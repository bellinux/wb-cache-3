The human SVCT 1 cDNA, {{obtained from a}} Caco 2 cell cDNA library, encodes a protein of 598 amino acids with 12 putative transmembrane domains. The SVCT 1 -specific transcript, 2. 4 kb in size, is expressed in kidney, liver, small intestine, thymus and prostate. When expressed heterologously in HRPE cells, SVCT 1 mediates the transport of ascorbate, the reduced form of vitamin C, in a Na+-dependent manner. The transporter is specific for ascorbate with a Kt of ∼ 75 μM. The relationship between the cDNA-specific uptake rate of ascorbate and Na+ concentration is sigmoidal with a Na+:ascorbate stoichiometry of 2 : 1, indicating that the transport process is electrogenic. In Caco 2 cells and in normal human intestine, SVCT 1 also exists as a non-functional splice variant with a four amino acid sequence inserted between E- 155 and V- 156.

Loh displays all hallmarks of ADAMTSL proteins including several thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSR 1), and acts {{in concert with}} the collagen Pericardin (Prc). Loss of either loh or prc causes progressive cardiac damage peaking in the abolishment of heart function. We show that both proteins are integral components of the cardiac ECM mediating cellular adhesion between the cardiac tube and the pericardial cells. Loss of ECM integrity leads to an altered myo-fibrillar organization in cardiac cells massively influencing heart beat pattern. We show evidence that Loh acts as a secreted receptor for Prc and works as a crucial determinant to allow the formation of a cell and tissue specific ECM, while it does not influence the accumulation of other matrix proteins like Nidogen or Perlecan. Our findings demonstrate that the function of ADAMTS-like proteins is conserved throughout evolution and reveal a previously unknown interaction of these proteins with collagens...|$|R

However, vacuolar sugar transporters have not been studied in detail in other plant species. To characterize the rice (Oryza sativa) tonoplast monosaccharide transporters, OsTMT 1 and OsTMT 2, we analysed their subcellular localization using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expression patterns using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), performed histochemical beta-glucuronidase (GUS) assay and in situ hybridization analysis, and assessed sugar transport ability using isolated vacuoles. Expression of OsTMT-GFP fusion protein in rice and Arabidopsis revealed that the OsTMTs localize at the tonoplast. Analyses of OsTMT promoter-GUS transgenic rice indicated that OsTMT 1 and OsTMT 2 are highly expressed in bundle sheath cells, and in vascular parenchyma and companion cells in leaves, respectively.

The cloned cDNA presented a 1767 nucleotides open-reading frame encoding a 589 aminoacids residues sequence containing a BTB/POZ (broad complex Tramtrack bric-a-brac/Pox virus and zinc finger) domain in its N-terminal region and kelch motifs in its C-terminal region. Sequence analysis indicates that the rat Nrp/b displays {{a high level of}} identity with the equivalent gene orthologs from other organisms. Among rat tissues, Nrp/b expression is more pronounced in brain tissue. We show that overexpression of the Nrp/b cDNA in C 6 /ST 1 cells suppresses anchorage independence in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, altering their malignant nature towards a more benign phenotype.

Results: With the objective of providing a high quality and highly accessible annotation of grapevine genes, the International Grapevine Genome Project (IGGP) commissioned an international Super-Nomenclature Committee for Grape Gene Annotation (sNCGGa) to coordinate the effort of experts to annotate the grapevine genes. The goal of the committee is to provide a standard nomenclature for locus identifiers and to define conventions for a gene naming system in this paper. Conclusions: Learning from similar initiatives in other plant species such as Arabidopsis, rice and tomato, a versatile nomenclature system has been developed in anticipation of future genomic developments and annotation issues. The sNCGGa's first outreach to the grape community has been focused on implementing recommended guidelines for the expert annotators by: (i) providing a common annotation platform that enables community-based gene curation, (ii) developing a gene nomenclature scheme reflecting the biological features of gene products that is consistent with that used in other organisms in order to facilitate comparative analyses...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{there has been an}} {{increasing}} amount of evidence for the de novo emergence of protein-coding genes, i. e. out of non-coding DNA. Here, we review the current literature and summarize the state of the field. We focus specifically <b>on</b> open questions <b>and</b> challenges in the study of de novo protein-coding genes such as the identification and verification of de novo-emerged genes. The greatest obstacle to date is the lack of high-quality genomic data with very short divergence times which could help precisely pin down the location of origin of a de novo gene. We conclude that, while there is plenty of evidence from a genetics perspective, {{there is a lack of}} functional studies of bona fide de novo genes and almost no knowledge about protein structures and how they come about during the emergence of de novo protein-coding genes. We suggest that future studies should concentrate <b>on</b> the <b>functional</b> <b>and</b> structural <b>characterization</b> of de novo protein-coding genes as well as the detailed study of the emergence of functional de novo protein-coding genes...|$|R
40|$|A {{potential}} role in disulfide {{bond formation}} in the intracellular proteins of thermophilic organisms has recently been attributed to a new family of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) -like proteins. Members of this family are characterized by a molecular mass of about 26 kDa and by two Trx folds, each comprising a CXXC active site motif. We report <b>on</b> the <b>functional</b> <b>and</b> structural <b>characterization</b> of a new member of this family, which was isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (AaPDO). Functional studies have revealed the high catalytic efficiency of this enzyme in reducing, oxidizing and isomerizing disulfide bridges. Sitedirected mutagenesis experiments have suggested that its two active sites have similar functional properties, i. e. that each of them imparts partial activity to the enzyme. This similarity was confirmed by {{the analysis of the}} enzyme crystal structure, which points to similar geometrical parameters and solvent accessibilities for the two active sites. The results demonstrated that AaPDO is the most PDI-like of all prokaryotic proteins so far known. Thus, further experimental studies on this enzyme are likely to provide important information on the eukaryotic homologue...|$|R
40|$|S-formylglutathione hydrolases (FGHs) {{constitute}} {{a family of}} ubiquitous enzymes which {{play a key role}} in formaldehyde detoxification both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, catalyzing the hydrolysis of S-formylglutathione to formic acid and glutathione. While a large number of functional studies have been reported on these enzymes, few structural studies have so far been carried out. In this article we report <b>on</b> the <b>functional</b> <b>and</b> structural <b>characterization</b> of PhEst, a FGH isolated from the psychrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis. According to our functional studies, this enzyme is able to efficiently hydrolyze several thioester substrates with very small acyl moieties. By contrast, the enzyme shows no activity toward substrates with bulky acyl groups. These data are in line with structural studies which highlight for this enzyme a very narrow acyl-binding pocket in a typical alpha/beta-hydrolase fold. PhEst represents the first cold-adapted FGH structurally characterized to date; comparison with its mesophilic counterparts of known three-dimensional structure allowed to obtain useful insights into molecular determinants responsible for the ability of this psychrophilic enzyme to work at low temperature...|$|R
40|$|Small {{heat shock}} {{proteins}} (sHSPs) are {{a family of}} ATP-independent molecular chaperones which prevent cellular protein aggregation by binding to misfolded proteins. sHSPs form large oligomers that undergo drastic rearrangement/dissociation in order to execute their chaperone activity in protecting substrates from stress. Substrate-binding sites on sHSPs have been predominantly mapped on their intrinsically disordered N-terminal arms. This region is highly variable in sequence and length across species, and has been implicated in both oligomer formation and in mediating chaperone activity. Here, we present our results <b>on</b> the <b>functional</b> <b>and</b> structural <b>characterization</b> of five sHSPs in rice, each differing in their subcellular localisation, viz., cytoplasm, nucleus, chloroplast, mitochondria and peroxisome. We performed activity assays and dynamic light scattering studies to highlight differences in the chaperone activity and quaternary assembly of sHSPs targeted to various organelles. By cloning constructs that differ in the length and sequence of the tag in the N-terminal region, we have probed the sensitivity of sHSP oligomer assembly and chaperone activity to the length and amino acid composition of the N-terminus. In particular, we {{have shown that the}} incorporation of an N-terminal tag has significant consequences on sHSP quaternary structure...|$|R
