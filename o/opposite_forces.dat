25|$|A load on a {{framework}} {{is a system}} of forces on the vertices (represented as vectors). A stress is a special case of a load, in which equal and <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> are applied to the two endpoints of each edge (which may be imagined as a spring) and the forces formed in this way are added at each vertex. Every stress is an equilibrium load, a load that does not impose any translational force on the whole system (the sum of its force vectors is zero) nor any rotational force. A linear dependence among the rows of the rigidity matrix may be represented as a self-stress, an assignment of equal and <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> to the endpoints of each edge that is not identically zero but that adds to zero at every vertex. Thus, a set of edges forms an independent set in the rigidity matroid {{if and only if}} it has no self-stress.|$|E
2500|$|A force couple {{results from}} equal and <b>opposite</b> <b>forces,</b> acting on two {{different}} points of a rigid body. [...] The sum (resultant) of these forces may cancel, but their effect on the body is the couple or torque T. [...] The work of the torque is calculated as ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{rightmost}} illustration shows a couple, two equal but <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> {{for which}} {{the amount of the}} net force is zero, but they produce the net torque where [...] is the distance between their lines of application. This is [...] "pure" [...] torque, since there is no resultant force.|$|E

2500|$|Notice {{that the}} case of two equal but <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> F and -F acting at points A and B respectively, yields the {{resultant}} W=(F-F, [...] A×F - B× F) = (0, (A-B)×F). [...] This shows that wrenches of the form W=(0, T) {{can be interpreted as}} pure torques.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a simple}} matter to change the point of {{application}} of a force by introducing equal and <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> at two different points of application that produce a pure torque on the body. [...] In this way, all of the forces acting on a body can be moved to the same point of application with associated torques.|$|E
2500|$|The {{magnetic}} force (...) {{component of the}} Lorentz force is responsible for motional electromotive force (or motional EMF), the phenomenon underlying many electrical generators. When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> on electrons and nuclei in the wire, and this creates the EMF. The term [...] "motional EMF" [...] is applied to this phenomenon, since the EMF {{is due to the}} motion of the wire.|$|E
50|$|A {{counterweight}} is {{a weight}} that, by exerting an <b>opposite</b> <b>force,</b> provides balance {{and stability of}} a mechanical system. Its purpose is to make lifting the load more efficient, which saves energy and is less taxing on the lifting machine.|$|R
5000|$|Internal forces {{between the}} {{particles}} {{that make up}} a body do not contribute to changing the total momentum of the body as there is an equal and <b>opposite</b> <b>force</b> resulting in no net effect. The law is also stated as: ...|$|R
5000|$|During tension or {{leverage}} connection, {{the dancers}} are {{pulling away from}} each other with an equal and <b>opposite</b> <b>force.</b> The arms do not originate this force alone: they are often assisted by tension in trunk musculature, through body weight or by momentum.|$|R
2500|$|Aristotle saw {{chance and}} {{necessity}} as <b>opposite</b> <b>forces.</b> He argued that nature had rich and constant patterns {{that could not}} be the result of chance alone, but that these patterns never displayed the machine-like uniformity of necessary determinism. He viewed randomness as a genuine and widespread part of the world, but as subordinate to necessity and order. [...] Aristotle classified events into three types: certain events that happen necessarily; probable events that happen in most cases; and unknowable events that happen by pure chance. He considered the outcome of games of chance as unknowable.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{situation}} {{with a simple}} stress pattern is when a straight rod, with uniform material and cross section, is subjected to tension by <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> of magnitude [...] along its axis. [...] If the system is in equilibrium and not changing with time, {{and the weight of}} the bar can be neglected, then through each transversal section of the bar the top part must pull on the bottom part with the same force F. [...] Therefore, the stress throughout the bar, across any horizontal surface, can be described by the number [...] = F/A, where A is the area of the cross-section.|$|E
2500|$|In ancient Persia Zoroaster {{taught that}} good (Ohrmazd) and evil (Angra Mainyu) were <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> {{and the battle}} between them {{is more or less}} evenly matched. A person should always be {{vigilant}} to align with forces of light. According to the asha or the righteousness and druj or the wickedness, [...] the person has chosen in his life they will be judged at the Chinvat bridge to grant passage to Paradise, Hammistagan (A limbo area) or Hell by a sword. A personified form of the soul that represents the person’s deeds takes the adjudged to their destination and they will abide there until the final apocalypse. After the final battle between good and evil, every soul’s walk through a river of fire ordeal for burning of their dross and together they receive a post resurrection paradise. The Zoroastrian holy book, called the Avesta, was written in the Avestan language, which is closely related to Vedic Sanskrit.|$|E

50|$|In the game, {{the laws}} of physics are modeled fully, so ships do not behave like aircraft: they behave like spaceships in a {{frictionless}} vacuum. This means that any velocity picked up will be maintained unless an <b>opposite</b> <b>force</b> is applied by the engines.|$|R
50|$|Jet force {{begins with}} some {{propulsion}} system; {{in the case}} of a rocket, this is usually some system that kicks out combustible gases from the bottom. This repulsion system pushes out these gas molecules in the direction opposite the intended motion so rapidly that the <b>opposite</b> <b>force,</b> acting 180° away from the direction the gas molecules are moving, (as such, in the intended direction of movement) pushes the rocket up. A common wrong assumption is that the rocket elevates by pushing off the ground. If this were the case, the rocket would be unable to continue moving upwards after the aircraft is no longer close to the ground. Rather, the <b>opposite</b> <b>force</b> by the expelled gases is the reason for movement.|$|R
2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two {{suspension cylinders}} mounted horizontally {{on each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder. The springs are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like bellcranks by pull rods (tie rods). These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front pull rod compresses the front spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear spring assembly and pull rod. When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|E
60|$|Jill, {{like many}} other people, had a brain which was under the {{alternating}} control of two diametrically <b>opposite</b> <b>forces.</b> It was like a motor-car steered in turn by two drivers, the one a dashing, reckless fellow with no regard for the speed limits, the other a timid novice. All through the proceedings {{up to this point}} the dasher had been in command. He had whisked her along at a break-neck pace, ignoring obstacles and police regulations. Now, having brought her to this situation, he abruptly abandoned the wheel and turned it over to his colleague, the shrinker. Jill, greatly daring a moment ago, now felt an overwhelming shyness.|$|E
60|$|Throughout {{subsequent}} Japanese history, {{until the}} Restoration, {{one seems to}} see two <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> struggling for mastery over people's minds, namely the ideas of government, civilization and art derived from China on the one hand, and the native tendency to feudalism, clan government, and civil war on the other. The conflict is very analogous to that which went on in mediæval Europe between the Church, which represented ideas derived from Rome, and the turbulent barons, who were struggling to preserve {{the way of life}} of the ancient Teutons. Henry IV at Canossa, Henry II doing penance for Becket, represent the triumph of civilization over rude vigour; and something similar is to be seen at intervals in Japan.|$|E

5000|$|Speed control/Velocity {{constant}} - dynamometer {{holds the}} set speed regardless of force or other parameters.

25|$|In Newtonian mechanics, {{the law of}} {{conservation}} of momentum {{can be derived from}} the law of action and reaction, which states that every force has a reciprocating equal and <b>opposite</b> <b>force.</b> Under some circumstances, moving charged particles can exert forces on each other in non-opposite directions. Nevertheless, the combined momentum of the particles and the electromagnetic field is conserved.|$|R
6000|$|... 961. That {{such cases}} of {{chemical}} action produce no current of electricity, is perfectly {{consistent with what}} we know of the voltaic apparatus, {{in which it is}} essential that one of the combining elements shall form part of, or be in direct relation with, an electrolytic conductor (921. 923.). That such cases produce no free electricity of tension, and that when they are converted into cases of voltaic action they produce a current in which the <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> are so equal as to neutralize each other, prove the equality of the forces in the opposed acting particles of matter, and therefore the equality of electric power in those quantities of matter which are called electro-chemical equivalents (824). Hence another proof of the definite nature of electro-chemical action (783. &c.), and that chemical affinity and electricity are forms of the same power (917. &c.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1115. With {{reference}} to the appearance, at different times, of the contrary effects produced by the making and breaking contact, and their separation by an intermediate and indifferent state, this separation is probably more apparent than real. If the conduction of electricity be effected by vibrations (283.), or by any other mode in which <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> are successively and rapidly excited and neutralized, then we might expect a peculiar and contrary development of force at the commencement and termination of the periods during which the conducting action should last (somewhat in analogy with the colours produced at the outside of an imperfectly developed solar spectrum): and the intermediate actions, although not sensible in the same way, may be very important and, for instance, perhaps constitute {{the very essence of}} conductibility. It is by views and reasons such as these, which seem to me connected with the fundamental laws and facts of electrical science, that I have been induced to enter, more minutely than I otherwise should have done, into the experimental examination of the phenomena described in this paper.|$|E
6000|$|... 950. Practically, {{the state}} of tension is best {{relieved}} by dipping a metal which has less attraction for oxygen than the zinc, into the dilute acid, and making it also touch the zinc. The force of chemical affinity, which has been influenced or polarized in the particles of the water by the dominant attraction of the zinc for the oxygen, is then transferred, in a most extraordinary manner, through the two metals, so as to re-enter upon the circuit in the electrolytic conductor, which, unlike the metals in that respect, cannot convey or transfer it without suffering decomposition; or rather, probably, it is exactly balanced and neutralized by the force which {{at the same moment}} completes the combination of the zinc with the oxygen of the water. The forces, in fact, of the two particles which are acting towards each other, and which are therefore in opposite directions, are the origin of the two <b>opposite</b> <b>forces,</b> or directions of force, in the current. They are of necessity equivalent to each other. Being transferred forward in contrary directions, they produce what is called the voltaic current: {{and it seems to me}} impossible to resist the idea that it must be preceded by a state of tension in the fluid, and between the fluid and the zinc; the first consequence of the affinity of the zinc for the oxygen of the water.|$|E
50|$|While under sail, the <b>opposite</b> <b>force</b> to the vang is {{supplied}} by the sail itself. When the sail is furled, a topping lift supplies the upward force on the boom. Some line vang systems incorporate a piston to provide the topping lift force and to damp oscillations. Hydraulic vangs can inherently act in the topping lift role.|$|R
50|$|The Coulomb {{friction}} model effectively {{defines a}} friction cone {{within which the}} tangential component of a force exerted by one body {{on the surface of}} another in static contact, is countered by an equal and <b>opposite</b> <b>force</b> such that the static configuration is maintained. Conversely, if the force falls outside the cone, static friction gives way to dynamic friction.|$|R
50|$|However, {{there is}} no {{physical}} principle that requires equal transit time and experimental results show that this assumption is false. In fact, the air moving {{over the top of}} an airfoil generating lift moves much faster than the equal transit theory predicts. Further, the theory violates Newton's third law of motion, since it describes a force on the wing with no <b>opposite</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R
60|$|A large space {{behind the}} altar, was fitted up with boxes, shaped like {{those at the}} Italian Opera in England, but in their {{decoration}} much more gaudy. In {{the centre of the}} kind of theatre thus railed off, was a canopied dais with the Pope's chair upon it. The pavement was covered with a carpet of the brightest green; and what with this green, and the intolerable reds and crimsons, and gold borders of the hangings, the whole concern looked like a stupendous Bonbon. On either side of the altar, was a large box for lady strangers. These were filled with ladies in black dresses and black veils. The gentlemen of the Pope's guard, in red coats, leather breeches, and jack-boots, guarded all this reserved space, with drawn swords that were very flashy in every sense; and from the altar all down the nave, a broad lane was kept clear by the Pope's Swiss guard, who wear a quaint striped surcoat, and striped tight legs, and carry halberds like those which are usually shouldered by those theatrical supernumeraries, who never CAN get off the stage fast enough, and who may be generally observed to linger in the enemy's camp after the open country, held by the <b>opposite</b> <b>forces,</b> has been split up the middle by a convulsion of Nature.|$|E
60|$|The correspondent, in {{the world}} of the senses, to the {{magnetic}} axis, exists in the series of metals. The metalleity, as the universal base of the planet, is a necessary deduction from the principles of the system. From the infusible, though evaporable, diamond to nitrogen itself, the metallic nature of which has been long suspected by chemists, though still under the mistaken notion of an oxyde, we trace a series of metals from the maximum of coherence to positive fluidity, in all ordinary temperatures, we mean. Though, in point of fact, cold itself is but a superinduction of the one pole, or, what amounts to the same thing, the subtraction of the other, under the modifications afore described; and therefore are the metals indecomposible, because they are themselves the decompositions of the metallic axis, in all its degrees of longitude and latitude. Thus the substance of the planet from which it is, is metallic; while that which is ever becoming, is in like manner produced through the perpetual modification of the first by the <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> of the second; that is, by the principle of contraction and difference at the eastern extreme—the element of fire, or the oxygen of the chemists; and by the elementary power of dilatation, or universality at its western extreme—the ὑδωρ ἐν ὑδατι of the ancients, and the hydrogen of the laboratory.|$|E
6000|$|... 1708. Probable {{reasons for}} these {{conditions}} and limitations arise out of the molecular theory of induction. Thus when a liquid dielectric, as chloride of tin, consists of molecules, each composed of a single particle {{of each of the}} elements, then as these can convey equivalent <b>opposite</b> <b>forces</b> by their separation in opposite directions, both decomposition and transfer can result. But when the molecules, as in the bichloride of tin, consist of one particle or atom of one element, and two of the other, then the simplicity with which the particles may be supposed to be arranged and to act, is destroyed. And, though it may be conceived that when the molecules of bichloride of tin are polarized as wholes by the induction across them, the positive polar force might accumulate on the one particle of tin whilst the negative polar force accumulated on the two particles of chlorine associated with it, and that these might respectively travel right and left to unite with other two of chlorine and one of tin, in analogy with what happens in cases of compounds consisting of single proportions, yet this is not altogether so evident or probable. For when a particle of tin combines with two of chlorine, it is difficult to conceive that there should not be some relation of the three in the resulting molecule analogous to fixed position, the one particle of metal being perhaps symmetrically placed in relation to the two of chlorine: and, {{it is not difficult to}} conceive of such particles that they could not assume that position dependent both on their polarity and the relation of their elements, which appears to be the first step in the process of electrolyzation (1345. 1705.).|$|E
30|$|Deterioration of {{the slope}} seemed {{to be caused by}} well-aligned {{molecules}} in the LC droplets. For this alignment to occur, more <b>opposite</b> <b>force</b> and more time are needed to randomly rearrange at the off state (i.e., slow and incomplete return to the original and random arrangement of molecules in LC droplets). Slow and imperfect rearrangement of LC arrangement induced a mild slope (Figure  2).|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} screw propeller accelerates a {{large volume of}} water by a small amount, {{similar to the way}} an airplane propeller accelerates a large volume of air by a small amount. An aircraft's jet engine, by contrast, accelerates a small volume of air by a large amount.
