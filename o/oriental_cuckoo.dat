50|$|The <b>Oriental</b> <b>cuckoo</b> or Horsfields cuckoo (Cuculus optatus) is a bird {{belonging}} to the genus Cuculus in the cuckoo family Cuculidae. It was formerly classified as a subspecies of the Himalayan cuckoo (C. saturatus) with the name <b>Oriental</b> <b>cuckoo</b> used for the combined species. Differences in voice and size suggest {{that they should be}} treated as a separate species. The binomial name Cuculus horsfieldi has often been used instead of Cuculus optatus but is now usually considered to be a junior synonym.|$|E
50|$|Pallas's leaf warbler, as {{with other}} members of its genus, is a host of the <b>oriental</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> a brood parasite. The cuckoo's egg is similar in appearance, though larger, to those of the host species.|$|E
5000|$|Among mammals, common predators are red fox, wolverines, {{wolves and}} lynx. Also common are forest mammals such as brown bear, and {{ungulates}} such as moose, sika deer, and caribou. [...] The Shantar Islands and the Sea of Okhotsk are host to large colonies of seabirds. Common land birds include northern goshawks, Ural owls, <b>Oriental</b> <b>cuckoos,</b> and brown creepers.|$|R
50|$|Its range {{covers the}} Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, Java, Bali, Seram and the Lesser Sunda Islands east to Timor. It is {{non-migratory}} unlike the Himalayan and <b>Oriental</b> <b>cuckoos</b> which overlap in range with {{it during the}} northern winter. It occurs in forests, mainly in mountainous areas. It is found at altitudes of 950-1700 m in the Malay Peninsula, 1300-2700 m in Borneo and above 1000 m in Java, Sumatra and Wallacea. It {{is believed to be}} slowly declining in numbers but still has a sizable range and population so its status is classed as Least Concern by BirdLife International.|$|R
50|$|Attractions {{include the}} Justice Precinct which {{includes}} a working Court House built in 1893, the <b>Oriental</b> Claims, the <b>Cuckoo</b> Clock shop, and white water rafting on the Mitta Mitta River. The Cobungra River, Bundara River, Big River, and Mitta Mitta River around nearby Anglers Rest, {{as well as the}} Tambo River, all provide good trout fishing.|$|R
50|$|Common cuckoos moult twice a year: {{a partial}} moult {{in summer and}} a {{complete}} moult in winter. Males weigh around 130 g and females 110 g. The common cuckoo looks {{very similar to the}} <b>Oriental</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> which is slightly shorter-winged on average.|$|E
50|$|The Sunda cuckoo or Sunda lesser cuckoo (Cuculus lepidus) is a South-east Asian bird {{belonging}} to the genus Cuculus in the cuckoo family, Cuculidae. It was formerly classified with the Himalayan cuckoo (C. saturatus) and <b>Oriental</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (C. optatus) in a single species, C. saturatus, but is now often regarded as a separate species based on differences in voice, size and plumage.|$|E
50|$|It is 30-32 {{centimetres}} {{long with}} a wingspan of 51-57 centimetres and a weight of 73-156 grams. The adult male has a grey head, breast and upperparts. The belly is creamy-white with dark bars. The vent is frequently buff with few markings. The {{legs and feet}} are orange-yellow {{and there is a}} bare yellow ring around the eye. Adult females and juveniles occur in two morphs. The grey morph is similar to the male but has a brownish wash on the breast. The rufous morph is reddish-brown above, paler on the underparts and with strong dark barring all over including the rump.The common cuckoo (C. canorus) is very similar in appearance but is slightly bulkier with longer wings and tail and a slightly smaller head and bill. It is slightly paler grey and the barring on the underparts is a little narrower. The vent is usually white with dark bars but is more similar to <b>Oriental</b> <b>cuckoo</b> in a few individuals. Birds of the rufous morph have a plain rump with no dark bars unlike the <b>Oriental</b> <b>cuckoo.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is 29-30 cm long. The upperparts, {{throat and}} upper breast are dark grey. The {{rest of the}} underparts are buff with black bars. The tail is blackish with white spots. The female also occurs in a rufous form which has reddish-brown upperparts, paler underparts and black barring both above and below. The Himalayan cuckoo and <b>Oriental</b> <b>cuckoo</b> {{are similar to the}} Sunda cuckoo but paler with less buff-coloured underparts and {{narrower}} black bars.|$|E
50|$|The call of {{the male}} <b>Oriental</b> <b>cuckoo</b> {{is a series of}} low paired notes, poo-poo, with both notes {{stressed}} equally. It is somewhat similar to the {{call of the}} hoopoe. It may be introduced with a four to eight note phrase or sometimes with grating notes. The female's call is a deep bubbling trill. Outside the breeding season, the birds are usually silent. The call of the male Himalayan cuckoo is a series of three or four note phrases with a short, high-pitched introductory note.|$|E
50|$|The pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus) is {{a species}} of cuckoo in the family Cuculidae. It is found in Australia with some {{migration}} to the islands of Timor and Papua New Guinea. It is between 28 - 33cm in size with distinctive markings such as a dark bill, a dark eye with a gold eye-ring and olive grey feet which differentiate it from other cuckoos. The pallid cuckoo is similar in appearance to the <b>oriental</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Cuculus optatus) with barred immature pallid cuckoos being often mistaken for oriental cuckoos.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Casual bird {{observations}} in the Northern Mariana Islands are reported, with new {{records for the}} islands of Anatahan, Pagan, Saipan, and Sarigan. Cuckoo (Cuculus sp.) —This is the first recorded observation of a cuckoo in the Mariana Islands. It was observed {{on the island of}} Pagan on July 11, 1996 by the author. The sighting occurred {{on the west side of}} the island in the vicinity of the airstrip. Initial recognition was based on its quick wing beat alternating with a short glide. The bird was then observed with 10 x binoculars in good light at 40 m. General characteristics noted were a total length of approximately 30 - 40 cm, a long tail and pointed wings, an overall coloration of grey with barring under the wings and chest. Its feet were bright yellow and it appeared to have a yellow bill with a black tip. The tail had a terminal band. The common cuckoo (C. canorus) and the <b>Oriental</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> (C. micropterus) are two similar species that range widely throughout mainland Asia and Japan. Both species migrate to the Philippines and beyond for the winter (Massey et al...|$|E
40|$|Birds {{are capable}} of seeing the {{ultraviolet}} light (UV) spectrum {{and as a consequence}} have evolved UV-reflective structures with signalling functions. Avian eggs also reflect in the UV spectrum but the importance of UV egg matching in egg rejection decisions has been equivocal. Here we conducted egg rejection experiments in the congeneric and sympatrically breeding Yellow-bellied Prinia Prinia flaviventris and Plain Prinia Prinia inornata in Taiwan to assess the role of UV as a cue in egg discrimination. Yellow-bellied Prinia is a host of <b>Oriental</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Cuculus optatus, whereas Plain Prinia is not. We coated one prinia egg in the experimental clutches with a cream containing a UV-blocking agent, {{while the rest of the}} eggs were coated with cream only. We also experimentally parasitized prinias with non-mimetic model eggs with reduced UV reflectance. Yellow-bellied Prinia and Plain Prinia rejected their own UV-blocked eggs in 18. 2 and 8. 3 % of the experiments, respectively, and the difference was not significant. However, Yellow-bellied Prinia rejected 100 % of the non-mimetic eggs, whereas the Plain Prinia rejected only 5 %. Hence, UV reflectance alone is a cue in egg discrimination, but the importance of reflectance outside the UV spectrum in these two prinia species is much more responsive to selection as a consequence of brood parasitism...|$|E
