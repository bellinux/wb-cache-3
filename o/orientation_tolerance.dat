40|$|Abstract. This paper {{extends the}} {{funnelling}} behavior {{to offer a}} low-cost flexi-ble guidance of mobile entities towards a circular region goal with the guaran-tee of enforcing an orientation within a predefined tolerance interval. The key requirements {{are the same as}} the funnelling control, i. e. a low and constant cost update of the control even when the goal parameters change (distance and rela-tive orientation of the goal, position tolerance radius, <b>orientation</b> <b>tolerance</b> interval, desired speed). The smoothness and the optimality of the resulting tra-jectory being of high importance the paper qualitatively compares the trajecto-ries produced by both funnelling algorithms. The new relaxed approach appears to produce smoother and shorter path for path made of a succession of large region goals. These qualities and its low cost advocate for its exploitation for moving through large dynamically changing regions without precise a priori planning. ...|$|E

Ageing induced discontinuous precipitation of Cr 2 N from grain boundaries, discontinuous precipitation at twin fronts, continuous precipitation throughout the matrix, continuous precipitation in association with ferrite plate formation and also grain boundary precipitation {{in the form of}} both discrete precipitates and films. The observed morphologies at the onset of discontinuous precipitation from grain boundaries suggest a Tu and Turnbull initiation mechanism. The orientation relation between Cr 2 N and γ in well-developed lamellae is not strictly (111) γ//(0001) Cr 2 N and γ[1 - 10]//[1 - 100]Cr 2 N. The fact that the process shows some <b>orientation</b> <b>tolerance,</b> together with the lamellae irregular and curved interfaces, indicates that minimization of the system interfacial energy does not play a key role during growth. In this precipitation mechanism, twinning inside growing γlamellae is associated with abrupt local changes in the growth direction. In the case of cooperative growth at incoherent twin fronts, the irregular habit surfaces of Cr 2 N point to a Fournelle and Clark type of initiation mechanism. At early precipitation stages, the interlamellar spacing for cooperative growth at twin fronts is similar to the one observed for cooperative growth from grain boundaries (~ 100 nm). It is proposed that the low growth efficiency observed at twin fronts results from lower diffusivity conditions at twin fronts as compared with grain boundaries...|$|E

The simulations account for the effects of obscurations by a secondary mirror and its supporting struts in a telescope, and for the effects of optical imperfections (especially tilt) of a telescope. A significant innovation introduced in this study is a methodology, applicable to space telescopes in general, for predicting the effects of optical imperfections. This methodology involves a Monte Carlo simulation in which one generates many random wavefront distortions and studies their effects through computational simulations of propagation. Then one performs a statistical analysis of the results of the simulations and computes the functional relations among such important design parameters as the sizes of distortions and the mean value and the variance of the loss of performance.

Most of the time, the tool path is described with linear segments (G 1) which leads to tangency discontinuities between blocks. The aim {{of this paper is}} to smooth the tool path geometry using a 5 -axis corner rounding method suitable for acceleration and jerk limited feedrate interpolation. Several methods have been developed in 3 -axis but 5 -axis corner rounding is still a challenge due to the difficulties linked to the smoothing of the orientation. The proposed corner roundingmodel allows to control precisely the contour and <b>orientation</b> <b>tolerances</b> in the workpiece coordinate system for 3 and 5 -axis tool path. To smooth the tool tip position and the tool orientation in the corner, 5 -axis tool paths are represented by two B-Spline curves. The main difficulty is the connection between the initial tool path and the newly inserted smoothing portion.

40|$|Seeking {{to better}} {{understand}} inter-generational continuity of political orientations, this study investigates the relationships among three archetypes of political <b>orientations</b> (<b>tolerance</b> of nonconformists, confidence in people running institutions {{and the strength of}} party affiliation) and enduring versus contemporaneous forces. Birth cohort membership and education are selected to represent the former and the time of survey and media use the latter. ^ Three fundamentals of the present study differ from most prior research in this tradition: First, instead of focusing on different effect models, this study seeks to establish a conceptual structure among outcome variables. Second, the inter-generational continuity is assumed to be cohort-generational rather than lineage-generational, Third, it employs a year-cohort matrix rather than a standard cohort table as the central analytical scheme. ^ Using the NORC General Social Surveys (1972 - 1993), the study tracks eight birth cohorts across twenty-two years to discern change patterns over time. Overall three archetypes and a sub-type emerged from the data. ^ The two tolerance scales and five individual indicators are overwhelmingly affected by enduring forces of one 2 ̆ 7 s birth cohort membership and education. Once formed, these orientations remain relatively stable through life. The patterns found among two confidence scales and six confidence indicators are those of a sweeping time effect. Cohorts 2 ̆ 7 confidence levels are closely 2 ̆ 2 bunched together 2 ̆ 2 and fluctuate from year to year. The strength of party affiliation represents a third archetype, in that we suspect the basic partisanship is fixed by formative experiences but the specific action of affiliating with either party is incited by environmental cues. The resulting change pattern is one of unsynchronized waves. The researcher found a fourth sub-type in confidence in the Supreme Court where enduring forces dictate the responses in the absence of significant contemporaneous forces. ^ Education is reconfirmed as a quintessential {{force to be reckoned with}} when one studies political orientations.

Many teacher-student interactions, whether instructional or disciplinary in nature, tend to be differentiated according to gender. Additionally, some studies suggest that the extent to which this differential treatment is present in classrooms may be a factor of teacher gender. ^ The purpose of this study was to examine middle level discipline referrals and assess the relationship between teacher gender and frequency of discipline referral, as well as degree of problematic behavior, for boys and girls. Data were analyzed from nine, middle level schools in the moderate-sized school district in the midwest by examining discipline referrals for the 1994 - 95 school year. This data included information on teacher gender, student gender, the reasons for the referral, and the degree to which teachers perceived these behaviors as problematic; as well as information regarding other variables including grade level and ethnicity. ^ Significant research exists examining discipline interventions, as well as research examining the impact of gender on student/teacher interactions in the classroom; however, the relationship between teacher gender and discipline referral frequency and severity is an area of study that has received little attention. ^ This study revealed more examples of potential bias found in schools, as well as the impact of staff gender on perceptions of students and practices related to school discipline. It was determined that boys are over-referred by more than fifty percent for disciplinary action, students of color are over-represented in disciplinary referrals by nearly fifty percent, and the grade level of the students referred appears to have an impact on the likelihood that they will be referred for disciplinary action. Additionally, male staff members over-refer students for disciplinary action by more than sixteen percent and female staff members tend to refer students for less severe types of behavior. ^ As schools become increasingly aware of gender specific practices and perceptions, they can provide staff development interventions to increase staff sensitivity to gender issues and practices and improve their ability to offer more equitable practices for students. ...|$|R

The use of an orientation plane to deal with unidirectional chains of dimensions is defined. In terms of metrology, the characteristic to evaluate is the margin between the actual surface and the limit surface of the tolerance zone when the tolerance zone on the references is respected. This margin enables one, for example, to determine a capability. Three applications present an assembly of a mechanism with clearances, a connection with a complex surface and a 3 D chain of dimensions at least material which requires a composite specification...|$|R
40|$|AbstractModern {{markets are}} {{becoming}} increasingly competitive emphasizing the importance of achieving Right First Time (RFT) during the early design stage as a key enabler facilitating cost and time-to-launch (or time-to-market) reduction. One of the leading challenges to deliver RFT {{is the lack of}} effective methods to model product errors at early design stage. Usually, the assembly process is designed under the assumption of ideal (nominal) products. On the contrary, it has been demonstrated that product errors (both geometrical and dimensional) affect the performance of the final assembly. To facilitate easy decision making at early design stage, new methods and models are required to support design engineers. In this study, a framework has been proposed for early design support to generate product variation. International standard provides guidelines for product control and inspection (ISO-GPS or ASME-GD&T); however, the integration of tolerance standard into nominal sized CAD models is not yet achieved. Current, Computer Aided Tolerancing (CAT) tools mainly capable to model <b>orientation</b> and position <b>tolerance</b> specifications, whereas part shape errors are omitted. This paper presents an innovative physics-driven simulation framework to model shape errors of compliant sheet metal parts at early design stage. The modelling framework consists of three important stages: (i) initial shape error prediction using physic-based simulation, such as, stamping process simulation; (ii) individual orthogonal shape error modes/patterns identification based on decomposition techniques, such as, Geometric Modal Analysis (GMA); and, (iii) simulation of shape error variation classes by assigning distribution to each orthogonal shape error modes. The proposed approach enables to generate shape errors at early design stage of assembly process which can be utilized to optimize the assembly process, including fixture design and joining process parameters. An industrial automotive component illustrates the proposed methodology...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is two-fold: (1) to {{identify}} the differences, if any, between the perceptions held by urban school teachers of urban school principals’ administrative leadership behaviors and urban school principals’ self-assessments of their leadership behaviors and (2) to determine if the responses of the principals relative to school activities that implement the leadership behaviors correlated with their self-assessments. The study was limited to 209 teachers and 55 principals in the Atlanta Public School System, Atlanta, Georgia. Three instruments developed by Selective Research Incorporated were used: (1) the Teacher Administrator Questionnaire administered to teachers; (2) the Administrator Self-Assessment Questionnaire administered to principals; and (3) the Administrator Perceiver Interview, a face-to-face, taped, structured interview, administered to thirty of the fifty-five principals. These three instruments have a common basis; that is, each instrument is developed around the twelve life themes espoused by Selective Research Incorporated as characterizing administrative behaviors that facilitate the growth of teachers, which in turn facilitates the growth of students. These life themes are Mission, Manpower Development, Relator, Arranger, Catalyzer, Audience Sensitivity, Group Enhancer, Discriminator, Performance Orientation, Work <b>Orientation,</b> and Ambiguity <b>Tolerance.</b> Analysis of variance was used to test the first set of null hypotheses at the. 05 level of significance as to the differences between the perceptions held by urban school teachers relative to urban school administrative leadership behaviors and the assessments of urban school principals of their administrative behaviors. The null hypothesis was rejected for each of the twelve hypotheses related to the twelve life themes. Teachers’ perceptions of principals’ administrative behaviors were different from the principals’ assessments of their own administrative behaviors. When the teachers were grouped by the variables sex, race, age, years of teaching experience, and academic training, they were consistent in their perceptions of principals’ administrative behaviors. However, teachers with more academic training rated the principals significantly higher on theme Delegator than did teachers with less academic training. When the principals were grouped by the same variables, only black principals and older principals differed in their self—ssessments. Black principals assessed themselves significantly higher than did white principals on seven of the twelve life themes, and older principals assessed themselves significantly higher than did younger principals on three of the twelve life themes. Pearson Correlation Coefficients were computed to test the second set of null hypotheses at the. 05 level of significance as to whether the principals’ responses in a structured interview correlated with their self-assessments. The null hypothesis was accepted for each of the hypotheses. The principals’ responses during the interviews to questions regarding school activities that reflect administrative behaviors described by the twelve life themes did not correlate with their self-assessments relative to conducting school tasks in keeping with the twelve life themes. The major recommendations resulting from this study are as foIlows: I. A longitudinal study should be made using the teacher—rating and principal-assessment instruments as a basis for planning and conducting in-service training for administrators, followed by post administration of the instruments 2. On-going use of the procedure employed in this study can be used by individual school administrators in an effort to assess needs in relation to staff moral...|$|R
