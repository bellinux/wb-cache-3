5|$|After adolescence, most {{physical}} training for males {{was of a}} military nature. The Campus Martius <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> an exercise field where young men developed the skills of horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to Plutarch, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake, and condemned Nero's efforts to encourage gymnastic games in the Greek manner.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Mexico {{established}} an embassy in Rabat which had <b>originally</b> <b>been</b> accredited from its embassy in Lisbon previously.

5|$|Croyle {{played in}} only two games and saw few snaps in his rookie season. He {{completed}} 3-of-7 passes for 23 yards including two interceptions. One of those interceptions was returned by Pittsburgh Steelers safety Rian Wallace for a touchdown.

5|$|Route 33 <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> {{part of the}} 1920s New Jersey Route 1 {{in parts}} of the road south of Hightstown, and Route 7 from Hightstown to its {{terminus}} at Route 71. Both roads were changed into Route 33 in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} outside of Japan by Sega, who packaged the heroine as a rugged gladiator {{instead of the}} dainty-looking sorceress she <b>originally</b> <b>was.</b> Due {{to the lack of}} publicity for the game internationally, Alisia Dragoon did not make a big impact on the video game market, despite the critical acclaim it received.|$|E

5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the rear wall, on the forts southern side. This room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E
5|$|Adonis <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> a Phoenician god of {{fertility}} representing {{the spirit of}} vegetation. It is further speculated {{that he was an}} avatar of the version of Ba'al, worshipped in Ugarit. It is likely that lack of clarity concerning whether Myrrha was called Smyrna, and who her father was, originated in Cyprus before the Greeks first encountered the myth. However, {{it is clear that the}} Greeks added much to the Adonis-Myrrha story, before it was first recorded by classical scholars.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the riders {{were faced with}} the Giro's longest stage, with {{numerous}} high mountain climbs along the course and {{the distinction of being}} the race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors Categorie climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and that radio communication in the area could not be assured. The course as it <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E
50|$|The Asalpha station had <b>originally</b> <b>been</b> named Subhash Nagar, {{despite the}} fact that it was not located near the Subhash Nagar area.

5|$|At Passo de Torres, many shipyards were destroyed, as {{they were}} not {{designed}} to withstand the pressure differentials caused by Catarina's winds; widespread roof damage was reported at this municipality as well. Near the Mampituba River, a house was blown about 50meters (165ft) upstream, literally landing in another state: it <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> built in the Torres municipality of Rio Grande do Sul, yet it ended up in Passo de Torres, within Santa Catarina. In rural areas, the corn, banana, and rice fields received the most damage, although rice farmers were able to partially recoup their losses, as they had harvested before Catarina made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Born in Connecticut, Baldwin <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> {{a teacher}} in Maryland and Connecticut before moving to Ohio in the late 1820s. He {{became part of the}} lyceum movement, and {{situated}} himself in Berea, Ohio. He opened up Baldwin Institute in 1846 upon seeing the dissolution of the Norwalk Seminary. Nine years later, the Institute became Baldwin University. He moved to Kansas around 1857, laying the foundation for Baldwin City, Kansas, as well as Baker University. In his later life, he purchased a Louisiana plantation, and made contributions to education in India late in his life.|$|E
5|$|Cryolophosaurus <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> {{collected}} during the 1990â€“91 austral summer on Mount Kirkpatrick in the Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains. The discovery was made by Hammer, a professor at Augustana College, and his team. The fossils {{were found in the}} siliceous siltstone of the Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the Pliensbachian stage of the early Jurassic. Cryolophosaurus was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after Antarctopelta, but named earlier.|$|E

5|$|Deady <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> {{to travel}} with a {{government}} designated Indian agent and the agent's family. At Fort Leavenworth the agent remained, and Deady continued his journey {{in the company of}} a United States Army regiment bound for Fort Vancouver. Taking the Oregon Trail, he arrived where Portland, Oregon, now stands on November 14, 1849. The next day he went to neighboring Oregon City, and then a few days later west to Lafayette, Oregon. At that city, the county seat of Yamhill County at that time, the red-haired Deady began teaching as his occupation to make ends meet. He first worked for room and board, but for the second term of the school year he was paid $75 per month.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{all three}} routes had their {{operations}} {{taken over by}} the MTA Bus Company brand of MTA Regional Bus Operations. The Q53 <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> a premium fare service, with a long nonstop segment between Rego Park to Broad Channel, as it was a replacement service for rail. Soon after the MTA's takeover of the route, it was converted to be a limited-stop service, with six stops along the corridor. Subsequently, the Q21 was extended up Woodhaven Boulevard, and its southern terminus in the Rockaways was switched. Increased ridership resulted {{in the creation of the}} Q21 Limited, which was soon replaced by the Q52 Limited, which replaced Q21 service south of Howard Beach.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the episode}} was {{supposed}} to revolve around the duo {{trying to get the}} plant back, lest Princess Bubblegum turn into a man. In addition, the episode <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> supposed to feature a mysterious rabbit that guided Finn and Jake through the Underworld; this character was later cut. The episode was watched by 1.981 million people and received largely positive critical attention. Many critics applauded Ferrer's voice acting work, and Matt Fowler of IGN singled the episode out {{as an example of the}} comedic darkening of Adventure Time.|$|E

5|$|The Solnhofen Specimen (unnumbered specimen) was {{discovered}} in the 1970s near EichstÃ¤tt, Germany, and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the BÃ¼rgermeister-MÃ¼ller-Museum in Solnhofen, it <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> classified as Compsognathus by an amateur collector, the same mayor Friedrich MÃ¼ller after which the museum is named. It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate genus and species, Wellnhoferia grandis. It is missing only portions of the neck, tail, backbone, and head.|$|E
5|$|The game <b>originally</b> <b>was</b> envisioned as {{a sequel}} to Remedy's {{previous}} game, Alan Wake. The game's focus was shifted to time travel, as Microsoft wanted a new intellectual property with interactive storytelling. The team consulted scientists while creating the fictional science in this game. While the video game portion was developed internally by Remedy and directed by studio veteran Sam Lake, the TV side of the game was developed by Lifeboat Productions and directed by Ben Ketai. Shawn Ashmore, Aidan Gillen and Lance Reddick portrayed important roles in the game. The game uses a new engine developed by Remedy, the Northlight engine, and a technology called Digital Molecular Matter.|$|E
