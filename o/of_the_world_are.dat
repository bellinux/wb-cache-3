5|$|Following the purges and {{subsequent}} recoveries, {{gaps in the}} Doctor Who archive are spread unevenly through its first eleven seasons. Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (The Tenth Planet, Episode 4 and The Web of Fear Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected; of the fourteen stories comprising his first two seasons, only The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>are</b> complete, and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Calcutta High Court is {{the oldest}} High Court in the country, {{established}} on 2 July 1862. High Courts that handle {{a large number of}} cases of a particular region have permanent benches established there. Benches are also present in states which come under the jurisdiction of a court outside its territorial limits. Smaller states with few cases may have circuit benches established. Circuit benches (known as circuit courts in some parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world)</b> <b>are</b> temporary courts which hold proceedings for a few selected months in a year. Thus cases built up during this interim period are judged when the circuit court is in session. According to a study conducted by Bengaluru-based NGO Daksh on 21 high courts in collaboration with Ministry of Law and Justice (India) in March 2016, it was found that average pendency of a case in High courts in India is 3 years.|$|E
5|$|The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender norms within a society. By combining these sources of inequality, SIGI is able to penalize high levels of inequality {{in each of the}} applicable dimensions, allowing for only partial compensation by the gaps between the remaining dimensions and the highly inequitable one. Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> controlled for.|$|E

5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus in many areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E

25|$|Different regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> {{researched}} very unevenly. The {{largest number}} of studies has been conducted in European countries and in North America, where the experts agree on the mean estimate to be about 1% {{of the general population}} (Bloodtein, 1995. A Handbook on Stuttering). African populations, particularly from West Africa, might have the highest stuttering prevalence in the world—reaching in some populations 5%, 6% and even over 9%. Many regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> not researched sufficiently, and for some major regions there are no prevalence studies at all (for example, in China). Some claim the reason for this might be a lower incidence in the general population in China.|$|E

25|$|The typical Mesoamerican {{cosmology}} {{sees the}} world as separated into a day world watched by the sun and a night world watched by the moon. More importantly, the three superposed levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> united by a Ceiba tree (Yaxche in Mayan). The geographic vision is also tied to the cardinal points. Certain geographical features are linked to different parts of this cosmovision. Thus mountains and tall trees connect {{the middle and upper}} worlds; caves connect the middle and nether worlds.|$|E
25|$|The δD {{values of}} the annual {{precipitation}} in different regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> shown on the map. The precipitation is more D-enriched near the equator in the Tropical regions. The values of δD generally fall {{in the range of}} around -30~-150‰ in the northern hemisphere and -30~+30‰ over the land areas of the southern hemisphere. In North America, the δD values of average monthly precipitation across regions are more negative in January (ranging up to around -300‰ in Canada) compared to July (up to around -190‰).|$|E
25|$|Competition {{for water}} has widely increased, {{and it has}} become more {{difficult}} to conciliate the necessities for water supply for human consumption, food production, ecosystems and other uses. Water administration is frequently involved in contradictory and complex problems. Approximately 10% of the worldwide annual runoff is used for human necessities. Several areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> flooded, while others have such low precipitations that human life is almost impossible. As population and development increase, raising water demand, the possibility of problems inside a certain country or region increases, as it happens with others outside the region.|$|E

25|$|Cricket {{grounds in}} most parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> devoid of any trees or shrubs. The lime tree at the St Lawrence Ground was an exception: the ground opened as the Beverley Ground in 1847, and was built around the tree. The {{presence}} of a tree within the playing area required special local rules. Shots blocked by the tree were counted as a four. Only four cricketers have cleared the tree to score a six: Arthur 'Jacko' Watson of Sussex in 1925, the West Indies' Learie Constantine (1928), Middlesex's Jim Smith (1939), and Carl Hooper (1992).|$|E
25|$|It is {{the optic}} tectum {{of the brain}} which {{eventually}} processes these infrared cues. This portion of the brain receives other sensory information as well, most notably optic stimulation, but also motor, proprioceptive and auditory. Some neurons in the tectum respond to visual or infrared stimulation alone; others respond more strongly to combined visual and infrared stimulation, and still others respond only {{to a combination of}} visual and infrared. Some neurons appear to be tuned to detect movement in one direction. It has been found that the snake’s visual and infrared maps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> overlaid in the optic tectum. This combined information is relayed via the tectum to the forebrain.|$|E
25|$|Education in BME also varies greatly {{around the}} world. By {{virtue of its}} {{extensive}} biotechnology sector, its numerous major universities, and relatively few internal barriers, the U.S. has progressed {{a great deal in}} its development of BME education and training opportunities. Europe, which also has a large biotechnology sector and an impressive education system, has encountered trouble in creating uniform standards as the European community attempts to supplant some of the national jurisdictional barriers that still exist. Recently, initiatives such as BIOMEDEA have sprung up to develop BME-related education and professional standards. Other countries, such as Australia, are recognizing and moving to correct deficiencies in their BME education. Also, as high technology endeavors are usually marks of developed nations, some areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>are</b> prone to slower development in education, including in BME.|$|E
