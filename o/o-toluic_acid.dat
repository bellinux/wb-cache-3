40|$|The {{inhibition}} kinetics of alkylbenzoic acids on the diphenolase {{activity of}} mushroom tyrosinase have been investigated. The {{results show that}} the alkylbenzoic acids assayed can lead to reversible inhibition of the enzyme; furthermore, <b>o-toluic</b> <b>acid</b> and m-toluic acid are mixed-type inhibitors and p-alkylbenzoic acids are uncompetitive inhibitors. The inhibition constants have been determined. For these p-alkylbenzoic acids, the inhibition strength follows the order: p-toluic acid < p-ethylbenzoic acid < p-propylbenzoic acid < p-isopropylbenzoic acid < p-tert-butylbenzoic acid < p-butylbenzoic acid < p-pentylbenzoic acid < p-hexylbenzoic acid < p-heptylbenzoic acid < p-octylbenzoic acid, indicating that the hydrophobic p-alkyl group {{played an important role in}} the inhibition of the enzyme. The inhibitory effects were potentiated with increasing lengths of the hydrocarbon chains. The inhibitory effects of <b>o-toluic</b> <b>acid</b> and p-isopropylbenzoic acid on the monophenolase activity have also been studied. The results show that both <b>o-toluic</b> <b>acid</b> and p-isopropylbenzoic acid can lengthen the lag time and decrease the steady-state activity of the enzyme. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Para-toluic acid (1 : 4 methylbenzoic acid) and ortho-toluic acid {{were found}} to be potent {{allergic}} sensitizers when applied to human skin. Cross-sensitivity was found between all three isomers, p-toluic, m-toluic, and <b>o-toluic</b> <b>acids.</b> It is suggested that this cross-sensitivity is explicable in terms of carrier protein specificity rather than by the presence of a common chemical sequence in the hapten or by conversion of the cross-reactants to an identical hapten...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCatalytic {{diastereoselective}} hydrogenation of o-toluic and 2 -methyl nicotinic acids covalently {{bound to}} various chiral auxiliaries {{was carried out}} in a three-phase slurry reactor and followed in real time by means of in situ Fourier transform infrared/attenuated total reflection (FTIR/ATR) spectroscopy. The measurements show that the catalytic hydrogenation of <b>o-toluic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives undergoes direct transformation to corresponding cyclohexanoic compounds. On the contrary, the presence of the nitrogen atom in the nicotinyl ring affects deeply the mechanism of hydrogenation by favoring the accumulation of tetrahydropyridine intermediate in the liquid phase, which is probably caused by modifying the adsorption mode on the metallic surface. It was demonstrated that data provided by examining corresponding IR stack plots by employing a chemometric, self-modeling curve resolution algorithm are more reliable than data derived from off-line GC analysis...|$|E
40|$|Photoionization mass {{spectrometry}} (PIMS) {{has been used}} to study the dissociative ionization of three anthropogenic atmospheric aerosol precursors (o-xylene, 2 -methylstyrene, indene) and five of their main atmospheric degradation products (o-tolualdehyde, 2 -methylphenol, <b>o-toluic</b> <b>acid,</b> phthalic acid, and phthaldialdehyde). Ionization and fragment appearance energies have been experimentally determined in the 7 - 15 eV photon energy regime. Moreover, intensive ab inito quantum chemical calculations have been performed to compute the first ionization energies and heats of formation of these compounds (including also phthalic anhydride). Several methods have been used, and the theoretical results are compared to the experimental values with the aim to find the best method to predict thermochemical data for similar molecules. The vacuum-UV fragmentation pathways following photoionization are discussed. The results of this work are important with respect to the analytical chemistry of these compounds since their basic gas phase ion energetics data are mostly unknown. They will help in interpreting real-time mass spectrometric measurements used for the study of organic aerosol formation in smog chambers and in the real atmosphere. 1...|$|E
40|$|Capillary zone {{electrophoresis}} (CZE) and affinity {{capillary electrophoresis}} (ACE) {{were applied to}} study the interaction between netropsin and a 14 mer double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The use of a polyacrylamide coated capillary can suppress the electroosmotic flow (EOF) and the adsorption of DNA onto the wall. Better analysis of the DNA was achieved in a coated capillary upon Tris-acetate. In CZE, the peak width broadened due to the affinity interaction between dsDNA and netropsin. In ACE, <b>o-toluic</b> <b>acid,</b> a negatively charged molecule {{was used as the}} indicator to monitor the changes of EOF when netropsin was added to the running buffer. The 14 mer dsDNA showed different mobilities upon various concentrations of netropsin due to the affinity interaction between the dsDNA and netropsin. The binding constants of this interaction were (1. 07 +/- 0. 10). 10 (5) M- 1 calculated from CZE and (4. 75 +/- 0. 30). 10 (4) M- 1 from ACE using a Scatchard plot. The binding stoichiometry was 1 : 1 calculated from CZE which was superior to ACE in this study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the work is}} to understand the decomposition of alphacypermethrin {{which is one of the}} most common pyrethroid pesticides, and to examine the formation of pollutants formed during decomposition. This article reports the experimental results of the thermal decomposition of alphacypermethrin under non-oxidative conditions. The experiments were conducted in a tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure. The reaction variables considered were temperature (300 - 600 °C) and flow rate (27. 8 - 18. 2 cm 3 /min) which was adjusted to maintain a residence time of 5 s. The pesticide was slowly vaporised at an evaporation rate of 70 µg/min at a temperature of 185 °C. The decomposition of alphacypermethrin started around 375 °C and involved an unusual vinylcyclopropane rearrangement-cum-aromatisation reaction. At higher temperatures, alphacypermethrin was aromatised into 3 -phenoxyphenyl nitrile acetic acid 3 -mcthyl phenyl ester with the concomitant loss of hydrogen chloride molecules. The presence of hydrogen chloride gas was confirmed by FTJR spectroscopy. Other products detected and quantified by GC/MS were <b>o-toluic</b> <b>acid,</b> 3 -phenoxybenzaldehyde, diphenyl ether, phenoxyphenyl acetonitrile, methyl benzonitrile, phenoxybenzonitrile and phenol. Previous studies carried out on permethrin in our laboratory 'showed that the process of aromatisation was around 20 kcal/mol lower in energy than the direct rupture of the O-CH 2 linkage for temperatures between 400 - 1000 °C. The effect of the CN group in alphacypermethrin compared to permethrin was also investigated by density functional theory (OFT) calculations...|$|E
40|$|<b>O-Toluic</b> <b>acid</b> (OTA) and {{m-toluic acid}} (MTA) are two isomers of toluic acid {{that act as}} an {{important}} organic intermediates, mostly used in medicines and pesticides. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on isotopic abundance ratios of 2 H/ 1 H, 13 C/ 12 C, (PM+ 1) /PM and 18 O/ 16 O, (PM+ 2) /PM, in toluic acid isomers using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The OTA and MTA samples were divided into two parts: control and treated. The control sample remained as untreated, while the treated sample was further divided into four groups as T 1, T 2, T 3, and T 4. The treated group was subjected to biofield energy treatment. The GC-MS spectra of both the isomers showed five m/z peaks due to the molecular ion peak and fragmented peaks of toluic acid derivatives. The isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+ 1) /PM and (PM+ 2) /PM were calculated for both the isomers and found significant alteration in the treated isomers. The isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+ 1) /PM in treated samples of OTA was decreased and then slightly increased upto 2. 37 % in T 2, where the (PM+ 2) /PM in treated OTA, significantly decreased by 55. 3 % in T 3 sample. Similarly, in case of MTA, the isotopic abundance ratio of (PM+ 1) /PM in the treated sample showed a slight increase the (PM+ 2) /PM was decreased by 11. 95 % in T 2 as compared to their respective control. GC-MS data suggests that the biofield energy treatment on toluic acid isomers had significantly altered the isotopic abundance of 2 H, 13 C, and 18 O in OTA and MTA as compared to the control.
