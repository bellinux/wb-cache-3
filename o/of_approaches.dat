5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>approaches</b> {{have been}} used to {{estimate}} the year of the crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in 30 or 33 AD. The gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. The date for the conversion of Paul (estimated to be 33–36 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul's conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles. Astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of the Crucifixion by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of Passover, a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar. The most widely accepted dates derived from this method are April 7, 30 AD, and April 3, 33 AD (both Julian).|$|E

These tactics range from engagement with the media, lobbying of governments and NGOs, public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek legal redress. As the persecution in China progressed, overseas Falun Gong efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications for freedom of speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E
5|$|Since Johnston's death, {{his field}} of {{volcanic}} eruption prediction has advanced significantly, and volcanologists are {{now able to}} predict eruptions based on a number of precursors that become apparent between days and months in advance. Geologists can now identify characteristic patterns in seismic waves that indicate particular magmatic activity. In particular, volcanologists have used deep, long-period earthquakes that indicate that magma is rising through the crust. They can also use carbon dioxide emission as a proxy for magma supply rate. Measurements of surface deformation due to magmatic intrusions, like those that were conducted by Johnston and the other USGS scientists at the ColdwaterI and II outposts, have advanced in scale and precision. Ground deformation monitoring networks around volcanoes now consist of InSAR (interferometry), surveys of networks of GPS monuments, microgravity surveys in which scientists measure the change in gravitational potential or acceleration because of the intruding magma and resulting deformation, strain meters, and tiltmeters. Though there is still work to be done, this combination <b>of</b> <b>approaches</b> has greatly improved scientists' abilities to forecast volcanic eruptions.|$|E

5|$|Stage directors, unaided by {{post-production}} {{effects and}} camera tricks, have used other methods {{to depict the}} ghost. In the late 19th century, elaborate productions of the play staged by Henry Irving employed a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>approaches</b> for this task. In 1877 a green silhouette was {{used to create a}} ghostlike image; ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear {{in the middle of the}} scene, and then again from the midst of the audience. In 1895 a shaft of blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo's spirit. In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play (Banquo and Macbeth were told of their future through palmistry); he used Macbeth's shadow as the ghost. In 1936 Orson Welles directed the Federal Theatre Project production of the play, with an African-American cast that included Canada Lee in the role of Banquo.|$|E
5|$|There exist data {{structures}} that may improve on binary search {{in some cases}} for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. However, while these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys, such data structures are usually only faster because they exploit the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, use a combination <b>of</b> <b>approaches</b> to mitigate this while retaining efficiency {{and the ability to}} perform approximate matching.|$|E

40|$|There are {{tradeoffs}} to {{high levels}} <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> motivation. On the one hand, high levels <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> motivation are thought to underlie positive emotional states such as excitement (Watson, Wiese, Vaidya, & Tellegen, 1999). High levels <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> motivation should also invigorate goal pursuit (Higgins, 1997) and potentially facilitate progress as a result (Carver & Scheier, 1998). On the other hand, Gray (1982) suggested that high levels <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> motivation predispose one to a certain class of dysregulated outcomes. Increasingly so, and consistent with the latter perspective, higher levels <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> motivation {{have been linked to}} addictive behaviors (Franken, Muris, & Georgieva, 2006), anger and aggression (Carver & Harmon-Jones, 2009), and bipolar symptoms (Alloy et al., 2006). Nonetheless, high levels <b>of</b> self-reported <b>approach</b> moti-vation, considered alone, may often not predict its problem-atic manifestations. For example, higher levels of self-control should mitigate the extent to which approach motivation results in addiction (Baumeister, Heatherton, & Tice, 1994). Similarly, better neurological functioning should mitigate the extent to which approach motivation predicts bipolar symptoms (Alloy et al., 2009).

5|$|Some ant {{species are}} {{considered}} as pests, primarily those {{that occur in}} human habitations, where their presence is often problematic. For example, the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens. Some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the Argentine ant, pavement ant, yellow crazy ant, banded sugar ant, Pharaoh ant, carpenter ants, odorous house ant, red imported fire ant, and European fire ant. Some ants will raid stored food, others may damage indoor structures, some can damage agricultural crops directly (or by aiding sucking pests), and some will sting or bite. The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions. Ant populations are managed by a combination <b>of</b> <b>approaches</b> that make use of chemical, biological and physical methods. Chemical methods {{include the use of}} insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through trophallaxis.

In-car navigation systems are {{an example of how}} multimodal technologies are increasingly becoming part of our everyday life.

In this paper we use a study on the usability of a navigation device when the user is setting set up an itinerary to investigate the scope of different classes <b>of</b> <b>approach.</b> Four analytical and one empirical techniques were used to evaluate the usability of the device. We analyse the results produced by the two classes <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> – analytical versus empirical – and compare them in terms of their diversity and the insight they provide to the analyst in respect to the overall usability of the system and its potential improvement.
