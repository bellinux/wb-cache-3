40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to assess the {{relationship}} between selected biomechanical variables with the performance in Javelin throw. Five male Javelin throwers of Lakshmibai National University of Physical Education, Gwalior from the track & field match practice group were selected as the subject for the present study. Their age was between 17 to 25 years. The sequential photography technique was employed to record the technique of javelin throwers. A Motor driven, Nikon D- 40 camera was used. The subjects were photographed at stance position and release moment in sagittal plane. From the photographs, the stick figures were prepared by using Joint-point Method, and various biomechanical variables were obtained at the moment of releasing the javelin, suggested by Hay. Pearson’s product moment correlation was used to find out the relationship of selected biomechanical Variables with the performance of male Javelin throwers. The level of significance was tested at. 05. The angle right and left ankle joint and left elbow joint have exhibited significant relationships at stance position and In case of release moment shoulder joint (right) and elbow joint (left) have shown significant relationship with the performance of subject. The result of the height of C. G. at selected moments has insignificant relationship with the performance of subject at stance position and at release moment.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} low-magnitude high-frequency vibration (LMHFV) on degenerated articular cartilage and subchondral bone in anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) induced osteoarthritis (OA) rat model. Methods 6 months old female Sprague-Dawley rats received ACLT <b>on</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> and randomly divided into treatment and control groups. OA developed 12 weeks after surgery. LMHFV (35  Hz, 0. 3 g) treatment was given 20  min/day and 5 days/week. After 6, 12 and 18 weeks, six rats of each group were sacrificed {{at each time point}} and the right knees were harvested. OA grading score, distal femur cartilage volume (CV), subchondral bone morphology, elastic modulus of cartilage and functional changes between groups were analyzed. ResultsIncreased cartilage degradation (higher OA grading score) and worse functional results (lower duty cycle, regular index and higher limb idleness index) were observed after LMHFV treatment (P =  0. 011, 0. 020, 0. 012 and 0. 005, respectively). CV increased after LMHFV treatment (P =  0. 019). Subchondral bone density increased with OA progress (P <  0. 01). Increased BV/TV, Tb. N and decreased Tb. Sp were observed in distal femur epiphysis in LMHFV treatment group (P =  0. 006, 0. 018 and 0. 011, respectively). ConclusionLMHFV accelerated cartilage degeneration and caused further functional deterioration of OA affected limb in ACLT-induced OA rat model. In contrast, LMHFV promoted bone formation in OA affected distal femur epiphysis, but did not reverse OA progression...|$|E

40|$|Analgesia {{arising from}} exercising can occur via release of {{endogenous}} opioids {{in the central}} nervous system and periphery. However, the literature remains controversial about exercise ways and actions in pain. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether resistance exercise produces changes on the nociception and suffers interference by applying an opioid inhibitor. 18 rats divided into three groups were used: G 1 –hyperalgesia <b>on</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> and untreated; G 2 –hyperalgesia and treated with jump sin water; G 3 –hyperalgesia with previous injection of naloxone and subsequent jumps. To produce hyperalgesia, 100 µl of 5 % formalin was injected in the tibio femoral joint space. Pain was assessed using a digital von Frey filament on the right medial tibiofemoral joint. The eva-luation periods were: pre-injury (EV 1) after 15 minutes (EV 2) and 30 minutes (EV 3) and one hour (EV 4). The applied exercise was jumpingin water and it occurred after EV 2. The animal performed 4 sets of 5 jumps, with an interval of 3 minutes and overload of 50 % of body weight. In G 1, no-ciceptive increase was observed, with significant decrease and return to initial baseline values in AV 4; G 2 showed threshold restoration after exercise and return to baseline; G 3 reduced thresholds, without restoration or significant increase in them.

40|$|To {{determine}} in a 48 -month {{longitudinal study}} {{the association of}} thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and strength on progression of morphologic knee cartilage degeneration using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Seventy Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) subjects aged 50 - 60 years, with no radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis (OA) and constant muscle strength over 48 months as measured by isometric knee extension testing were included. Baseline right thigh muscle CSAs were assessed on axial T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, and extensor to flexor CSA ratios were calculated. Degenerative knee abnormalities at baseline and 48 -months were graded <b>on</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> 3 T MRIs using a modified whole organ MRI score (WORMS). Statistical analysis employed Student's t-tests and multivariable regression models adjusted for age, body mass index and gender. Extension strength was significantly and positively correlated with baseline thigh muscle CSA (r =  0. 65, P <  0. 001). Greater baseline total thigh muscle CSA {{was significantly associated with}} increase of cartilage WORMS scores over 48 months in patellar (P =  0. 027) and trochlear (P =  0. 038) compartments, but not in other knee compartments. Among specific muscle groups, CSA of extensors (P =  0. 021) and vastus medialis (VM) (P =  0. 047) were associated with patellar cartilage increase in WORMS. Baseline E/F ratio had a significant positive association with patellar WORMS cartilage score increase over 48 months, P =  0. 0015. There were no other significant associations between muscle CSA/ratios and increase in WORMS scores. Maintenance of proper extensor to flexor muscle balance about the knee through decreased E/F ratios may slow patellofemoral cartilage deterioration, while higher extensor and VM CSA may increase patellofemoral cartilage loss...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} weight loss with progression of cartilage changes at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging over 48 months in overweight and obese participants compared with participants of stable weight. Materials and Methods The institutional review boards of the four participating centers approved this HIPAA-compliant study. Included were (a) 640 participants (mean age, 62. 9 years ± 9. 1 [standard deviation]; 398 women) who were overweight or obese (body mass index cutpoints of 25 and 30 kg/m(2), respectively) from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, with risk factors for osteoarthritis or mild to moderate radiographic findings of osteoarthritis, categorized into groups with (a) weight loss of more than 10 % (n = 82), (b) weight loss of 5 %- 10 % (n = 238), or (c) stable weight (n = 320) over 48 months. Participants were frequency-matched for age, sex, baseline body mass index, and Kellgren-Lawrence score. Two radiologists assessed cartilage and meniscus defects <b>on</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> 3 -T MR images at baseline and 48 months by using the modified Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS). Progression of the subscores was compared between the weight loss groups by using multivariable logistic regression models. Results Over 48 months, adjusted mean increase of cartilage WORMS was significantly smaller in the 5 %- 10 % weight loss group (1. 6; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 3, 1. 9; P =. 002) and even smaller in the group with less than 10 % weight loss (1. 0; 95 % CI: 0. 6, 1. 4; P =. 001) {{when compared with the}} stable weight group (2. 3; 95 % CI: 2. 0, 2. 7). Moreover, percentage of weight change was significantly associated with increase in cartilage WORMS (β = 0. 2; 95 % CI: 0. 02, 0. 4; P =. 007). Conclusion Participants who lost weight over 48 months showed significantly lower cartilage degeneration, as assessed with MR imaging; rates of progression were lower with greater weight loss.

40|$|Durante o processo inflamatório, alguns tipos de células predominam e estão envolvidos com a produção de dor. O laser de baixa potência mostra-se útil no controle de mediadores inflamatórios, mas a ampla divergência nos parâmetros dosimétricos, conduz a variações nos resultados positivos. O objetivo deste estudo foi analisar o uso do laser 808 nm, na dor {{articular}} crônica e edema de ratos Wistar submetidos a sinovite. Foram utilizados 10 ratos Wistar, divididos em dois grupos: GC - indução de sinovite em joelho direito e tratamento placebo; GT - indução de sinovite e irradiado com laser 10 J/cm². Para a produção de sinovite foram injetados 100 µl de formalina a 5 %, no espaço articular tibiofemoral direito. A avaliação da dor ocorreu pelo tempo de elevação da pata (TEP). No 10 º dia após a indução de sinovite, iniciou-se o tratamento com laser sobre a face articular medial do joelho, procedimento mantido no decorrer de 10 dias. Os resultados mostraram que o laser apresentou efeitos analgésicos, visto que, para o grupo tratado, houve redução significativa nos valores de TEP, indicando redução da dor, quando comparados os valores pós-tratamento com os pré-tratamento, o que não ocorreu para o grupo que recebeu tratamento placebo; para o edema, o laser também mostrou redução significativa do mesmo. Concluiu-se que o laser 808 nm, com 10 J/cm², é eficaz na redução da dor articular crônica e edema, em animais submetidos a sinovite experimental. During the inflammatory process {{some kinds}} of cells are predominant and are involved with pain production. Low power laser seems to be useful in the control of inflammatory mediators, but wide divergence in the dosemetric parameters leads to variations in its positive results. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the use of the 808 nm laser in the chronic joint pain and edema of Wistar rats submitted to synovitis. Sample was composed of 10 Wistar rats divided in two groups: CG - synovitis induction <b>on</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> and placebo treatment; TG - synovitis induction and irradiated with 10 J/cm² laser. 100 µl of 5 % phormaline were injected in the right tibiofemoral joint space. Pain assessment occurred by the time of paw elevation (TPE). On the 10 th day after synovitis induction, laser treatment began on the knee medial joint surface and this procedure was kept for 10 days. The outcomes showed that laser presented analgesic effects, since significant reduction of the TPE values was observed for the treated group, hence indicating pain reduction when compared with the pre-treatment values; the same situation did not occur to the group which received the placebo treatment. Concerning edema, laser has also shown significant reduction. It can be concluded that laser 808 nm with 10 J/cm² is efficient in reduction of chronic joint pain and edema in animals submitted to experimental synovitis...|$|E
