40|$|Legal representatives engage {{psychologists to}} provide expert witness {{opinions}} {{about a number}} of factors, including the psychological factors that {{may have contributed to the}} perpetrator 2 ̆ 7 s behaviour and the likelihood of reoffending. Although this evidence can affect the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings,</b> little is known about how the experts who provide it are chosen or about the quality of their services. This paper explored legal representatives’ reasons for engaging psychologists as expert witnesses, how they choose these experts, and their opinions about the expertise provided. Questions were also asked about the features of good and poor written and oral expert testimony. The results show that the majority of legal representatives engage psychologists who are usually chosen through referrals from colleagues and others. The legal representatives in the present sample had little awareness about the different backgrounds of experts (e. g. clinical vs forensic psychology). These results have implications for psychologists who provide expert evidence and the legal representatives who engage them...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} societal change in the early nineties in the Czech Republic which has brought many new phenomena. The increase in crime was one of the events to which modern society was not ready. Development of post-Communist society has been uneven in all aspects. The legislative process in an emerging democratic state system was poor. As a result, a specific group of people took advantage from this situation. They have exploited loopholes in existing legislation to commit a crime. This group of offenders, in search of easy profits, then committed crimes and fraud. This thesis deals with fraud as one of the statistically most spread offenses. Law enforcement and criminal proceedings document the notification of victims when deciding the case as far as possible, which allows them existing legislation.

40|$|Forensic {{engineers}} have several duties, {{in some cases}} to be performed in conflictual situations (e. g. depositions). The competencies of the forensic electrical engineer include the knowledge of engineering standards and best practices, familiarity with applicable laws and regulations, as well as wise decision making. In this paper, functions and duties of the forensic electrical engineer preparing for a trial are discussed and quantitative methods of technical evaluation are proposed. Around the world, institutions establish and define the competencies of the forensic engineer, and promote the advancement of the forensic science through conferences, and publications. To resolve the historical dichotomy between the logic of the "certainty" required by the judicial <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings,</b> and the logic of the "uncertainty" of the engineering, this paper suggests utilizing the subdivision of accident-related trials, when a risk assessment must be provided, into two levels; a junior "engineering" level (which may be public is some jurisdictions, confidential in others), followed by a senior level or formal trial, might together better support the formulation of the verdict by providing a more exhaustive analysis of the accident causation, and parties' responsibilities...|$|E
40|$|The study {{involves}} a {{statistical analysis of}} the case management system (CMS) database of the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) for the financial years 2001 / 2, 2003 / 4 and 2004 / 5. It focuses on statistical indicators that {{shed light on the}} administrative efficiency of the CCMA and the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> at the CCMA as a basis for assessing its regulatory efficiency in respect of resolving unfair dismissals and unfair labour practices. The study concludes that there are marked differences in patterns of dispute resolution and the outcome of disputes in the CCMA’s different provincial regions. These regional variations are significantly greater than those between different economic sectors. A closer scrutiny of these differences contributed to an improved understanding of the successes and failures of the CCMA. The CMS database on which the study is based is designed for case management purposes and this orientation is reflected in the information contained in the database. Accordingly, key information required for assessing efficiency of the CCMA and to inform policy decisions is not contained in the CMS database and consideration should be given to expanding the database for these purposes.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The research examined {{the task of}} legal representation and client management, in a study focused on the representation of parents in child care proceedings. Care proceedings, brought where there are serious child protection concerns, {{have been subject to}} extensive review, and reforms to procedures and the funding regime impacting on legal representatives. This qualitative research was prompted by a study based on an examination of court files and commissioned by the DCA. This raised questions about the way parents are represented, and the role of parental representation in affecting the process and <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Underlying legal representation of parents are issues of access to justice {{for one of the most}} vulnerable and needy groups in our society. Project description: This research will examine the task of legal representation and client management, focusing on the representation of parents in child care proceedings. Care proceedings have been subject to extensive review and changes in procedure recently and the research is prompted also by the Care Profiling Study conducted by the applicants for the Ministry of Justice. New procedures emphasise the importance of good legal representation not simply for the benefit of the parents, but also for the smooth operation of the system. Faced with problems of cost and delay, legal representatives are being identified as a key part of the solution. It is particularly relevant now to provide clear understandings of how the legal representatives of parents conceive and operate their role. The research will use qualitative methods. A preliminary phase involves observations of interim court hearings to obtain an overview of the process in practice. A second element will comprise a set of contemporaneous case studies. A third element will comprise interviews with legal representatives and other key personnel involved in the process, to explore wider conceptions of the role, adding breadth to the case studies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} two criminal networks {{belonging to}} the ‗Ndrangheta, a mafia-type criminal organization originating from Calabria, a Southern Italian Region. The literature on criminal networks argues that differences in the degree and betweenness centrality measures may highlight strategic positioning patterns for criminals capable of reducing risk of detection and maintaining control over the criminal activities at the same time. However, the identification of this strategic pattern is difficult whenever, as frequently happens, centrality measures are highly correlated The paper analyzes network positioning in two mafia-type organizations, where degree and betweenness centrality were highly correlated. The analysis focuses on specific characteristics of the individuals in the networks (task, hierarchy and social status within each group) and how these relate to network positioning (centrality scores and clustering coefficient) and the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the criminal <b>proceedings</b> (accusation, arrest, conviction and sentence in months). Results show that task and hierarchy are highly associated with network centrality, but also with accusation, arrest and conviction. Contrarily, high social status within the networks shows limited association with network centrality and the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>proceedings.</b> This may reveal patterns of strategic positioning {{which could not be}} identified solely though network analysis measures...|$|R
