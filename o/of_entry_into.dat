5|$|The {{original}} {{scheduled date}} <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> {{service for the}} MRA4 was April 2003; however, development proved far more protracted than anticipated. Early on, an independent company, Flight Refuelling Ltd., had been contracted to undertake the conversions to MRA4 standard, however BAE discovered that the Nimrod airframes supplied by the RAF were not built to a common standard and this considerably complicated the refurbishment process. The task of converting the existing airframes was transferred in-house to BAE Systems Woodford. The BAE team at Woodford then found that the new wing was flawed, {{which resulted in the}} project being put on hold while another wing design was developed.|$|E
5|$|Gernot Klepper, in an {{analysis}} similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of learning during the production process which depends {{on the scale of}} production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall by as much as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.|$|E
5|$|The {{advanced}} level of metallurgy in the area, coupled with its ease of access from the Continent, meant that Hengistbury Head became a significant Late-Iron Age port; trading worked metal of iron, silver, and bronze {{in return for}} figs, glass, tools and other goods. Armorican coins and pottery uncovered here show links to the Brittany peninsula. Amphorae used for the transportation of North Italian wine {{have been found in}} such quantities (more than all other sites in the south of England put together), that {{it is clear that the}} Head was a main port <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> the country. However, no similar amphorae have been unearthed in Armorica, hinting at a more direct trade route between Hengistbury Head and Italy. Most of these vessels date from before 50 B.C., while later styles are absent despite being common in other parts of Britain, indicating the wine trade seems to have declined at about the time Caesar began his Gaulish campaigns.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase- 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor, {{may have}} various {{effects on the}} central nervous system via the nitric oxide (NO) -cyclic {{guanosine}} monophosphate (cGMP) pathway. Preclinical studies have shown the controversial effect of sildenafil on anxiety-like behavior in animals. This study was undertaken to investigate the acute effect of sildenafil on anxiety-like behavior in mice. Methods: Male mice were intraperitoneally (i. p.) administrated sildenafil (1, 2, or 10 mg/kg), and the control group was given the vehicle 15 min before the plus-maze test. The number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> the open arms of the plus-maze, the time spent in the open arms, and the total numbers <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> the arms were recorded. Results: The results indicated that compared to the control group, the sildenafil-treated mice spent more time in the open arms and had a greater number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> open arms. The total number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> the arms did not significantly differ between the sildenafil-treated groups and the control group. Discussion: Acute administration of sildenafil could have anxiolytic effects on male mice. This effect might be mediated in a time-dependent manner by the NO/ cGMP/PDE 5 pathway...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} role of calcium in anxiety {{and its effect on}} {{anxiolytic}} activity of diazepam and verapamil. Materials and Methods: Study was conducted using female albino rats in light and dark arena; a nonconflicting animal experimental model for anxiety. Animals were divided into six groups with six animals in each group. Test drugs, calcium gluconate (10 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg), verapamil (5 mg/kg), calcium &#x 002 B; diazepam, and calcium &#x 002 B; verapamil were administered intraperitoneally. Percentage of time spent in light arena and number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> light arena were the two parameters observed for 5 min after 30 min of drug administration. ANOVA test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Compared to the control group, diazepam group, and calcium group, only calcium &#x 002 B; diazepam group showed considerable increase in mean percentage of time spent in light arena. However, this increase was statistically insignificant. In the case of total number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> light arena, animals in calcium &#x 002 B; diazepam group showed statistically significant increase in total number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> light arena when compared to calcium group and diazepam group. Conclusion: Results of the study suggest that calcium may enhance the anxiolytic activity of diazepam, but has no effect on anxiolytic activity of verapamil...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relationships}} between epilepsy, sleep, and anticonvulsant drugs in kindled cats. No sleep alteration was present at midkindling. When the animals became fully kindled, a reduction in REM sleep percentage and the number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> REM sleep were observed compared to baseline. In addition, with further seizures, {{an increase in the}} percentage of wakefulness appeared, accompanied by a further reduction in the number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> REM sleep. It therefore seems that there is a progressive disruption of sleep, dependent on the increasing number of tonic-clonic generalized seizures. After a seizure-free interval, REM sleep and wakefulness returned to baseline values. A reduction in the percentage of stage II compared to baseline was found and remained as a long-term effect of the kindling process. Acute administration of carbamazepine (CBZ) reduced the REM sleep percentage. This effect, paralleled by a reduction in the number <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> REM sleep, was evident both at baseline and when the animals were fully kindled. After a large number of seizures, however, CBZ administration did not cause a further reduction in the already low percentage of REM sleep. Results are discussed with reference to previous literature. We propose a hypothesis of competition between seizure and REM sleep in the elimination of epileptogenic and hypnogenic factors...|$|R
