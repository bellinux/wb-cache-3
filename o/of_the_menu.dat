The current application icon in the upper right-hand corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> bar cycles between open applications; {{it is not a}} menu. System 6 supports 24bits of addressable random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard drive capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive.

5|$|Beyond French fries, {{the company}} has {{introduced}} several other side products {{over the course of}} its existence. Onion rings have been part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> for the majority of BK history. Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeño poppers accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella sticks with a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella sticks have since been relegated to a regional menu item in the United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} company's major offerings, {{the chicken}} fries are {{sometimes}} the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product has been a prominent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> {{for the better part}} of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product – its first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E
5|$|Pillsbury's {{management}} {{made several}} attempts at reorganization or {{restructuring of the}} restaurant chain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. In a plan called Operation Phoenix, Smith initiated a restructuring of corporate business practices {{at all levels of}} the company. Changes to the company included updated franchise agreements, a broadening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu,</b> and new store designs to standardize the look and feel of the company. While these efforts were initially effective, many of them were eventually discarded, resulting in Burger King falling into a fiscal slump that damaged the financial performance of both Burger King and its parent. Poor operating performance and ineffectual leadership continued to bog the company down for many years, even after it was acquired in 1989 by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan and its successor Diageo. Eventually, the institutional neglect of the brand by Diageo damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the loss-making chain and put the company up for sale in 2000.|$|E
50|$|Although officially {{released}} only in Japan, it can {{be enjoyed}} by players from other countries because most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menus</b> are in English with Japanese subtitles.

5|$|The game {{progresses}} linearly {{from one}} story event to the next, usually {{presented as a}} cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide benefits to the characters. Players may also choose {{the order in which}} they tackle some areas. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. Combat in Kingdom Hearts occurs in real time and involves pressing buttons to initiate attacks by the on-screen character. An action menu, similar to those found in Final Fantasy games, found at the bottom left of the screen provides other combat options such as using magic and items, although players can also assign selected magic spells that can be instantly used whilst holding the shoulder button. As players progress through the game, they can receive certain Disney characters as summons, such as Dumbo and Tinker Bell, each with their own unique abilities. There is also a context-sensitive option at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu,</b> usually used for interacting with the environment or performing special attacks. This menu is manipulated by using the right analog stick or digital pad, while movement is controlled by the left analog stick, allowing the player to navigate the menu while avoiding or approaching enemies.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game overseas, Square and Sony {{launched}} a widespread three-month advertising campaign in August 1997. Beginning with a television commercial that ran alongside popular {{shows such as}} Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons, the campaign included numerous articles in both gaming and general interest magazines, advertisements in comics from publishers such as DC Comics and Marvel, a special collaboration with Pepsi, media events, sample discs, and merchandise. According to estimations by Takechi, the total worldwide marketing budget came to USD$40 million; $10 million had been spent in Japan, $10 million in Europe, and $20 million in North America. Unlike its predecessors, Final Fantasy VII did not have its numeral adjusted {{to account for the}} lack of a Western release for Final Fantasy II, III and V—while only the fourth Final Fantasy released outside Japan, its Japanese title was retained. It released in North America on September 7, 1997. The game released in Europe on November 17, becoming the first Final Fantasy game to be released in Europe. The Western version included additional elements and alterations, such as streamlining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> and Materia system, reducing the health of enemies, new visual cues to help with navigation across the worldmap, and additional cutscenes relating to Cloud's past.|$|E
5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E
5|$|To {{celebrate}} <b>the</b> 45th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{restaurant in}} 2008, Gueller recreated elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1963 <b>menu,</b> but {{decided not to}} make certain dishes such as chicken chasseur or melon boats.

25|$|Chicken Selects – McDonald's {{version of}} chicken strips. They were {{introduced}} in early 1998 and offered again as a permanent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> in late October 2003.

Sold in the United States, Canada, Israel and the UK. Available in Australia under the name Chicken McDippers. McDonald's stopped selling Chicken Selects in the United States in February 2013, but {{they returned to the}} menu on 25 February 2015, for a limited engagement and were renamed Chicken Select Tenders.

500|$|After the event, it was {{claimed by}} Nixon and Kissinger that Sihanouk {{had given his}} tacit {{approval}} for the raids, but this is dubious.

Kenton Clymer notes that this statement [...] "cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids... In any event, no one asked him.... Sihanouk was never asked to approve the B-52 bombings, and he never gave his approval." [...] During the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Menu</b> bombings, Sihanouk's government formally protested [...] "American violation of Cambodian territory and airspace" [...] at the United Nations on over 100 occasions, although it [...] "specifically protested the use of B-52s" [...] only once, following an attack on Bu Chric in November 1969.|$|E
500|$|The {{restaurant}} has fourteen tables, and can seat 42 diners. It {{has a very}} high proportion of chefs working at the restaurant, 42, equating to one chef per diner. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> is developed by experimentation: for example, the egg and bacon ice cream came about following Blumenthal investigating the principles of [...] "flavour encapsulation". A research laboratory where Blumenthal and his team develop dishes is two doors away opposite the Hinds Head pub, which is also owned by the chef. It was {{where the majority of}} the laboratory scenes for the television series Heston Blumenthal: In Search of Perfection were filmed. The lab equipment includes a centrifuge which is used to make chocolate wine, and a vacuum oven. The restaurant takes reservations up to 2 months in advance, and in 2011 it was receiving some 30,000 calls for reservations per day, although that figure also included people who couldn't get through and were redialling.|$|E
40|$|Objective In 2006, the Victorian Government {{adopted the}} School Canteens {{and other school}} Food Services (SCFS) Policy that bans <b>the</b> sale <b>of</b> sweet drinks and confectionary and {{recommends}} <b>the</b> proportions <b>of</b> <b>menu</b> items based on a traffic light system of food classification. This study aims to determine whether compliance with the policy improves <b>the</b> nutritional profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menus.</b> Methods Items from food service menus were assessed for compliance with the SCFS policy and categorised as ‘everyday’ (‘green’), ‘select carefully’ (‘amber’) or ‘occasionally’ (‘red’) (n= 106). Profile analysis assessed differences in <b>the</b> nutritional profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menus</b> between sub-groups. Results Overall, 37 % of menus contained items banned under the policy. <b>The</b> largest proportion <b>of</b> items on <b>the</b> assessed <b>menus</b> were from <b>the</b> ‘amber’ category (mean: 51. 0 %), followed by ‘red’ (29. 3 %) and ‘green’ (20. 3 %).

500|$|Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. James Griffiths of The Guardian commented: [...] "Here comes the Queen of Pop {{in a box}} so shiny you can see your face in it. Spears is described on the cover as 'the ultimate video performer', and watching the 20 promos contained within, it's difficult to argue. [...] Relentlessly thrusting herself at the camera, compulsively preening amid special FX galas, Britney is the MTV video age in human form." [...] He also complimented the innovations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu,</b> but added that [...] "it's not particularly impressive" [...] and [...] "you need to be pretty nifty with your handset to find them." [...] Music Week said: [...] "The DVD version of Spears' high-flying 'best of' set adds bells and whistles to the audio version at only a slight premium pricewise. Twenty promo videos are included, all with top-notch sound and vision". AllMusic gave the video {{four and a half}} stars out of five. Rolling Stone graded it with three out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|V for Vendetta was {{released}} on DVD in the US on August 1, 2006, in three formats: a single-disc wide-screen version, a single-disc full-screen version, and a two-disc wide-screen special edition. DVD sales were successful, selling 1,412,865 DVD units {{in the first week}} of release which translated to $27,683,818 in revenue. By the end of 2006, 3,086,073 DVD units had been sold, bringing in slightly more than its production cost of $58,342,597. The single disc versions contain a short (15:56) behind-the-scenes featurette titled [...] "Freedom! Forever! Making V for Vendetta" [...] and the film's theatrical trailer, whereas the two-disc special edition contains three additional documentaries, and several extra features for collectors. On the second disc of the special edition, a short Easter egg clip of Natalie Portman on Saturday Night Live can be viewed by selecting the picture of wings on the second page <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu.</b> The film has also been released on the HD DVD high definition format, which features a unique 'in-film experience' created exclusively for the disc.

500|$|Reviewing {{the game}} {{years after its}} release, IGN's Scott Thompson wrote that EarthBound {{balances}} [...] "dark Lovecraftian apocalypse and silly lightheartedness", and was just as interesting nearly a decade after its original release. While he lamented a lack of [...] "visual feedback" [...] in battle animations, he felt the game had innovations that still feel [...] "smart and unique": the rolling HP meter and lack of random battles. Thompson also noted that technical issues like animation slowdown with multiple enemies on-screen went unfixed in the rerelease. Official Nintendo Magazine Parkin found the game {{to provide a more}} potent experience than developers with more resources and thought its battle sequences were [...] "sleek". Nintendo World Report Justin Baker was surprised by the [...] "excellent" [...] battle system and controls, which he found to be underreported in other reviews despite their streamlined, grind-reducing convenience. He wrote that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> interactions were clunky. GamesTM felt that the game was [...] "far from revolutionary", compared to Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, and that its battle scenes were unexciting. The magazine compared the game's [...] "chosen one" [...] story to a [...] "throwaway /Goonies hybrid narrative". Reviewers praised Nintendo for digitizing the Player's Guide, though IGN noted that it was technically easier to view it on another tablet rather than switching the Wii U's view mode. Multiple reviewers concluded that the game had aged well.|$|E
