40|$|Iron-catalyzed {{reactions}} are receiving {{a surge of}} interest owing to the natural abundance and biocompatibility of Fe and the urge to develop practically useful sustainable catalysis for fine chemical industries. This article is a brief account of our studies on the C-O and C-N bond formation reactions catalyzed by Fe complexes supported by oligopyridine, macrocyclic tetraaza, and fluorinated porphyrin ligands. The working principle is the in situ generation of reactive Fe=O and Fe=NR intermediates supported by these oxidatively robust N-donor ligands for oxygen atom/nitrogen group transfer and insertion reactions. The catalytic reactions include C-H bond oxidation <b>of</b> saturated hydrocarbons (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 87 % yield), epoxidation <b>of</b> alkenes (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 96 % yield), cis-dihydroxylation <b>of</b> alkenes (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 99 % yield), epoxidation-isomerization (E-I) reaction <b>of</b> aryl alkenes (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 94 % yield), amination <b>of</b> C-H bonds (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 95 % yield), aziridination <b>of</b> alkenes (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 95 % yield), sulfimidation <b>of</b> sulfides (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 96 % yield), and amide formation from aldehydes (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 89 % yield). Many of these catalytic reactions feature high regio- and diastereoselectivity and/or high product yields and substrate conversions, and recyclability of the catalyst, demonstrating the applicability of Fe-catalyzed oxidative organic transformation reactions in practical organic synthesis. © 2012 IUPAC. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
