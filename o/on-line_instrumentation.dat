50|$|Although {{particles}} and TOC are usually measured using on-line methods, {{there is significant}} value in complimentary or alternative off-line lab analysis. The value of the lab analysis has two aspects: cost and speciation. Smaller UPW facilities that cannot afford to purchase <b>on-line</b> <b>instrumentation</b> often choose off-line testing. TOC {{can be measured in}} the grab sample at a concentration as low as 5 ppb, using the same technique employed for the on-line analysis (see on-line method description). This detection level covers the majority of needs of less critical electronic and all pharmaceutical applications. When speciation of the organics is required for troubleshooting or design purposes, liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) provides an effective analysis. This method allows for identification of biopolymers, humics, low molecular weight acids and neutrals, and more, while characterizing nearly 100% of the organic composition in UPW with sub-ppb level of TOC.|$|E

The measurement of dielectric relaxation is one of only a few instrumental techniques available for studying molecular properties in both the liquid and solid states.

Measurement of the wide variation in magnitude of the complex permittivity with both frequency and state of cure, coupled with chemical characterization work, have been shown in the laboratory to have the potential to determine: resin quality, composition and age; cure cycle window boundaries; onset of flow and point of maximum flow; extent of and completion of reaction; evolution of volatiles; T sub g; and, crosslinking and molecular weight buildup...|$|R

The techniques for manufacturing these surfaces are varied but are tied together by one limitation; the lack of useable, <b>on-line</b> metrology <b>instrumentation.</b> Current metrology methods require the removal of a workpiece for characterisation which leads to machining down-time, more intensive labour and generally presents a bottle neck for throughput. In order {{to establish a new}} method for on-line metrology at the nanoscale investigation are made into the use of optical fibre interferometry to realise a compact probe that is robust to environmental disturbance. Wavelength tuning is combined with a dispersive element to provide a moveable optical stylus that sweeps the surface. The phase variation caused by the surface topography is then analysed using phase shifting interferometry. A second interferometer is wavelength multiplexed into the optical circuit in order to track the inherent instability of the optical fibre. This is then countered using a closed loop control to servo the path lengths mechanically which additionally counters external vibration on the measurand. The overall stability is found to be limited by polarisation state evolution however. A second method is then investigated and a rapid phase shifting technique is employed in conjunction with an electro-optic phase modulator to overcome the polarisation state evolution. Closed loop servo control is realised with no mechanical movement and a step height artefact is measured.

After ~ 2 â€“ 4 min of aging, submicron smoke particles, produced primarily from sagebrush combustion, consisted predominantly of organics by mass, but were comprised primarily of internal mixtures of organic carbon, elemental carbon, potassium chloride, and potassium sulfate. Significantly, 100 % of the fresh biomass burning particles contained minor mass fractions of nitrate and sulfate, suggesting that hygroscopic material is incorporated very near or at the point of emission. The mass fractions of ammonium, sulfate, and nitrate increased with aging up to ~ 81 â€“ 88 min and resulted in acidic particles, with both nitric acid and sulfuric acid present. Decreasing black carbon mass concentrations occurred due to dilution of the plume. Increases in the fraction of oxygenated organic carbon and the presence of dicarboxylic acids, in particular, were observed with aging. Cloud condensation nuclei measurements suggested all particles > 100 nm were active at 0. 5 % water supersaturation in the smoke plumes, confirming the relatively high hygroscopicity of the freshly emitted particles.

This multi-stage diagnosis strategy aims at successive detection of the occurrence, location and extent of the structural damage. In the first stage, a novelty detection technique based on auto-associative neural networks is proposed for damage alarming. This method needs only a series of measured natural frequencies of the structure in intact and damage states, and is inherently tolerant of measurement error and uncertainties in ambient conditions. The goal in the second stage is to identify the deck segment or section that contains damaged member(s). For this purpose, the bridge deck is partitioned into 149 segments defined by 150 sections, and normalized index vectors derived from modal curvature and modal flexibility are presented for damage localization.

40|$|The {{membrane}} electro-bioreactor (MEBR) {{has demonstrated}} {{to be effective}} in the treatment of wastewater, where superior quality of the effluent was achieved. The MEBR is a compact hybrid unit that uses several processes, such as activated sludge, membrane filtration, and electrokinetic phenomena. The objective {{of this study was to}} improve the treatment of wastewater by monitoring and controlling MEBR processes on-line, which was accomplished by implementing an automation system. As the complexity of the processes increase in the treatment wastewater, it is difficult to their guarantee performance; the automation system maintained the wastewater treatment to satisfactory performance. Automation of the system was accomplished through control algorithms using <b>on-line</b> <b>instrumentation</b> of critical parameters such as: dissolved oxygen, aeration, and water levels. The MEBR system demonstrated removal of carbon and nutrients (phosphorus, and nitrogen) for water recovery. Automated aeration ensured biological treatment without excessive aeration, fluctuating low dissolved oxygen concentrations allowed for simultaneous aerobic and anoxic conditions without inhibiting biological treatment. Automated electrokinetic improved nutrient removal with reduced energy consumption, also biological treatment was not inhibited. Electrokinetic demonstrated even lower than previously observed energy consumption. A user interface was implemented to allow on-site monitoring of the processes as well as allow adjustment of process parameters. Having a completely automated MEBR allowed this novel wastewater treatment system to be implemented in a remote location, as a decentralized system, in order to simulate an effective wastewater treatment system which may be applied to improve the quality of life for the secluded population of northern Canada and Quebec...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{nanotechnology}} lets foresee {{many opportunities}} and benefits for new materials with significantly improved properties {{as well as}} revolutionary applications in large industrial fields. Analysts have estimated {{that the size of}} the market was 900 million Euro in 2005 and will be 11 billion Euro in 2010. However, nanomaterial industries are currently encountering potential problems with hazard control in their production plants. Release of nanoparticles in air can lead to violent chemical reactions and even explosion because of their small size and energetic properties, and hence high chemical reactivity. Another major safety concern is the impact of manufacturing nanoparticles on the environment and more specifically on the health of the workers. Thus, {{there is a need to}} detect a possible release of manufactured nanoparticles in the ambient background, which can be several order of magnitude higher than the release itself, in term of number or mass concentration. The key issue was then to develop <b>on-line</b> <b>instrumentation</b> could be able to detect leaks using size resolved chemical identification. Within the European project FP 6 NANOSAFE 2, an on line monitoring method based on the coupling of the LIBS technique with a DMA (Differential Mobility Analyzer) device has been proposed as an analytical tool for workplace survey. Nanoparticle chemical identification is performed using LIBS whereas particle physical characteristics are yielded by the DMA analysis. Experiments aiming at demonstrating the potentialities of LIBS coupled with a DMA have been carried out. The LIBS signal has been also precisely studied as a function of several parameters such as laser energy or particle size and chemical composition. Moreover analytical potentialities such as repeatability, linearity and detection limit have been also investigated showing the potentiality of such instrumentation as a leak detection tool for workplace survey...|$|E
