He later {{recalled}} that {{the inspiration for the}} episode was the idea that [...] "there's a monster around that <b>only</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see—the clinical definition of madness" [...] and called the conceit [...] "scary". The title is a reference to Folie à deux, a form of insanity shared by two people. It usually begins with one person who conceives of a delusional belief and then spreads it to another; thus, those two share the same delusion.|$|E

500|$|Each playable {{character}} in the game {{has the ability to}} equip items. Weapons in the game, unlike its predecessors, are gained in levels. Some items are only found in certain stages, but is only obtainable if completing a goal. Sometimes the goal may be very simple, but some may be not that easy {{to figure out how to}} obtain the certain item. By defeating generals and lieutenants, the player's character is awarded experience scaled by the difficulty of each officer, and the amount of them defeated. This experience is allocated at the end of the level and allows the player to increase their attributes or obtain new forms. Each playable officer has 9 levels to achieve with their standard weapon, while a 10th level is accessible through special in-game requirements, and on the [...] "Hard" [...] difficulty, which is found to be frustrating like most games, the harder the difficulty the more eager you gain. Items can have a number of effects on the player such as increasing attack power, defense, and movement speed. You can also retrieve your health level to avoid getting killed and having [...] "Game Over" [...] by obtaining [...] "Chinese Meatbuns" [...] that at first, look like onions like in any other game in the so far successful Dynasty Warriors franchise. You can also obtain item boost that increase a certain skill by 2 for limited time <b>only.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> also get packs of wine and packs of Chinese Meatbuns in certain stages in certain locations during gameplay.

[...] Similarly, UGO Networks wrote that [...] "As Bartman, Bart's got some superpowers and battles comic book villains in this amazingly average side-scroller. Like {{a lot of the}} Simpsons games, there's nothing to really make it shine or distinguish itself from any other game on the racks." [...] Game Players gave the game a 44/100 rating with the rationale that [...] "it's full of frustrating jumps, and there are no passwords [...]" [...] The website MobyGames commented that [...] "most of the level sequences require precise timing and pixel-perfect jumping precision." [...] In addition, the authors of the book [...] wrote that [...] "simply put, the poor control of this game ruins {{what should have been a}} very entertaining title.
