5|$|A {{coronation}} is the act <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> or bestowal of a crown upon a monarch's head. The term generally also refers {{not only}} to the physical crowning but to the whole ceremony wherein the act of crowning occurs, along with the presentation of other items of regalia, marking the formal investiture of a monarch with regal power. Aside from the crowning, a coronation ceremony may comprise many other rituals such as the taking of special vows by the monarch, the investing and presentation of regalia to the monarch, and acts of homage by the new ruler's subjects and the performance of other ritual deeds of special significance to the particular nation. Western-style coronations have often included anointing the monarch with holy oil, or chrism as it is often called; the anointing ritual's religious significance follows examples found in the Bible. The monarch's consort may also be crowned, either simultaneously with the monarch or as a separate event.|$|E
5|$|The NHL Entry Draft {{eligibility}} requires {{players to}} have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held, excluding players older than 20 years old before December 31 of that same year, the latter not applying to non-North American players. The draft order {{is determined by the}} previous season's order of finish: non-playoff teams draft first in order <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> in the standings, followed by teams that competed in the post-season whose order is determined by the Stanley Cup playoffs results. Once the regular season is over, a weighted lottery is held for the 14 teams who miss the playoffs, giving teams the opportunity to move up to a higher pick including the first overall selection. From 1995 to 2012, a team that won the lottery could only move up a maximum of four picks, preventing some teams from winning the top selection regardless of winning the lottery. During that time, the Islanders won the lottery twice, receiving the top selection both times (2000 and 2009). The team finished last in the league standings in the 2000–01 season, but picked second in the draft after the Atlanta Thrashers won the lottery.|$|E

25|$|In his {{description}} of the genus, Thomas opined that Irenomys is most closely related to Phyllotis. The group of genera related to Phyllotis was later formalized as the tribe Phyllotini, and Irenomys was often included there, but also excluded from it by some authors. In 1995, a cladistic analysis of Phyllotini on the basis of morphology provided evidence in favor <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> of Irenomys in the group, with some support for a close relation to Andinomys. From 1999 on, DNA sequence data cast doubt on this assignment, as studies using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the nuclear IRBP gene placed Irenomys in a variety of positions, all outside Phyllotini, with Scolomys, Sigmodon, Euneomys, and various large clades of sigmodontines all as sister groups in some analyses. Accordingly, it is now classified outside Phyllotini and considered as Sigmodontinae incertae sedis.|$|E
25|$|In a tournament, most of {{the team}} points are scored for advancement. For example, a team winning a match in the {{championship}} bracket would be awarded one team advancement point; one-half of an advancement point would be awarded if a team won a match in the wrestle-back bracket. The corresponding team points also apply if a wrestler from the team gained a bye and then won his next match in that bracket. Two additional advancement points are for victories by fall, default, disqualification, and forfeit (including victories by medical forfeit). One and one-half additional advancement points are awarded for victories by technical fall with near fall points scored {{in the course of}} the match. One additional advancement point is awarded for victories by technical fall victories with no near fall points scored during the course of the match and also for victories by major decision. A team could then win a certain number <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> points if its wrestlers have placed individually in the championship and wrestle-back brackets. Thus, whole teams are awarded placements (first, second, etc.) based on their total number of victories.|$|E
