Meanwhile, Jacinda finds Lucy at the wishing well in the community garden, who tells her that she found Henry, despite her mother's skepticism. Jacinda then returns the laptop back to Henry, and the two are encouraged by Roni to share a drink. However, Victoria shows up, ready to buy out Roni's bar and to deal with Jacinda, telling her that she'll be taking full custody of Lucy. Henry attempts to defuse the tension between the three, but is warned by Victoria to stay out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>business.</b> Afterwards, Lucy meets him at the garden, and attempts to convince him about the curse, only for Henry to reveal that his wife and child perished in a fire years ago. Finding that his car has been stolen, Henry goes to the nearby police station, and reports it missing to a cursed Killian Jones, who now lives as Officer Rogers with no memories of his past life. In another part of town, Tilly enters an abandoned warehouse to find her boss, Rumpelstiltskin, now living under the cursed identity of Detective Weaver, and informs him of Henry's arrival.|$|E
25|$|A retired Chicago {{police officer}} named Bill Dorsch has stated he {{has reason to}} believe {{there may be more}} victims buried within the grounds of the {{apartment}} building located at the 6100 block of West Miami Avenue in Chicago; a property which Gacy is known to have been the caretaker of for several years prior to his 1978 arrest. In 1975, Dorsch—then a Chicago police officer—observed Gacy (whom he knew on a casual basis), holding a shovel {{in the early hours of}} the morning. When confronted by Dorsch as to his actions, Gacy stated he was performing work that he was too busy to do during the day. Dorsch has also related that several other residents of West Miami Avenue have stated that, in the early- to mid-1970s, they had observed Gacy digging trenches in the grounds of the property; one of these residents has also stated that Gacy would later place plants in the elongated trenches he had dug. At the time these actions had been observed, Gacy had still been married to Carole Hoff. Following his first murder in January 1972, he is not known to have buried any murder victims beneath his own home until one month after his March, 1976 divorce. (John Butkovitch had been buried beneath his garage and the unknown victim known as Body 28 had been buried in his backyard.) Gacy's wife had informed investigators that, on several occasions in the years preceding their divorce, she had found several men's wallets and identification cards discarded about the property at 8213 Summerdale. When she had confronted Gacy about these items, he had angrily informed her the property was none <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} {{of a public}} authority is subject to judicial review if the authority took into account irrelevant considerations in arriving at its decision. This is demonstrated by Tan Gek Neo Jessie v. Minister for Finance (1991). In this case, the Registrar of Businesses wrote to the applicant to direct her to change the name <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>business,</b> [...] "JC Penney Collections", to one which {{did not use the}} name [...] "JC Penney". At the time, there were two trade marks registered with the Registry of Trade Marks in Singapore under the name [...] "Penneys". The proprietor of both trade marks was JC Penney Company Inc., a company incorporated in the United States. These trade marks had not been used in Singapore by the American corporation. The applicant appealed to the Minister for Finance against the {{decision of}} the Registrar, but the appeal was dismissed. The applicant subsequently applied for an order of certiorari (now referred to as a quashing order) to nullify the decisions of the Registrar and the Minister.|$|E

500|$|On March 13, Saldívar went to {{her lawyer}} and wrote her resignation, which Quintanilla, Jr. {{believed}} was her alibi. The same day, Saldívar drove to Corpus Christi and checked into the Sand and Sea Motel. Selena was in Miami, Florida, at the time. Quintanilla, Jr. believed {{this would have been}} the first attempt to kill Selena. When Selena arrived in Corpus Christi on March 14, Saldívar contacted her to schedule a meeting. Saldívar told Selena there was too much traffic and asked her to meet her at a parking lot twenty-five miles (40 km) away from Corpus Christi. Upon arriving, Selena told Saldívar she could remain in charge <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>business</b> affairs in Mexico. According to Quintanilla, Jr. Selena wanted to continue employing Saldívar until she could find a replacement. Saldívar showed Selena the gun she had bought; Selena told her to [...] "get rid of it" [...] and said she would protect Saldívar from her father, according to Saldívar and Pérez. This, Quintanilla, Jr. believed, had calmed Saldívar and was the reason she did not kill Selena in the parking lot. The next day, Saldívar returned the gun to the shop saying her father had given her a [...]22-caliber pistol. On March 26, Saldívar stole a perfume sample and more bank statements from Selena in Mexico.|$|E

Local media were alerted, and after being exposed as Escobar's widow, Henao was imprisoned for eighteen months while her finances were investigated. Ultimately, authorities {{were unable to}} link her funds to illegal activity, and she was released. According to her son, Henao {{fell in love with}} Escobar [...] "because of his naughty smile [...] the way he looked at [...] [...] was affectionate and sweet. A great lover. I fell in love with his desire to help people and his compassion for their hardship. We [...] drive to places where he dreamed of building schools for the poor.

2500|$|A {{change of}} command in 1952, however, contributed to Barnes {{getting into a}} {{conflict}} with the United States Air Force. [...] The Air Force was planning {{for the future of}} aviation, and decided it needed to build a new, super-long runway to accommodate new aircraft that were being planned to run on atomic power. [...] That new runway would run directly across her ranch. [...] The Air Force originally offered her a price for her ranch, land, and facilities that was very close to the cost of undeveloped desert land. She requested a fair appraisal to better reflect the actual cost of replacement of her land and business, but in the midst of getting a re-appraisal, the base leadership accused her of running a house of ill-repute on her ranch. The effect of even the hint of impropriety resulted in her ranch and business being put off-limits to military personnel, and the value <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>business</b> plummeted.|$|E

2500|$|Mosley {{moved her}} {{business}} to a rented shop on Lombard Street in 1729 and in 1736 {{was able to}} purchase her own property on nearby Gracechurch Street. She lived and worked at this location with her apprentices {{for at least a}} decade. This area of London around Lombard and Gracechurch Streets was the principal market area of the city and home to wealthy merchants such as goldsmiths, mercers, apothecaries, and bankers. [...] In 1732, Mosley took on her third apprentice, Mary Newton, the daughter of a London goldsmith. Eleanor's first two apprentices completed their apprenticeships in 1734 and she then took on her fourth apprentice that same year. She took on two apprentices in 1738 and her seventh, and final, registered apprentice in 1739. Eleanor apparently was the sole proprietor <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>business,</b> as no other names were recorded on the tax roles as business partner or co-owner. In addition to her apprentices, Eleanor probably had domestic servants to run her household and possibly other shop assistants.|$|E
2500|$|This legal {{principle}} has {{not been}} examined extensively in Singapore {{but it can be}} regarded to have been applied in Tan Gek Neo Jessie v. Minister for Finance (1991). The plaintiff was told by the Registrar of Businesses to change the name <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>business</b> [...] "J. C. Penney Collections" [...] to one which did not resemble the name [...] "J. C. Penney". This was because the Registry of Trade Marks already had two trademarks registered with it with the name [...] "Penneys" [...] at that time. The proprietor of both the trademarks was J. C. Penney Company Inc., an American corporation. The Minister for Finance and the Registrar alleged that the plaintiff had used this business name to ride on the reputation of the American corporation by misleading Singaporeans into thinking that her business was associated with the American corporation. Both administrative bodies held that the mere resemblance of the names was proof of this. This was eventually held to be an irrelevant consideration as neither of the trademarks had been used by the American corporation to identify retail services in Singapore. Thus, it had no business reputation in Singapore in relation to the name [...] "J. C. Penney". Furthermore, there was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiff, at the time of registering her business, was aware of the existence of the two registered trademarks. In arriving at the decisions to order the plaintiff to change her business name and to dismiss her appeal against that order, the Registrar and the Minister had respectively taken into account an irrelevant consideration. Ultimately, the court made an order of certiorari (now known as a quashing order) to quash both decisions.|$|E
