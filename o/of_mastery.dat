The two are sent to awaken several worlds submerged in sleep after the defeat of Ansem, but once the task is complete, Sora's heart is damaged by Xemnas, whose companions plan to turn him into a vessel for Xehanort's heart. Riku and his friends save Sora and {{bring him back to}} Yen Sid's tower, where Riku dives into Sora's body and repairs his heart, awakening him from his coma. As Yen Sid promotes Riku as a Keyblade Master, Sora congratulates him and continues to train elsewhere. In the ending of Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage for Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, Yen Sid reveals Sora lost most of his powers when Xehanort tried to take over his body. After advising Sora to seek out one who already went through a similar experience, Sora, Donald, and Goofy go to Olympus Coliseum.|$|E

Shortly after the test, Xehanort disappears and a horde of mysterious creatures called the Unversed begin to appear throughout the worlds {{in pursuit of the}} Princesses of Heart. Learning about these developments from Yen Sid, Master Eraqus sends Terra and Aqua to destroy the Unversed and find Xehanort throughout the countless worlds. Later, Xehanort's apprentice Vanitas convinces Ventus to follow Terra against Eraqus' wishes, while Eraqus orders Aqua to watch over Terra and bring Ventus back to the Land of Departure.|$|E

5|$|In 265/4 BC, Areus {{once again}} tried {{to cross the}} Isthmus of Corinth and aid the beleaguered Athenians, but the Macedonian king Antigonus II Gonatas {{concentrated}} his forces against him and defeated the Spartans, with Areus himself among the dead. Despite the presence of Patroclus and his fleet, it appears that Ptolemy II hesitated to fully commit himself to the conflict. The reasons for this reluctance are unclear, but it appears that, especially {{in the last years}} of the war, Ptolemaic involvement was limited to financial support for the Greek city-states and naval assistance. The end of Ptolemaic involvement may be related to the Battle of Cos, whose chronology is much disputed by modern scholars. Almost nothing is known about the events of the battle, except that Antigonus II Gonatas, although outnumbered, led his fleet to defeat Ptolemy's unnamed commanders. A surviving anecdote where Patroclus taunted the Macedonian king for his lack <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> over the sea has been interpreted by some scholars, such as Hans Hauben, as indicating that Cos belongs to the Chremonidean War and was fought around 262/1 BC, with Patroclus in command of the Ptolemaic fleet. Others, however, place the battle around 255 BC, at the time of the Second Syrian War. Whatever the actual events, it is clear that Cos marked the end of absolute Ptolemaic thalassocracy in the Aegean.|$|E

The game debuted {{at the top of}} Media Create's sales charts, selling 213,579 copies during its first week. The release was also noted to have helped boost the sales of the Nintendo 3DS console. Although the amount of pre-orders surpassed that of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days for the Nintendo DS, the first week's sales were lower. Nevertheless, Media Create noted that this was due to the {{comparison}} between the amount of units sold between the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo 3DS during the time the games were released, with the former having sold more copies than the latter. The game continued to appear in Media Create's polls for the next several weeks, selling a total of 311,688 units as of May 2012.

40|$|In {{analyzing}} the philosophical {{roots of the}} precautionary principle, the article proposes that one can find two such fundamental ideas in the Responsibility Principle of Hans Jonas: first, the idea <b>of</b> a <b>mastery</b> (ethical) <b>of</b> our <b>mastery</b> (technical) <b>of</b> nature, second, the threat of catastrophe and {{the adoption of the}} worst-case scenario. But these ideas were adopted separately and were deeply transformed.

Those involving play have central themes <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> (of nature or each other), risk and adventure: fishing, camping, playing sports or socializing in bars. There is usually an element of danger and a focus on movement and speed (watching fast cars or driving fast).

25|$|In {{the context}} of {{producing}} objects e.g. baskets, mats, or quilts, there was a belief that a child must produce a perfect end-product {{before moving on to}} learn the skills of producing something else. Perfection in these products was judged by more experienced craftspeople and was attained by repeated attempts interspersed with feedback. The perfected final products were kept as a special reminder and never used.

25|$|Instructional design, the {{systematic}} design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a taxonomy of educational objectives created by Benjamin Bloom and colleagues. Bloom also researched mastery learning, an instructional strategy in which learners only advance {{to a new}} learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom discovered that a combination <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction. Gagné, another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of task analysis in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives connected by prerequisite relationships.|$|E
25|$|Only limited artefactual {{evidence}} survives of {{the users}} of Acheulean tools {{other than the}} stone tools themselves. Cave sites were exploited for habitation, but the hunter-gatherers of the Palaeolithic also possibly built shelters such as those identified in connection with Acheulean tools at Grotte du Lazaret and Terra Amata near Nice in France.

25|$|Masturbation among {{adolescents}} contributes to them developing a sense <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> over sexual impulses, {{and it has}} a role in the physical and emotional development of prepubescents and pubescents. Babies and toddlers will play with their genitals {{in much the same way}} as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection, or the child may be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or indeed understimulated and bored. Alongside many other factors, such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play or aggression, and precocious or seductive behavior, excessive masturbation may alternatively be an indicator of sexual abuse.|$|E

Sagawa ran only a single dojo and taught {{a relatively small number of}} students. He began studying Daitō-ryū under Takeda Sokaku in 1914 after first learning the art from his father, Sagawa Nenokichi (1867–1950), who was also a student of Sokaku and a holder of a Kyōju Dairi (teaching license) in the system. Although considered by many to be one of the most accomplished students of Sokaku, Yukiyoshi Sagawa received the kyoju dairi in 1932—but did not receive the menkyo kaiden (certificate <b>of</b> <b>mastery)</b> of the system's secrets, as during the time he practised under Takeda Sokaku, the highest licence was not the menkyo kaiden. Sagawa often served as a teaching assistant to Takeda and traveled with him to various locations in Japan teaching Daito-ryu. He further developed the art of applying Aiki and is said to have remained powerful until very late in life, and– as a consequence of the success of Transparent Power– was featured in a series of articles in the Aiki News magazines prior to his death in 1998.|$|E
