After his father's death, though Brooke desires {{to return to}} the <b>Orchard,</b> Brooke is forced to stay at the school where his father worked as headmaster, {{retaining}} the post {{until the end of the}} school year. After a brief period, Brooke returns to The <b>Orchard.</b> Meanwhile, Nell's sister Betty becomes a maid at The <b>Orchard</b> and another of Nell's sisters has a still birth. Brooke continues to become closer to Nell, and they covertly go swimming together in Byron's pond, a local swimming hole named after the poet Lord Byron. Afterwards, Brooke departs on a tour advocating for workers' rights, which does not go very well. At the end of the tour, Brooke proposes to Noel Oliver, one of the wealthy girls whom Brooke had been courting during his stay at The <b>Orchard.</b> Upon his return to Grantchester, Brooke also finds himself expelled from The <b>Orchard</b> because of his wanton social life. Brooke then moves next door to another boarding house, the Old Vicarage.|$|E

40|$|Apple <b>orchards</b> are agro-ecosystems managed {{with high}} levels of inputs and {{especially}} pesticides. Epigeal spider communities were sampled in three seasons using pitfall traps in 19 apple <b>orchards</b> with four different management strategies (abandoned, under organic, Integrated Pest Management or conventional protection) and thus significantly different pesticide usage. The abundance and diversity of the spider communities was the highest in abandoned <b>orchards.</b> Higher diversity and evenness values were the only difference in spider communities from the organic <b>orchards</b> compared to the other commercial <b>orchards.</b> The analysis of five ecological traits (proportion of aeronauts, type of diet, overwintering stages, body size and maternal care), however, clearly showed differences in the spiders from the organic <b>orchards.</b> The spider species in the other commercial <b>orchards</b> were smaller and showed higher dispersal abilities.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} abandonment of sylvo-pastoral practices in chestnut <b>orchards</b> (Castanea sativa) on bats in southern Switzerland to determine practical recommendations for bat conservation. We compared bat species richness and foraging activities between traditionally managed and unmanaged chestnut <b>orchards,</b> testing the hypothesis that managed <b>orchards</b> provide better foraging opportunities and harbour more bat species. Echolocation calls of foraging bats were sampled simultaneously at paired sites of managed and unmanaged <b>orchards</b> using custom made recorders. Vegetation structure and aerial insect availability were sampled at the recording sites and used as explanatory variables in the model. In a paired sampling design, we found {{twice the number of}} bat species (12) and five times higher total foraging activity in the managed chestnut <b>orchards</b> compared to the unmanaged ones. Bat species with low flight manoeuvrability were 14 times more common in managed <b>orchards,</b> whereas bats with medium to high manoeuvrability were only 5 times more common than in abandoned <b>orchards.</b> The vegetation structure was less dense in managed <b>orchards.</b> However, management did not affect relative insect abundance. Bats primarily visited the most open <b>orchards,</b> free of undergrowth. As a result of restricted access into the overgrown forests, the abandonment of chestnut <b>orchards</b> leads to a decline in bat species richness and foraging activities. Continued management of chestnut <b>orchards</b> to maintain an open structure is important for the conservation of endangered bat species in the southern Swiss Alps...|$|R
40|$|Fruit flies {{are major}} pest in West Africa. In Côte-d’Ivoire, they caused heavy losses. Thus, {{preventive}} measures {{are taken to}} reduce their damage.

Three <b>orchards</b> were treated with Success Appat® and three with Proteus 170 O-TEQ, respectively and their untreated <b>orchards</b> were selected.
