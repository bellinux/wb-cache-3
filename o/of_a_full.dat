5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{establish}} the exact date of Good Friday by assuming that the darkness described at Jesus's crucifixion was a solar eclipse.

Further, the darkness lasted from the sixth hour to the ninth, or three hours, which is much, much longer than the eight-minute upper limit for any solar eclipse's totality. In the Western hemisphere, there are few reliable records of eclipses before 800 AD, until the advent of Arab and monastic observations in the early medieval period. The first recorded observation of the corona was made in Constantinople in 968 AD.|$|E
