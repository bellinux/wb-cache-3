500|$|Despite his {{thorough}} contrapuntal {{training in}} London and Leipzig, {{as well as}} his experience as a church organist, Sullivan rarely composed fugues. Hughes cites examples from the Epilogue to The Golden Legend and Victoria and Merrie England. In the Savoy operas, fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in Trial by Jury and Iolanthe (e.g., the Lord Chancellor's leitmotif in the latter). Less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as [...] "Brightly Dawns <b>our</b> <b>Wedding</b> Day" [...] (The Mikado) and [...] "When the Buds are Blossoming" [...] (Ruddigore).|$|E

500|$|He added, [...] "A British {{soldier was}} {{cut into pieces}} [...] broad {{daylight}} in London or near London. Will [...] British government ever, instead of putting that guy to justice, {{put him in a}} five-star hotel and say, 'Brother, what made you do this? Can we accommodate your grievances?' [...] That is what the West is expecting [...] us - to bring the killers of our brothers, to bring those who cut the noses of the Afghan women, to bring those who do suicide bombings in <b>our</b> <b>wedding</b> parties, to put them {{on the other side of}} the table and say, 'Brother, you represent our religion and I have lost my direction.

Our lives have not been all sunshine, but Zulime has met all storms with a brave sweetness, which I cannot overpraise. If she has regrets, she does not permit me to know them. My poverty--which persists--has not embittered her or caused her, so far as I know, a single mood of self-commiseration.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. It's {{been very}} {{different}} from <b>our</b> first <b>wedding</b> journey in that. It isn't that we're not so young now as we were, but that we don't seem so much our own property. We {{used to be the}} sole proprietors, and now we seem to be mere tenants at will, and any interloping lover may come in and set our dearest interests on the sidewalk. The disadvantage of living along is that we get too much into the hands of other people." ...|$|R

With him, he said, it had not only been a duty but a pleasure, and as he had given to <b>our</b> brief <b>wedding</b> just the right touch of dignity, we were grateful to him.

We describe the process of model abstraction for the shape space spanned by these shapes, arguing that the same is possible for other shape design spaces as well...|$|R
40|$|Family law is {{intrinsically}} provocative because it governs a fundamentally {{important aspect of}} human life. Unlike fields such as securities or evidence, family law exerts a direct and profound effect upon our most deeply cherished relationships. It becomes most relevant at the happiest moments of <b>our</b> lives- <b>weddings</b> and births-and the saddest-divorces and deaths. Many of the disputes at the unsettled frontiers of this field where the law is rapidly evolving touch something deep within us and frequently evoke passionate, if not visceral, reactions.

60|$|After all, however, {{theirs was}} not to be <b>our</b> first <b>wedding.</b> I have said little of Emily. The fact was, that after that week of Clarence's danger, we said she lived in a kind of dream. She {{fulfilled}} all that was wanted of her, nursing Clarence, waiting on me, ordering dinner, making the tea, and so forth; but it was quite evident that life began for her on the Saturdays, when Lawrence came down, and ended on the Mondays, when he went away. If, in the meantime, she sat down to work, she went off into a trance; if she was sent out for fresh air, she walked quarter-deck on the esplanade, neither seeing nor hearing anything, we averred, but some imaginary Lawrence Frith.|$|R
