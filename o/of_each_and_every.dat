5|$|Until the 1906–07 season, {{the players}} were not paid to play hockey, as the team was abiding by the {{principles}} of amateur sports. Ottawa HC had an advantage in attracting top players to its squad. The players could work for the government, and the work allowed the players {{to play for the}} team. Meanwhile, in the United States, the International Hockey League was paying players. In response to this, the ECAHA, while still having several purely amateur teams, started to allow professional players. The top teams could therefore compete for the top players and the gate attractions that they were. The only restriction was that the status <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>and</b> <b>every</b> player had to be publicized.|$|E

The Greek-Jaffa citron was also promoted {{by most of the}} Sephardic and even some Ashkenazic rabbis, who saw a great future in the beautiful and pitamed variety.

25|$|The {{layers of}} the {{protocol}} suite near the top are logically closer to the user application, while those near the bottom are logically closer to the physical transmission of the data. Viewing layers as providing or consuming a service is a method of abstraction to isolate upper layer protocols from the details of transmitting bits over, for example, Ethernet and collision detection, while the lower layers avoid having to know the details <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>and</b> <b>every</b> application and its protocol.|$|E
25|$|A more {{stringent}} test would involve following the chemical shifts <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>and</b> <b>every</b> atom in the molecule by {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) {{as a function of}} temperature/denaturant. Though time-consuming, this method does not require any specific model for the interpretation of data. The Tms for all the atoms should be identical within experimental error if the protein folds in a two-state manner. But for a protein that folds globally downhill the unfolding curves should have widely different Tms. The atomic unfolding behavior of BBL was found to follow the latter, showing a large spread in the Tms consistent with global downhill behavior. The Tms of some atoms were found to be {{similar to that of the}} global Tm (obtained from a low-resolution technique like CD or fluorescence), indicating that the unfolding of multiple atoms has to be followed, instead of a few as is frequently done in such experiments. The average atomic unfolding behavior was strikingly similar to that of CD, underlining the fact that unfolding curves of low resolution experiments are highly simplified representations of a more complex behavior.|$|E

He argued that there was a [...] "need for more hesitation in the granting of this charter of liberty to each and every applicant without a more thorough search <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>and</b> <b>every</b> applicant’s capacity to benefit from such a gift."

500|$|When Madonna {{started working}} on her ninth studio album, the {{cultural}} mood of America was bleak and that of paranoia after the September 11 attacks. There was discontent and fear all around as the terrorism and hatred took people by surprise, as they started questioning the feasibility of the American Dream. While developing the songs for American Life with producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Madonna interrogated and pondered upon those values. The confusion, disorientation and the anger they created seeped into the making <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>and</b> <b>every</b> song, including [...] "Hollywood". She later spoke about Ahmadzaï's downbeat existentialism and the long discussions they had about this, and society's obsession with fame and fortune.
