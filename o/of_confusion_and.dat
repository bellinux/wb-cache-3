5|$|One of {{the main}} sources <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> {{ambiguity}} in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|The {{name of the}} warship {{that served}} the Confederacy in the Battle of Hampton Roads has been a {{continuing}} source <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> some contention. She was originally a screw frigate in the United States Navy carrying the name USS Merrimack. All parties continued to use the name after her capture by secessionists while she was being rebuilt as an ironclad. When her conversion was almost complete, her name was officially changed to Virginia. Despite the official name change, Union accounts persisted in calling Merrimack by her original name, while Confederate sources used either Virginia or Merrimac(k). The alliteration of Monitor and Merrimack has persuaded most popular accounts to adopt the familiar name, {{even when it is}} acknowledged to be technically incorrect.|$|E
5|$|Guðrøðr was {{a son of}} Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles (died 1265), {{a member}} of the Crovan dynasty. Guðrøðr's father came to power in 1252, {{following}} a period <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> contention in the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, when Magnús' right to rule was acknowledged by Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1263), his nominal overlord. In the previous decade, Alexander II, King of Scotland (died 1249) had made several attempts to incorporate the Hebrides into the Scottish realm. In the 1260s, Alexander's son and successor, Alexander III, King of Scotland (died 1286), renewed his kingdom's struggle to wrest the region from Norwegian overlordship. In so doing, Alexander III provoked a retaliatory military response from Hákon, a campaign that ultimately ended in failure with the latter's weakening health and death in 1263.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling the trench, Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against the Spartan lines. Mounted on his horse, the Epiriote King was able to force his away through the trench, over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} his companions. The sudden onslaught of Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst the defenders of this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw his companions into a state <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> enabled the Spartans to rally. The Spartans launched a barrage of missiles at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{sudden death}} of George Terter II had been {{followed}} by a brief period <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> uncertainty, which was exploited by the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. The Byzantines overran northeastern Thrace and captured {{a number of important}} cities including Yambol, Lardea, Ktenia, Rusokastro, Anchialus, Sozopol and Agatopol. At the same time, a Byzantine-sponsored pretender, Voysil, brother of the former Bulgarian emperor Smilets (r. 1292-1298), ensconced himself in Krăn, controlling the valleys between the Balkan mountains and Sredna Gora from Sliven to Kopsis. At this point the newly elected Michael Shishman marched south against Andronikos III, while another Byzantine army led by Andronikos III himself was besieging Philippopolis (Plovdiv). Defended by a Bulgarian garrison led by Ivan the Russian, the siege was a failure despite the Byzantines use of a 100-soldier, five-story siege tower. While the Byzantine army was engaged at Philipopolis, Michael Shishman led his troops to north-eastern Thrace and quickly retook the lost cities thus forcing the Byzantines to pull back.|$|E

25|$|A dive sector {{should be}} at a {{constant}} depth, or an average depth can be estimated. This is used to get the sector ambient pressure (Psector). The duration of the sector (Tsector) and RMV of the diver for the sector (RMVsector) must also be estimated. If the sector gas volume requirements (Vsector) are all calculated at surface pressure, they can later be added directly. This reduces the risk <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> error.|$|E
25|$|The risk {{of being}} {{left behind by the}} boat can be {{controlled}} by logging divers {{into and out of the}} water. If this is done by each diver only for themselves, there is little chance <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> error. In other protocols the skipper or divemaster is responsible for ensuring there is a name-list of all divers on board before leaving the shore, and that everyone on the list is back on the boat before leaving the dive site.|$|E

25|$|The {{lingering}} {{symptoms of}} neuropathy associated with cerebral beriberi {{are known as}} Korsakoff's syndrome, or the chronic phase of Wernicke-Korsakoff's. Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder resulting from a deficiency in thiamine, sharing the same predominant features of cerebral beriberi, as characterized by ocular abnormalities, ataxia of gait, a global state <b>of</b> <b>confusion,</b> <b>and</b> neuropathy. The state of confusion associated with Wernicke's may consist of apathy, inattention, spatial disorientation, inability to concentrate, and mental sluggishness or restlessness. Clinical diagnosis of Wernicke's disease cannot be made without evidence of ocular disturbance, yet these criteria may be too rigid. Korsakoff's likely represents {{a variation in the}} clinical manifestation of Wernicke encephalophathy, as they both share similar pathological origin.|$|E

The character came to Pine Valley in 2002 after Frankie's death, and dated Bianca Montgomery while investigating her sister's demise. The series portrayed Bianca as having {{fallen in love}} with Maggie, with Maggie initially maintaining that she is only interested in men. The series featured her dating several men, taking a few of them to bed, sometimes out <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> other times out of a clear attempt to dispel her growing romantic attraction to Bianca. The two eventually become lovers, though heartbreak follows.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Atlanta trailed 17–6. Facing 3rd & 8 at their own 19-yard line, an unusual play occurred. Matt Ryan {{completed}} a 20-yard pass to Roddy White. White fumbled, and it was recovered by Sabby Piscitelli of the Buccaneers. Piscitelli then ran 3 yards and attempted a lateral to Cato June. The lateral was actually an illegal forward pass, and fell incomplete to the ground. Thought to be a live ball, it was recovered once more by Atlanta, meanwhile a flag for a personal foul by Tampa Bay was also on the field. After several minutes <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> discussion by the officials, they awarded the ball to Atlanta at the Tampa Bay 48-yard line.

They also claimed that Nana Sahib's camp had previously arranged for the rebels to fire upon and kill all the British. Although the East India Company later accused Nana Sahib of the betrayal and murder of innocent people, no evidence has ever been found to prove that Nana Sahib had pre-planned or ordered the massacre. Some historians believe that the Satichaura Ghat massacre was the result <b>of</b> <b>confusion,</b> <b>and</b> not of any plan implemented by Nana Sahib and his associates.

25|$|Student demonstrators, taking {{advantage}} of the loosening political atmosphere, reacted to a variety of causes of discontent. The diverse demands of protesters included greater economic liberalization, political democracy, media freedom, freedom of speech and association, rule of law, and to have the legitimacy of the movement recognized. Some protest leaders spoke against official corruption and speculation, price stability, social security, and the democratic means to supervise the reform process. Ironically, some of the original invective was also directed against Zhao. Party hardliners increasingly {{came to the conclusion that}} the demonstrations were due to Zhao's rapid pace of reform, which they believed caused a sense <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> frustration among college students.

25|$|In {{creating}} Hamlet, Shakespeare broke several rules, one of {{the largest}} being the rule of action over character. In his day, plays were usually expected to follow the advice of Aristotle in his Poetics, which declared that a drama should not focus on character so much as action. The highlights of Hamlet, however, are not the action scenes, but the soliloquies, wherein Hamlet reveals his motives and thoughts to the audience. Also, unlike Shakespeare's other plays, there is no strong subplot; all plot forks are directly connected to the main vein of Hamlet struggling to gain revenge. The play is full of seeming discontinuities and irregularities of action. At one point, Hamlet is resolved to kill Claudius: in the next scene, he is suddenly tame. Scholars still debate whether these odd plot turns are mistakes or intentional additions to add to the play's theme <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> duality.|$|E
