Its predecessor, the more radical right of centre, economic liberal, Action démocratique du Québec, or ADQ, of Mario Dumont took a similar stance after abandoning Quebec sovereignty.|$|E

However, many current requirements for video bandwidth compression, such as Remotely Piloted Vehicle and "smart" ordnance video links, include dynamic (moving) scenery and severe channel noise. The image degradation effects of the bandwidth compression technique will then fall into three categories: Degradation of a static image; effects due to any frame segmenting and partial frame transmission used; and the impact of uncorrected channel errors. In this environment, the more powerful, but also more complex techniques, i. e., the various transform techniques, may provide less acceptable imagery than simple techniques (such as DPCM <b>or</b> Lockheed's <b>CAQ</b> algorithm) since their complexity may require frame slicing, i. e., the compression and transmission of only a segment of a frame during each frame period. Also, the one-dimensional techniques often prove more effective than twodimensional techniques because the vertical redundancy they retain can be used to eliminate uncorrected errors. The MSE criterion for image quality, known to be crude and often misleading in static images, is totally inadequate to quantify the impact of scene dynamics and uncorrected channel errors...|$|R
