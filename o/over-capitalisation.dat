The high cost of fuel for the smelters, a lack of ore, increasing wages, low metal prices and <b>over-capitalisation</b> on railways and smelters all contributed to the closure of the Chillagoe smelters. The Company asked for a government loan in February 1914 and when this was refused the company shut down its smelting and ore-buying operations.

The results we obtain show that, within the European institutional framework, the prospects of obtaining yields suited to the investment made increase. The coincidence of countries which practise a policy of protectionism and low profitability fleets should be reflected on in the light of the present Common Fisheries Policy reform procedure.

The main results of this paper are, first of all, that the Cobb-Douglas production function provides, overall, a satisfactory description of the production decisions of the firm, showing constant returns to scale in 83 % of the case. Secondly, 11 out of the 13 Student-t tests reject the hypothesis that the firm was minimizing its costs. In all cases, the results indicate that the bias favored the production factor (K). Finally, the most dramatic variations in the results come from the use of segmented periods.

40|$|Managing marine {{fisheries}} using output {{controls in}} the form of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) can be an attractive alternative to more traditional input controls. There are now a number of examples of where ITQ-managed fisheries have been able to reduce the impact of the major management problems in global fisheries, namely, gross <b>over-capitalisation</b> and effort. However, ITQs are not the perfect management tool and one of the lesser known consequences of ITQ-managed fisheries where ITQs consist of a harvest right is the implicit relationship between ITQ property rights and rights of access to the fishing grounds. This implicit spatial right to the grounds can provide obstacles in the way of allocating water-space within fishing grounds for alternative uses such as marine-protected areas, large-scale aquaculture, and wind farms. These lesser-known consequences of ITQ-managed fisheries are discussed here. ITQ New Zealand Fisheries management...|$|E
40|$|Although {{fisheries}} management {{is a complex}} task, many {{countries in the world}} have managed to develop {{fisheries management}} regimes that can improve the economic efficiency of the fisheries. Property rights-based fisheries management regimes have shown promising results in the management of fisheries resources since they reduce or eliminate the incentives for <b>over-capitalisation</b> in harvesting of the fisheries resources and thus contribute to economic efficiency. Community-based cooperative fisheries management is one of the property rightsbased fisheries management systems, which has received attention in recent years particularly in the developing countries. In Tanzania, community-based cooperative fisheries management seems a feasible option because the current system is entirely based on common property and an open access approach. This approach has led to increased fishing effort, encouraged excessive fishing investment and thus, declining catch trends. A community-based cooperative fisheries management has proposed for Lake Victoria fisheries i...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Individual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) {{have long}} been proposed {{as a way of}} increasing the profitability of fisheries by introducing a rights based, tradeable permit system that fosters stewardship of the resource, breaking the cycle of <b>over-capitalisation</b> and over-exploitation. Under ITQs, fishers receive a share of total allowable catch (TAC) and are free to use it or sell it. In this paper we develop a model to simulate trading of fisheries quota in an ITQ market. We build on a multi-species population and vessel dynamics model developed for common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus) and red throat emperor (Lethrinus miniatus) in the Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery (CRFFF), a $AU 50 million fishery operating on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, where an ITQ fisheries management system has been operating since 2004. The model considers initial quota allocation to vessels, seasonal fish prices and individual variable costs, fishing efficiency and experience., Vessel operators can either purchase or sell quota of either species, if it was in their interest to do so to maximise profit. This depends on the cost each vessel incurs per day fishing, seasonal fish prices and historical catch rates experienced by the vessel operator, which in turn depends on the catchable biomass of the species and the vesselâ€™s own fishing efficiency.

40|$|Research PaperFisheries {{exploited}} under open-access conditions create externalities, {{resulting in}} a range of problems associated with <b>over-capitalisation</b> and stock depletion. One answer to this is to shift the mode of production away from hunting and towards husbandry, an approach which becomes feasible where some control can be exercised over the resource and the harvesting pressure to which it is subject. Physical structures in the form of artificial reefs make such control a practical possibility, but the way these might be managed so as to support a sustainable fishery is by no means obvious. To investigate this further, the views of commercial fishermen who use the artificial reefs in the Algarve region of Portugal were canvassed and their opinions sought specifically on the prospects for co-management. In general, it was found that {{for each of the three}} different geographical areas where the ARs were deployed, there were different views on the establishment of management measures. The reasons for this may be related to the fact that each skipper had different incentives, once they were subjected to different fishing conditions (e. g. target species, fishing area and hauls, gear, vessel, crew, etc). Different fishing incentives reflect no consensual agreements in terms of possible management measures to adopt. However, a trade-off solution could be obtained for both area closure and users, and the use of scientific expertise consultancy (e. g. weight-length studies for the target species found in each reef area) could help managers in the establishment of an adequate measure to be adopted for the season closure option...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) {{are increasingly}} {{seen as a}} way to make fisheries more profitable and halt <b>over-capitalisation.</b> ITQs allocate to users of a resource a share of a total allowable catch (TAC) which they are free to use, lease, or sell. We outline an approach to modelling the effect of an ITQ system in a multi-species, multi-sector fishery and apply it to the Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery (CRFFF) in Queensland, Australia. An ITQ model, {{based on the assumption that}} operators seek to maximize profits, simulates the use of tradeable quota units by operators in the fishery, taking account of the initial quota allocation to operators, seasonal fish prices and individual operator variable costs, their fishing efficiency and experience, and constraints on vessel movements. Rationalization of the fishery is predicted to occur under an ITQ system for the CRFFF, which will lead to reductions in effort, increases in profits, and changes over time in quota prices. The ecological consequences of transferable quota in the multi-species fishery are seen in the catch and discard levels of the less profitable species, even though a TAC was set. This had flow-on effects on biomass. For example, simulations showed that the TAC for the primary target species, coral trout, was used more fully than that for a less valuable target species, red throat emperor, and that this was achieved through increased discarding of red throat emperor. Catches of both coral trout and red throat emperor that were derived from the model were higher than those recently observed in the fishery. The effort predicted by the model, however, closely approximated the actual effort observed in the fishery following implementation of ITQ management...|$|E

Results show projected fishing effort trajectories under a range of TAC levels for coral trout and red throat emperor. Results also show the profitability of the fishery under a range of management options. In general, as the TAC for the primary targeted species, coral trout, increased, so too did the effort. Fishing effort under the current TAC arrangement decreased, mimicking the actual effort level since 2004. Effort dynamics were also more sensitive to the coral trout TAC, the more valuable primary target species, compared to the TAC of the less valuable red throat emperor. Discarding of red throat emperor was also high when the ratio of coral trout TAC to red throat emperor TAC was high. The results help managers in understanding the implications of their quota-related decisions, illustrate what might be expected with trading in a multi-species quota system and indicate what to expect in the CRFFF as that multi-species ITQ system matures...|$|E
