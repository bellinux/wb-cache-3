50|$|A more {{complete}} treatment of Atkinson's Theorem {{is in the}} reference by Arveson: it shows that if B is a Banach space, an operator is Fredholm iff it is invertible modulo a finite rank operator (and that the latter is equivalent to being invertible modulo a compact operator, which is significant in view of Enflo's example of a separable, reflexive Banach space with compact operators that are not norm-limits of finite rank operators). For Banach spaces, a Fredholm operator is one with finite dimensional kernel and range of finite codimension (equivalent to the kernel of its adjoint being finite dimensional). Note that the hypothesis that Ran(T) is closed is redundant since a space of finite codimension that is also the range of a bounded operator is always closed (see Arveson reference below); this {{is a consequence of}} the <b>open-mapping</b> <b>theorem</b> (and is not true if the space is not the range of a bounded operator, for example the kernel of a discontinuous linear functional).|$|E
