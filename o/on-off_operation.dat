40|$|The natural {{gas-fired}} {{combined cycle}} (NGCC) plants {{are among the}} best technologies for power production, especially when operating in combined heat and power (CHP) generation feeding a district heating (DH) network. Even if usually designed to operate with very high utilization factors, thus satisfying mainly the base load, nowadays these plants are often used also as backup power. This is due mainly to the necessity to compensate the nonprogrammable renewable energy sources (RES) production, and it can be done, thanks to the good flexibility of these plants. However, in off-design conditions, the energy performance and the pollutant emissions may not be as good as the expected nominal ones. In this paper, the real operation of three NGCC units has been analysed in detail by considering mean hourly data over several years. A gas turbine efficiency curve at partial loads has been obtained, showing a decrease of conversion efficiency at lower unit loads.

30|$|The {{fluctuating}} and stochastic {{nature of}} wind power imposes new challenges to supply adequacy in electric power systems [5, 6]. Load fluctuation or generation failure also causes a supply adequacy problem in conventional power systems. Based on static characteristics of load, {{the process of}} secure supply adequacy involves load forecasting, generation and grid planning, generation dispatch, etc. Planned generation usually consists of three types: on-line fast response generations (minutes) for frequency regulation, fast response generations such as hydro or gas for load following (hour), and slow response generations such as coal or nuclear for unit commitment (day). With large-scale wind generation in the system, the net load of the system exhibits two new features: increasing rate and range of variation; and increasing uncertainty of rate and range of variation. The study shows that these features will first impact load following requirements (increase), further on base load requirements (decrease) when the penetration grows, and yet at load level and <b>on–off</b> <b>operation</b> of conventional generations. Large-scale wind integration therefore requires a substantial increase for flexibility of response from conventional generations [1].|$|E

The coupling increases the transmissible torque of a magnetorheological (MR) clutch, under particular environmental conditions, i. e. for temperature below 20 °C.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{technique}} for on-line estimation of oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and to investigate the use of OUR in monitoring and control of the activated sludge process. A mathematical expression for the relationship between the plant specific oxygen transfer coefficient (K) and air flow rate was necessary for the estimation of OUR. Three different least squares methods, a direct linear method, a discrete linear method, and a non-linear method, were investigated as estimation techniques for K. Data from a full-scale, instrumented wastewater treatment plant were collected in order to evaluate the usefulness of each of the three methods. It was found that the direct linear method with data smoothing, although mathematically less rigorous than the other two methods, yielded a satisfactory estimate and was preferred over the non-linear method because of its computational simplicity. Difficulties were encountered with the discrete linear method because of disturbances in flow rate at the plant due to the <b>on-off</b> <b>operation</b> of several influent pumps. A comparison between the measured and estimated OUR showed similar trends indicating that the estimated OUR could be used in control. The use of OUR for control purposes was investigated by means of computer simulations using an existing mathematical model modified to simulate conditions at the full-scale plant. Control strategies, using OUR estimates, for air flow rate and step feed manipulation were developed and demonstrated to be effective. Because OUR is a better indicator of sludge activity than dissolved oxygen, the estimated OUR may also be used to monitor process conditions and obtain an estimate of the active fraction in the sludge. The latter may enable improved control strategies for sludge age to be developed...|$|E

OABF can completely remove the high-cost, power-consuming and bulky analog phase-shifters that are extensively employed by traditional analog beamforming schemes; it only requires the deployment of low-cost analog switches that are easy to implement. Moreover, we show that the beams formed by such simple antenna <b>on-off</b> switch <b>operations</b> can achieve rather good performances with low-complexity beamforming algorithms. Specifically, we first propose two optimal signal-to-noise ratio maximization algorithms to determine the on-off state of each switch under the per-antenna power constraint and the total power constraint, respectively.

Numerical results are consistent with our theoretical analysis. We believe that the simple structure of OABF makes massive MIMO much easier to implement in real systems.

Note that criterion (2) is for O-mode heating, criterion (3) is for stable ionosphere or stable heating, which is important for <b>ON-OFF</b> heating <b>operation,</b> and criterion (4) is for nighttime, including both nautical twilight and astronomical twilight to detect optical emissions, i.e., artificial aurora emissions.|$|R
30|$|The present {{survey is}} {{basically}} {{the same as that}} employed by Tsuda et al. (2018), but for the case of 2.7 -MHz frequency (i.e., for the artificial aurora experiments utilizing the second electron gyro-harmonic). For a statistical survey, we accumulated f_oF_ 2 data from 2000 to 2017 (precisely to 06 : 06 UT on October 11, 2017), obtained by the dynasonde at the EISCAT Tromsø site (69.6 ^∘N, 19.2 ^∘E). The data period covers more than one solar cycle. A sounding was made typically every 6 minutes before February 2012 and every 2 minutes since then. Using the dataset, we categorized each period of 1  h into three conditions: (a) possible nighttime heating condition; (b) impossible nighttime heating condition; and (c) no data. To judge the conditions, we set four criteria: (1) number of f_oF_ 2 data for each 1 -h period is at least 5; (2) averaged f_oF_ 2 for each period of 1  h is more than or equal to 2.7  MHz; (3) one standard deviation of f_oF_ 2 for each period of 1  h is {{less than or equal to}} 0.5  MHz; (4) minimum of solar zenith angle (SZA) for each period of 1  h is more than or equal to 96 ^∘. If the criterion (1) is not satisfied, the 1  h is categorized as the condition (c). If all the criteria are satisfied, the 1  h is categorized as the condition (a). Otherwise, the 1  h is categorized as the condition (b). Note that the criterion (2) is for O-mode heating in the second electron gyro-harmonic, the criterion (3) is for stable ionosphere or stable heating which would be important for, e.g., <b>ON–OFF</b> heating <b>operation,</b> and the criterion (4) is for nighttime including both the nautical twilight and the astronomical twilight to detect optical emissions, i.e., artificial aurora emissions.|$|R
40|$|Pathogen {{and toxic}} {{chemical}} concentrations above {{the chemical and}} toxicity water quality standards in creeks and rivers pose risks to human health and aquatic ecosystems. Storm drains discharging into these watercourses often contribute significantly to elevating pollutant concentrations during wet weather, especially following extended periods of dry weather over which pollutants accumulate, or after seasonal pesticides applications that cause high concentrations in retention structures and flood control basins drained by the storm drains. In many instances the discharges from the storm drains are controlled by pumps that run intermittently in response to water level elevations in the retention basins. These pumps usually run at full volume, modulated only in stepwise fashion when more than one pump serves the overflow structure. The <b>on-off</b> mode of <b>operation</b> is insensitive to conditions in the ambient flow or the effluent. Modulating storm drain flows can ameliorate the impact of pathogens or toxic residues found in the storm drain effluent by controlled and optimum mixing of the effluent and ambient streams. Plume models simulating the mixing process in real time based on continuously measured stream levels and storm drain volumes, together with variable flow pumps, {{could be used to}} blend the effluent with the receiving stream in a way that mitigates the impact of the storm drai...|$|R
30|$|Concerning their applications, we {{note that}} this type of hybrid films (or hybrid membranes) {{possesses}} many structural advantages and processing flexibilities: (1) AuNPs (or other metallic NPs) can be tuned with different sizes (e.g., monodisperse AuNPs, 2.1 ± 0.3 nm and 6.2 ± 0.6 nm; see SI- 8 in Additional file 1); (2) inter-AuNP distance depends on the thiol population and chain lengths (e.g., 3.8 ± 0.4 nm and 8.6 ± 0.5 nm; see SI- 8 in Additional file 1); (3) film thickness and interfacial shape can be engineered; and (4) new properties can be obtained by introducing functional groups to thiol chains. All these control factors will determine the final porosity and functionality of the suspended hybrid films in future applications (e.g., gas separation). For instance, these films {{can be used as a}} catalyst or a sealant for the enclosure of nano test tubes [18 – 20]. At a relatively low temperature, the AuNPs in these films are readily fused into single metallic gold plugs at 150 °C to 250 °C, as reported in Figure 4 g,h. On the other hand, while they are very stable in aqueous solution, the suspended hybrid films of AuNPs are soluble (and thus removable) in common organic solvents such as toluene and cyclohexane. The assembly-disassembly property that these films possess may be useful for <b>on-off</b> or store-release <b>operations.</b>|$|R
40|$|Graphene {{became one}} of the most {{investigated}} system in the last decade, being considered by the scientific community the wonder material of this century. It is formed from a single layer of carbon atoms packed in a honeycomb lattice with a series of exotic and unique properties which make this system very convenient for engineering new electronic applications. However, besides the outstanding mechanical and electronic properties, graphene has also some serious limitations due to the difficulty in the synthesis of high-quality monolayers at a large scale, or in creating of an electronic band gap in the material, necessary for <b>on-off</b> switching <b>operations</b> in the transistors technology. To overcame this problem, one solution comes from the interaction between epitaxial graphene and transition metal substrates, but this will results in a hardly controlled opening of an energy band gap at a Fermi level. Another solution arises from the possibility to grow a second layer of graphene which will employ a stable band gap. At present, only the high temperature Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) can supply large flakes of free standing graphene to an industrial level, but unfortunately this process is self-limiting to one single graphene layer. Therefore, a different approach is needed for the growth of high quality single- and multi-layer on a large scale to overcome the aforementioned limitations. My research activity during these three years was focused in developing a new method of growing graphene, beyond the standard CVD. Specifically, we were interested in the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth, where C atoms are directly delivered on the surface. To this purpose, a new solid carbon source was designed and constructed, which is based on the electron bombardment principle to achieve carbon sublimation from a hot graphite rod. This was used on different substrates like Ir(111), where the CVD technique is well established, Ag(111) and PbZr 0. 2 Ti 0. 8 O 3 (PZT(001)), a ferroelectric oxide where CVD is precluded. The first part is dedicated to the study of the growth mechanism of graphene on Ir(111) using the carbon (MBE) a very low substrate temperature (T= 80 K) to reduce surface diffusion. This allowed us to assimilate the origin of different species of carbon atoms present in the incipient stage of graphene formation on the Ir(111). We also exploit the possibility to grow a second layer of graphene using the C source, at a high substrate temperature which was impossible to achieve with standard CVD method. The second part is dedicated to the growth of graphene on substrates where, the dissociation of the hydrocarbon molecules used in the CVD is precluded. To this purpose we involved carbon MBE to grow single and double layers on Ag(111) by keeping the substrate at elevated temperature. The last part of the thesis is dedicated to the graphene ferroelectric oxides interfaces, which can be considered the forward step in the integration of graphene in the new era of electronics Specifically we were interested in the synthesis of graphene on top of PZT(001 using the solid carbon source, because on this kind of substrate the hydrocarbon used in CVD does not dissociate. A special cleaning procedure was defined to promote carbon adsorption on the substrate. A key role is played also by the temperature deposition which not may exceed a certain value in order that carbon to adsorb.
