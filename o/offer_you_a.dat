25|$|Vladimir Putin, {{it was not}} you {{who started}} this war. But you can finish it if you have enough courage and {{determination}} of de Gaulle. We <b>offer</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sensible peace based on mutual benefit by the principle independence in exchange for security. In case of troops withdrawal and acknowledgement of independence of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, we are obliged not to make any political, military, or economic treaties with anyone against Russia, not to accommodate foreign military bases on our territory even temporarily, not to support and not to finance groups or organizations carrying out a military struggle against RF, {{to be present in}} the united ruble zone, to enter CIS. Besides, we can sign a treaty even though a neutral state status is more acceptable to us. We can also guarantee a renunciation of armed struggle against RF by all Muslims of Russia for at least 10 to 15 years under condition of freedom of faith. We are not related to the apartment bombings in Moscow and Volgodonsk, but we can take responsibility for this in an acceptable way.|$|E
500|$|The serial's writers {{decided that}} Frank and Bobby should marry; but were unsure how viewers would react. Papps and Dickson {{embarked}} on a promotional event in a shopping centre. Their presence attracted crowds and Papps shouted [...] "let's have a scream from those who want Bobby and Frank to marry". The crowds went [...] "berserk" [...] and voiced their approval– which gave the go ahead for their on-screen marriage plans. The storyline played out on-screen when Frank decides that he should ask Bobby to marry him, despite still feeling hurt by Roo's actions. He picks Bobby up from school wearing a tuxedo in a Rolls-Royce and takes her to a picnic in the woods. He sets up a meal of fish and chips. Frank proposes and says; [...] "I can't <b>offer</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> Rolls-Royce lifestyle but {{you can have a}} life of fish and chips with me." [...] Frank also writes a song titled [...] "When Best Friends Fall in Love" [...] and this was played during the scenes. They later face problems and Frank takes Bobby to his childhood home and he explains to her about how important marriage is to him. In the episode Frank also has flashbacks of his childhood; in which he was played by Michael Scilusa. Dickson told J Clayden that everyone wants her character to attend University and [...] "Bobby knows that getting married isn't {{the right thing to do}} [...] but she doesn't want to lose Frank." ...|$|E

2500|$|Najdorf's lively {{personality}} {{made him}} a great favorite among chess fans, as he displayed an aptitude for witty sayings, {{in the manner of}} his mentor Tartakower. An example: commenting on his opponent at the 1970 USSR vs. Rest of the World match, he remarked, [...] "When [...] Spassky <b>offers</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> piece, <b>you</b> might as well resign then and there. But when Tal <b>offers</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> piece, <b>you</b> would do well to keep playing, because then he might <b>offer</b> <b>you</b> another, and then another, and then ... who knows?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{a meeting}} with John Houseman, Reeve was told, [...] "Mr. Reeve. It is terribly {{important}} that you become a serious classical actor. Unless, of course, they <b>offer</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> shitload of money to do something else." [...] Houseman then offered him the chance to leave school and join the Acting Company, among performers such as Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone, and David Ogden Stiers. Reeve declined, as {{he had not yet}} received his bachelor's degree from Juilliard.|$|E
2500|$|Ianulea's {{only option}} is to flee Bucharest in a haste and escape his creditors. As he rides past Cuțitul de Argint Church, he notices that he is being pursued by armed guards, sent by the Bucharest Aga to lock him into a debtors' prison. He {{abandons}} his horse and runs up a hill and into a vineyard, pleading with the keeper to provide him with shelter. The latter, who presents himself as Negoiță, reluctantly accepts to do so when Ianulea assures him that his pursuers are not boyars. In exchange for his help, Ianulea lets him on his secret identity, and promises to reward him. He explains: [...] "Whenever you hear that the devil's got into a woman, a wife, or a girl, whatever, {{no matter the place}} where they live and no matter what station in life they have, you should know it's about me that they're talking. You go right away to the respective house for I won't leave the woman until you chase me out... Naturally that seeing you cure their precious jewel they will <b>offer</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> reward".|$|E
2500|$|In March 1940, British writer George Orwell {{reviewed}} a then-recently published uncensored {{translation of}} Mein Kampf for The New English Weekly. Orwell {{suggested that the}} force of Hitler's personality shone through the often [...] "clumsy" [...] writing, capturing the magnetic allure of Hitler for many Germans. In essence, Orwell notes, Hitler offers only visions of endless struggle and conflict {{in the creation of}} [...] "a horrible brainless empire" [...] that [...] "stretch to Afghanistan or thereabouts". He wrote, [...] "Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people 'I <b>offer</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> good time,' Hitler has said to them, 'I offer you struggle, danger, and death,' and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet." [...] Orwell's review was written {{in the aftermath of the}} 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, when Hitler made peace with Russia after more than a decade of vitriolic rhetoric and threats between the two nations; with the pact in place, Orwell believed, England was now facing a risk of Nazi attack and the UK must not underestimate the appeal of Hitler's ideas.|$|E

2500|$|The Parade {{column and}} its {{response}} received considerable {{attention in the}} press, including a front page story in the New York Times in which Monty Hall himself was interviewed. [...] Hall understood the problem, giving the reporter a demonstration with car keys and explaining how actual game play on Let's Make a Deal differed from {{the rules of the}} puzzle. In the article, Hall pointed out that because he had control over the way the game progressed, playing on the psychology of the contestant, the theoretical solution did not apply to the show's actual gameplay. He said he was not surprised at the experts' insistence that the probability was 1 out of 2. [...] "That's the same assumption contestants would make on the show after I showed them there was nothing behind one door," [...] he said. [...] "They'd think the odds on their door had now gone up to 1 in 2, so they hated to give up the door no matter how much money I offered. By opening that door we were applying pressure. We called it the Henry James treatment. It was 'The Turn of the Screw.'“ Hall clarified that as a game show host {{he did not have to}} follow the rules of the puzzle in the vos Savant column and did not always have to allow a person the opportunity to switch (e.g., he might open their door immediately if it was a losing door, might offer them money to not switch from a losing door to a winning door, or might only allow them the opportunity to switch if they had a winning door). [...] "If the host is required to open a door all the time and <b>offer</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> switch, then you should take the switch," [...] he said. [...] "But if he has the choice whether to allow a switch or not, beware. Caveat emptor. It all depends on his mood.” ...|$|E
