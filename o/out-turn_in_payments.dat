We also make use of a unique ranking of investor quality, associated with the likelihood of flipping the IPO. We find that investors perceived to be long-term holders of the stock are consistently favored in allocation and <b>in</b> <b>out-turn</b> profits. <b>In</b> contrast to Cornelli and Goldreich (2001), we find little evidence that more informative bids receive larger allocations or higher profits.

3000|$|In {{the present}} {{competitive}} market, the supplier influences the customers {{in many different}} ways to capture the market. For this reason, they offer a delay period <b>in</b> <b>payment</b> without any extra charges.

In this paper, we generalize [Goyal, S. K., 1985. EOQ under conditions of permissible delay <b>in</b> <b>payments.</b> Journal of the Operational Research Society 36, 335 - 338] economic order quantity (EOQ) model with permissible delay <b>in</b> <b>payment</b> to reflect the following real-world situations: (1) the retailer's selling price per unit is significantly higher than unit purchase price, (2) the interest rate charged by a bank is not necessarily higher than the retailer's investment return rate, (3) many items such as fruits and vegetables deteriorate continuously, and (4) the supplier may offer a partial permissible delay <b>in</b> <b>payments</b> even if the order quantity is less than W. We then establish the proper mathematical model, and derive several theoretical results to determine the optimal solution under various situations and use two approaches to solve this complex inventory problem. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the theoretical results. Inventory EOQ Trade credits Partially permissible delay <b>in</b> <b>payment</b> Finance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results on}} variability of outturn shortfalls about the expected value indices {{which are usually}} presented in resource adequacy studies, {{for a range of}} Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) levels and installed wind capacities in a test system generally representative of future Great Britain system scenarios. While the details of results will clearly vary between systems, one very general conclusion is possible. In the results presented, for a given LOLE level, the probability of very severe <b>out-turn</b> <b>in</b> a future peak season is much greater at high installed wind capacity. Thus for this system, as the installed wind capacity increases, a constant level of LOLE cannot be taken as an indicator of an unchanging overall risk profile of the system. This further demonstrates that in any system, LOLE cannot be assumed to be a good summary statistic of risk profile as the installed variable generation (VG) capacity increases, and that it might be necessary to reconsider the near-universal use of expected value risk indices as the main headline indices in utility adequacy studies...|$|R

Data on seed cotton yield and eight other yield related characters were collected. Genotypic and phenotypic correlations between different traits were then determined. Seed cotton yield had significant positive phenotypic and genotypic associations with lint yield {{and number of}} bolls/m 2. Similarly, positive phenotypic and genotypic correlations were obtained between lint yield and number of bolls/m 2, seed cotton/plant and number of bolls/plant, boll size and seed index, lint index and ginning <b>out-turn.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, boll size and seed index exhibited significant negative associations with seed cotton yield {{and most of its}} components. The number of bolls/m 2, which had close association with seed cotton yield, could be used as indicator in selection for yield. However, special consideration should be paid to the traits which are negatively associated with each other. Khartoum University Pres...|$|R

At the same time, the industry has been shaped by its share of entry and exit, through startups, mergers, and the reorganization of businesses seeking the proper scope of horizontal and vertical integration.; These changes have enabled nonbank organizations to play a larger role <b>in</b> the <b>payments</b> system. Nonbanks have followed a number of pathways to more prominence: purchasing bank payment processing subsidiaries, carving out niches <b>in</b> the <b>payments</b> market through innovation, and taking advantage of economies of scale made possible by shifting to electronic forms of payment.; Nonbanks have introduced some of the most far-reaching innovations to the <b>payments</b> system <b>in</b> recent years, leading to greater efficiencies <b>in</b> <b>payments</b> processing.

The results showed that formal education (demographic variable) had positive relationship and land size (economic of land variable) had negative relationship with the participation. Positive relationship between formal education and participation <b>in</b> <b>payment</b> of irrigation service fees meant that the participation increased as farmers’ education increased.

40|$|In this comparative-historical case study, changes <b>in</b> <b>payment</b> modes and {{currencies}} {{are described}} and analysed for {{the cases of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia {{against the background of}} the breakup of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. First, an analytical framework is developed, yielding an ideal type of payments and a categorisation of movements away from and towards this ideal. While a unilateral decision tree forms the basic framework, it is argued that choosing a payment mode and a currency to effect a transaction is a problem of coordination. The aggregate outcome of changes <b>in</b> <b>payments</b> is understood by putting emphasis on the interplay of informal and formal rules <b>in</b> <b>payments</b> as well as on network structure and characteristics of payment systems.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} calculating the Jarman index using the smaller geographical unit of the census enumeration district on the changes <b>in</b> deprivation <b>payments</b> made to general practitioners. The Jarman index, or underprivileged area score, {{is used to calculate}} the allowance that general practices in the United Kingdom receive for each patient registered with them who lives in an area of relative social deprivation. Current values of the Jarman score are derived from the 1981 census and are based on electoral wards. The change <b>in</b> <b>payments</b> to some practices brought about by using data from the 1991 census may cause severe financial hardship. DESIGN [...] Jarman indices for wards and enumeration districts from the 1981 and 1991 censuses were used to calculate the payments made to 169 practices in Lambeth, Southwark, and Lewisham; the changes <b>in</b> <b>payments</b> under ward and enumeration district based schemes were then compared. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Standard deviations of the changes <b>in</b> <b>payments</b> to practices. Extreme values of changes <b>in</b> <b>payments.</b> RESULTS [...] The standard deviation of the change <b>in</b> <b>payment</b> between the two censuses was 6365 pounds with the enumeration district Jarman index, whereas it was 9452 pounds under the ward based scheme. If the ward based scheme is used 10 practices would find their payments changed by over 20, 000 pounds, whereas only two practices would have changed by more than this amount under the scheme based on enumeration districts. CONCLUSION [...] The Jarman index could be more sensitively and appropriately applied to calculate the deprivation payments that practices receive using the census enumeration district as its unit for calculation. This would result in fewer precipitate changes <b>in</b> <b>payments</b> when census data change every 10 years...|$|R
