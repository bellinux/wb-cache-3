50|$|On 23 September 2002, {{seven days}} after DTI Consumer Minister Melanie Johnson {{released}} the government Good Garage scheme, Forte Lubricants registered goodgaragescheme.com as a domain name. In 2003, just after motor industry representatives and {{representatives from the}} Office of Fair Trading (OFT) signed an agreement to create an industry run Good Garage Scheme, the Office of Fair Trading issued a car service checklist that recommended to garages what {{should be included in}} a service and enabled consumers to compare what different garages offer as part of a car service. Forte Lubricants then began using the Office of Fair Trading's car service checklist in its promotional material. The Office of Fair Trading felt that Forte Lubricants' usage of the checklist as well as usage of the OFT's name and logo in its marketing material lead to consumers to believe that the OFT recommended the use of a fuel system cleaner and an engine <b>oil</b> <b>flush,</b> neither of which were addressed by the Office of Fair Trading. In general, the OFT does not approve any products or recommend what products should be used by garages when providing a car service. In response to a request by the Office of Fair Trading, Forte Lubricants agreed in June 2003 to stop using the OFT's name and logo in Forte's marketing material as legal action was threatened against Forte.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTitanium alloys {{have been}} widely used in the aerospace, {{biomedical}} and automotive industries because of their good strength-to-weight ratio and superior corrosion resistance. However, {{it is very difficult to}} machine Titanium alloy materials due to their poor machinability, resulting in short tool life. The effects of oil mist and air jet flushing on tool wear in the milling of Ti 6 Al 4 V were investigated at a cutting speed of 300 m/min in this study. Tests with various <b>flushing</b> directions of <b>oil</b> mist and air jet during up, and down-cut were carried out. Tool wear and chip shape were measured and analyzed. As a result of these cutting tests and considerations, it was revealed that up-cut with <b>oil</b> mist <b>flushed</b> from any direction and air jet flushed from the side were desirable, and dry down-cut was also desirable...|$|R

40|$|Emulsifiable oils {{are often}} used in {{post-tensioned}} construction to reduce friction losses and to provide temporary corrosion protection for tendons {{during the period of}} time between stressing and grouting. In the past, <b>oils</b> were <b>flushed</b> from the ducts with water prior to grouting. This practice often led to voids in the grout and created environmental problems related to the disposal of the flushing water. This report is a summary of research done at Pennsylvania State University and The University of Texas at Austin that addressed the effect of unflushed emulsifiable oils on corrosion, bond, and friction losses. Certain oils available on the market do provide adequate temporary corrosion protection. Bond test results indicate that the strength of post-tensioned specimens with oiled tendons is similar to or better than the strength of specimens with unoiled tendons. Specimens with oiled tendons did experience large amounts of slip in comparison to specimens with unoiled tendons. Friction tests indicate that lubrication reduces the friction coefficient in rigid steel pipes and HDPE ducts on the order of 15 percent if the tendon is stressed when the oil is fresh. The coefficient of friction for HDPE ducts measured from this test program was significantly less than the value recommended b...|$|R
40|$|Smackover Field, {{discovered}} in 1922, {{is an excellent}} example of the methodology of heavy oil handling and loss in early 20 th century flush production fields. Emulsion problems and waste were severe; millions of barrels of heavy oil were stored in earthen pits for up to a decade, and millions of barrels of oil were lost to land and water. The largest quantity of crude oil waste was from the inadequate handling and treatment of water-in-oil emulsions. Crude oil loss was also associated with earthen storage both on leases and in large tank farms. Lease storage pits served numerous purposes and had the most complex fluid his-tory. Many were used for decades as saltwater disposal pits fol-lowing the <b>flush</b> <b>oil</b> period. Large earthen tank farms on the field edge stored millions of barrels of heavy oil in the 1920 s and 1930 s but were not used for saltwater storage. Today the farms exist within young forests where the ground is hardened by as-phaltic deposits associated with both earthen construction and seepage loss. Drainage areas also provide a record of the exten-sive waste oil history. Asphaltic layers are most prominent in creek areas that did not burn, but degraded oil exists to some ex-tent in almost all field drainage areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{remediation}} of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) using conventional aquifer treatment technologies {{is limited}} by the low solubility of NAPLs. Surfactants can promote the enhanced removal of NAPL through mobilisation, a mechanism that relies on the reduction of interfacial tension (IFT) at the flushing solution/NAPL interface. The conditions governing mobilisation can be represented by the total trapping number (N T), a dimensionless quantity relating viscous and buoyancy forces to the capillary forces trapping the NAPL residual. A highly reliable experimental apparatus and procedure were developed to study the effect of flow rate and surfactant concentration on the removal of a residual NAPL. Column studies were conducted to investigate the relative flushing efficiencies of very dilute Triton X- 100 solutions delivered through Ottawa sand spiked with light white mineral oil. At the higher flow rate, the surfactant solutions yielded N T values greater than the critical N T, promoting greater NAPL recovery as IFT dropped. While NAPL removal at the lower flow rate should not be enhanced because the critical N T was not surpassed, variations in mineral <b>oil</b> recovery during <b>flushing</b> clearly indicate a surfactant effect. At the lower flow rate, the surfactant-induced enhancement and retardation of NAPI, removal both highlight the limitations of the N T approach. For more realistic systems where free product NAPL is present, the total trapping number approach requires further study to define its applicability as an indicator for NAPL mobilisatio...|$|R
40|$|Time-lapse seismic {{can be an}} {{important}} tool for monitoring and planing further development of a producing hydrocarbon field. Use of 4 D seismic can make itpossible to detect production changes over a relatively large area and match thesechanges with production data acquired from wells. Undepleted pockets, pressurebarriers and injectors out of range can be revealed when interpreting a 4 D data set. This can be valuable information when updating reservoir models and when planingnew wells an hence, lead to an increased recovery from the field. The reservoir interval and the oil column in the Norne G-segment are relatively thin. The pore pressure in the segment has been in the range of the bubble point of thehydrocarbons in place. This has led to gas going out of solution and back to oil againas a result of variations in pore pressure. The producer 6608 / 10 -E- 4 has extractedthe hydrocarbons from the segment while injector 6608 / 10 -F- 4 has given pressuresupport to the producer by injection of water down flank in the water zone. Waterhas <b>flushed</b> <b>oil</b> {{as a result of the}} production of the hydrocarbons and injection ofwater. All this factors introduces more than one effect that may have affected theseismic response form the field at the same time, making the 4 D interpretation inthis segment challenging. In this Master?s thesis interpretation of pressure and saturation changes in the NorneG-segment have been performed for the time interval between 2001 and 2006. Thework is done by use of amplitude difference data and AVO attributes on the seismichorizon representing top reservoir in addition to time shift analysis on a horizon belowthe reservoir. Seismic data from 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2006 and well informationincluding paths, production and injection history has been available for this thesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|The ca. 1280 Ma {{dolerite}} sill {{within the}} Mesoproterozoic Roper Group in the Roper Superbasin, Australia, contains evidence {{for at least}} two episodes of hydrocarbon migration represented, respectively, by solid bitumen with a ketone-rich extract, and a mixture of a high maturity gas-condensate and a lower maturity oil within oil-bearing fluid inclusions. The ketone isomers are formed by flash pyrolysis of kerogen during the intrusion of the dolerite sill [Org. Geochem. 21 (1994) 829] and represent the first and oldest phase of hydrocarbon migration. The gas condensate and oil were subsequently trapped as a mixture within fluid inclusions at diagenetic temperatures and pressures of around 110 °C and 250 bars, significantly after cooling of the sily duroproterozoic. reactivation of the Roper Superbasin. Either (1) these fluids migrated together and mixed in the reservoir or (2) an earlier <b>oil</b> charge was <b>flushed</b> by a later condensate charge and the oil-condensate mixture was trapped within single fluid inclusions. Oil inclusions occur chiefly within albitised zones of labradorite laths within the dolerite matrix, and within transcrystalline microfractures cutting vein calcite and rarely vein quartz. Oil inclusions trapped in the vein calcite are accompanied by hypersaline Ca/Mg brines. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of oil extracted from inclusions within the dolerite matrix shows that the oil is non-biodegraded and was therefore trapped relatively quickly within the host minerals. Trace amounts of biomarkers indicate that the inclusion oil is of a biogenic origin and excludes any abiotic processes that are apparent sources of hydrocarbons in many crystalline rocks. Monomethylalkanes, pentacyclic terpanes chiefly comprising hopanes and diahopanes, and very low concentrations of steranes and diasteranes indicate input from cyanobacterial organic matter with a minor contribution from eukaryotes. The hydrocarbons are likely derived from Proterozoic source rocks such as the directly overlying Velkerri Formation and/or the underlying Barney Creek Formation from the McArthur Group. The study has implications for the source of hydrocarbons in non-sedimentary rocks and suggests that fluid inclusions can be used not only to distinguish between biogenic and abiogenic sources of hydrocarbons but also to provide critical information about the composition of the biomass, fluid migration events, and conditions under which hydrocarbons in different geological settings are trapped. 21 page(s...|$|R
