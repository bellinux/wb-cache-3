25|$|The hips {{should be}} relaxed and the rider should lean {{forwards}} slightly {{with the movement}} of the horse. In cross country, the rider tends to stay <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> and be standing up with their knees bent and the upper body leaning over the horse's withers. The heel of the rider should be in line with their shoulders and then the back of their riding hat in dressage to make the canter look neat.|$|E
25|$|In a half-seat position, the rider's seat {{bones are}} lifted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle,</b> {{and only the}} pelvis has contact. It is used for jumping when some seat aid may be necessary, {{especially}} for sharp turns, when riding downhills, on the approach to potentially spooky fences, or when the rider wishes to collect the stride. This seat is a compromise, allowing the jumping rider to have greater control than in two-point, but still keeping {{the majority of the}} rider's weight off the horse's back.|$|E
25|$|To not be jostled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> and to {{not harm}} the horse by {{bouncing}} on its back, riders must learn specific skills in order to sit the trot. Most riders learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, {{but to do so}} requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, is virtually impossible to sit.|$|E

5000|$|Born at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, bred {{and owned}} by Ogden Phipps, she was trained by National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame trainer Claude R. McGaughey III. She was sired by the 1988 Champion Two-Year Old Male, Hall of Famer Easy Goer, and was foaled by the undefeated {{champion}} race mare and Hall of Famer Personal Ensign. During her racing days, My Flag {{was known to}} have a [...] "diva" [...] personality, {{because she did not}} like to be around other horses.

25|$|McCulloch {{commanded}} the Confederate right wing at the Battle of Pea Ridge (or Elkhorn Tavern), Arkansas, and on March 7, 1862, after much maneuvering his troops overran a key Union artillery battery. Union resistance stiffened {{late in the}} morning, however, and as McCulloch rode forward to scout out enemy positions, he was shot <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> and died instantly. McCulloch always disliked army uniforms and was wearing a black velvet civilian suit and Wellington boots {{at the time of}} his death. Credit for the fatal shot was claimed by sharpshooter Peter Pelican of the 36th Illinois Infantry.|$|E
25|$|In January 1862, Union General George H. Thomas {{began to}} advance on George B. Crittenden's {{position}} at Mill Springs. In rainy conditions, Thomas' army moved slowly, and Crittenden advanced {{to meet them}} before they could be reinforced by forces from nearby Somerset. The battle commenced on January 19, 1862, and favored Crittenden's forces early on. However, in the confusion caused by the rain and fog, Felix Zollicoffer, commander of Crittenden's First Brigade, rode into {{the midst of the}} Union forces. A Confederate officer galloped in, yelling at Zollicoffer to inform him of his mistake. Upon being identified, Zollicoffer was shot <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> and killed, disheartening the Confederates and turning the tide of the battle. Thomas' reinforcements arrived, and Crittenden's forces were forced to retreat across the flooded Cumberland River. Many drowned in the process, and Crittenden was given the blame for the debacle.|$|E
25|$|A month later, Forrest {{was back}} in action at the Battle of Shiloh (April 6–7, 1862). He {{commanded}} a Confederate rear guard after the Union victory. In the battle of Fallen Timbers, he drove through the Union skirmish line. Not realizing {{that the rest of}} his men had halted their charge when reaching the full Union brigade, Forrest charged the brigade single-handedly, and soon found himself surrounded. He emptied his Colt Army revolvers into the swirling mass of Union soldiers and pulled out his saber, hacking and slashing. A Union infantryman on the ground beside him fired a musket ball into Forrest's spine with a point-blank musket shot, nearly knocking him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b> The ball went through his pelvis and lodged near his spine. Steadying himself and his mount, he used one arm to lift the Union soldier by the shirt collar and then wielded him as a human shield before casting his body aside after he had found his way to safety. Forrest is acknowledged to have been the last man wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. Forrest galloped back to his incredulous troopers. A surgeon removed the musket ball a week later, without anesthesia, which was unavailable. Forrest would likely have been given a generous dose of alcohol to muffle the pain of the surgery.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{the devil}} with such vanities!" [...] said Sir John Foster; [...] "when had I leisure for them or any thing else? During {{my whole life}} has she kept me to this hangman's office, chasing thieves one day and traitors another, in daily fear <b>of</b> my life; <b>the</b> lance never hung up in the hall, <b>the</b> foot never <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stirrup, <b>the</b> <b>saddles</b> never off my nags' backs; and now, because I have been mistaken in <b>the</b> person <b>of</b> a man I never saw, I warrant me, the next letters from the Privy Council will rate me as I were a dog--a man were better dead than thus slaved and harassed." ...|$|R

60|$|Their course {{still lay}} along the old trade route, but their {{progress}} was very slow, {{and more than}} once the two Emirs rode back together and shook their heads as {{they looked at the}} weary baggage-camels on which the prisoners were perched. <b>The</b> greatest laggard <b>of</b> all was one which was ridden by a wounded Soudanese soldier. It was limping badly with a strained tendon, and it was only by constant prodding that it could be kept with the others. The Emir Wad Ibraham raised his Remington, as the creature hobbled past, and sent a bullet through its brain. The wounded man flew forwards <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high <b>saddle,</b> and fell heavily upon the hard track. His companions in misfortune, looking back, saw him stagger to his feet with a dazed face. At the same instant a Baggara slipped down from his camel with a sword in his hand.|$|R
500|$|This stage saw {{numerous}} breakaways {{get away}} and stay {{away for a}} time. The first of them comprised four riders, coming clear after [...] This group attained a maximum advantage of over nine minutes, but the peloton was able to catch them before the Passo Maloja. Right at the summit, Alessandro Bertolini attacked and came free for a time. He was able to lengthen his escape somewhat by descending the Passo Maloja in an extremely aerodynamic position, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> with all his weight over the handlebars. A crucial four-man break took place [...] from the finish line, with Bertolini able to stay with them as they caught him, making it a five-man leading group. Andriy Hryvko tried {{to make his way}} up to them after they were well away, but could not make it. Despite the presence of more experienced riders and riders noted as sprinters in the break, it was young Norwegian Edvald Boasson Hagen who made it to the line first.|$|E
500|$|King Henry {{took part}} in the jousting, {{sporting}} Diane's black-and-white colours. He defeated the dukes of Guise and Nemours, but the young Gabriel, comte de Montgomery, knocked him half <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b> Henry insisted on riding against Montgomery again, and this time, Montgomery's lance shattered in the king's face. Henry reeled out of the clash, his face pouring blood, with splinters [...] "of a good bigness" [...] sticking out of his eye and head. Catherine, Diane, and Prince Francis all fainted. Henry was carried to the Château de Tournelles, where five splinters of wood were extracted from his head, one of which had pierced his eye and brain. Catherine stayed by his bedside, but Diane kept away, [...] "for fear", {{in the words of a}} chronicler, [...] "of being expelled by the Queen". For the next ten days, Henry's state fluctuated. At times he even felt well enough to dictate letters and listen to music. Slowly, however, he lost his sight, speech, and reason, and on 10 July 1559 he died, aged 40. From that day, Catherine took a broken lance as her emblem, inscribed with the words [...] "lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor" [...] ("from this come my tears and my pain"), and wore black mourning in memory of Henry.|$|E
2500|$|Rising or Posting: The rider {{makes an}} up-and-down {{movement}} each stride, rising <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> for one beat and lowering (sits) {{for the second}} beat. When the rising trot is performed correctly, it is comfortable for the rider and easy on the horse. This is preferred for show jumping, hunt seat, eventing (the jumping phases), saddle seat, lower-level dressage, and most other English-type riding as well as endurance riding. Although this does not provide as much control as sitting, it frees the horse's back. In the rising trot, the rider allows the horse's movement to throw his or her seat a bit <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b> When coming back down, the seat touches down lightly rather than slamming down on the horse's back. [...] Except in saddle seat riding, rider's shoulders maintain a slight forward incline throughout the rising trot, instead of the upright, vertical position seen in sitting trot. The shoulders and lower legs remain in relatively the same position when the rider is both rising and sitting and the hands also stay {{in the same position}} as the rider rises and sits.|$|E
60|$|Her {{statement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact in such {{quiet and}} simple words came with more force than a tragic declamation, and had somewhat <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> setting <b>the</b> distorted images in each mind present into proper focus. Oak, almost {{before he had}} comprehended anything beyond <b>the</b> briefest abstract <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event, hurried <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, <b>saddled</b> a horse and rode away. Not till he had ridden {{more than a mile}} did it occur to him that he would have done better by sending some other man on this errand, remaining himself in the house. What had become of Boldwood? He should have been looked after. Was he mad--had there been a quarrel? Then how had Troy got there? Where had he come from? How did this remarkable reappearance effect itself when he was supposed by many to be at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea? Oak had in some slight measure been prepared for <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> Troy by hearing a rumour of his return just before entering Boldwood's house; but before he had weighed that information, this fatal event had been superimposed. However, it was too late now to think of sending another messenger, and he rode on, in <b>the</b> excitement <b>of</b> these self-inquiries not discerning, when about three miles from Casterbridge, a square-figured pedestrian passing along under the dark hedge {{in the same direction as}} his own.|$|R
50|$|Terriers were bred to kill, and are one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few hunting {{dogs that}} {{have worked in}} urban environments: many terriers of English, Scottish, and Irish {{extraction}} were extremely popular for killing vermin. Some weighed only 15-20 pounds and were easy to keep in small apartments. Unlike many other hunters, this group did not exclusively work in rural areas: rats were rampant in Victorian era London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Dublin, Birmingham, Belfast, and Glasgow, and poisons had marginal effects: the rats bred in <b>the</b> dirty conditions <b>of</b> these cities faster than traps could be laid. It became very profitable for working-class men to have a profession where they trained small dogs to sniff out and kill as many rats as they could {{as fast as they}} could. They required dogs that had very fast reflexes, had a high tolerance for pain (rat bites are painful), and a ruthless never say die attitude. They also required dogs that had more than one type of coat depending on the work needed, but both had to be low maintenance: Cairn terriers, a breed from Scotland, have a waterproof coat with a harder outer layer and a softer inner layer that was ideal in cool and damp conditions. It would have been an excellent breed for hunting rats in a laird's stable and only required a clipping once a month. The Jack Russell Terrier comes in two coats, one long and wiry and the other short: the short coated variety spent more time underground doing battle with badgers and foxes and did not need the wiry hair as much as it would be taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hunter's <b>saddle</b> bag at <b>the</b> last moment to seek its prey.|$|R
5000|$|Then [...] came to <b>the</b> leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region who reigned after Attila {{and whose}} name was Zuatapolug, and saluted him in <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> his people .... On hearing this, Zuatapolug rejoiced greatly, for he {{thought that they were}} peasant people who would come and till his land; and so he {{dismissed}} the messenger graciously. ... Then by a common resolve Hungarians despatched the same messenger again to the said leader and sent to him for his land a big horse with a golden <b>saddle</b> adorned with <b>the</b> gold <b>of</b> Arabia and a golden bridle. Seeing it, the leader rejoiced all the more, thinking that they were sending gifts of homage in return for land. When therefore <b>the</b> messenger asked <b>of</b> him land, grass and water, he replied with a smile, [...] "In return for the gift let them have as much as they desire." ... Then Hungarians sent another messenger to the leader and this was the message which he delivered: [...] "Arpad and his people say to you that you may no longer stay upon the land which they bought of you, for with the horse they bought your earth, with the bridle the grass, and with <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> <b>the</b> water. And you, in your need and avarice, made to them a grant of land, grass and water." [...] When this message was delivered to the leader, he said with a smile: [...] "Let them kill the horse with a wooden mallet, and throw the bridle on the field, and throw <b>the</b> golden <b>saddle</b> into <b>the</b> water <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danube." [...] To which the messenger replied: [...] "And what loss will that be to them, lord? If you kill the horse, you will give food for their dogs; if you throw the bridle on the field, their men will find <b>the</b> gold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridle when they mow the hay; if you throw <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> into <b>the</b> Danube, their fishermen will lay <b>out</b> <b>the</b> gold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> upon <b>the</b> bank and carry it home.

2500|$|The canter may be ridden {{in three}} ways: sitting, half-seat, and {{two-point}}. In a half-seat and/or two-point position, as described below, the rider's seat is raised <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> to some extent, {{the upper body}} leaning forward slightly, enough to balance over the horse's center of gravity, and more weight is carried in the stirrups. [...] This position provides more freedom for the horse, especially over rough terrain or when jumping. [...] When a rider sits the canter, the seat remains firmly in the saddle at all times, allowing a more secure position and greater control over the horse.|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, {{after playing}} roles that had him {{wandering}} in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> for many years, including a role alongside Charles Laughton in the cheaply made production Captain Kidd (1945), Scott appeared in Abilene Town, a UA release which cast him {{in what would}} become one of his classic images, the fearless lawman cleaning up a lawless town. The film [...] "cemented Scott's position as a cowboy hero" [...] and from this point on all but two of his starring films would be Westerns. The Scott Westerns of the late 1940s would each be budgeted around US$1,000,000, equal to $ today.|$|E
2500|$|Stiffness (or elastic modulus) can {{in theory}} affect the ride comfort and power {{transmission}} efficiency. [...] In practice, because even a very flexible frame {{is much more}} stiff than the tires and saddle, ride comfort is ultimately more a factor of saddle choice, frame geometry, tire choice, and bicycle fit. [...] Lateral stiffness is far more difficult to achieve because of the narrow profile of a frame, and too much flexibility can affect power transmission, primarily through tire scrub on the road due to rear triangle distortion, brakes rubbing on the rims and the chain rubbing on gear mechanisms. [...] In extreme cases gears can change themselves when the rider applies high torque <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle.</b>|$|E
50|$|A bicycle saddle is {{commonly}} {{attached to the}} seatpost and <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> can usually be adjusted by the seatpost telescoping in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seat tube.|$|R

50|$|In {{architecture}} a stanchion is {{the upright}} iron bars in windows that pass through <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> bars or horizontal irons to steady the leadlight.

2500|$|Depending on {{the horse}} and its speed, a trot can be {{difficult}} for a rider to sit because {{the body of the}} horse actually drops a bit between beats and bounces up again when the next set of legs strike the ground. Each time another diagonal pair of legs hits the ground, the rider can be jolted upwards <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> and meet the horse with some force on the way back down. Therefore, at most speeds above a jog, especially in English riding disciplines, most riders post [...] to the trot, rising up and down in rhythm with the horse to avoid being jolted. Posting is easy {{on the horse}}'s back, and once mastered is also easy on the rider.|$|E
