5|$|The one {{exception}} to the general rule of concealment and <b>obfuscation</b> was that of border guards who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda as heroes, but West German public opinion was divided about the morality of killing border guards. Some took the view that escapees were entitled to use force {{in the course of}} crossing the border, but (as in one case tried in a West Berlin court) others saw the guard's life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|E
5|$|ROT47 is a {{derivative}} of ROT13 which, {{in addition to}} scrambling the basic letters, also treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence A–Z as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as ASCII. Specifically, the 7-bit printable characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 '!' through 126 '~', 94 in total, taken {{in the order of}} the numerical values of their ASCII codes, are rotated by 47 positions, without special consideration of case. For example, the character A is mapped to p, while a is mapped to 2. The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough <b>obfuscation</b> than that of ROT13; for example, a telephone number such as +1-415-839-6885 is not obvious at first sight from the scrambled result Z`\c`d\gbh\eggd. On the other hand, because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination, it is more immediately obvious that the text has been enciphered.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bytecode, Java’s binary form, is {{relatively}} high-level and therefore susceptible to decompilation attacks. An obfuscator transforms code {{such that it}} becomes more complex and therefore harder to reverse engineer. We develop bytecode <b>obfuscations</b> that are complex to reverse engineer but also do not significantly degrade performance. We present three kinds of techniques that: (1) obscure intent at the operational level; (2) complicate control flow and objectoriented design (i. e. program structure); and (3) exploit the semantic gap between what is legal in source code and what is legal in bytecode. <b>Obfuscations</b> are applied to a benchmark suite to examine their affect on runtime performance, control flow graph complexity and decompilation. These results show {{that most of the}} <b>obfuscations</b> have only minor negative performance impacts and many increase complexity. In almost all cases, tested decompilers fail to produce legal source code or crash completely. Those <b>obfuscations</b> that are decompilable greatly reduce the readability of output source. ...|$|R

25|$|One notable {{consequence}} {{of the decline in}} use of the second person singular pronouns thou, thy, and thee is the <b>obfuscation</b> of certain sociocultural elements of Early Modern English texts, such as many character interactions in Shakespeare's plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613. Although Shakespeare is far from consistent in his writings, his characters primarily tend to use thou (rather than you) when addressing another who is a social subordinate, a close friend, or a hated wrongdoer.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversial}} {{example of}} an unreliable narrator occurs in Agatha Christie's novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, where the narrator hides essential truths in the text (mainly through evasion, omission, and <b>obfuscation)</b> without ever overtly lying. Many readers at the time felt that the plot twist at {{the climax of the}} novel was nevertheless unfair. Christie used the concept again in her 1967 novel Endless Night. The same technique was employed (baldly) in William Makepeace Thackeray's 1847–8 serial and novel Vanity Fair—one of the few examples of an unreliable authorial narrator in the English novel—where he admits passing over the worst of Becky's misdeeds in silence while providing enough allusions and clues (including in the content and captions of the illustrations, also done by Thackeray) to show the way to those interested in them; even their accuracy, however, is made dubious by his admission that he learned the story second-hand from the diplomat Tapeworm. The Norwegian crime writer Sven Elvestad's 1909 The Iron Wagon is another early example of the trope.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the course}} of the week, further {{fighting}} pushed them back to the Kranji–Jurong line where the 2/29th experienced the main force of a further Japanese thrust after the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade was pushed back by two Japanese divisions. Lacking supporting fires following <b>obfuscation</b> from higher headquarters, the battalion was nearly split in half as it withdrew in contact again towards high ground around Bukit Timah. In the process of the withdrawal, individual platoons were forced to fight their way back to Allied lines. At Bukit Timah, the battalion again regrouped minus one company which found itself detached and subsequently fought alongside the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Further fighting saw the Allied forces withdraw towards Singapore City's suburbs, where elements of the 2/29th were used to shore up the line along the Reformatory Road along with part of the 2/20th Battalion and the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion. The Australian forces subsequently formed a perimeter around Tanglin Barracks where they were making preparations for a counter-attack by the time the garrison surrendered on 15 February following the loss of the city's main water reservoirs.|$|E
25|$|The grand tribal {{identities of}} Berber antiquity {{were said to}} be the Mauri, the Numidians, and the Gaetulians. The Mauri {{inhabited}} the far west (ancient Mauritania, now Morocco and central Algeria). The Numidians were located between the Mauri and the city-state of Carthage. Both had large sedentary populations. The Gaetulians were less settled, with large pastoral elements, and lived in the near south on the margins of the Sahara. The medieval historian of the Maghrib, Ibn Khaldun, is credited or blamed for theorizing a causative dynamic to the different tribal confederacies over time. Issues concerning tribal social-economies and their influence have generated a large literature, which critics say is overblown. Abdallah Laroui discounts the impact of tribes, declaring the subject a form of <b>obfuscation</b> which cloaks suspect colonial ideologies. While Berber tribal society has made an impact on culture and government, their continuance was chiefly due to strong foreign interference which usurped the primary domain of the government institutions, and derailed their natural political development. Rather than there being a predisposition for tribal structures, the Berber's survival strategy in the face of foreign occupation was to figuratively retreat into their own way of life through their enduring tribal networks. On the other hand, as it is accepted and understood, tribal societies in the Middle East have continued over millennia {{and from time to time}} flourish.|$|E
25|$|As of March 2001, 2,265 {{victims have}} been officially {{certified}} (1,784 {{of whom have}} died) and over 10,000 people have received financial compensation from Chisso, although they are not recognised as official victims. The issue of quantifying the impact of Minamata disease is complicated, as a full epidemiological study has never been conducted and patients were recognised only if they voluntarily applied to a certification council to seek financial compensation. Many victims of Minamata disease faced discrimination and ostracism from the local community if they came {{out into the open}} about their symptoms. Some people feared the disease to be contagious, and many local people were fiercely loyal to Chisso, depending on the company for their livelihoods. In this atmosphere, sufferers were reluctant to come forward and seek certification. Despite these factors, over 17,000 people have applied to the council for certification. Also, in recognising an applicant as a Minamata disease sufferer, the certification council qualified that patient to receive financial compensation from Chisso. For that reason, the council has always been under immense pressure to reject claimants and minimise the financial burden placed on Chisso. Rather than being a council of medical recognition, the decisions of the council were always affected by the economic and political factors surrounding Minamata and the Chisso corporation. Furthermore, compensation of the victims led to continued strife in the community, including unfounded accusations that {{some of the people who}} sought compensation did not actually suffer from the disease. More properly, the impact should be called a criminal 'poisoning', not a clinical 'disease'. These forms of <b>obfuscation</b> are commonly experienced by 'environmental victims' in many countries.|$|E

500|$|Thirty years ago, when I first {{attempted}} {{to describe the}} characteristic features of tenth-century Anglo-Latin literature, I was rather naively bedazzled by the display of vocabulary which one encounters there.

40|$|Malware {{detection}} is {{a crucial}} aspect of software security. Current malware detectors work by checking for “signatures, ” which attempt to capture (syntactic) characteristics of the machine-level byte sequence of the malware. This reliance on a syntactic approach makes such detectors vulnerable to code <b>obfuscations,</b> increasingly used by malware writers, that alter syntactic properties of the malware byte sequence without significantly affecting their execution behavior. This paper takes {{the position that the}} key to malware identification lies in their semantics. It proposes a semantics-based framework for reasoning about malware detectors and proving properties such as soundness and completeness of such detectors. Our approach uses a trace semantics to characterize the behaviors of malware as well as the program being checked for infection, and uses abstract interpretation to “hide ” irrelevant aspects of these behaviors. As a concrete application of our approach, we show that the semantics-aware malware detector proposed by Christodorescu et al. is complete with respect to a number of common <b>obfuscations</b> used by malware writers. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Malware {{embedded}} in documents is regularly used {{as part of}} targeted attacks. To hinder a detection by anti-virus scanners, the embedded code is usually obfuscated, often with simple Vigenère ci-phers based on XOR, ADD and additional ROL instructions. While for short keys these ciphers can be easily cracked, breaking <b>obfuscations</b> with longer keys requires manually reverse engineering the code or dynami-cally analyzing the documents in a sandbox. In this paper, we present Kandi, a method capable of efficiently decrypting embedded malware obfuscated using Vigenère ciphers. To this end, our method performs a probable-plaintext attack from classic cryptography using strings likely contained in malware binaries, such as header signatures, library names and code fragments. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in dif-ferent experiments. In a controlled setting, Kandi breaks <b>obfuscations</b> using XOR, ADD and ROL instructions with keys up to 13 bytes {{in less than a}} second per file. On a collection of real-world malware in Word, Powerpoint and RTF files, Kandi is able to expose obfuscated malware from every fourth document without involved parsing...|$|R
