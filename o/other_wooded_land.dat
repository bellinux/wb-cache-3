40|$|Land {{take due}} to {{urbanization}} triggers {{a series of}} negative environmental impactswith direct effects on {{quality of life for}} people living in cities. Changes in ecosystem services are associated with land take, among which is the immediate C loss due to land use conversion. Land use change monitoring represents the first step in quantifying land take and its drivers and impacts. To this end, we propose an innovative methodology for monitoring land take and its effects on ecosystem services (in particular, C loss) undermulti-scale contexts. The devised approach was tested in two areas with similar sizes, but different land take levels during the time-span 1990 – 2008 in Central Italy (the Province of Rome and theMolise Region). The estimates of total coverage of built up areaswere calculated using point sampling. The area of the urban patches including each sampling point classified as built up areas in the year 1990 and/or in the year 2008 is used to estimate total abundance and average area of built up areas. Biophysical and economic values for carbon loss associated with land take were calculated using InVEST. Although land take was 7 – 8 times higher in the Province of Rome (from 15. 1 % in 1990 to 20. 4 % in 2008) than in Molise region, our findings show that its relative impact on C storage is higher in the latter,where the urban growth consistently affects not only croplands but also semi-natural land uses such as grasslands and <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>lands.</b> The total C loss due to land take has been estimated in 1. 6 million Mg C, corresponding to almost 355 million €.

40|$|Forests and <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>lands</b> cover around 42 % of EU’s {{land area}} {{and provide a}} {{multiplicity}} of benefits supporting human wellbeing. These benefits are known as ecosystem services. In addition, forests provide economic, social and environmental values. Ensuring those values, as well as maintaining the ecosystem services provided by forests is only possible by implementing a sustainable forest management approach. Ensuring the multifunctional role of forests to supply provisioning services, such as timber, {{and at the same}} time provide regulating and cultural services is one of the aims of sustainable forest management. Nevertheless, most of the income in forestry is from timber production, whereas other non-marketed ecosystem services would require incentives for its provision, which would be oriented to satisfy increasing societal demands. Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) represents one alternative and voluntary way to secure financial sources for multifunctional and protective forest management and sustainable maintenance of ecosystem services. The aim of this report is to present an overview of PES implementation in forest ecosystems in Europe. A SWOT analysis is presented based in the analysis of first, policy drivers related with PES at the EU level, second literature review, and finally a comparison of best practices in PES. In the policy drivers section, we address the main EU policy documents, such as the Biodiversity Strategy, the EU Forest Strategy and other related with PES. Best practices from European countries are shown in the case studies of established and functional PES schemes. The SWOT analysis unveils challenges and potentialities for PES schemes development and implementation. The reviewed strategic and policy documents at EU level call for sustainability, development, cooperation and fostering of forest biodiversity. This opens new opportunities for creating and establishing suitable instruments and one of them is represented by PES schemes. The implementation process of PES schemes reveals some weaknesses and threats, for example the issue of sound valuation methods for ecosystem services. The report concludes by considering all aspects from the best practices identified in the case studies. Finally, despite the fact that PES are not a final solution to ensure sustainable forest management, it is possible to successfully implement PES schemes as part of policy instruments promoting the sustainable management or conservation of European forests.

Given the lack of historical land cover maps over such a large area, Landsat data is a reliable and consistent source of information on land cover dynamics from the 1970 s. This study examines land cover changes occurring between 1975 and 1990 in West Africa using a systematic sample of satellite imagery. The primary data sources for the land cover classification were Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) for 1975 and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) for the 1990 period. Dedicated selection of the appropriate image data for land cover change monitoring was performed for the year 1975. Based on this selected dataset, the land cover analysis {{is based on a}} systematic sample of 220 suitable Landsat image extracts (out of 246) of 20 km × 20 km at each one degree latitude/longitude intersection. Object-based classification, originally dedicated for Landsat TM land cover change monitoring and adapted for MSS, was used to produce land cover change information for four different land cover classes: dense tree cover, tree cover mosaic, <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>land</b> and other vegetation cover. Our results reveal that in 1975 about 6 % of West Africa was covered by dense tree cover complemented with 12 % of tree cover mosaic. Almost half of the area was covered by <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>land</b> and the remaining 32 % was represented by other vegetation cover.

To produce our forest change estimates we used a systematic sample of medium resolution satellite data processed to forest change maps covering 1230 sites of 20 km by 20 km, each located at the degree confluence. Biomass data were spatially associated to each individual sample site so that annual carbon emissions could be estimated. For our study area we estimate that forest cover {{in the study area}} had fallen from 763 Mha (s. e. 10 Mha) in 1990 to 715 Mha (s. e. 10 Mha) in 2005. During the same period <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>land</b> (i. e., non-forest woody vegetation) had fallen from 191 Mha (s. e. 5. 5 Mha) to 184 Mha (s. e. 5. 5 Mha). This equates to an annual gross loss of 3. 74 Mha∙y− 1 of forests (0. 50 % annually) between 1990 and 2000, rising to 4. 40  Mha∙y− 1 in the early 2000 s (0. 61 % annually), with Brazil accounting for 69 % of the total losses. The annual carbon emissions from the combined loss of forests and <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>land</b> were calculated to be 482 MtC∙y− 1 (s. e. 29 MtC∙y− 1 ) for the 1990 s, and 583  MtC∙y− 1 (s. e. 48 MtC∙y− 1 ) for the 2000 to 2005 period. Our maximum estimate of sinks from forest regrowth in tropical South America is 92 MtC∙y− 1 .

A systematic sample of 1600 Landsat satellite imagery subsets, each 20 km 9 20 km in size, were analysed for two reference years: 1990 and 2000. At each sample site and for both years, dense tree cover, open tree cover, <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>land</b> and other vegetation cover were identified from the analysis of satellite imagery, which comprised multidate segmentation and automatic classification steps followed by visual control by national forestry experts. Land cover and land-cover changes were estimated at continental and ecoregion scales and compared with existing pancontinental, regional and local studies. The overall accuracy of our land-cover maps was estimated at 87 %. Between 1990 and 2000, 3. 3 million hectares (Mha) of dense tree cover, 5. 8 Mha of open tree cover and 8. 9 Mha of <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>land</b> were lost, with a further 3. 9 Mha degraded from dense to open tree cover. These results are substantially lower than the 34 Mha of forest loss reported in the FAO’s 2010 Global Forest Resources Assessment {{for the same period}} and area. Our method generates the first consistent and robust estimates of forest cover and change in dry Africa with known statistical preci- sion at continental and ecoregion scales. These results reduce the uncertainty regarding vegetation cover and its dynamics in these previously poorly studied ecosystems and provide crucial information for both science and environmental policies.

40|$|Several {{international}} initiatives, {{including the}} European Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, promote {{the identification and}} mapping of ecosystems as basic tools {{for the conservation of}} biodiversity and related services. On coarse scales, the spatial representation of ecosystems is usually based on broad land cover categories that largely overlook important ecological and biogeographic features of the biotic communities they are meant to exemplify. This paper presents a nationwide ecosystem mapping approach that promotes a degree of thematic detail, which is more suited than that found in the continental maps to meeting biodiversity conservation targets in Italy. The approach is based on the rationale that current and potential vegetation cover are valuable proxies for outlining ecosystems.

Results concerning carbon stocks, and fluxes of Net Ecosystem Production and Net Biome Production for whole-tree biomass (excluding wood products and soils) were derived from a detailed European forest resource database and converted to carbon using biomass conversion factors. Uncertainties and differences from other estimates are discussed. Based on these detailed national forest inventory data, the estimated carbon stock in whole-tree biomass for the European forest, excluding Russia and the Newly Independent States, amounts to 6. 15 PgC.

The EU has set seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy [36] to increase economic performance while reducing resource use; to promote innovation, new sources of growth, and competitiveness; to ensure the security of supply of essential resources; and to fight against climate change and limit environmental impacts of resource use. In the Biomass Action Plan [37], the European Commission states ‘Energy is a key in helping Europe achieve its objectives for growth, jobs and sustainability.’ Renewable energy in general and bio-based renewable in particular have a central role in this. Indeed, forests could play a key role in energy policy and in the overall bio-economy [38] because forests and <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>land</b> cover 178 Mha in Europe (42 % of the European land), and their growing stock is estimated in 23 Mmc in 2005.

The sampling design and image processing techniques were developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) Tropical Ecosystem Environment Observation by Satellite (TREES- 3) project. A set of 175 regularly distributed sample units (with 10 km x 10 km size) located at every full degree confluence point of latitude and longitude were assessed. For each sample unit, (E) TM Landsat images from three target years (1990, 2000 and 2010) were selected, pre-processed, segmented and classified into five land cover classes (Tree Cover - TC, Tree Cover Mosaic - TCM, <b>Other</b> <b>Wooded</b> <b>Land</b> - OWL, Other Land Cover - OLC and Water -W). The results showed that the Cerrado had a net loss of natural vegetation (TC + OWL) of about 12 million hectares between 1990 and 2010, or an average rate of change of - 0. 6 % y- 1. However, the rates of change decreased from the first (1990 - 2000) to the second (2000 - 2010) decade. By 2010, the percentage of natural vegetation cover remaining in the Cerrado was 47 %. JRC.

40|$|Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) {{launched}} in the early 1970 's provides unique opportunities to monitor land cover dynamics based on medium to high resolution imagery. Although the image availability from the initial period of satellite record is relatively good, spatial coverage, radiometric, geometric and optical properties of the images remains unknown. While most of the existing studies using MSS data were focused on regional level or covered more recent time periods, this study examines the quality of these satellite images and exploits them for land cover monitoring at large scale. To examine the availability of Landsat MSS data and its suitability for land cover changes monitoring, a systematic sampling of image dataset is applied over West Africa. Sampling sites taken as boxes of 20 x 20 km at each one degree latitude and longitude intersect are processed and analyzed. Images are examined and used along with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) as a primary data source for the classification process. Results of the study provide a first large scale estimation of land cover changes from Landsat MSS sensor for the period 1975 – 1990. The most remarkable changes over study area were loss of tree cover, tree cover mosaic, <b>other</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>land</b> and gain of other vegetation cover.
