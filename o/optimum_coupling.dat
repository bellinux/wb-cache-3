5000|$|Carboxyl {{groups can}} be immobilized {{on the surface}} of a quantum dot coated in zinc sulfide. Single strands of DNA can then be {{modified}} with an added amino group in order to covalently bond to the carboxyl group, due to an amide bond formed between the carboxyl and amino groups in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC). Factors that can influence the binding of single stranded DNA to the carboxyl group are pH and ionic strength. The pH determines how many protons are available to form covalent bonds, with less being present as the pH gets higher. This results in less strands of DNA binding to each quantum dot. Lower ionic strength results more stable quantum dots, but also causes DNA strands to repel each other. <b>Optimum</b> <b>coupling</b> conditions for over 10 DNA strands per quantum dot are at a pH of 7 and an ionic strength of 0M.

In this paper, the maximum induced voltage on a single-turn loop inside an enclosure from lightning coupling to a metal enclosure wall {{is expressed in}} terms of two multiplicative factors: (A) the normalized enclosure wall peak penetration ratio (i. e., ratio of the peak interior electric field multiplied by the sheet conductance to the exterior magnetic field) and (B) the DC voltage on an ideal <b>optimum</b> <b>coupling</b> loop assuming the ideal penetration ratio of one. As a result of the decomposition, the variation of the peak penetration ratio (A) for different coupling mechanisms is found to be small; the difference in the maximum voltage hence arises from the DC voltage on the <b>optimum</b> <b>coupling</b> loop (B).

40|$|For {{magnetic}} resonant coupled {{wireless power}} transfer (WPT), the axial movement of near-field coupled coils adversely degrades the power transfer efficiency (PTE) {{of the system and}} often creates sub-resonance.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 50) The {{objective of}} this project {{is to examine the}} efficiency of coupling criteria used to connect two substructures by component mode synthesis. Four coupling criteria were examined. The first criterion was used to determine the accuracy of the component mode synthesis method. The entire set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors (modal characteristics) was used in coupling the substructures. The three remaining criteria used selected subsets of the modal characteristics, for each substructure. These criteria were used to identify the optimum subset of modal characteristics which would yield the most cost effective and accurate dynamic analysis. Relationships observed, when defining this optimum subset, became part of the <b>optimum</b> <b>coupling</b> criterion. This <b>optimum</b> <b>coupling</b> criterion can assist in modal selection or truncation, when substructuring of a dynamic model becomes necessary. Three models were used in this parametric study. First, each model was analyzed as a complete structure (non-substructured), and the results of this analysis were used as a basis for comparison. Then all models were split into two substructures and the four coupling criteria were evaluated. Comparisons of modal characteristics and element dynamic stresses, for the substructured versus non-substructured models, were used to determine the accuracy of the coupling criteria. Recommendations in the last chapter of this study, define some selection criteria guide lines.
