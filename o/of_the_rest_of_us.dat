500|$|Johnson gained {{high office}} {{due to his}} proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and {{self-employed}} tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the [...] "plebeians"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, [...] "Johnson {{was always the same}} to everyone... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen." [...] Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts. One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, [...] "you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> Could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you. Then we did not want you to go to the Senate but the people would send you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The other {{threat to}} the {{security}} of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, but I think they should be allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are hardly safe … ...|$|E
2500|$|From the first, {{critics and}} fellow poets praised Stevens. Hart Crane {{wrote to a}} friend in 1919, after reading some of the poems that would make up Harmonium, [...] "There is a man whose work makes most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> quail." [...] The Poetry Foundation states that [...] "by the early 1950s Stevens was {{regarded}} as one of America's greatest contemporary poets, an artist whose precise abstractions exerted substantial influence on other writers." [...] Some critics, like Randall Jarrell and Yvor Winters, praised Stevens' early work but were critical of his more abstract and philosophical later poems.|$|E

2500|$|After leaving CSICOP, Truzzi started another journal, the Zetetic Scholar. He {{promoted}} the term [...] "zeteticism" [...] {{as an alternative}} to [...] "skepticism", because he thought that the latter term was being usurped by what he termed [...] "pseudoskeptics". A zetetic is a [...] "skeptical seeker". The term's origins lie in the word for the followers of the skeptic Pyrrho in ancient Greece. Skeptic's Dictionary memorialized Truzzi thus:Truzzi considered most skeptics to be pseudoskeptics, a term he coined to describe those who assume an occult or paranormal claim is false without bothering to investigate it. A kind way to state these differences might be to say that Marcello belonged to the Pyrrhonian tradition, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> belong to the Academic skeptical tradition.Truzzi was skeptical of investigators and debunkers who determined the validity of a claim prior to investigation. He accused CSICOP of increasingly unscientific behavior, for which he coined the term pseudoskepticism. Truzzi stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Standing five foot, nine {{inches tall}} and {{weighing}} 170 pounds, Loob arrived in Calgary facing skepticism {{that he would be}} able to withstand the rougher North American game and smaller ice surface compared to what he was used to in the Elitserien. Opinion around the NHL in the early 1980s was that Swedish players were [...] "soft"; teammate Colin Patterson credited Loob with changing that perception. [...] He was a vocal leader, unafraid to speak to his teammates when he felt it necessary. [...] He was a strong skater with [...] "dazzling technique", and former Calgary linemate Joe Nieuwendyk said Loob was a key reason for his own early success in the NHL: [...] "He just had such a great amount of skill. He could do things none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could. The luckiest thing that happened to me was getting put on Hakan Loob’s line my first full year in Calgary. He helped me so much, starting my career the right way. A big reason why I scored 50." [...] Nieuwendyk added that Loob could [...] "put pucks into areas, make plays, nobody else would dream of".|$|E
2500|$|Writing for CNN, Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Peñalver {{said that}} [...] "A {{straight}} line {{runs from the}} 1930s sit-down strikes in Flint, Michigan, to the 1960 lunch-counter sit-ins to the occupation of Alcatraz by Native American activists in 1969 to Occupy Wall Street. Occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent, exhibited by a willingness {{to break the law}} and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences." [...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone who says he has no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture".|$|E
