40|$|Abstract: Vitamin E, {{the most}} potent {{antioxidant}} in the lipid phase, was tested for antiinflammatory activity in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced rat colitis. Rats were fed a nonpurified diet (saline and control groups) or a vitamin E supplemented diet (treated group, 300 mg/kg nonpurified diet). Vitamin E supplementation, which resulted in increased colonic vitamin E levels, reduced colonic weight and damage score, prevented lipid peroxidation and diarrhea, reduced interleukin- 1 β levels and preserved glutathione reductase activity and total glutathione levels. However, it did not modify myeloperoxidase levels, which are indicative of neutrophil infiltration in the inflamed colon.

Conflicting evidence exists as to whether nitric oxide plays a crucial role in acute lung injury induced by blast. Data presented in this study demonstrate that local exposure of mid-thoracic region to moderate-level blast overpressure significantly enhanced lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde and superoxide anion generation in rabbit’s lungs 30 minutes after exposure, whereas the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase) activity showed parallel increase.

40|$|Caveolin (CAV) is an {{essential}} component of caveolae, cholesterol-enriched invaginations of the plasma mem-brane of most mammalian cells. However, CAV is not restricted to plasma membrane caveolae, and pools of CAV are present in myriad intracellular membranes. CAV proteins tightly bind cholesterol and contribute to regu-lation of cholesterol fluxes and distributions within cells. In this context, we recently showed that CAV 1 regulates the poorly understood process controlling mitochondrial cholesterol levels. Cholesterol accumulates in mitochon-drial membranes in the absence of CAV 1, promoting the organelle’s dysfunction with important metabolic consequences for cells and animals. In this article, we suggest a working hypothesis that addresses the role of CAV 1 within the homeostatic network that regulates the influx/efflux of mitochondrial cholesterol.

In the pro-cess, electron transfer through the mitochondrial respiratory chain is inevitably associated with production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several physiological roles have been described for ROS (1), but ROS generation in excess of antioxidant defenses is harmful and may cause oxidative stress with damage to DNA, lipids, proteins, and organelles (1, 2).

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) supplementation on acute GalN-induced oxidative liver injury. Hepatotoxicity induced by single intraperitoneal injection of GalN (500 mg/kg body wt) was evident from increase in lipid peroxidation and serum marker enzymes (asparate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase). The decreased activities of enzymic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) as well as glutathione levels were the salient features observed in GalN-induced hepatotoxicity. Pretreatment with ALA (50 mg/kg body weight for 7 days) significantly precluded these changes and prevents the hepatic injury.

Antiepileptic drugs can increase levels of free radicals, which consequently might lead to seizures. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is an antiepileptic drug commonly used in childhood and adolescence.

Patients and Methods: The study included 40 epileptic patients and 31 healthy children between 4 and 12 years of age.

The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of Glu 298 Asp eNOS gene polymorphism on the individual risk for development of complicated carotid atherosclerotic plaque in pa-tients from Serbia with advanced carotid atherosclerosis (CA) who had undergone endarterectomy.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that Asp 298 Asp is an independent risk factor for the presence of complicated plaques in CA patients. Patients who were homozygous for the Asp 298 allele had an adjusted OR of 4. 36 for the development of compli-cated plaques compared to those that carry the Glu 298 allele. Further validation and replication studies are needed. Key words: Carotid atherosclerosis, polymorphism, eNOS, <b>oxidative</b> <b>stres...</b>|$|E
