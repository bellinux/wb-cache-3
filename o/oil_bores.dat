5000|$|As {{a method}} to reduce {{production}} costs, Ford eliminated {{one of the main}} oil galleys from the block casting, resulting in the 335 series having two galleys versus the Windsor family's three. The result was an oil system very similar to the 385 series V8 engines. The two main oil galleys in the 335 series engine run along the lifter <b>bores.</b> <b>Oil</b> is fed from the filter to the number one main bearing followed by the number one cam bearing above. At the same time, it also feeds the right hand oil galley, feeding the right side lifter bank. The lifter bank has four galleys that lead to each of the remaining main bearings. After the oil feeds the main bearings, it feeds each corresponding camshaft bearing above. At the rear-most main bearing, the oil goes into the other galley which feeds the left lifter bank. [...] This system has proven to be adequate for street engines, but can fall short in high-revolution race use without modification.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{content-based}} search application for petroleum exploration and production (E&P). The target application is specification of and search for geologically significant features to be extracted from 2 -dimensional imagery acquired from <b>oil</b> well <b>bores,</b> in conjunction with 1 -dimensional parameter traces. The PetroSPIRE system permits a user to define rock strata using image examples in conjunction with param-eter constraints. Similarity retrieval is based multimodal search, an relies on texture-matching techniques using pre-extracted texture features, employing high-dimensional indexing and nearest neighbor search. Special-purpose visualization techniques allow a user to evaluate object definitions, which can then be iteratively refined by supplying multiple positive and negative image examples as well as multiple parameter constraints. Higher-level semantic constructs can be created from simpler entities by specifying sets of inter-object constraints. A delta-lobe riverbed, for example, might be specified as a layer of siltstone which is above and within 10 feet of a layer of sandstone, with an intervening layer of shale. These "compound objects ", along with simple objects, form a library of searchable entities {{that can be used}} in an operational setting. Both object definition and search are accomplished using a web-based Java client, supporting image and parameter browsing, drag-and-drop query specification, and thumbnail viewing of query results. Initial results from this search engine have been deemed encouraging by oil-industry E&P researchers. A more ambitious pilot is underway to evaluate the efficacy of this approach on a large database from a North Sea drilling site. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. There are two important omissions {{in the literature on}} bore polishing, firstly {{there is no evidence of}} the successful development of a reliable tribo test device to simulate bore polishing and secondly, the mechanism of bore polishing has not been fully defined. The aims of this study were: 1. To establish the principal characteristics of bore polishing In engines. 2. To produce bore polishing in the laboratory. 3. Differentiate between two reference oils in a laboratory tribo test. 4. To understand the mechanism of bore polishing. The principal characteristics of bore polishing have been identified by the examination of Tornado cylinder bores from an engine test. The graphite structure is visible on the surface which has a surface finish of less then 0. 125 micro-m in C. L. A. value. The components used in these tests were a grey cast iron piston ring running on a grey cast iron cylinder bore typically used in commercial engines. A reciprocating tribo test was used to distinguish between the two reference oils. The result showed higher friction, wear and a smoother surface with the <b>oil</b> causing <b>bore</b> polishing compared to the other oil which did not produce bore polishing. Adding carbon, taken from the wall of a piston used in an engine test, to the lubricant in the laboratory tribo test produced a phenomenon resembling bore polishing. Comparisons have been made between the tribo test results and service engines and a good correlation has been obtained. Several analytical techniques have been used and the knowledge of bore polishing has been advanced. In particular, it is suggested that a combination of two processes, one mechanical and the other chemical, are associated with bore polishing. Four wear mechanisms were identified during this investigation; abrasion, delamination, corrosion and adhesion...|$|R
50|$|The Batavia was {{the most}} {{productive}} goldfield in Cape York during the economic depression of the early 1930s, with six payable mines. In 1932 it produced 2,793 ounces of recorded gold valued at £9,287, compared to 3,342 ounces valued at £11,114 in 1931. The use of motor lorries greatly assisted operations on the field. Two batteries had been established {{by the end of}} 1931 to crush the one-ounce stone. One of these was Forsythe's, formerly at Belmore Creek near Croydon, which had been shifted to the Batavia field in November 1931. Peninsula Mines Limited had taken over two leases at the beginning of 1932. Two boarding houses were established at Lower Camp during 1932 with 75 people on the field. A crude-oil engine driven Huntington mill began work in November 1932. Sheppard erected a six head stamp battery driven by suction gas. The Peninsula Mines Limited was using an <b>oil</b> engine driven <b>boring</b> plant. By 1935 the yield was 1,326 ounces of gold (more than the previous year) from the New Year's Gift, Golden Casket, Reform, Black Cat, United, Double Chance, Hidden Treasure and Duke leases. By the mid 1930s there was a population of about 160.|$|R
30|$|Enhancement of {{technology}} and techniques for drilling deep directed <b>oil</b> and gas <b>bore</b> hole {{is one of the}} most important problems of the current petroleum industry. Not infrequently, the drilling of these bore holes is attended by occurrence of extraordinary situations associated with technical accidents. Among these is the Eulerian loss of stability of a drill string in the channel of a curvilinear bore hole. Methods of computer simulation should play a dominant role in prediction of these states. In this paper, a new statement of the problem of critical buckling of the drill strings in 3 D curvilinear bore holes is proposed. It is based on combined use of the theory of curvilinear elastic rods, Eulerian theory of stability, theory of channel surfaces, and methods of classical mechanics of systems with nonlinear constraints. It is noted that the stated problem is singularly perturbed and its solutions have the shapes of localized harmonic wavelets. The calculation results showed that the friction effects lead to essential redistribution of internal axial forces, as well as changing the eigenmode shapes and sites of their localization. These features make the buckling phenomena less predictable and raise the role of computer simulation of these effects.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Modern {{industrial}} {{applications such as}} the smart grid and oil and gas are continuously monitored. The massive amounts of data collected is then processed, and analyzed to generate actions to ensure smooth operations to positively impact the bottom line. In {{the oil and gas}} industry, modern oil rigs are outfitted with thousands of sensors to measure the flow rates, as well as the physical and chemical characteristics that affect production from underground off-shore and on-shore reservoirs. Analytical methods packaged into a surveillance system and applied to the massive network of sensors track the state of the system and issue warning alerts about impending failures. In this setting, real time algorithms are needed to detect a diversity of event types, such as anomalies, trends or forewarn failure events to generate alerts for proactive engineering actions. In this paper, effective online algorithms drawn from the signal processing and statistics literature are applied to quickly detect anomalies, trends, and turbulence in the flow of <b>oil</b> in the <b>bore</b> well which is typical in oil production. The short time Fourier transform and dynamical systems were utilized to uncover structure in the data to apply methods based on local derivatives and estimation based on linear and non-linear methods. We compare the performance of the algorithms and make suitable recommendations for their application. Furthermore We apply non-linear time series models such as kernel adaptive filters for prediction purposes and compare their performance against standard linear methods such as the least mean square algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted over a variety of stream patterns showing that our methods perform well both in terms of accuracy of detection and the short latency in the decision. I...|$|R
