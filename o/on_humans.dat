5|$|Of {{the very}} few {{confirmed}} attacks <b>on</b> <b>humans</b> by wild killer whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks <b>on</b> <b>humans</b> since the 1970s, {{some of which have}} been fatal.|$|E

5|$|After World War II {{ended in}} 1945, Bruno Tesch and Karl Weinbacher of Tesch & Stabenow were tried in a British {{military}} court and executed for knowingly providing Zyklon B to the SS for use <b>on</b> <b>humans.</b> Gerhard Peters, {{who served as}} principal operating officer of Degesch and Heli and also held posts in the Nazi government, served two years eight months in prison as an accessory before being released due to amendments to the penal code.|$|E
5|$|Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin {{achieved}} the first genuine success in immunization against tuberculosis in 1906, using attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis. It was called bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG). The BCG vaccine {{was first used}} <b>on</b> <b>humans</b> in 1921 in France, but received widespread acceptance in the US, Great Britain, and Germany only after World War II.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey <b>on</b> <b>humans</b> with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria {{can also}} be used in the place of {{pesticides}} in the biological pest control. This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a Lepidopteran-specific insecticides under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or no effect <b>on</b> <b>humans,</b> wildlife, pollinators and most other beneficial insects.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{only a few}} sharks are {{dangerous}} to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four {{have been involved in}} a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. Despite being responsible for attacks <b>on</b> <b>humans</b> they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks <b>on</b> <b>humans</b> are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E
50|$|Regional {{human rights}} regimes are {{relatively}} independently coherent human rights sub-regimes. that are nested {{within the larger}} frame work of International human rights practise. Three principle regional human rights instruments can be identified, the African Charter <b>on</b> <b>Human</b> and Peoples' Rights, the American Convention <b>on</b> <b>Human</b> Rights (the Americas) and the European Convention <b>on</b> <b>Human</b> Rights.|$|R

5|$|In early 1942, Zyklon B {{emerged as}} the {{preferred}} killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust. Around a million people were killed using this method, mostly at Auschwitz. Tesch was executed in 1946 for knowingly selling the product to the SS for use <b>on</b> <b>humans.</b> Hydrogen cyanide is now rarely used as a pesticide, but still has industrial applications. Firms in several countries continue to produce Zyklon B under alternative brand names, including Detia-Degesch, the successor to Degesch, who renamed the product Cyanosil in 1974.|$|E

They encounter two of Strucker's test subjects—twins Pietro Maximoff, who has superhuman speed, and Wanda Maximoff, who can manipulate minds and project energy—and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that some behaviours might be homologous, based either on sharing across related taxa or on common origins of the behaviour in an individual's development, though this remains controversial. For example, D. W. Rajecki and Randall C. Flanery, using data <b>on</b> <b>humans</b> and on nonhuman primates, argue that patterns of behaviour in dominance hierarchies are homologous across the primates.|$|E

5|$|One {{problem with}} {{counting}} attacks <b>on</b> <b>humans</b> {{is that the}} copper shark is so similar to other requiem sharks. Victims and witnesses are unlikely to correctly identify which type of genus Carcharhinus shark {{is responsible for the}} attack. Experts trying to confirm shark attacks by species warn that their statistics undercount the number of attacks by requiem sharks like the copper.|$|E
5|$|Tephrosia apollinea {{is known}} to be toxic to goats. Although it has been used in Oman to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, nasal {{congestion}} and wounds and bone fractures, as of 1993 its wider impact <b>on</b> <b>humans</b> had not been assessed. It {{can be used to make}} indigo dyes, and the leaves and those of other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} alcohol on bees are {{sufficiently}} {{similar to the}} effects of alcohol <b>on</b> <b>humans</b> that honey bees have been used as models of human ethanol intoxication. However, the metabolism of bees and humans is sufficiently different that bees can safely collect nectars from plants that contain compounds toxic to humans. The honey produced by bees from these toxic nectars can be poisonous if consumed by humans. Many humans have eaten toxic honey and become seriously ill as a result.|$|E

5|$|The {{wildebeest}} {{benefit the}} ecosystem by increasing soil fertility with their excreta. They are economically important {{for human beings}} as they are a major tourist attraction. They also provide important products like leather to humans. The wildebeest, however, can also {{have a negative impact}} <b>on</b> <b>humans.</b> Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E
5|$|Though rarely {{encountered}} {{because of}} its oceanic habitat, a handful of documented attacks <b>on</b> <b>humans</b> were apparently caused by cookiecutter sharks. Nevertheless, this diminutive shark is not regarded as highly dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the cookiecutter shark under Least Concern, as it is widely distributed, has no commercial value, and is not particularly susceptible to fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Weather, {{seen from}} an anthropological perspective, is {{something}} all humans {{in the world}} constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside.
