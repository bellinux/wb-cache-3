30|$|Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) with {{conversational}} dialogue form {{a special}} category <b>of</b> <b>ITSs.</b> The development <b>of</b> conversational <b>ITSs</b> such as DeepTutor {{is driven by}} explanation-based constructivist theories of learning and the collaborative constructive activities that occur during human tutoring (Rus et al. 2013). Conversational ITSs have several advantages over other types <b>of</b> <b>ITSs.</b> They encourage deep learning as {{students are required to}} explain their reasoning and reflect on their basic approach to solving a problem. Such conceptual reasoning is more challenging and beneficial than mechanical application of mathematical formulas (Hestenes et al. 1992). Furthermore, conversational ITSs have the potential of giving students the opportunity to learn the language of scientists, an important goal in science literacy. A student associated with a more shallow understanding of a science topic uses more informal language as opposed to more scientific accounts (Mohan et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Designing an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) usually {{requires}} precise {{models of the}} underlying domain, {{as well as of}} how a human tutor would respond to student mistakes. As such, the applicability <b>of</b> <b>ITSs</b> is typically restricted to well-defined domains where such a formalization is possible. The extension <b>of</b> <b>ITSs</b> to ill-defined domains constitutes a challenge. In this paper, we propose the provision of feedback based on solution spaces which are automatically clustered by machine learning techniques operating on sets of student solutions. We validated our approach in an expert evaluation with a data set from a programming course. The evaluation confirmed the feasibility of the proposed feedback provision strategies. ...|$|R
