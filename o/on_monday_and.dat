5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} record chart in the United Kingdom. Until 1983, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry with a two-week break each Christmas. The BMRB used motorcycle couriers to collect the sales figures taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. This data was compiled <b>on</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>and</b> given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Music Week. On 4 January 1983, the chart was taken over by Gallup who expanded the chart from the Top 75 to the Top 100 and began the introduction of computerised tills which automated the data collection process. The chart was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets and announced on Tuesday until October 1987, when the Top 40 was revealed each Sunday, due to the new automated process.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} record chart in the United Kingdom. In the 1970s, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry with a one-week break each Christmas. Prior to 1969 many music papers compiled their own sales charts but, on 15 February 1969, the BMRB was commissioned in a joint venture by the BBC and Record Retailer to compile the chart. BMRB compiled the first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops. The sampling cost approximately £52,000 and shops were randomly chosen and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. The data was compiled <b>on</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>and</b> given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Record Retailer (rebranded Music Week in 1972). However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post. The 1971 postal strike meant that data had to be collected by telephone but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart, and by 1973 the BMRB was using motorcycle couriers to collect sales figures.|$|E
