40|$|Das Konzept der Nachhaltigkeit beinhaltet viele Gegens 4 tze in Form von Widerspr, Konflikten, Dilemmata, Paradoxa und double-bind-Kommunikationen. Um diese Gegens 4 tze zu bew 4 ltigen bedarf es deren vorheriger Identifikation. Die Beschreibung von Gegens 4 tzen der Nachhaltigkeit sind Ziele des folgenden Arbeitspapiers. Eine Literaturrecherche offenbart, dass verschiedene Begriffe, die dem Term "Gegensatz" nahe stehen, {{verwendet}} werden. Diese verschiedenen Begriffe f Entgegensetzungen, wie Polarit 4 t und Dualismus, Widerspruch und Gegensatz, Paradox und Antinomie, Dilemma und Aporie sowie double-bind und Konflikt, werden in dem Arbeitspapier erl 4 utert und systematisiert. Diese Systematik dient dann als Ausgangspunkt f eine weitere Literaturrecherche zu Gegens 4 tzen der Nachhaltigkeit und zu deren Klassifizierung. Ergebnis des Arbeitspapiers ist zum einen ein konzeptioneller Rahmen zu Begriffen f Entgegensetzungen und zum anderen die Anwendung des konzeptionellen Rahmens auf Gegens 4 tze der Nachhaltigkeit. Diese Anwendung kann als inhaltlicher Ansatzpunkt f die Bew 4 ltigung der beschriebenen Gegens 4 tze der Nachhaltigkeit sowie als Ausgangspunkt f das Expansive Lernen im Rahmen von Nachhaltigkeit genutzt werden. Expansives Lernen anhand von Gegens 4 tzen der Nachhaltigkeit soll in einem kommenden Projekt der Professur f Innovationsforschung und Technologiemanagement der TU Chemnitz erforscht werden. The {{concept of}} sustainability {{is characterized by}} a lot <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> in terms <b>of</b> contradictions, conflicts, dilemmas, paradoxes and double binds in communication. There is a need to identify these oppositions in order to cope with them. The aim of the paper is to describe these <b>oppositions</b> <b>of</b> sustainability. The literature research revealed various terms which are associated with the term of "opposition". In a first step, I define and classify the terms of "polarity" and "dualism", "contradiction" and "contrariety", "paradox" and "antinomy", "dilemma" and "aporia", "double bind" and "conflict". Based on this I use this classification <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> {{as a starting point for}} a further literature research on practical examples <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> <b>of</b> sustainability. The results of the working paper are a conceptual framework associated with "opposition" as well as its application on <b>oppositions</b> <b>of</b> sustainability. This application can be used as a basis for the overcoming <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> <b>of</b> sustainability as well as a starting point for the approach of expansive learning in the context of sustainability. Expansive Learning on the basis <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> <b>of</b> sustainability will be researched in a forthcoming project of the Professorship for Innovation Research and Technology Management of TU Chemnitz...|$|R

Sadek cited studies in <b>opposition</b> <b>of</b> a limited offensive; Egyptian analyses estimated 17,000 casualties in a canal crossing, while Soviet estimates placed casualty figures at 35,000 troops. Sadek stressed the immense losses that would be sustained would overshadow any military and political gains from a limited offensive, which required following up by liberating all or most of the Sinai.|$|E
