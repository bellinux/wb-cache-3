The poisonous influences of the chemical substances contained in heavy oil on many kinds of marine organisms are widely studied. However, the influence of the chemical compounds in heavy oil on our health has not been cleared yet. In order to reveal the poisonous influences of these chemical compounds on mammalian reproductive system, water-soluble fraction (WSF) extracted from heavy oil was administrated to mice for 2 weeks. WSF-administrated mice were crossed with either WSF- or distilled water-administrated group for mating experiment. When WSF-administrated male mice were used as a father, it reduced not only mating ratio, but also neonatal male ratio. The numbers <b>of</b> <b>sperms</b> <b>of</b> WSF-administrated male mice were decreased. In addition, abnormality <b>of</b> <b>sperms</b> such as bent or twisted tail was increased approximately 6 -fold by WSF intake. The level of testosterone in serum from WSF-administrated mice was lower than that from control mice. Testosterone is the most important for the spermatogenesis in vertebrate.

40|$|Introduction Automated {{methods for}} sperm {{characterization}} in microscopic videos have some limitations such as: low contrast {{of the video}} frames and possibility <b>of</b> neighboring <b>sperms</b> to touch each other. In this paper a new method is introduced for detection <b>of</b> <b>sperms</b> in microscopic videos. Materials and Methods In this work, first microscopic videos are captured from specimens of human semen. Several frames of these videos are transformed to wavelet sub-bands and bit-related planes are constructed from wavelet sub-bands separately. Finally, the acquired bit planes are mapped by different local mapping functions and decision is made using continuity and discontinuity of the mapping results. Based on the above decision procedure, each region of the microscopic image is assigned to either a sperm or other parts of semen. Results Performance of the proposed method was evaluated by two sets of microscopic videos which have been captured from semen of some infertile men. The first sets belonged to semen specimens with low densities <b>of</b> <b>sperms</b> and the second set belonged to semen specimens with high densities <b>of</b> <b>sperms.</b> Conclusion The {{results of this study}} revealed that the proposed method in this work is more efficient in sperm detection and extraction compared with the current approaches in both scenarios. Furthermore, it is evident that for specimens with higher sperm densities the proposed method improved sperm detection also reduces false detection rate considerably...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of repeated semen collection and the substitution of normal egg yolk with clarified egg yolk to commercially produced semen extender on qualitative parameters of frozen-thawed canine semen. Two semen collections were scheduled in a 24 -hour interval and in each of six dogs, three 1 st and three 2 nd collections were performed. The frozen-thawed sperm samples were prepared either with clarified or normal egg yolk and motility and viability were evaluated. The effect of the sequence of semen collection was demonstrated by significant differences in motility and also in viability <b>of</b> <b>sperms</b> both in native and frozen-thawed ejaculate. The percentage <b>of</b> viable <b>sperms</b> was significantly higher in samples from the 2 nd compared to the 1 st collection. This trend was the same also in motility except in native ejaculate. The addition of clarified egg yolk was beneficial for higher survival <b>of</b> <b>sperms</b> immediately after thawing and also after 30 min of incubation, compared to samples with normal egg yolk. Sperm motility evaluated after thawing was higher in samples with clarified egg yolk, without an apparent connection with semen collection sequence. The decrease of values of the qualitative parameters <b>of</b> <b>sperms</b> observed in the period of 30 min of incubation was significantly slowed down when clarified egg yolk was used.

5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts <b>of</b> <b>sperm</b> allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production <b>of</b> <b>sperm,</b> and birth defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E

40|$|Alpha {{zearalenol}} is a derivative of the mycotoxin zearalenone, {{which is}} {{commonly found in}} agricultural crops and commercial feed. It is a secondary metabolite of filamentous fungi of the genus Fusarium. The alpha zearalenol {{is the result of}} a biotransformation of zearalenone in the liver and intestinal tissue. When the zearalenone is metobolised this way, it is able to compete for the binding sites of estrogen receptors because the structure is very similar to 17 beta estradiol. Toxicity of alpha zearalenol therefore lies in an estrogenic stimulation, which induces morphological and functional changes in the reproductive organs and gametes. Toxicity is manifested on the male gamete by reducing viability, motility and the portion <b>of</b> <b>sperms</b> capable <b>of</b> undergoing acrosome reaction. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of alpha zearalenol on the hyperactivation and acrosome reaction <b>of</b> boar <b>sperm</b> depending on the concentration and duration of exposure to mycotoxins.

In this experimental study, we evaluate the effects <b>of</b> MAMP on <b>sperm</b> parameters <b>of</b> mature rat. Methods: MAMP or saline were injected in three experiments as follow: In the first experiment, twenty-four rats were injected one time with 10 mg/kg MAMP, and sperms were sampled from tail of epididymis 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h after injection (n= 4, at each time). Six rats injected with saline served as controls. In the second experiment, four groups of rats each consisting of four rats were administered MAMP (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg) or saline, respectively, and examined 24 h later. In the third experiment, 16 rats were evenly divided into four groups (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg MAMP and control) and were injected MAMP or saline once daily for 14 consecutive days (spermatogenesis period) and sperms were sampled 24 h after the last injection. The motility, concentration and morphology <b>of</b> the sampled <b>sperms</b> were evaluated. We also measured the body and testis weights and used the testis/body weight ratio as an index {{at the end of}} each experiment. Results: At 24 and 48 h after injection with a single dose of 10 mg/kg MAMP, the number <b>of</b> <b>sperms</b> decreased significantly in comparison with controls (P≤ 0. 001 and P≤ 0. 05 respectively). In the second experiment, the number <b>of</b> <b>sperms</b> for three doses of MAMP significantly decreased in the two upper doses (P< 0. 001) and in the lower dose (P≤ 0. 05). The results of the third experiment were similar but the decrease <b>of</b> <b>sperms</b> number was more than that in the second experiment. MAMP did not change the testis/body weight ratio in the first and second experiments, but it significantly decreased this index in rats of the third experiment which received 10 and 5 mg/kg MAMP daily. We did not observe differences between experimental and control groups in motility and morphology <b>of</b> <b>sperms.</b> Conclusion: Our results indicate that the repeated administration and/or higher doses of MAMP reduce the number <b>of</b> mature <b>sperms</b> in the tail of epididymis and have adverse effects on the reproduction and fertility of MAMP users.
