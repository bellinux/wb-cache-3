5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts are one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, {{as well as}} their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E
