5|$|The conservationists, governments, and {{non-governmental}} organizations that endorse the strategy {{argue that it}} fosters {{public support for the}} protection of elephants and that it sends a message to poachers their work is futile. Critics contend that the technique may increase poaching by creating a perception <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> that increases ivory's value on the black market, and that evidence for the technique's effectiveness is insufficient to justify the opportunity cost for countries struggling with poverty.|$|E
5|$|Although wolves {{primarily}} feed {{on medium}} to large sized ungulates, {{they are not}} fussy eaters. Smaller sized animals that may supplement the diet of wolves include marmots, hares, badgers, foxes, weasels, ground squirrels, mice, hamsters, voles and other rodents, as well as insectivores. They frequently eat waterfowl and their eggs. When such foods are insufficient, they prey on lizards, snakes, frogs, rarely toads and large insects as available. In times <b>of</b> <b>scarcity,</b> wolves readily eat carrion, visiting cattle burial grounds and slaughter houses. Cannibalism is not uncommon in wolves: during harsh winters, packs often attack weak or injured wolves, and may eat the bodies of dead pack members. Wolf packs in Astrakhan hunt Caspian seals on the Caspian Sea coastline and some wolf packs in Alaska and Western Canada have been observed to feed on salmon. Humans are rarely, but occasionally preyed upon. Other primates occasionally taken by wolves include grey langurs in Nepal and hamadryas baboons in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} {{the logic of}} the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices and lead to an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception <b>of</b> <b>scarcity,</b> if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also lead to an increase in poaching.|$|E

5|$|The least weasel feeds {{predominantly}} on mouse-like rodents, including mice, hamsters, gerbils and others. It {{usually does}} not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten. It {{can deal with}} adult pikas and gerbils, but usually cannot overcome brown rats and sousliks. Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel hen and hares. In England, a favoured prey item is the field vole (Microtus agrestis). These have fluctuations in population size, and in years of abundance may form up to 54% of the weasel's diet. In years <b>of</b> <b>scarcity,</b> birds form {{a greater proportion of}} the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed.|$|E
5|$|Tigers usually {{prefer to}} eat prey they have caught themselves, {{but are not}} above eating carrion in times <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> and may even pirate prey from other large carnivores. Although predators {{typically}} avoid one another, if a prey item is under dispute or a serious competitor is encountered, displays of aggression are common. If these are not sufficient, the conflicts may turn violent; tigers may kill competitors as leopards, dholes, striped hyenas, wolves, bears, pythons, and crocodiles on occasion. Tigers may also prey on these competitors. Attacks on smaller predators, such as badgers, lynxes, and foxes, are almost certainly predatory. Crocodiles, bears, and large packs of dholes may win conflicts against tigers {{and in some cases}} even kill them.|$|E
5|$|Nectar-eating bats have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, extensible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. The tube-lipped nectar bat (Anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial {{to them in}} terms of pollination and feeding. Their long, narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers. When the tongue retracts, it coils up inside the rib cage. However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times <b>of</b> <b>scarcity,</b> making them more prone to extinction than any other type of bat. Nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as pollinators (as pollen can get attached to their fur while they are feeding). Around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night. Rainforests are said to benefit the most from bat pollination, because of the large variety of plants that depend on it.|$|E
