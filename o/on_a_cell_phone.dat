5|$|Forfeit: A {{player who}} cheats, or violates {{the rules of}} the game, or violates the rules {{specified}} for the particular tournament can be forfeited. In high-level tournaments, players have been forfeited for such things as arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds), receiving a call or text <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone,</b> refusing to undergo a drug test, refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices, and unsporting behavior (such as refusing to shake the opponent's hand).|$|E
5|$|During {{a school}} {{trip to a}} camp, a nude video of Anju is taken <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> camera hidden in the bathroom. The culprit is {{revealed}} as Varun, {{the son of the}} Inspector-general of police, Geetha. When Varun meets Anju later to blackmail her, she breaks his cell phone and inadvertently kills him. With her mother's help, she hides his body in a compost pit that was originally made for manure. Unbeknownst to them, this is witnessed by Anu. Jyothi tells Rambabu about the incident and he devises a plan to save his family from imprisonment. He gets rid of the broken cell phone. However, as he is disposing of Varun's car, Rambabu is seen by a corrupt police constable named Veerabhadram, who holds a grudge against him. Rambabu then takes his family out on a trip to Vizianagaram, where they attend a religious meeting, watch a movie and dine at a restaurant.|$|E

That night, Revis was charged for aggravated assault, robbery, terroristic threats and conspiracy stemming. Revis turned himself into police the following day and was released on non-monetary bond.

25|$|Some {{members of}} the {{community}} were outraged because Lifsh was taken from the scene by a private ambulance service while city emergency workers were still trying to free the children who were pinned under the car. Some believed that Gavin Cato died because the Hatzolah ambulance crew was unwilling to help non-Jews. There was a rumor at the time that Lifsh was intoxicated. A breath alcohol test administered within 70 minutes of the accident indicated this was not the case. Other rumors circulating shortly after the accident included: Lifsh was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone,</b> Lifsh did not have a valid driver's license, and that police prevented people, including Gavin Cato's father, from assisting in the rescue.|$|E
25|$|To date, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that Paulo Portas personally embezzled any funds from the submarines' purchase, and, since Portugal's 10-year statute of limitations for white collar crimes expired in 2014, he (or anyone else) can no longer be prosecuted even if incriminating evidence were to emerge some day. Still, the suspicions against Paulo Portas are unlikely to ever go away given the established facts that (i) he was the Minister in-charge at the time, which makes him the main figure in a controversial deal that, even if not tainted by his corruption, was disastrous for Portugal's finances; (ii) in contrast with his usual incisiveness on all other affairs of state, Paulo Portas has consistently been evasive about his role and any details of the submarines purchase; (iii) his CDS-PP party was shown to have been in close contact with one of the submarines' intermediaries (ESCOM) and to have received sizeable donations from fabricated sources shortly after (see Portucale case above); and (iv) Portas himself is on record saying he could not talk about the submarines deal <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> for fear of being wiretapped, which suggests he might have had something to hide.|$|E

30|$|We {{obtained}} workload ratings {{attributable to}} cognitive sources by comparing seven different concurrent tasks with a “single-task” condition where the drivers {{did not perform}} any concurrent secondary-task activity (Strayer et al., 2015 b). The seven tasks were {{listening to the radio}}, listening to <b>a</b> book <b>on</b> tape, talking to <b>a</b> passenger, talking <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hands-free <b>cell</b> <b>phone,</b> talking <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hand-held <b>cell</b> <b>phone,</b> interacting with <b>a</b> simple voice messaging system, and a cognitively demanding Operation Span (OSPAN) task that was used for calibration. 1 In our distraction scale, the non-distracted single-task driving anchored the low-end (category 1) and the mentally demanding OSPAN task anchored the high-end (category 5) of the scale. Using this method, we found that activities such as listening to the radio or an audio book were not very distracting. Other activities, such as conversing with a passenger or talking <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hand-held or hands-free <b>cell</b> <b>phone,</b> were associated with moderate increases in cognitive distraction. Finally, activities such as using a speech-to-text system to send and receive short text or e-mail messages produced a surprisingly high level of cognitive distraction.|$|R

While speaking with a passenger is as cognitively demanding as speaking with a friend over the phone, passengers are able to change the conversation based upon the needs of the driver.

50|$|All {{practical}} antennas are {{at least}} somewhat directional, although usually only the direction in the plane parallel to the earth is considered, and practical antennas can easily be omnidirectional in one plane. The most common types are the Yagi antenna, the log-periodic antenna, and the corner reflector antenna, which are frequently combined and commercially sold as residential TV antennas. Cellular repeaters often make use of external directional antennas to give a far greater signal than can be obtained <b>on</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> Satellite Television receivers usually use parabolic antennas.

50|$|Payment {{recovery}} firms {{specialize in}} getting vendors to return money inadvertently paid to them.

Another {{situation in which}} this might occur is when, for instance, a company places <b>a</b> deposit <b>on</b> <b>a</b> corporate <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> account {{in order to prevent}} service interruption {{in the event of a}} late payment. If the company then switches <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> providers, it may have difficulty collecting its deposit from the original provider. Accounts receivable staff who handle incoming payments seldom have authority to cut checks themselves, and in any case tend to place <b>a</b> lower priority <b>on</b> returning overpayments than in collecting back payments. Rather than spend time on hold working with vendors, many companies decide to turn the matter over to the experts.|$|R
40|$|Most consumer-facing online {{applications}} such as banking and e-commerce rely primarily on single-factor authentication schemes to authenticate users. Such schemes, while easy to use, suffer from easily exploitable security vulnerabilities that cost business billions of dollars per year. While alternative authentication mechanisms such as biometrics and two-factor schemes provide increased security, neither is currently viable for the consumer market. This project proposes an economically practical and user-friendly two-factor authentication mechanism that uses a familiar end-user device—the cell phone—as the second factor in authentication. The system implemented in this project includes a server component and a client component. The server piece is an enterprise-grade authentication server that features pluggable authenticators, configuration management, and identity management. The client piece consists of software that runs locally <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Java-enabled <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> to generate passcodes for multiple services. I...|$|R
