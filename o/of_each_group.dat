5|$|Each group plays a {{round-robin}} tournament, {{in which}} each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. This means that {{a total of six}} matches are played within a group. The last round of matches <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>group</b> is scheduled {{at the same time to}} preserve fairness among all four teams. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).|$|E

5|$|The {{knockout}} {{stage is}} a single-elimination tournament in which teams play {{each other in}} one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>group</b> plays against the runner-up of another group. This {{is followed by the}} quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} began in Seattle with {{the wild card}} matches on August 2, with the EHOME and Escape Gaming {{advancing}} to the round robin group stage the following day. The round robin group stage consisted of two groups of eight teams, with the top four teams <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>group</b> advancing to the upper bracket of the best-of-three double elimination main event, and the bottom four advancing to the lower bracket. The Grand Finals, consisting of {{the winners of the}} upper and lower brackets, took place in a best-of-five series between Wings Gaming and Digital Chaos, with the former winning the series 3–1.|$|E
5|$|A {{percentage}} <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>group</b> {{working in}} less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% {{of the total}} work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E

5|$|Saint and Elliot {{returned}} to Ecuador to work among the Huaorani (1958-1960), establishing a camp called Tihueno near a former Huaorani settlement. Rachel Saint and Dayuma became bonded in Huaorani eyes through their shared mourning and Rachel's adoption as a sister of Dayuma, taking the name Nemo from the latter's deceased youngest sister. The first Huaorani to settle there were primarily {{women and children}} from a Huaorani group called the Guiquetairi, but in 1968 an enemy Huaorani band known as the Baihuari joined them. Elliot had {{returned to}} the United States in the early 1960s, so Saint and Dayuma worked to alleviate the resulting conflict. They succeeded in securing cohabitation of the two groups by overseeing numerous cross-band weddings, leading to an end of inter-clan warfare but obscuring the cultural identity <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
5|$|Various {{advocacy}} groups have given Biden scores or grades {{as to how}} well his votes align with the positions <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>group.</b> The American Civil Liberties Union gives him an 80 percent lifetime score, with a 91 percent score for the 110th Congress. Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and supports governmental funding to find new energy sources. Biden believes action must be taken on global warming. He co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States {{to be a part}} of the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate. Biden was given an 85percent lifetime approval rating from AFL-CIO, and he voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E
