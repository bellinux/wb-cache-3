5|$|Wii Sports {{has been}} {{featured}} on television multiple times. The game {{was featured in}} commercials for the Wii system, and in news features on ABC and NBC. The game has appeared on various comedy shows. An episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien featured host Conan O'Brien competing against his guest, tennis star Serena Williams, in a match of Wii Sports tennis. On an episode of the Rick Mercer Report, former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien beat Rick Mercer {{in a game of}} Wii Sports boxing. The boxing game also appeared on an episode of The Colbert Report where a clip featured Mii versions of Stephen Colbert and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi boxing. At the 80th Academy Awards Show, host Jon Stewart and Jamia Simone Nash were caught playing Wii Sports tennis on one of the event's gigantic projection screens after a commercial break as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> Wii Sports has also been featured in mainstream movies such as Tropic Thunder and in commercials for products such as Kellogg's Smart Start.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Mavis starts dating {{the equally}} shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), {{but it remains}} platonic. Jerry dies {{of a heart attack}} in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets {{salesman}} Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek– feeling the same way she does– did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> but neither care as they are genuinely in love. They spend evenings reading aloud to each other and discussing the events of the day. They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years.|$|E
25|$|The very use of obscene Russian vocabulary, called mat, {{can enhance}} the humorous effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> by its {{emotional}} impact. Due to the somewhat different cultural attitude to obscene slang, such an effect is difficult to render in English. The taboo status often makes mat itself the subject <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> One typical plot goes as follows.|$|E

25|$|Louis C.K. had Gervais play Dr. Ben, {{his doctor}} on two episodes of his series Louie. Gervais would break into his {{trademark}} hysterical laugh every time his character made Louie the butt <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b>|$|E
25|$|Agents may modify schemas {{even though}} their use does not predictably {{accumulate}} resources. For example, the effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> is never quite certain, but a comedian may alter it based {{on the amount of}} laughter it garners regardless of this variability.|$|E
50|$|A long running {{advertisement}} {{for the film}} in Variety was the source <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recurring <b>joke</b> on Mystery Science Theater 3000.|$|R
5000|$|It {{often has}} the flavor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joking</b> apology or excuse, {{particularly}} to other Jews, {{for having been}} caught celebrating a custom that is agreeable but not quite proper. Thus, we read in a novel: [...] "Louis was so unorthodox I caught him buying a Christmas tree one night.... Louis tried to fob it off as a Hanukkah bush.""Did you ream him out?""Of course. As we were carrying it home. I was merciless." ...|$|R

25|$|On 2 February 2005, at the {{birthday}} party of the Hungarian Socialist Party, for the sake <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> Gyurcsány referred to the players of the Saudi national football team as terrorists. Later he apologized, but the kingdom recalled its ambassador from Hungary for a time.|$|E
25|$|The Crown Prosecution Service had a week {{to decide}} if it would seek a retrial on the {{remaining}} charge, but no further action was taken as it was known that Whatley licked the faces {{of many of his}} co-workers as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> amongst Ideal World staff.|$|E
25|$|Years {{after the}} war, {{memories}} faded {{and in the}} public mind it became popular to assume that the few pillboxes and other concrete objects that could easily be seen were all that was done to defend Britain; that their purpose was just to bolster morale and that {{there would have been no}} realistic hope of resisting a German assault. Even the Home Guard came to be seen as something <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> as exemplified by the BBC sitcom Dad's Army. However, what can be seen today are just the most visible and robust remains of a massive programme of fortification undertaken in a very short period.|$|E

5000|$|The {{contemporary}} ceremonies {{used this}} interplay in somewhat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joking</b> way. After the first day, related ceremonies and rituals took place. Males showed their [...] "strength" [...] {{in front of}} women by fighting spirits (who were other males but the women supposedly did not know it) in some theatrical fights. Each spirit was played with traditional actions, words and gestures, so that everyone could identify it. The best spirit actors from previous Hains were called again to impersonate spirits in later Hains.|$|R
25|$|In 1989, {{during a}} city council race, many in Sharpstown voted for Jim Westmoreland for an at-large position. In one precinct 68.5 {{percent of the}} voting {{residents}} voted for him. Westmoreland drew controversy after reports <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> that was characterized as racist spread. Westmoreland was defeated in that race. In a 1989 Houston Chronicle article, Nancy Palm, a Republican Party activist from western Houston, said that the residents who voted for Westmoreland had social ties with them and {{did not see the}} controversy as significant. In the first 1991 Mayor of Houston election most Sharpstown voters voted for Bob Lanier. By December 3, 1991, increases in crime and changes of demographics in southwestern Houston neighborhoods lead to many challengers desiring to fill the city council seat of District F. In 2005 Khan promoted an anti-graffiti campaign in Sharpstown and other communities in his district.|$|E
25|$|Life {{in his own}} monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard {{himself was}} partly responsible. He took a sort of {{malicious}} pleasure in irritating the monks. As if for the sake <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> he cited Bede {{to prove that the}} believed founder of the monastery of St Denis, Dionysius the Areopagite had been Bishop of Corinth, while the other monks relied upon the statement of the Abbot Hilduin that he had been Bishop of Athens. When this historical heresy led to the inevitable persecution, Abelard {{wrote a letter to the}} Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica and St. Jerome, according to whom Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey, though, in deference to Bede, he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Adam accused him of insulting both the monastery and the Kingdom of France (which had Denis as its patron saint); life in the monastery grew intolerable for Abelard, and he was finally allowed to leave.|$|E
25|$|Skillet {{formed in}} 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee {{progressive}} rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor {{encouraged them to}} form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains {{that it was a}} joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet {{to come up with something}} unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.|$|E

5000|$|The {{humor of}} such jokes {{is based on}} the {{surprise}} factor <b>of</b> absence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expected <b>joke</b> or <b>of</b> <b>a</b> punch line in a narration which is set up as <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> This kind <b>of</b> anticlimax {{is similar to that of}} the shaggy dog story. In fact, some researchers see the [...] "shaggy dog story" [...] as <b>a</b> type <b>of</b> anti-joke.|$|R
5000|$|In 1904 {{the waters}} of Hague bay were home of the Lake George Monster. [...] The [...] "monster" [...] was the {{creation}} of Harry Watrous, and was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> practical <b>joke.</b>|$|R
500|$|In the insert song [...] "nowhere", {{there is}} a {{frequently}} repeated background refrain [...] It doesn't have any particular meaning but since the song usually plays when Madlax is fighting, [...] "Yanmaani" [...] has become something <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> to Japanese fans, claiming that it apparently gives her superpowers.|$|E
500|$|Henderson {{served as}} an {{assistant}} to his former coach Carmody during Carmody's first eleven seasons as the coach at Northwestern University. Carmody used Henderson, who commonly scrimmaged with the players, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> for a Sports Illustrated: [...] "I don't mind that Mitch is cagier and smarter than all those guys on the court. The thing that bothers me is that he's faster than all of them." [...] During Henderson's final three seasons at Northwestern, the team qualified for the National Invitation Tournament.|$|E
500|$|In 1973 Peter Sellers {{introduced}} Harrison to Denis O'Brien. Soon after, the two {{went into}} business together. In 1978, {{in an effort}} to produce Monty Python's Life of Brian, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Harrison explained: [...] "The name of the company came about as a bit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> I'd been to Wooky Hole in Somerset... an old paper mill where they show you how to make old underpants into paper. So I bought a few rolls, and they had this watermark 'British Handmade Paper'... So we said... we'll call it Handmade Films." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Mark Farner-written Grand Funk Railroad cover, [...] "Paranoid," [...] was <b>a</b> bit <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inside <b>joke,</b> as Butthole Surfers owned {{a female}} pit bull named Mark Farner of Grand Funk Railroad.|$|R
50|$|Eamie Kissane {{would have}} been {{generally}} described as a natural genius and <b>a</b> small sample <b>of</b> his art is featured in The Ballydonoghue Parish Magazine.

5000|$|In the 2009 film, {{the mystery}} {{regarding}} Uhura's first name {{is the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> running <b>joke</b> as Kirk repeatedly tries {{to find out what}} it is before finally hearing Spock call her [...] "Nyota".|$|R
500|$|Neild's adventures {{had seen}} him lose respect in his {{political}} career, and he was now openly mocked in the Senate chamber, becoming something <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke.</b> He introduced a number of bills in his remaining {{five years in the}} Senate, all of which lapsed. He spoke in support of Muslim camel drivers and opposed military training for boys, and continued to oppose elements of the White Australia policy, raising concerns about Australian-born children of Kanaka labourers: [...] "They will have difficulties enough in front of them in a country that is so rampantly strong on the white Australia policy without our making their case worse." [...] Neild was defeated at the 1910 election.|$|E
500|$|This {{novel was}} widely popular {{and led to}} García Márquez's Nobel Prize {{as well as the}} Rómulo Gallegos Prize in 1972. William Kennedy has called it [...] "the first piece of {{literature}} since the Book of Genesis that should be required reading for the entire human race," [...] and hundreds of articles and books of literary critique have been published in response to it. Despite the many accolades the book received, García Márquez tended to downplay its success. He once remarked: [...] "Most critics don't realize that a novel like One Hundred Years of Solitude is a bit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke,</b> full of signals to close friends; and so, with some pre-ordained right to pontificate they take on the responsibility of decoding the book and risk making terrible fools of themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 21, 1922, Constable Steve Lawson of the Alberta Provincial Police {{was murdered}} at his Blairmore home by bootlegger Emil Picariello and his {{companion}} Florence Lassandra. [...] He {{was the third}} policeman killed in Alberta in liquor-related incidents in 1922. [...] The murder opened up a rift between Albertans of British descent, who saw bootlegging as an affront {{to the rule of}} law even if they did not support prohibition, and Albertans of southern and eastern European descent, who found prohibition to be something <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>joke</b> and accepted bootlegging. [...] Brownlee authorized the deployment of special constables to apprehend Picariello and Lassandra. [...] Once they were arrested, he appeared personally at the prosecution's bench alongside A. A. McGillivray, reputedly Alberta's best courtroom lawyer, whose services he secured specifically for the case. [...] Picariello and Lassandra were convicted and sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} component <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dick <b>joke</b> is breaking <b>a</b> social taboo. As a Canadian comedian Ricky Blue puts it: [...] "The trick {{is being able}} to speak the unspeakable and somehow get away with it." ...|$|R
