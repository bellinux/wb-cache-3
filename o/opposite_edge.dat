5|$|The Crown Roller Mills {{building}} {{is not in}} Princes Street itself, but rather lies {{at the foot of}} Manor Place, close to its intersection with Princes Street. It stands {{at the edge of a}} small area of parkland called the Market Reserve, at the <b>opposite</b> <b>edge</b> of which is the city's main bus depot. This area was swampland when the first European settlers arrived in Dunedin, but was reclaimed and did host a regular market for a few years from the 1870s. The market was not well-supported, however, and eventually folded. The bus depot is located on the site of the city's 1902 Tram workshops. The Market Reserve also contains a children's playground and, at the edge closes to the Crown Roller Mills Building, a small monument dedicated to Otago workers who have lost their lives while at work. This simple bluestone memorial was erected in 2003 by the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions on a site donated by the Dunedin City Council.|$|E

This is often not necessary, because acceleration software detects fast movement, and moves the pointer significantly faster in proportion than for slow mouse motion.|$|E
25|$|Gaspard Monge found {{a center}} {{that exists in}} every {{tetrahedron}}, {{now known as the}} Monge point: the point where the six midplanes of a tetrahedron intersect. A midplane is defined as a plane that is orthogonal to an edge joining any two vertices that also contains the centroid of an <b>opposite</b> <b>edge</b> formed by joining the other two vertices. If the tetrahedron's altitudes do intersect, then the Monge point and the orthocenter coincide to give the class of orthocentric tetrahedron.|$|E

25|$|If X plays corner opening move (best {{move for}} them), O should take center, {{and then an}} edge, forcing X to block in the next move. This will stop any forks from happening. When both X and O are perfect players and X chooses to start by marking a corner, O takes the center, and X takes the corner {{opposite}} the original. In that case, O is free to choose any edge as its second move. However, if X is not a perfect player and has played a corner and then an edge, O should not play the <b>opposite</b> <b>edge</b> as its second move, because then X is not forced to block in the next move and can fork.|$|E
25|$|Figure 19a {{shows the}} network of boron icosahedra in the boron {{framework}} of ScB19+xSiy. In this network, 4 icosahedra form a supertetrahedron (figure 18b); its one edge {{is parallel to the}} a-axis, and the icosahedra on this edge make up a chain along the a-axis. The <b>opposite</b> <b>edge</b> of the supertetrahedron is parallel to the b-axis and the icosahedra on this edge form a chain along the b-axis. As shown in figure 19, there are wide tunnels surrounded by the icosahedron arrangement along the a- and b-axes. The tunnels are filled by the B22 units which strongly bond to the surrounding icosahedra; the connection of the B22 units is helical and it runs along the c-axis as shown in figure 19b. Scandium atoms occupy the voids in the boron network as shown in figure 19c, and the Si atoms bridge the B22 units.|$|E
25|$|In principle, the Life {{field is}} infinite, but {{computers}} have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches {{on the border}} of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program, but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a toroidal array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the <b>opposite</b> <b>edge.</b> Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but at least there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns.|$|E

25|$|Alpha sheet (also {{known as}} alpha pleated sheet or polar pleated sheet) is an {{atypical}} secondary structure in proteins, first proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951. The hydrogen bonding pattern in an alpha sheet {{is similar to}} that of a beta sheet, but the orientation of the carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide bond units is distinctive; in a single alpha strand, all of the carbonyl groups are oriented in the same direction on one side of the pleat, and all of the amino groups are oriented in the same direction on the opposite side of the sheet. Thus the alpha sheet accumulates an inherent separation of electrostatic charge, with one edge of the sheet exposing negatively charged carbonyl groups and the <b>opposite</b> <b>edge</b> exposing positively charged amino groups. Unlike the alpha helix and beta sheet, the alpha sheet configuration does not require all component amino acid residues to lie within a single region of dihedral angles; instead, the alpha sheet contains residues of alternating dihedrals in the traditional right-handed (αR) and left-handed (αL) helical regions of Ramachandran space. Although the alpha sheet is only rarely observed in natural protein structures, it has been speculated to play a role in amyloid disease and it was found to be a stable form for amyloidogenic proteins in one set of molecular dynamics simulations. Alpha sheets have also been observed in X-ray crystallography structures of designed peptides.|$|E

(For instance, the six points of a regular octahedron can be paired up in this way by an axial symmetry around a line through two <b>opposite</b> <b>edge</b> midpoints, although the Bricard octahedron resulting from this pairing would not be regular.) The octahedra have 12 edges, each of which connects two points that do not belong to the same symmetric pair as each other. These edges form the octahedral graph [...]|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} a Möbius strip can be created by taking a paper strip and giving it a half-twist, and then joining {{the ends of the}} strip to form a loop. However, the Möbius strip is not a surface of only one exact size and shape, such as the half-twisted paper strip {{depicted}} in the illustration. [...] Rather, mathematicians refer to the closed Möbius band as any surface that is homeomorphic to this strip. [...] Its boundary is a simple closed curve, i.e., homeomorphic to a circle. This allows for a very wide variety of geometric versions of the Möbius band as surfaces each having a definite size and shape. [...] For example, any rectangle can be glued to itself (by identifying one edge with the <b>opposite</b> <b>edge</b> after a reversal of orientation) to make a Möbius band. [...] Some of these can be smoothly modeled in [...] Euclidean space, and others cannot.|$|E
2500|$|Technically the 1796 heavy cavalry sword was a backsword, {{that is a}} sword with a {{straight}} blade with one cutting edge and the <b>opposite</b> <b>edge</b> of the blade (the [...] "back") thickened {{for most of its}} length to give added strength. The blade was [...] in length, with a single broad fuller each side. The grip was of ribbed wood, or wood bound with cord to resemble the same, and covered in leather. The iron backpiece of the grip had ears which were riveted through the tang of the blade to give the hilt and blade a very secure connection. The hilt combined a disc guard pierced with 2 semicircular and 6 oval (never circular) holes, with single knucklebow and two slim [...] long langets (projections from the guard, which gripped the throat of the scabbard) extending {{from the front of the}} guard. The langets were often removed and the left side of the guard ground away so as to reduce wear to uniforms. The latter modification would also have made it more comfortable to wear, especially on horseback.|$|E
