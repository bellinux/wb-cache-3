They {{were shown to}} jurors in Philadelphia during the July 2011 trial, but were then {{returned}} to Fort Knox, where they were to remain until {{a decision was made}} regarding their disposition. In April 2015, a United States federal appeals court ordered the coins returned to the Langbord family because the <b>original</b> <b>asset</b> seizure was conducted improperly, as the government failed to file a judicial civil forfeiture complaint within 90 days of the family's seized asset claim. This order was reversed on July 28, 2015, and in October 2015, an en banc session was held with 13 judges from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where they heard oral arguments in the ongoing appeal. On August 1, 2016, the judges reversed the previous ruling, finding the coins to be property of the United States government. The Langbords appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on April 17, 2017 denied certiorari.|$|E

50|$|Tactical asset {{allocation}} {{is a strategy}} in which an investor takes a more active approach that tries to position a portfolio into those assets, sectors, or individual stocks that show the most potential for perceived gains.

5000|$|Dynamic asset {{allocation}} {{is similar to}} strategic {{asset allocation}} in that portfolios are built by allocating to an asset mix that seeks to provide the optimal balance between expected risk and return for a long-term investment horizon. Like strategic allocation strategies, dynamic strategies largely retain exposure to their <b>original</b> <b>asset</b> classes; however, unlike strategic strategies, dynamic asset allocation portfolios will adjust their postures over time relative {{to changes in the}} economic environment.|$|E

50|$|If {{an asset}} is fungible, {{this means that}} if such an asset is lent, or placed with a custodian, it is {{customary}} for the borrower or custodian to be obliged {{at the end of}} the loan or custody arrangement to return assets equivalent to the <b>original</b> <b>asset,</b> rather than the specific identical asset. In other words, the redelivery of fungibles is equivalent and not in specie. For example, if an owner of 100 shares of IBM transfers custody of those shares to another party to hold for a purpose, {{at the end of the}} arrangement, the holder need simply provide the owner with 100 shares of IBM identical to those received. Cash is also an example of a fungible asset. The exact currency notes received need not be segregated and returned to the owner.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{remastering}} {{work was}} outsourced to the Shanghai-based studio Virtuos. Square Enix's internal staff was responsible for reassembling the <b>original</b> <b>assets,</b> and helped with a part of redoing the high-definition data. Among the returning original team members were Motomu Toriyama, Yusuke Naora, Toshitaka Matsuda and Masaki Kobayashi who supervised the production. X-2 art director Shintaro Takai remained in the same role for both remastered games. The Chinese side of development was headed by managing director Pan Feng. The team encountered problems in porting the games to PlayStation 3 and Vita as their graphics used many functionalities unique to the PlayStation 2 hardware. The loss and repair {{of some of the}} <b>original</b> <b>assets</b> posed another hurdle, with Kitase commenting that it might have been easier to recreate the data from the ground up.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the role of}} the nonrecourse financing of securitization by a financial institution (FI). Our model suggests that even though the FI has the opportunity to provide liquidity support afterward, it is optimal for the FI to use the nonrecourse financing of securitization initially, because the nonrecourse security makes liquidation of the <b>original</b> <b>asset</b> more attractive for an FI that knows that the <b>original</b> <b>asset</b> is bad. However, our model also predicts that the nonrecourse financing of securitization, together with short-term maturity financing, forces the financial system to perform inefficiently in handling troubled loans and causes problems with inefficient liquidity support and overinvestment under certain conditions, despite the nonrecourse property of securitization. The theoretical results provide empirical implications for recent problems with securitized and structured finance in the United States and Europe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—With {{the rapid}} {{development}} {{of colleges and}} universities in China, earth-shaking changes have taken place in both {{the quality and quantity of}} their national assets and the <b>original</b> <b>asset</b> management modalities have been lagging behind the pace of development. Therefore, how to effectively safeguard the interests of state-owned assets of universities, thus avoiding the waste and promoting value retaining and increment, has become a major problem. Combined with the actual work, this paper carries out a detailed analysis of five realistic issues, then extensively studies the outstanding experience of foreign counterparts, and finally summarizes seven ideas and suggestions for the reform of asset management.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{analyzing}} the efficient portfolio problem {{under the assumption}} that short sales are allowed is presented. It is based on the remarkable finding that the <b>original</b> <b>asset</b> set can be reorganized as a set of uncorrelated portfolios, here named principal portfolios. The original problem of portfolio selection from the existing, correlated assets is thereby traded for the reduced problem of choosing from a set of uncorrelated portfolios. These portfolios constitute a new investment environment of uncorrelated assets, thereby providing significant conceptual and practical simplification in any portfolio optimization process such as the determination of the efficient frontier. The principal portfolio analysis of the efficient frontier reveals new features of the volatility structure of the optimal portfolios. ...|$|E

40|$|Option pricing is an {{integral}} part of modern financial risk management. The well-known Black and Scholes (1973) formula is commonly used for this purpose. This paper is an attempt to extend their work to a situation in which the unconditional volatility of the <b>original</b> <b>asset</b> is increasing during a certain period of time. We consider a market suffering from a financial crisis. We provide the solution for the equation of the underlying asset price as well as finding the hedging strategy. In addition, a closed formula of the pricing problem is proved for a particular case. The suggested formulas are expected to make the valuation of options and the underlying hedging strategies during financial crisis more precise. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the virtual reconstruction of a dismantled and dispersed piece of art: the Funerary Complex of Arrigo VII. To faithfully reconstruct the monument, all of the statues and elements of the mausoleum have been acquired in digital 3 D format; then, with advanced computer graphics techniques, some of the accredited reconstructing hypothesis have been assembled and evaluated. 1. The case study The Arrigo VII Mausoleum {{was one of the}} most famous funerary monuments of the XIV century, perceived as a model by contemporaries. It was carried out by Tino di Camaino, an artist who played a big role in the birth of modern sculpture in Europe. Unfortunately, this masterpiece was dismantled soon after its completion and we lack any written or graphic document of the original mausoleum. A complex layout of the monument is indicated by the number, size, and iconography of the sculptures, making it quite different from other contemporary examples of funerary monuments. However, a 100 % sure reconstruction of the <b>original</b> <b>asset</b> is almost impossible; many hypothesis have been formulated since the end of the XIX century, but none of them looks really convincing...|$|E
40|$|Sherraden, 1991), {{interest}} in asset programs and {{their contribution to}} social policy has increased significantly. These programs have been widely discussed in the academic literature; large foundations have supported research and demonstration projects in the field; and legislative initiatives have fostered their wider implementation. In addition, variations on the asset approach have emerged to extend the <b>original</b> <b>asset</b> development idea both {{in this country and}} abroad (Ackerman & Alstott, 1999; Nissan & Le Grand, 2000). Although these developments represent a remarkable innovation in social policy, discussions about assets have been primarily concerned with technical matters and relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} their wider theoretical implications. Sherraden did devote a chapter to theoretical issues in Assets and the Poor, but he noted that more work was needed to give the asset approach a sound conceptual grounding. Unfortunately, there has been little subsequent discussion on how assets fit into broader systems of theoretical social policy analysis, or how they reflect the normative preferences inherent in welfare theories. While a preoccupation with the practicalities of program design, implementation and outcomes often results in an understandable neglect of theoretical considerations, theory plays a vital rol...|$|E
