5|$|As the Great Depression hit the United States, Fairbanks bucked {{the poor}} {{economic}} trend. Thanks to the Alaska Railroad, large gold dredges {{could be brought}} in, and these returned the area's gold mines to profitability. In 1938, Lathrop {{took advantage of the}} good economic situation by reviving the Alaska Miner as a weekly supplement to the News-Miner. The Miner covered happenings in the gold-mining camps outside Fairbanks and was focused <b>on</b> <b>areas</b> outside the city. In 1939, Fairbanks radio station KFAR was founded, and it shared the Lathrop building with the News-Miner, which occupied the bottom floors of the building.|$|E
5|$|In late November, Typhoon Durian brought {{even greater}} devastation to the Philippines and {{prompted}} greater need for international assistance. On December11, President Arroyo declared a national state of calamity and released 1billion PHP (US$25.6million) in relief and rehabilitation funds. Throughout 2006 as a whole, the Philippines was devastated by multiple natural disasters that collectively killed well over 1,000people and left more than US$1.6billion in damage. Consequently, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for emergency {{assistance to the}} nation, {{in the form of}} US$46million in funds for the most severely affected areas. The European Commission Humanitarian Aid department also provided €2million (US$1.9million) in emergency funds in relation to the four major typhoons that struck the country, with a focus <b>on</b> <b>areas</b> affected by Typhoon Durian. The Red Cross ultimately provided US$9.67million in assistance to the nation in relation to the four typhoons as well as Typhoon Fengshen in June 2008 which struck while relief efforts from the 2006 storms were still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these two gameplay types, Sonic Unleashed also features hubworlds, in which the player may reveal, as well as advance, {{the story of the}} game. Hubworlds operate differently depending on the version of the game being played; the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions feature fully interactive, explorable 3D hubworlds, similar to those in Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic Adventure, in which townspeople may be interacted with and side quests may be undertaken, in order to gain experience or unlock items, such as artwork, videos and music tracks. In contrast, the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions feature menu-based map systems, in which players simply click <b>on</b> <b>areas</b> to talk to townspeople and find information. Within both day and nighttime levels are medals that Sonic may collect, two types of which exist: Sun and Moon. In the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, collecting these medals allows the player to level up Sonic's Sun and Moon stats, and these must be increased to reach new stages in the game, with a certain number of Sun medals for Hedgehog levels, and a certain number of Moon medals for Werehog levels. Because only the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions feature playable hubworlds, these are also the only versions in which Sun and Moon medals may be found by exploring the towns, talking to the citizens, and completing side quests. In the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, Sun and Moon medals are earned after completing stages and clearing their objectives. The medals are used to open up doors in Gaia gates, which can earn bonus content.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{animation}} industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand. This is labor-intensive and inefficient; the cels {{are generally}} non-reusable, and errors {{are difficult to}} correct. This method is called the 2D approach due to the conception of the source images in only two dimensions. The use of computers and graphics software introduced computer graphics (CG) into the industry. This reduced waste; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes. Increasing computer power spread the use of three-dimensional graphics software to create 3D models and environments, and render them as 2D images. This 3D approach requires more resources to create the 3D models, but production teams can correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D approach. The 2D-3D hybrid approach in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns. The 2D approach allowed greater artistic details and creativity, and the 3D approach could save resources. Sato, however, disapproved the common notion of using the 3D approach for economic concern. He pushed the team to enhance image quality with detailed CG. He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects, and ordered the animators to draw them by hand. Due to the bright colors of the original cels, they darkened the images and concentrated <b>on</b> <b>areas</b> where shadows should be, leaving untouched the areas where light falls on.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisational}} {{ability of}} the government agencies charged with overseeing {{the integration of the}} refugees into society was frequently criticised by American officials. In many cases, the individual officials simply made their own decisions and the goal of resettling the northerners without disruption to the existing local economy or social structure was not achieved. In other cases, the northern Catholics formed their own committees and settled and built <b>on</b> <b>areas</b> as they saw fit. By the end of September, the shortage of funds and equipment had eased, but their distribution was not organised or coordinated effectively. At the same time, some Viet Minh cadres who stayed in the south after the partition pretended to be refugees and stirred up trouble inside the camps. Aside from disruption by communists, other non-communist movements such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng were strong in areas of central Vietnam, were opponents of Diem and some of them were military personnel. This sometimes caused hindrance in civilian-military cooperation in the resettlement program, as some of Diem's public servants were suspicious of the military's reliability as a working partner.|$|E
