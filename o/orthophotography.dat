40|$|Glacial retreat {{is one of}} {{the most}} evident impacts of climate change in high {{mountain}} areas. In the French Alps, data about glacier extensions were recently updated in the context of the new French glacier inventory. This inventory is based on manual delineation of the French National Geographical Institute (IGN) 50 -cm-pixel <b>orthophotographies</b> from 2006 to 2009 and IGN 1 / 25 000 topographical maps from the end of the 1960 s (1967 - 1971). Data are integrated in a GIS and topographic parameters are extracted from the IGN 25 -m-DEM for the glacier surface extension of the end of the 1960 s and the ASTER 30 -m-GDEM for the 2006 - 2009 extension. The present (2006 - 2009) glacier surface area in the French Alps is 275. 5 km 2. This surface decreased by 26 % since the end of the 1960 s when the glacier extension was 373 km 2. The surface area of 82 % of the glaciers is 2. 5 km 2 account for 3. 5 % of the glacier number and 47 % of the total glacier area. Glaciers with a length 2 km in length represent 10 % of this total. Glaciers > 1 km 2 have a gentle mean slope than glaciers 70 % in number). Average minimal (i. e. fronts), mean and maximal elevation of French Alpine glaciers is 2840 m (σ = 286 m), 3019 m (σ = 240 m), and 3210 m (σ = 289 m), respectively. Finally, more than 11 % of the surface area of the present glacier is debris-covered. Retreat rate mainly depends related on the glacier size classes or the aspect, and varies from one massif to another: glacier shrinkage in the Ecrins massif was more than three times stronger than in the French area of the Mont Blanc massif. We use a statistical approach in order to pinpoint topographical and glaciological controls on the glacier retreat. For each glacier size class, aspect and massif of the French Alps, we compared the glacier retreat during the 40 last years with several of the following parameters of the glacier: surface area; length; mean surface slope; mean aspect; minimal, mean, and maximal elevation; and debris cover area.

40|$|Digital <b>orthophotography</b> {{has been}} a {{powerful}} tool for large scale geometric documentation of monuments for over a decade. However, several factors prevent the smooth implementation of commercially available software for the production of digital orthophotos. The production of orthophotographs presents even more special problems, as it usually is a case of a highly demanding true orthophoto. Special techniques have been proposed in the past to address these problems in the best possible way. However no clearly defined solution to the above has been implemented. Terrestrial laser scanning techniques have helped the situation a lot, as they are able to provide a more detailed description of the object’s surface, a fact which contributes to a more successful implementation of traditional orthophoto production algorithms. However, even this solution is by no means complete, as it imposes limitations to the orientation of the stereopairs, the position of the projective planes for the final orthophoto and, of course, to the completeness of the final product. Several attempts {{have been reported in the}} past in order to help overcome these limitations. In this paper a novel and simple method developed for the production of <b>orthophotography</b> at large scales is described and assessed. This method successfully attempts to produce orthophotos at large scales using a point cloud and freely taken pictures of the object, thus achieving two goals. Firstly the user may work independently from the practical constraints imposed by the commercially available software and secondly there is no need for specialized knowledge for implementing complicated photogrammetric techniques, or specialized photogrammetric or pre-calibrated cameras, since self-calibration may take place, thus making the method attractive to non-photogrammetrists. 1. 1 <b>Orthophotography</b> 1...|$|E
