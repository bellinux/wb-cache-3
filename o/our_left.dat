2500|$|At 03:00 a British {{infantry}} {{advance in}} extended order began: [...] "Several shots rang out slightly to <b>our</b> <b>left</b> and then instantaneously {{the ground in}} front became alive with flashing rifles and machine guns, and hoarse shouts in guttural German and Turkish Arabic added to the increasing excitement." [...] Overrunning the first line of enemy trenches, [...] "orders now came to rally, and in a downpour of rain the first and second waves joined up and advanced {{in the face of a}} brisk fire from snipers and isolated enemy machine guns across the top of the redoubt. In the distance on all sides could be heard the shouts of the other attacking parties." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the village}} of Amoaful, the Ashantis succeeded in luring their opponents forward {{according}} to plan, and threatened them several times by flanking movements. Ashanti weaponry however, was poor compared to the modern weapons deployed by the redcoats, a point noted in the British accounts, and such superior arms served the British well in repulsing the Ashanti encirclements: [...] "The Ashantees stood admirably, and kept {{up one of the}} heaviest fires I ever was under. While opposing our attack with immediately superior numbers, they kept enveloping <b>our</b> <b>left</b> with a constant series of well-directed flank attacks." [...] Enemy commander General Garnet Wolesey had anticipated Ashanti tactics and had strengthened the British flanks with the best units and stronger firepower. The earlier successes of the African kingdom were thus not repeated.|$|E

2500|$|The Austrian field marshal's {{anxiousness}} is best {{explained by}} {{a letter he}} received from Emperor Francis I of Austria on 29 January. Francis wrote, [...] "We must not forget that the enemy can, from the South of France, move against <b>our</b> <b>left,</b> where the allies have few men, {{and that it is}} very necessary to hold strongly the road [...] which, in case of a check, would serve for retreat". Napoleon wanted Augereau to advance toward Chalon-sur-Saône to carry out the threat that Francis feared. On 21 February, Napoleon sent Augereau a letter urging the marshal to, [...] "pull on his boots of 1793". The emperor wrote, [...] "Count Bubna has no more than 10,000 miserable troops with which to oppose you, which will disappear like a fog before the sun".|$|E
2500|$|On June 4, 1966, Don Demeter and Julio Navarro were traded by the Detroit Tigers to the Boston Red Sox for outfielder Joe Christopher and pitcher Earl Wilson. The Red Sox {{had been}} {{attempting}} anywhere from several weeks to {{several months to}} obtain Demeter, offering a combination of catcher Bob Tillman and an infielder, but the Tigers continually rejected the offers. General manager Billy Herman had known Demeter {{ever since he was}} a coach for the Dodgers several years prior. Demeter was a player Herman wanted to acquire ever since he took the manager post in September 1964. [...] "He (Demeter) is a good hitter with power. I know he will take good advantage of <b>our</b> <b>left</b> field wall." [...] He went on to say, [...] "One of the things I like best about Demeter is that I can use him at five positions. He can play anywhere in the outfield, and he can play both first and third base. Don will shake up a few people on this club." [...] Herman cited that his then current plan was to put Demeter in center field, but was also considering playing him at third base, where Joe Foy had been struggling offensively. Herman also said he would start Demeter at first base for a few days should rookie first baseman George Scott need any sort of rest.|$|E
