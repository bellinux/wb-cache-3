5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects <b>owe</b> <b>their</b> existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{normally}} rotate cyclonically (when {{viewed from}} above, this is counterclockwise {{in the northern}} hemisphere and clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect, thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is unimportant, as indicated by their large Rossby numbers. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. Low-level mesocyclones and tornadoes <b>owe</b> <b>their</b> rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.|$|E

5|$|Turkey's varied landscapes are {{the product}} of complex earth {{movements}} that have shaped the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. The Bosphorus and the Dardanelles <b>owe</b> <b>their</b> existence to the fault lines running through Turkey that {{led to the creation of}} the Black Sea. The North Anatolian Fault Line runs across the north of the country from west to east, along which major earthquakes took place in history. The latest of those big earthquakes was the 1999 İzmit earthquake.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of this attention, {{existing}} acts like Yeah Yeah Yeahs were able to sign to major record labels. A second wave of bands that managed to gain international recognition {{as a result of}} the movement included Interpol, the Killers, the Catheters, Mooney Suzuki and the Go in the US, and Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, Maxïmo Park, Editors, the Cribs, the Libertines, the Fratellis, Razorlight and Kaiser Chiefs in the UK. Arctic Monkeys were the most prominent act to <b>owe</b> <b>their</b> initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking, with two No. 1 singles and Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), which became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.|$|E
5|$|The stave churches <b>owe</b> <b>their</b> {{longevity}} to architectural {{innovations that}} protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most {{important was the}} introduction of massive sills underneath the staves (posts) {{to prevent them from}} rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the Reformation, however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because they were too small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.|$|E

5|$|Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure {{are three}} action-adventure games {{produced}} by Philips for the CD-i {{as part of}} Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. Not designed for Nintendo platforms, the games <b>owe</b> <b>their</b> existence to negotiations related to Nintendo's decision not to have Philips create a CD add-on to the Super NES. During these negotiations, Philips secured the rights to use Nintendo characters in CD-i third-party developer games. The Faces of Evil and The Wand of Gamelon were developed by Animation Magic and were both released in North America on October 10, 1993, and Zelda's Adventure was developed by Viridis and was released in North America on June 5, 1994. The games were given little funding or time for completion, and Nintendo provided only cursory input.|$|E
5|$|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an {{edible root}} {{vegetable}} of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, {{and length of}} time they take to mature. Radishes <b>owe</b> <b>their</b> sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop. Some radishes are grown for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production. Others are used for sprouting.|$|E
5|$|Zahir, {{similar to}} other local strongmen in the Ottoman Empire who did not <b>owe</b> <b>their</b> power to the central Ottoman authorities, was disliked by the Ottoman administration. The Ottoman Sultan sent an order to the {{governor}} of Damascus Eyalet, Sulayman Pasha al-Azm, {{to put an end}} to Zahir's rule in Galilee. In September 1742, a military force led by the governor of Damascus came to Galilee and laid siege to Tiberias. After 83 days, the siege was lifted due to the departure of the Hajj pilgrim caravan. Using this respite, Zahir reinforced the defenses of Tiberias and Shefa-'Amr. In July 1743, backed by the Bani Saqr, the wali of Tripoli and the district governors of Jerusalem, Gaza and Irbid, Sulayman Pasha renewed his expedition, this time seeking to reduce Deir Hanna and sever Tiberias's links to the outside. Sulayman died suddenly in Lubya and Zahir used the opportunity to assault Sulayman's troops, capturing their camp. In 1745, Zahir had a fortress erected on a hill overlooking Saffuriya.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, wolves began recolonising central Sweden after a twelve-year absence, {{and have}} since {{expanded}} into southern Norway. As of 2005, {{the total number}} of Swedish and Norwegian wolves is estimated to be at least one hundred, including eleven breeding pairs. The gray wolf is fully protected in Sweden and partially controlled in Norway. The Scandinavian wolf populations <b>owe</b> <b>their</b> continued existence to neighbouring Finland's contiguity with the Republic of Karelia, which houses a large population of wolves. Wolves in Finland are protected only in the southern third of the country, and can be hunted in other areas during specific seasons, though poaching remains common, with 90% of young wolf deaths being due to human predation, and the number of wolves killed exceeds the number of hunting licenses, in some areas by a factor of two. Furthermore, the decline in the moose populations has reduced the wolf's food supply. Since 2011, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark have also reported wolf sightings presumably by natural migration from adjacent countries. In 2016, a female wolf tracked 550 kilometers from a region southwest of Berlin to settle in Jutland, Denmark where male wolves had been reported in 2012 {{for the first time in}} 200 years. Wolves have also commenced breeding in Lower Austria's Waldviertel region for the first time in over 130 years.|$|E
5|$|The anti-Hindi {{imposition}} agitations of 1937–40 and 1940–50 led to {{a change}} of guard in the Madras Presidency. The main opposition party to the Indian National Congress in the state, the Justice Party, came under Periyar's leadership on 29 December 1938. In 1944, the Justice Party was renamed as Dravidar Kazhagam. The political careers of many later leaders of the Dravidian Movement, such as C. N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi, started with their participation in these agitations. The agitations stopped the compulsory teaching of Hindi in the state. The agitations of the 1960s {{played a crucial role}} in the defeat of the Tamil Nadu Congress party in the 1967 elections and the continuing dominance of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu politics. Many political leaders of the DMK and ADMK, like P. Seenivasan, K. Kalimuthu, Durai Murugan, Tiruppur. S. Duraiswamy, Sedapatti Muthaiah, K. Raja Mohammad, M. Natarajan and L. Ganesan, <b>owe</b> <b>their</b> entry and advancement in politics to their stints as student leaders during the agitations, which also reshaped the Dravidian Movement and broadened its political base, when it shifted from its earlier pro-Tamil (and anti-Brahmin) stance to a more inclusive one, which was both anti-Hindi and pro-English. Finally, the current two-language education policy followed in Tamil Nadu is also a direct result of the agitations.|$|E
