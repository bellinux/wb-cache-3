The station {{was built in}} 1888 by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, designed by architects Fuller & Wheeler, and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since June 1, 1995. Amtrak's Adirondack line still stops at the station building which currently serves as a local senior citizen's and community center. A Canadian Pacific Alco <b>ore</b> <b>car</b> and a Lake Champlain and Moriah Railroad caboose are on display near the station.|$|E
50|$|After a miner named Ramon Castro killed Gracio Manzo, he hid {{from the}} law for two weeks in an {{abandoned}} mine shaft. As deputy, it was McEven's duty to bring Castro in, {{but he knew that}} if he entered the shaft without some sort of protection, he would be an easy target for Castro. He devised a simple but effective shield. Obtaining an <b>ore</b> <b>car,</b> upon which he hung a lamp, McEven pushed the bulletproof barrier ahead of him through the mine shaft until he cornered and captured Castro.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Lopez went {{to hide in}} the Minnie Silver Mine {{outside of}} Bingham, {{stopping}} along the way at the home of a friend, Mike Stefano, to relieve him of his Model 1894 30-30 Winchester. A few days later, the police were informed of Lopez's whereabouts and they proceeded to block off the entrances to the mine with armed guards. On November 29, the posse tried to smoke Lopez out by sending two deputies in with an <b>ore</b> <b>car</b> full of hay to start a fire, but Lopez killed them both. Deputy James Douglas Hulsey was shot in the right shoulder blade and the bullet exited through his chest. He was also hit in the heel of one of his feet while his partner, Deputy Thomas Manderich, was hit in the upper right part of his back. The remaining possemen then attempted to starve Lopez into submission, but he survived due to the efforts of sympathetic miners, who left food in the tunnels. The posse also tried pumping smoke and fumes into the place, but it did not work either. Finally, Lopez escaped the mine into Bingham Canyon and got away. The posse called off the search on January 3, 1914, the day after finding the mine empty.|$|E

40|$|Heavy haul {{vehicles}} {{operating in}} remote regions {{are particularly vulnerable}} to compounding deterioration due to {{the high levels of}} mechanical stress during operation coupled with low levels of maintenance inspection. The application of structural health monitoring is appealing in this operating environment due to its autonomous nature, and the potential cost savings due to early detection of mechanical damage. Without any monitoring system in place, predicting the reliability and mechanical failure modes of heavy haul rail vehicles is difficult. However autonomous structural health monitoring systems such as the Instrumented <b>Ore</b> <b>Car</b> (IOC) allow early detection of rail and vehicle anomalies to minimise damage and reduce the risk of derailment leading to significant down time and cost. A particular issue experienced by wireless systems is the lack of electrification. Primary batteries are often the easiest solution however they are typically not suitable due to their limited energy capacity and high maintenance cost. A more appealing solution is energy harvesting from local sources of waste energy. The ambient operating environment of heavy haul rail vehicles were examined with the aim of finding a suitable source of waste energy, and potential transduction approaches were considered. It was decided that vibration energy harvesting using electromagnetic transduction was the most suitable energy harvesting method. An inertial based 1 -DoF electromagnetic energy harvester was designed and manufactured to generate practical levels of power (typically in the range of 10 - 100 mW for structural health monitoring sensor systems). The device was designed using finite element analysis and tested in the laboratory using sinusoidal and PSD input based on measured railcar vibration. A substantial amount of power was generated using the 1 -DoF device with experimental results agreeing well with model predictions. Furthermore to improve power generation for heavy haul rail application, a second design was introduce utilising a 2 -DoF coupled oscillating system. The 2 -DoF design demonstrated significant improvements to the power generation and was installed on the railcar to provide an in-service demonstration and to validate the experimental and model predictions...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} faced by the Cartier Railway during the winter months was keeping the concentrate from freezing to the sides of the <b>ore</b> <b>cars,</b> which could make dumping the concentrate a very slow process. The solution to this problem was to line the insides of the <b>ore</b> <b>cars</b> with styrofoam sheets and cover it with plywood. Steam was injected in the plywood/styrofoam liner at the mine and it would keep the ore insulated until it reached the unloader at Port-Cartier.|$|R
