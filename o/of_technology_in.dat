40|$|Students are the {{end users}} of the Information Systems that {{educators}} use to enhance students? learning experiences. The use <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> education has altered {{the ways in which}} lecturers and students can interact and has expanded the volume of information that students can access. This study was undertaken to obtain students perspectives on the uses <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> higher education to assist educators in improving the pedagogical design of e-learning platforms, known as learning management systems. This chapter provides students? perspectives on the academic use <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> two higher education institutions in Ireland. Analysis of the responses received from three hundred and twenty students indicates that students are of the opinion that the use <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> higher education can beneficially transform learning; however, technologies will never replace lecturers...|$|R
