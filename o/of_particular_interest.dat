5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III, and are <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E

5|$|Behavioral ecologists {{have found}} {{its role as}} a brood {{parasite}} to be <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> as, unlike many brood parasites, it does not directly oviposit in the hosts' nests. The P. rebeli parasitizes the colony ant species Myrmica schencki as a larva by using chemical mimicry to trick the ants into believing that they are ant larvae; thus, the ants bring the P. rebeli larvae back to their own nests and feed them. It also parasitizes the food plant Gentiana cruciata early in its life cycle, but in turn, is parasitized by the Ichneumon eumerus when it is in the M. schencki nest. It was placed on the IUCN Red List in 2000 and is classified as a species 'vulnerable' to extinction. Although a separate species from the P. alcon, its DNA genome and appearance are extremely similar, leading many researchers to argue that any differences between the two species are due to intraspecific variation.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium mirrors are <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest.</b> Large-area mirrors, {{frequently}} with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors {{are used in}} optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E

5|$|Hengistbury Head forms {{part of the}} Christchurch Harbour Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and in May 1990 was {{declared}} a Local Nature Reserve. The head supports 500 plant species (a quarter of the national flora), including eight red data book species, 14 nationally scarce, and 39 locally rare species. The main nature reserve area faces Christchurch Harbour, and is contiguous with the reed beds of Wick Fields. The Head contains a large variety of habitats from the heathland on Warren Hill to freshwater ponds, sand dunes, and salt marshes. The woodland (known as Withybed Wood) is home to English oak and silver birch amongst many other trees, and is <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest,</b> {{as it is the}} only such area to be shown on an 1811 Ordnance Survey map of the Bournemouth/Christchurch area. In 2002, cattle-grazing commenced in a field near the new visitor centre known as Barn Field. This, combined with gorse eradication, has assisted in the restoration of this habitat to its ancient character.|$|E
5|$|In 1536 Cleeve {{was closed}} by Henry VIII {{in the course}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the abbey was {{converted}} into a country house. Subsequently, the status of the site declined and the abbey was used as farm buildings until the latter half of the nineteenth century when steps were taken to conserve the remains. In the twentieth century Cleeve was taken into state care; the abbey is now looked after by English Heritage and is open to the public. Today Cleeve Abbey is one of the best-preserved medieval Cistercian monastic sites in Britain. While the church is no longer standing, the conventual buildings are still roofed and habitable and contain many features <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> including the 'angel' roof in the refectory and the wall paintings in the painted chamber.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} architecture, the church {{features}} a round dome {{and a single}} apse. The naos or cella has {{the shape of a}} cross, in line with the popular Byzantine cross-in-square design. <b>Of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> is the formerly two-storey narthex, which is notable for its unusual verticality and the towers {{on either side of the}} entrance. Judging by the models depicted in the donor's portraits inside the church, it is clear that the towers were originally further apart and the west facade with the narthex included much woodwork. The towers are topped off by sharp-pointed pyramidal elements, with additional sharp-pointed details in each of the pyramids' four corners. The towers and their design are entirely unusual and unprecedented in medieval Bulgarian church architecture. Art historian Nikola Mavrodinov believes these resemble Gothic architecture, though a more modern researcher, Bistra Nikolova, dismisses his assessment and considers these an influence from Hungary or Transylvania.|$|E

Although specific plans were articulated, no construction of an airbase was carried out. However, Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} tripwire and was to be sacrificed in case of a Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, consisting of a short section of unmaintained wooden runway and the rest a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} the contributions from Driessen, Flanders and Boyer as <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest,</b> though challenged {{the inclusion of}} chapters focussed on the environment. They also criticised the book's failure to include contributions from, or sufficiently engage with the work of, the key voices in the politically focused animal ethics literature, such as Robert Garner, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, Alasdair Cochrane, Kimberly Smith or Siobhan O'Sullivan. Wissenburg's chapter was identified as the one which engaged most directly with this literature; his approach, however, was a negative one.

5|$|Several {{thousand}} animal {{bones were}} discovered in Mummy Cave. While {{the large majority of}} the bones could not be identified, researchers at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) were able to determine the biological origins of over two thousand bones. As at many other archeological sites in the region, significant numbers of Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) and deer from the genus Odocoileus were identified. <b>Of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interest</b> to biologists was the much larger number of sheep than deer: eighty-eight sheep and fifteen deer were identified. Such a prevalence of sheep over deer is highly unusual for archeological sites in the region, because deer are equally or more plentiful in areas such as the one in which Mummy Cave is located. This anomaly has led researchers at UTEP to propose that the site was used as a home base for hunters to operate at higher altitudes.|$|E
