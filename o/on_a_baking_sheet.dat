50|$|The classic Ellio's pizza may be {{prepared}} {{only in a}} conventional or toaster oven. In each instance, the baking temperature is 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 °C), with the pizza baking either directly on the rack for about 9-12 minutes, or <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> for 14-16 minutes (not more than 14 minutes in a toaster oven).|$|E
50|$|The {{recipe for}} {{peppermint}} bark uses few ingredients, with only chocolate and mint candies required. Some recipes also add peppermint flavoring. The candies used may be candy canes. The candies should be broken up, and the chocolate is melted. These two ingredients are combined <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> and then chilled until firm. The bark is then {{removed from the}} sheet and broken into pieces {{in a similar way}} to peanut brittle.|$|E
50|$|The Hungarian kalács (pronounced ˈkɒlaːtʃ) is a sweet bread {{very similar}} to brioche, usually baked in a braided form, and {{traditionally}} considered an Easter food. Until {{the end of the}} 19th century, the preparation of kalács was similar to that of everyday bread; the difference was in the shape, and in the better/quality flour used for the kalács. Nowadays kalács is prepared from dough enriched with milk and eggs. It is baked in an oven or brick oven, sometimes directly on the stones of the brick oven, or <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to paper, cupcake liners {{may be made}} from very thin aluminum foil or, in a non-disposable version, silicone rubber. Because they can stand up on their own, foil and silicone liners {{can also be used}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flat <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> which makes them popular among people who do not have a specialized muffin tin. Some of the largest paper liners are not fluted and are made out of thicker paper, often rolled at the top edge for additional strength, so that they can also stand independently for <b>baking</b> without <b>a</b> cupcake tin. Some bakers use two or three thin paper liners, nested together, to simulate the strength of a single foil cup.|$|R
5000|$|Elzer Zwetschgenkuchen: The fifth verse of the Elz kermis song runs Quetschekuche soiß än zoart, bäckt mer in Elz die richtig Oart, or in {{standard}} High German, Zwetschgenkuchen süß und zart, bäckt man in Elz auf die richtige Art, or indeed in English, “Zwetschge cake sweet and mellow, is baked in Elz {{in the right}} way.” This describes the regional speciality, which at Elz kermis time in September is well known far beyond the village’s limits. The reason for the zwetschge cake’s popularity is, among other things, that the fair’s end traditionally falls {{at the same time}} as the zwetschge harvest also ends. The cake is traditionally prepared <b>on</b> <b>a</b> great oblong <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> The dough is a yeast dough upon which are laid pitted and chopped zwetschgen. In the preparation, the grounds for choosing zwetschgen over plums can be seen. Plums would give off too much moisture while baking and would soak the cake. The Zwetschgenkuchen is eaten with whipped cream at afternoon coffee time.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common ways to prepare {{butternut}} squash is roasting. To do this, the squash is cut in half lengthwise (see pictures), lightly brushed with cooking oil or put in a thin layer of water and placed cut side down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> It is then baked for 45 minutes or until soft. Once roasted, it can be eaten in a variety of ways.The fruit is prepared by removing the skin, stalk, and seeds, which are not usually eaten or cooked. However, the seeds are edible, either raw or roasted, and the skin is also edible and softens when roasted.|$|E
50|$|Matzah pizza is {{prepared}} by covering {{a piece of}} matzo with sauce and melted cheese. It can be eaten as is, or baked first. In the latter case, the matzo is first softened in water; alternately, the sauce ingredients are used to soften the matzo. Other traditional pizza toppings {{may be used in}} addition to cheese. For example, chef Spike Mendelsohn suggests topping matzah pizza with figs and asparagus, peppers and feta cheese, or cherry tomatoes, olives, and rosemary, while Martha Stewart recommends placing a fried egg on top of a matzah pizza. Other recipes suggest using crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and some recipes suggest substituting hummus for sauce. Some recipes recommend baking the matzo and toppings <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> either in a conventional oven or in a microwave oven, while other recipes recommend baking matzah pizza in a casserole pan, so that the dish resembles a layered lasagna. Vegan recipes suggest utilizing vegan cheese or omitting the cheese entirely.|$|E
50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|E

50|$|Putting <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> {{pan over}} <b>a</b> furnace can allow for baking, {{which is in}} turn derived from {{the concept of the}} masonry oven. This was common for centuries, used to make breads, pies, and other items, and is still popular today, {{particularly}} among campers who enjoy stuffing their meats. Ovens can be made from cast iron, sheet metal or aluminum foil covered cardboard box. Reflector ovens are metal containers designed to surround an article of food being baked over an open flame and reflect the heat back towards the food.|$|R
50|$|By using <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> pan placed {{above the}} grill surface, {{as well as}} a drip pan below the surface, it is {{possible}} to combine grilling and roasting to cook meats that are stuffed or coated with breadcrumbs or batter, and to bake breads and even casseroles and desserts. When cooking stuffed or coated meats, the foods can be baked first on the sheet pan, and then placed directly on the grilling surface for char marks, effectively cooking twice; the drip pan will be used to capture any crumbs that fall off from the coating or stuffing.|$|R
50|$|Shortcake is {{typically}} made with flour, sugar, baking powder or soda, salt, butter, milk or cream, and sometimes eggs. The dry ingredients are blended, {{and then the}} butter is cut in until the mixture resembles cornmeal. The liquid ingredients are then mixed in just until moistened, resulting in a shortened dough. The dough is then dropped in spoonfuls onto <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> rolled and cut like baking powder biscuits, or poured into a cake pan, depending on how wet the dough is and the baker's preferences. Then it is baked at a relatively high temperature until set.|$|R

5000|$|Genoise {{is a basic}} {{building}} block of much French pâtisserie and is used for making several different types of cake. The batter usually is baked to form a thin sheet. An 1884 cookbook gives a simple recipe for a genoise: Work together briskly in a basin half a pound of flour, half a pound of sugar, and four eggs: after five minutes' good stirring, add {{a quarter of a}} pound of melted butter. Butter <b>a</b> square <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> spread the paste upon it, and bake it in a moderate oven until it turns a golden yellow.|$|R

5000|$|The Needham family {{believed}} that Ben was kidnapped {{with the intention}} of selling him for adoption, or that he was taken by child traffickers. Carol Sarler, writing in The Times in 2007, said: [...] "I have repeatedly asked police and press, British and Greek, for a single example to support this rumour. There is none. When pretty little Western European kiddies go missing... we know about it; if we don't know, it isn't happening. Those of us who properly investigated Ben's disappearance are certain he was not abducted; put bluntly, a child less than 2, toddling unsupervised for five hours <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking,</b> remote, inhospitable hillside that is still largely unsearched, is easy prey to the lonely accident." ...|$|R

The team {{then went on to}} play the Castleford Aybertigers at Castleford in a tag rather than contact game and they {{recorded}} their first ever victory <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> hot August day. A heavy loss against the Hull FC Irregulars at The Boulevard was followed by a lesson in tag rugby at the annual IMBRL tournament. Despite these setbacks on the field, the concept had worked and was allowing new players to play rugby league as well as watching it, at a standard suitable for beginners.|$|R
5000|$|Morels can be {{preserved}} in several ways: They can be 'flash frozen' by simply running {{under cold water}} or putting them in a bucket to soak for a few minutes, then spread <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> tray and placed into a freezer. After freezing, they keep very well with the frozen glaze {{for a long time}} in airtight plastic containers. However, when thawed they can sometimes turn slightly mushy, so they are best frozen after steaming or frying. Due to their natural porosity, morels may contain trace amounts of soil which cannot be easily washed out. Any visible soil should be removed with a brush, after cutting the body in half lengthwise, if needed. Mushroom hunters sometimes recommend soaking morels in a bowl of salt water briefly prior to cooking, although many chefs would disagree.|$|R
