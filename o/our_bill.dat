25|$|Adding to {{the growing}} {{tensions}} between the Congressional Union and NAWSA, Burns made a radical proposal once again at the 1913 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Because Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress at the time, Burns wanted {{to give them an}} ultimatum—support <b>our</b> <b>bill</b> for suffrage or we will make sure you don’t get reelected. Burns stated “Inaction establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open hostility.” She was no longer going to stand for the apathy from the Democratic Party. Burns was particularly infuriated with President Wilson because he had told them he would support the Committee on Suffrage, but then never mentioned his promise in his address to Congress. When a delegation of women from NAWSA tried to meet with him to address this incident and register their protest, Wilson claimed to be ill. A few days later, Wilson reneged his vow to support suffrage and said he would not impose his private views on Congress.|$|E

Under her proposed bill Donald Trump could face impeachment if he fails to declare conflicts of interest between his presidential role and his business interests. Warren states, [...] "The only way for President-elect Trump to truly eliminate conflicts-of-interest is to divest his financial interests {{and place them in}} a blind trust. This has been the standard for previous presidents, and <b>our</b> <b>bill</b> makes clear the continuing expectation that President-elect Trump do the same." [...] On January 9, 2017, the Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act, was first read in the Senate.|$|E

Mason wrote the first of these lists." [...] Diane D. Pikcunas, in her article prepared for the bicentennial of the U.S. Bill of Rights, wrote that Mason [...] "made the declaration of rights as his personal crusade".
