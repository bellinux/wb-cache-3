5|$|As such, language, as {{a social}} product, {{literally}} structures and shapes <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> reality. This discursive approach to language and society would be developed by later French philosophers, such as Michel Foucault.|$|E
5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{discussion}} among philosophers about mental supervenience and <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> duration. If all mental properties supervene only upon some physical properties at durationless moments, then {{it may be}} difficult to explain <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> duration. The philosophical belief that mental and physical events exist as a series of durationless moments that lie between the physical past and the physical future is known as presentism, and is a form of belief in Galilean relativity.|$|E
5000|$|The sociological {{approach}} [...] {{emphasizes the}} importance of language, collective representations, self-conceptions, and self-reflectivity. This theoretical approach argues that the shape and feel of human consciousness is heavily social, and this is no less true <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> [...] "collective consciousness" [...] than it is <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> individual consciousness.|$|R

25|$|The unmoved mover {{argument}} asserts that, from <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> {{motion in}} the universe (motion being the transition from potentiality to actuality) {{we can see that}} there must have been an initial mover. Aquinas argued that whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another thing, so there must be an unmoved mover.|$|E
25|$|Bohm {{discussed}} {{the experience of}} listening to music. He believed the feeling of movement and change that make up <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> music derive from holding the immediate {{past and the present}} in the brain together. The musical notes from the past are transformations rather than memories. The notes that were implicate in the immediate past become explicate in the present. Bohm viewed this as consciousness emerging from the implicate order.|$|E
25|$|According to Shusterman our culture’s growing {{preoccupation with}} the body has not yet found an {{appropriate}} response {{in the realm of}} philosophy, which simply neglects the somatic, textualizes it, or reduces it to gender or racial difference, and thus is unwilling or unable to counteract the negative aspects of the current body boom (such as the tendency that “contemporary aesthetic ideals of body remain enslaved by shallow and oppressive stereotypes that serve more to increase profits for the cosmetics industries than to enrich <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the varieties of bodily charms”).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{have drawn}} on <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> using {{storytelling}} as a sensemaking tool {{to argue for}} the benefits {{of this as a}} means of better understanding the gendered academy and the role storytelling can play in effecting change. We aim to demonstrate how storytelling helped make visible the gendered practices in our workplace and how this led to a change in <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> workplace. As well, we highlight the need for such stories to be heard more generally in the workplace, as a means for prompting change through negotiation. We argue that, ideally, a triple loop learning environment would allow for meaningful exchanges, but how to enable this in practice is still unclear...|$|R

25|$|Kant {{argued that}} our {{experiences}} are structured by necessary features of our minds. In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features. Among other things, Kant {{believed that the}} concepts {{of space and time}} are integral to all human experience, as are our concepts of cause and effect. One important consequence of this view is that <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> things is always of the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses: we do not have direct access to things in themselves, the so-called noumenal world. Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These included the Critique of Practical Reason (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (Die Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and the Critique of Judgment (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{either from}} {{religious}} belief or from science, Spencer argued, we are ultimately driven to accept certain indispensable but literally inconceivable notions. Whether {{we are concerned}} with a Creator or the substratum which underlies <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> phenomena, we can frame no conception of it. Therefore, Spencer concluded, religion and science agree in the supreme truth that the human understanding is only capable of 'relative' knowledge. This is the case since, owing to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality ('the absolute') underlying phenomena. Hence both science and religion must come to recognise as the 'most certain of all facts that the Power which the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable.' He called this awareness of 'the Unknowable' and he presented worship of the Unknowable as capable of being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Indeed, {{he thought that the}} Unknowable represented the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges.|$|E

EastEnders explores all these issues, and hopefully will help improve people's understanding of what it's like to be affected by a cancer diagnosis." ...|$|E

2500|$|Epiphenomenon / zombie reply: Several {{philosophers}} {{argue that}} consciousness, as Searle describes it, does not exist.

2500|$|Tarkovsky {{developed}} {{a theory of}} cinema that he called [...] "sculpting in time". By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> time and alter it. Unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time. By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, {{and the relationship of}} one moment in time to another.|$|E
2500|$|In Buddhist philosophy, Ayatana or [...] "sense-base" [...] {{includes}} the {{mind as a}} sense organ, {{in addition to the}} traditional five. This addition to the commonly acknowledged senses may arise from the psychological orientation involved in Buddhist thought and practice. The mind considered by itself is seen as the principal gateway to a different spectrum of phenomena that differ from the physical sense data. This way of viewing the human sense system indicates the importance of internal sources of sensation and perception that complements <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the external world.|$|E
2500|$|Most theists, in fact, do {{admit that}} love is a central concept in {{almost all of the}} world's religions. God is often {{directly}} associated with love, especially with agape.

2500|$|Searle {{argues that}} his critics are also relying on intuitions, however his opponents' intuitions have no {{empirical}} basis. He writes that, {{in order to}} consider the [...] "system reply" [...] as remotely plausible, a person must be [...] "under the grip of an ideology". The system reply only makes sense (to Searle) if one assumes that any [...] "system" [...] can have consciousness, just {{by virtue of being}} a system with the right behavior and functional parts. This assumption, he argues, is not tenable given <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|Two female mannequins {{in a scene}} {{somewhat}} like a supermarket checkout. One mannequin sits naked on a lavatory with items dangling from her head: a nurse's cap, rusty horseshoes, a deflated balloon, charred bits of wood. The other's head is enclosed in a bird cage. The scene is covered with detritus: unwashed bowls and spoons with porridge and salad dried on. The everyday items are from the artist's own home, as are the leftovers. Wilkes says of her work that it [...] "apprehends an end point {{in our understanding of}} things as they area point at which words become insufficient, and the naming of objects is disconnected from <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several replies {{argue that}} Searle's {{argument}} is irrelevant because his {{assumptions about the}} mind and consciousness are faulty. Searle believes that [...] human beings directly experience their consciousness, intentionality {{and the nature of}} the mind every day, and that this experience of consciousness is not open to question. [...] He writes that we must [...] "presuppose the reality and knowability of the mental." [...] These replies question whether Searle is justified in using his own experience of consciousness to determine that it is more than mechanical symbol processing. In particular, the other minds reply argues that we cannot use <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> consciousness to answer questions about other minds (even the mind of a computer), and the epiphenomena reply argues that Searle's consciousness does not [...] "exist" [...] in the sense that Searle thinks it does.|$|E

40|$|Ubiquitous {{computing}} and {{the city}} Ubiquitous computing seeks to embed computers into our everyday lives in such ways as to render them invisible {{and allow them to}} be taken for granted, while social and cultural theories of everyday life have always been interested in rendering the invisible visible and exposing the mundane. Despite these related concerns, social and cultural studies have been almost entirely absent in discussions of the design of ubiquitous technologies. This essay seeks to introduce researchers in both fields to each other, and begin to explore the ways in which collaboration might proceed. By exploring mobile and ubiquitous technologies currently being used to augment <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> the city, this paper investigates notions of sociality, spatialization and temporalization as central to <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> everyday life, and therefore of interest to the design of ubiquitous computing...|$|R
