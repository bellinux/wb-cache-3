5|$|The choice <b>of</b> <b>surgical</b> versus non-surgical {{treatments}} for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, {{the type and}} extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety <b>of</b> <b>surgical</b> options exist {{for the treatment of}} persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in glycosaminoglycan concentration, histological, and immunohistochemical appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.|$|E
5|$|For both NSCLC and SCLC, the {{two general}} types of staging {{evaluations}} are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It {{is based on}} the results of imaging studies (such as CT scans and PET scans) and biopsy results. Surgical staging is evaluated either during or after the operation and {{is based on the}} combined results <b>of</b> <b>surgical</b> and clinical findings, including surgical sampling of thoracic lymph nodes.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>surgical</b> treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E
5|$|Grey's Anatomy is an American {{television}} medical {{drama that}} debuted on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal on March 27, 2005. While creating the show, producers put {{an emphasis on}} the casting process. The series has aired for thirteen seasons, and focuses on the fictional lives <b>of</b> <b>surgical</b> interns and residents, as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, while trying to maintain personal lives. The show's premise originated with Shonda Rhimes, who serves as an executive producer, along with Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, and Allan Heinberg. It is primarily filmed in Los Angeles, California.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{advantage}} of CCPDMA method {{is that it}} allows for the complete examination <b>of</b> the entire <b>surgical</b> margin <b>of</b> the specimen. The second {{advantage of}} CCPDMA is allowing the surgeon to remove only a very small surgical margin. As the CCPDMA surgery is frequently performed using frozen section pathology, immediate reporting <b>of</b> positive <b>surgical</b> margin is made, and the tumor can be completely removed in the same day. Traditional pathology processing is called [...] "bread loafing", and only allows for the partial examination <b>of</b> the <b>surgical</b> margin.

5|$|The artery is only {{present in}} {{approximately}} 3–10% of the population. Thyroid ima artery is <b>of</b> <b>surgical</b> importance; {{due to its}} relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such as severe bleeding in surgery of the thorax, trachea, thyroid or parathyroid glands. Knowledge of occurrence of the artery is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy. Because the artery is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin {{from one of the}} bigger vessels, a brisk cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant blood loss. The artery, if dissected, may draw back into the mediastinum and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the thoracic cavity.|$|E
5|$|There are two doctors' {{surgeries}} in Shepton Mallet, a National Health Service {{community hospital}} formerly operated by Somerset Primary Care Trust, {{and an independent}} sector treatment centre, which carries out a range <b>of</b> <b>surgical</b> procedures.

Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service have a retained fire station in the town, which is adjacent to the ambulance station operated by South Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust. Avon and Somerset Constabulary closed the local police station in 2014 and the town falls within the Somerset East policing district.|$|E
5|$|Greys Anatomy {{follows the}} lives <b>of</b> <b>surgical</b> interns and {{residents}} at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, {{with the help}} of their competent mentors. Every installment, typically, commences with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the theme of the episode. Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field. The season will always end with a finale, typically involving a tragic event such as a death or character departure. Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show puts an emphasis on their personal, rather than professional, lives. The series sets aside medical ethic concerns to focus on character development and relationships. Although the physicians treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, their primary motivation is customarily praise and competition.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two forms}} of CCPDMA surgery: Mohs surgery and {{surgical}} excision coupled with margin assessment.

5|$|The cabin {{located on}} the main deck {{underneath}} the sterncastle {{is thought to have}} belonged to the barber-surgeon. He was a trained professional who saw to the health and welfare of the crew and acted as the medical expert on board. The most important of these finds were found in an intact wooden chest which contained over 60 objects relating to the barber-surgeon's medical practice: the wooden handles of a complete set <b>of</b> <b>surgical</b> tools and several shaving razors (although none of the steel blades had survived), a copper syringe for wound irrigation and treatment of gonorrhoea, and even a skilfully crafted feeding bottle for feeding incapacitated patients. More objects were found around the cabin, such as earscoops, shaving bowls and combs. With this wide selection of tools and medicaments the barber-surgeon, along with one or more assistants, could set bone fractures, perform amputations and deal with other acute injuries, treat a number of diseases and provide crew members with a minimal standard of personal hygiene.|$|E

By following Lister and adopting systematically the use of scrubbing (deep cleansing and disinfection of hands and arms), sterilisation <b>of</b> <b>surgical</b> tools, use <b>of</b> <b>surgical</b> gowns, and (recently discovered) anaesthesia, Macewen {{became one of the most}} innovative surgeons of his time and was able to greatly advance modern surgical technique and improve the recovery of patients.|$|E

The effects of the treatment on the physical and chemical characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>surgical</b> sutures were evaluated. The friction force <b>of</b> the <b>surgical</b> sutures during sliding through the skin substitute was experimentally determined using a penetration friction apparatus.
