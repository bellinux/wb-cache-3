5000|$|There is {{much debate}} over which {{characters}} in Family Guy can understand Stewie. In an interview, MacFarlane said {{that everyone can}} basically understand him, but they ignore him or just think to themselves [...] "oh how cute" [...] when he talks. However at a recent ComicCon panel (2011), he compares this to Wile E. Coyote in the old Merrie Melodies cartoons. MacFarlane {{went on to say}} that Brian always hears Stewie, and more recently so does Chris, but the writers usually strive for Peter, Lois, and Meg not to hear him. Once Stewie leaves the house, the question of who can understand him depends very much on the story. MacFarlane also states that these rules can be broken for the sake of comedy, so this could change from one episode to another. In the 18th minute, of Episode 4 Season 15, Peter apologizes to the family, to which Stewie comments: [...] "Oh that's nice of you to say". Peter replies: [...] "Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand." [...] referring to the ongoing discussion whether or not other family members, than Brian, are able to understand him.

Such {{equipment and}} algorithms will provide a new way for traffic control systems to automatically measure their performance and adapt in real-time to the actual traffic demands on the system. Using the concept of link travel time data, this paper describes a procedure to set offsets offline for a coordinated actuated arterial signal system. The <b>offset</b> <b>setting</b> procedure is developed in CORSIM and based on recording individual vehicle travel times between coordinated actuated intersections. Establishing offsets in this manner mitigates the "early return to green" problem associated with coordinated actuated systems and accounts for downstream queues which may negatively impact progression. The offline procedure presented, provides the foundation for an online algorithm that could adjust offsets based on real-time travel data...|$|E

30|$|According to {{the above}} analysis, on the one hand, the offset measure on the random {{hyperparameter}} field f reflects {{the characteristics of the}} observation mark classification and the density distribution agglomeration under the local relation. On the other hand, considering that when the <b>offset</b> <b>set</b> level parameter is higher, the Euler indicative number of the <b>offset</b> <b>set</b> is larger, and it shows that the local coverage of the <b>offset</b> <b>set</b> at the high level in the planar domain is more complete and shows more of a clustering trend. Therefore, the learning problem for p(⋅) can be transformed to a random clustering learning problem. This section uses the infinite Dirichlet process mixture model of the clustering model to construct the probability density p(⋅) in Eq. 2. The Gibbs sampling method is used to iteratively study the density structure of the hierarchical probability form under the assumption of the Markov neighborhood.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} age on transient vernier visual evoked potential (VEP) and vernier acuity estimated by extrapolation. Methods - Transient vernier VEPs were examined in normal subjects aged 20 to 75 years. Vernier offsets were presented for the first 350 msec of the stimulus period, and the segments were then realigned in the following 400 msec. The six vernier offsets used were 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 140 seconds of arc. Averaging for each <b>offset</b> <b>setting</b> produced vernier VEP waveforms, for which amplitude and latency of visual evoked response and background electroencephalographic (EEG) noise level were determined. Extrapolation of the function relating signal-to-noise ratio and log vernier offset to a ratio of 1. 0 resulted in an estimate of vernier acuity. Results - Amplitude of vernier VEP waveforms was significantly reduced in subjects more than 60 years of age, and the latency to the first negative peak was progressively prolonged with increasing age. There was no statistically significant change in electroencephalographic (EEG) noise with advancing age. VEP vernier acuity was significantly degraded in the 61 - to 75 -year age group. These results are parallel to recent psychophysical findings that alignment performance is worse in older persons than in younger ones. Conclusions - The present findings provide the first electrophysiological evidence of age-related cortical degeneration associated with vernier processing. Reduced neural activity probably contributes {{to the loss of}} vernier acuity with advancing age. Also provided are the first normative data for subjects of different ages for vernier VEP and VEP vernier acuity. Moreover, the present study has demonstrated that vernier VEP is sensitive to neural changes and therefore may be applied in clinical situations to evaluate the integrity of the visual system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{conducted}} in collaboration with Signal Processing (SP) Devices Sweden AB. SP Devices provides digital signal processing solutions for the enhancement of analogue to digital conversion (ADC). Their ADCs facilitate the development of products for Communications, Radio base stations, Radar, Signals intelligence and Test & Measurement. The ADQ series digitizers, from SP Devices, are portable high performance digitizers which incorporate one or more analog inputs, an on-board double data rate (DDR 2) memory and USB or PXI Express interface. DDR 2 refers {{to the ability of}} a computer bus to transfer data on both the rising and falling edges of a clock signal. The ADCaptureLab software is a graphical user interface used to control this digitizer. ADCaptureLab, designed in the C/C++ programming language, is an easy-to-use standalone program which allows for configuration and operation of all ADQ series digitizers from SP Devices. The use of the LabView program from National Instruments forms the backbone of this thesis. LabVIEW (short for Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering Workbench) is a platform and development environment for a visual programming language from National Instruments. The topic of this thesis was to reproduce the ADCaptureLab user interface using LabView instead of C/C++. The graphical user interface (GUI) developed in LabView should be able to communicate with and control the processing of the ADQ 214 digitizer (the digitizer model provided to us) {{in the same way as}} the ADCaptureLab. This would involve not only the data capturing and visualization but also digitizer configurations, monitoring of the device and ADQ functions and the analyses of acquired signal and FFT. In order to implement the configuration settings we developed functions for trigger settings (conditions at which a trigger will occur), Analogue Front End settings (AC/DC coupling), clock settings (sets the clock source), data type settings (set sample format), gain and <b>offset</b> <b>setting</b> (sets amplitude gain and mean value), pre-trigger settings (size of pre-trigger buffer), trigger hold off settings (number of samples to wait for acquiring data after trigger), data acquisition length settings (Length of the acquired signal), continuous and single batch data acquisition, FFT transformation, save, load, and “clear plots” control (resets graph indicators). The functioning of our device may be monitored through the “Status window” (displays connection status of the ADQ device), “Devices window” (displays product information about the ADQ device), “Device monitor window” (returns the status of ADQ-API functions used) and the “Device information window” (returns information related to the revision of the ADQ device). Analyzing the acquired data and its corresponding FFT is made simple with the “Signal Properties” window (displays analyzed data), “Mark Harmonics” control (marks harmonics in the FFT) and the “Mark Signal Props” control (marks the fundamental tone and highest distortion in the FFT). Our LabVIEW GUI efficiently incorporates the features described above. In addition to being able to communicate instructions to the ADQ 214 device we are able to monitor its condition and analyze any output. This result serves to show that it is possible to develop a program such as ADCaptureLab in LabVIEW. HASSAN GILANI # : + 46736742637 RAISUL BHUIYAN # :+ 4676259697...|$|E
30|$|Tosun (2003) {{modelled}} {{the variation}} of response variables with the machining parameters of a WEDM process using regression analysis method, and then applied simulated annealing based searching for {{determination of the}} machining parameters that can simultaneously optimize all the performance measures. Liao et al. (1997) established mathematical models relating the machining performances with various machining parameters, and then determined the optimal parametric settings for the WEDM processes using feasible-direction method of non-linear programining. Ahmad et al. (2001) studied machinability of aluminum matrix composite (AMC). The full factorial design of experimental approach with two levels {{were used to determine}} the combination of machining parameter based on pulse-off time, servo voltage and wire tension. They concluded that the servo voltages have significant influence on the MRR. Mahapatra and Patnaik (2006) established the relationship between various process parameters and responses using non-linear regression analysis and then employed genetic algorithm to optimize the WEDM process. Singh and Garg (2009) machined hot die steel (H- 11) on WEDM. They studied the effects of process parameters on MRR using one variable at a time approach. Finally conclude that by increasing the pulse on time the MRR also increases and vice versa. Jangra et al. (2011) investigated the Influence of taper angle, peak current, pulse-on time, pulse-off time, wire tension and dielectric flow rate for MRR and surface roughness during machining of WC–Co composite. In order to optimize MRR and surface roughness GRA is used along with Taguchi method. Durairaj et al. (2013) examined the effect of process parameters on surface roughness and kerf width on WEDM using SS 304. For experimentation Taguchi L 16 OA has been used. By using multi-objective optimization technique GRA theory, the optimal value is obtained for surface roughness and kerf width and by using Taguchi optimization technique, optimized value is obtained separately. Shivade and Shinde (2013) proposed different approaches which may also be quite useful for multi-objective optimization of WEDM processes. Chiang and Chang (2006) optimized the surface roughness and MRR of a WEDM process for Al 2 O 3 particle reinforced material based on GRA method. Ramakrishna and Karunamoorthy (2006) used multi-objective optimization method using Taguchi’s robust design approach for WEDM. Each experiment had been performed under different cutting conditions of pulse on time, wire tension, delay time, wire feed speed and ignition current intensity. Three responses, namely MRR, surface roughness and wire wear ratio had been considered. It was observed that the Taguchi’s parameter design is a simple, systematic, reliable and more efficient tool for optimization of the machining parameters. It was identified that the pulse on time and ignition current had influenced more than the other parameters. Sarkar et al. (2005) presented an approach to select the optimum cutting condition with an appropriate wire <b>offset</b> <b>setting</b> {{in order to get the}} desired surface roughness and dimensional accuracy for machining of γ-titanium aluminide alloy. The process has been modeled using additive model in order to predict the response parameters, i.e., cutting speed, surface roughness and dimensional deviation. Muthu et al. (2011) investigated experimentally the influence of the machining parameter on the kerf width, metal removal rate and the surface roughness of the machined workpiece surface using Taguchi method. Jangra et al. (2012) proposed integrated approach for multi-objective optimization for WC- 5.3  %Co composite on WEDM using Taguchi, GRA and entropy method. Hewidy et al. (2005) developed a mathematical model based on response surface methodology for correlating the relationships of various WEDM parameters of Inconel 601 material such as peak current, duty factor, wire tension and water pressure on the MRR, wear ratio and surface roughness. Rao and Pawar (2009) highlighted the development of mathematical models using response surface modeling for correlating the relationships of various WEDM parameters such as pulse on-time, pulse off-time, peak current, and servo feed setting on the machining speed and surface roughness. ABC algorithm was then applied to find the optimal combination of process parameters with an objective of achieving maximum machining speed for a desired value of surface finish. Datta and Mahapatra (2010) derived a quadratic mathematical model to represent the process behavior of WEDM operation. Experiments have been conducted with six process parameters: discharge current, pulse duration, pulse frequency, wire speed, wire tension and dielectric flow rate; to be varied in three different levels. Process responses such as Material Removal Rate, surface finish and kerf have been measured. These data have been utilized to fit a quadratic mathematical model (response surface model) for each of the responses.GRA has been adopted to convert this multi-objective criterion into an equivalent single objective function; Optimal setting has been verified through confirmatory test; showed good agreement to the predicted value. Kumar et al. (2013) investigated effect of various WEDM parameters on four response variables, i.e., machining rate, surface roughness, dimensional deviation and wire wear ratio on pure titanium (Grade- 2) using RSM. The experimental plan is based on Box–Behnken design. The six parameters, i.e., pulse on time, pulse off time, peak current, spark gap voltage, wire feed and wire tension have been varied to investigate their effect on output responses. The ANOVA has been applied to identify the significance of developed model. Shandilya et al. (2011) used a RSM and artificial neural network based mathematical modeling for average cutting speed of SiCp/ 6061 Al metal matrix composite during WEDM. Four WEDM parameters namely servo voltage, pulse-on time, pulse-off time and wire feed rate were chosen as machining process parameters. They developed a back propagation neural network to establish the process model. The performance of the developed artificial neural network models was compared with the RSM mathematical models of average cutting speed. Sharma et al. (2013) investigated the effect of parameters on metal removal rate for WEDM using high strength low alloy as work-piece and brass wire as electrode. They observed that material removal rate and surface roughness increase with increase in pulse on time and peak current. RSM is used to optimize the process parameter for Material removal rate and surface roughness. They developed a mathematical model which correlates the independent process parameters with the desired metal removal rate and Surface Roughness. The central composite rotatable design has been used to conduct the experiments.|$|E

40|$|The coiled coil is a {{ubiquitous}} protein-folding motif. It {{generally is}} accepted that coiled coils {{are characterized by}} sequence patterns known as heptad repeats. Such patterns direct the formation and assembly of amphipathic α-helices, the hydrophobic faces of which interface in a specific manner first proposed by Crick and termed "knobs-into-holes packing". We developed software, socket, to recognize this packing in protein structures. As expected, in a trawl of the protein data bank, we found examples of canonical coiled coils with a single contiguous heptad repeat. In addition, we identified structures with multiple, overlapping heptad repeats. This observation extends Crick's original postulate: Multiple, offset heptad repeats help explain assemblies with more than two helices. Indeed, {{we have found that}} the sequence offset of the multiple heptad repeats is related to the coiled-coil oligomer state. Here we focus on one particular sequence motif in which two heptad repeats are offset by two residues. This <b>offset</b> <b>sets</b> up two hydrophobic faces separated by ≈ 150 °– 160 ° around the α-helix. In turn, two different combinations of these faces are possible. Either similar or opposite faces can interface, which leads to open or closed multihelix assemblies. Accordingly, we refer to these two forms as α-sheets and α-cylinders.

To learn the distribution {{model of the}} observations by using observations, the relationship between observations, label classes, and offset measures on grid Z must be established. On V and Z, respectively, the position in the observed set V has a definite marker class 1 on the image. However, the labeling category Z on the unobserved position set is uncertain. Under the assumption of {{the continuity of the}} distribution model, the position where the marker category is indefinite should be understood as not observed, and the 0 marker cannot directly determine the corresponding observation result. The label category indicates whether the observation position belongs to the <b>offset</b> <b>set</b> under the level c. However, when estimating the overall offset measure using the observation data, it is necessary to further specify the mark relationship between the elements of the sets V and Z to integrate the mark relationships on the entire grid point Z. In connection with the data-extraction process in the previous article [30], the dependency relationship between grid observations can be established on Z using the mixture graph structure as a basis for subsequent inference learning using observation data. The relationship between marker categories and grid positions is established through a directed graph structure. At the same time, pairwise Markov random fields are used to establish a dependency relationship between the discrete grid points on the imaging domain, i.e., the distribution of p(⋅) on Z.|$|R
