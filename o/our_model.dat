Accommodation can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning: when we act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates our expectations, we often fail, but by accommodating this new experience and reframing <b>our</b> <b>model</b> of the way the world works, we learn from the experience of failure, or others' failure.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{modeling}} of delay, power, and area of interconnections {{early in the}} design phase is crucial for effective system-level optimization. Models presently used in system-level optimizations, such as network-on-chip (NoC) synthesis, are inaccurate {{in the presence of}} deep-submicron effects. In this paper, we propose new, highly accurate models for delay and power in buffered interconnects; these models are usable by system-level designers for existing and future technologies. We present a general and transferable methodology to construct <b>our</b> <b>models</b> {{from a wide variety of}} reliable sources (Liberty, LEF/ITF, ITRS, PTM, etc.). The modeling infrastructure, and a number of characterized technologies, are available as open source. <b>Our</b> <b>models</b> comprehend key interconnect circuit and layout design styles, and a power-efficient buffering technique that overcomes unrealities of previous delay-driven buffering techniques. We show that <b>our</b> <b>models</b> are significantly more accurate than previous models for global and intermediate buffered interconnects in 90 nm and 65 nm foundry processes- essentially matching signoff analyses. We also integrate <b>our</b> <b>models</b> in the COSI-OCC synthesis tool and show that the more accurate modeling significantly affects optimal/achievable architectures that are synthesized by the tool. The increased accuracy provided by <b>our</b> <b>models</b> enables system-level designers to obtain better assessments of the achievable performance/power/area tradeoffs for (communication-centric aspects of) system design, with negligible setup and overhead burdens. ...|$|R
