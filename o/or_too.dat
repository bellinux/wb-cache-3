5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy <b>or</b> <b>too</b> ballady <b>or</b> <b>too</b> old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Magic, {{like many}} other games, {{combines}} chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves {{the notion that there}} is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many <b>or</b> <b>too</b> few lands. Early in the game especially, too many <b>or</b> <b>too</b> few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, the land count is automatically adjusted to 40% of the total deck size.|$|E
5|$|After Cerezeda took {{most of the}} {{inhabitants}} of Trujillo into Higueras, the city entered a period of serious decline. Those inhabitants that remained were too old, too sick, <b>or</b> <b>too</b> dispirited to head west. Basic supplies such as food and clothing were scarce. The citizens believed that Cerezeda wished to abandon Trujillo, and appealed to the audiencia of Santo Domingo, and to the Crown, for supplies and a Crown-appointed governor.|$|E

50|$|Secondly, Jentleson et al. outline that {{reciprocity}} {{involves an}} explicit understanding of linkage between the defending state's carrots and the attacking state's concessions. The balance lies neither in offering too little <b>too</b> late <b>or</b> for <b>too</b> much in return, not offering too much <b>too</b> soon <b>or</b> for <b>too</b> little return.|$|R

5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of {{the casting}} it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, <b>or</b> <b>too</b> much lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of the}} casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{challenge}} {{that came up}} in production was who Monk's new psychiatrist would be. Several ideas included a woman, someone too strict <b>or</b> <b>too</b> nice, someone driven crazy by Monk's compulsions, and even someone who would give Monk scream therapy. The eventual decision came from writer Jonathan Collier, who suggested a one-armed psychiatrist. Shalhoub liked the idea, but required that they recruit an actual one-armed actor to play Dr. Sorenson. The Screen Actors Guild actually had several actors waiting to audition, and the part was given to Rick Curry.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure. The {{majority of the}} Palestinian people view him as a heroic freedom fighter and martyr who symbolized the national aspirations of his people. Conversely, most Israelis came to regard him as an unrepentant terrorist, while Palestinian rivals, including Islamists and several PLO leftists, often denounced him for being corrupt <b>or</b> <b>too</b> submissive in his concessions to the Israeli government.|$|E

5|$|At 15:05 another British ship {{appeared}} on the horizon, the sloop , which persuaded Montfort that {{he could no longer}} protect the battered Pomone against superior numbers. Pauline set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were either too battered <b>or</b> <b>too</b> distant to pursue. Alceste and Active now concentrated their full broadsides on Pomone, which soon lost both masts and was forced to surrender to prevent total destruction. Pauline escaped, later reaching Ancona safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Finds from sites outside England, {{especially}} in France, {{have in the}} nineteenth and twentieth century been referred to M. bucklandii. In 2010 Benson considered these as either clearly different <b>or</b> <b>too</b> fragmentary to establish an identity. In 2014, fossils from the Philippines were identified as dinosaurian in nature, and American palaeontologist John J. Flynn suspected that they belonged to Megalosaurus.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} {{humidity}} {{are essential for}} optimum fruit body development, and growth is inhibited by either too much <b>or</b> <b>too</b> little light. Fruit bodies change their geotropic response three times during their development, which helps ensure that the teeth ultimately point downward for optimum spore release. The pure culture, cell division and the ultrastructure of A.vulgares hyphae and mycelia have been studied and described in search of potentially useful characters for phylogenetic analysis. When grown in culture, the fungus can be induced to produce fruit bodies under suitable conditions.|$|E

5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (<b>or</b> <b>too</b> much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans {{were known to}} {{dominate}} the conversation amongst elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked too much <b>or</b> <b>too</b> loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her). When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized {{a new form of}} lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.|$|E
5|$|Based on estimations of the {{primordial}} mass required to form Uranus and Neptune, {{as well as}} bodies as large as Pluto (see below), earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested {{that the number of}} large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50AU, so this sudden drastic falloff, known as the Kuiper cliff, was unexpected, and to date its cause is unknown. In 2003, Bernstein, Trilling, et al. found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100km or more in radius beyond 50AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include that material at that distance was too scarce <b>or</b> <b>too</b> scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed those that did. Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.|$|E

5|$|Belugas {{were the}} first whales {{to be kept in}} captivity. Other species were too rare, too shy, <b>or</b> <b>too</b> big. The first beluga was shown at Barnum's Museum in New York City in 1861. For most of the 20th century, Canada was the {{predominant}} source of wild belugas. They were taken from the St. Lawrence River estuary until the late 1960s, after which they were predominantly taken from the Churchill River estuary until capture was banned in 1992. Russia has become the largest provider since it had been banned in Canada. Belugas are caught in the Amur River delta and their eastern coast, and then are either transported domestically to aquariums or dolphinariums in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Sochi, or exported to other countries, such as Canada. Most captive belugas are caught in the wild, since captive-breeding programs are not very successful.|$|E
5|$|Big Huge Games added {{multiple}} {{new features}} {{to the game}} during its development, {{in an attempt to}} fix issues with the original version. In an interview with GameSpot, executive producer Tim Train explained the development of the expansion pack. He stated how some nations were previously either too weak <b>or</b> <b>too</b> strong, and so features were added to balance gameplay. One way they did this is armed caravans and merchants were added to the Dutch nation, in order to weaken raids initiated by other players who rush their opponent. He said Big Huge Games brought in professional players in order to get suggestions on how to improve the game.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint <b>or</b> <b>too</b> high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E

Danny wakes from his mental explorations if he falls off the level <b>or</b> <b>too</b> high of a surface, is touched by a monster, or fails to stop a timer, but the C.R.U.S.H. device reinserts him at the start of the level or the last checkpoint Danny passed.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} are filter feeders, {{using their}} gills to capture particulate food such as phytoplankton from the water. The protobranchs feed {{in a different}} way, scraping detritus from the seabed, {{and this may be}} the original mode of feeding used by all bivalves before the gills became adapted for filter feeding. These primitive bivalves hold on to the substratum with a pair of tentacles {{at the edge of the}} mouth, each of which has a single palp, or flap. The tentacles are covered in mucus, which traps the food, and cilia, which transport the particles back to the palps. These then sort the particles, rejecting those that are unsuitable <b>or</b> <b>too</b> large to digest, and conveying others to the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, too much <b>or</b> <b>too</b> little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.|$|E
