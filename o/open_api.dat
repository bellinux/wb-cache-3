5|$|To create 2,000 Hun {{soldiers}} {{during the}} Huns' attack sequence, the production team developed crowd simulation software called Attila. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A {{variant of the}} program called Dynasty {{was used in the}} final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar's photorealistic <b>open</b> <b>API</b> RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane, which was used to add depth to flat two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, Faux Plane was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the Chinese are bowing to Mulan, the crowd is a panoramic film of real people bowing. It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.|$|E

2500|$|The Bloomberg <b>Open</b> <b>API</b> (BLPAPI) {{application}} programming interface (API) allows third-party applications, such as Microsoft Excel, {{to access}} Bloomberg data via the Terminal and Bloomberg's market data products. A user might wish to use Bloomberg data from the Terminal {{to create their own}} calculations; by accessing streaming, historical, and reference market data from another program, they can build these formulae. The Bloomberg Terminal installation ships with Excel add-ins which facilitate building spreadsheets which consume market data. In addition, Bloomberg offers free BLPAPI SDKs allowing Bloomberg subscribers to build their own software which accesses market data in C, C++, Java, [...]NET, Perl, and Python, on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Solaris.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 April 2017, Gearbox Publishing {{announced}} {{a partnership with}} G2A for exclusive collector’s editions of , to be created and sold by G2A. Bain was critical of this move, citing G2A’s negative press coverage as well as accusations made against the company, and threatened to withhold covering Bulletstorm, or any other Gearbox game, unless Gearbox cancelled the deal. [...] On 6 April 2017, one day before Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition was due for release, Gearbox published a list of ultimatums made together with Bain for G2A to accept, or else it would {{back out of the}} deal. The ultimatums focused on G2A’s Shield service, an <b>open</b> <b>API</b> for game developers, and G2A’s payment system. The following day, Gearbox Publishing publicly announced that it is ending its cooperation with G2A, {{due to a lack of}} response from the company concerning the ultimatums. G2A responded to the assertions on 10 April 2017 stating, [...] "All of the requests made of G2A.COM in the ultimatum have in fact long been part of our marketplace", and ascribed the problems to the unfamiliarities that Bain and Gearbox have in regards to how G2A operates its marketplace.|$|E
5000|$|While an <b>open</b> <b>API</b> is {{regarded}} as a gamble just like a paywall, journalist Matthew Ingram ethically notes that the use of an <b>open</b> <b>API</b> aims at [...] "profiting from the open exchange of information and other aspects of an online-media world, while the paywall is an attempt to create the kind of artificial information scarcity that newspapers used to enjoy." [...] An <b>open</b> <b>API</b> keeps news content free to the public while the newspaper makes a profit from the quality and usefulness of its data to other businesses. The <b>open</b> <b>API</b> strategy can be commended because it takes the pressure off of the news room to continually investigate and explore new means of revenue. Instead, the <b>open</b> <b>API</b> strategy relies on the interest and ideas of those outside the newsroom, to whom the sites content and data are attractive.|$|E

50|$|With {{the rise}} in {{prominence}} of HTML5 and Web 2.0, the modern browsing experience has become interactive and dynamic and this has, in part, been accelerated {{through the use of}} <b>open</b> <b>APIs.</b> Some <b>open</b> <b>APIs</b> fetch data from the database behind a website and these are called Web APIs. For example, Google's YouTube API allows developers to integrate YouTube into their applications by providing the capability to search for videos, retrieve standard feeds, and see related content.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Open</b> <b>APIs</b> {{can be used}} by {{businesses}} {{seeking to}} leverage the ever-growing community of freelancing developers who have the ability to create innovative applications that add value to their core business. <b>Open</b> <b>APIs</b> are favoured in the business sphere as they simultaneously increase the production of new ideas without investing directly in development efforts. Businesses often tailor their APIs to target specific developer audiences that they feel will be most effective in creating valuable new applications. However, an API can significantly diminish an application's functionality if it is overloaded with features.|$|R
