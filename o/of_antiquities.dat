5|$|In 1895 and 1896 {{the ruins}} at Abydos, Tukh, Hierakonpolis and Gebelein were excavated. In 1892 Jacques de Morgan, Director <b>of</b> <b>Antiquities</b> in Egypt, proved that pottery found at Abydos and Nakadah pre-dated the dynastic period, {{stimulating}} interest by many European Archaeologists. As each excavation was completed, local Egyptian residents {{would continue to}} search the sites for remains. In 1895 E. A. Wallis Budge, {{on behalf of the}} British Museum, procured inscribed coffins and funerary furniture from the 12th Dynasty tombs at Al-Barshah by working with the Egyptian Service <b>of</b> <b>Antiquities.</b> Budge started purchasing predynastic finds from the locals including bowls, spear and arrow heads, carved flint and bone figures and partial human remains (described as chiefly bones without skin or flesh remaining).|$|E

5|$|Palmyra's first {{excavations}} {{were conducted}} in 1902 by Otto Puchstein and in 1917 by Theodor Wiegand. In 1929, French general director <b>of</b> <b>antiquities</b> of Syria and Lebanon Henri Arnold Seyrig began large-scale excavation of the site; interrupted by World War II, it resumed soon after the war's end. Seyrig started with the Temple of Bel in 1929 and between 1939 and 1940 he excavated the Agora. Daniel Schlumberger conducted excavations in the Palmyrene northwest countryside in 1934 and 1935 where he studied different local sanctuaries in the Palmyrene villages. From 1954 to 1956, a Swiss expedition organized by UNESCO excavated the Temple of Baalshamin. Since 1958, the site has been excavated by the Syrian Directorate-General <b>of</b> <b>Antiquities,</b> and Polish expeditions led by many archaeologists including Kazimierz Michałowski (until 1980) and Michael Gawlikowski (until 2011). The stratigraphic sounding beneath the Temple of Bel was conducted in 1967 by Robert du Mesnil du Buisson, who also discovered the Temple of Baal-hamon in the 1970s.|$|E

Until 1999, the restorations were carried out by the Syrian Directorate-General <b>of</b> <b>Antiquities</b> and Museums (DGAM). In 1999 a joint French-Syrian mission was initiated {{under the supervision of the}} DGAM and the Institut français du Proche-Orient (IFPO). Between 2000 and 2006, this mission carried out extensive archaeological and art-historical research in the citadel, as well as further restoration works. In celebration of these restorations, a ceremony was held on 1 July 2006 which was attended by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.|$|E

Most of the hypogea were excavated jointly by the Polish expedition and the Syrian Directorate, while the area of Efqa was excavated by Jean Starcky and Jafar al-Hassani. The Palmyrene irrigation system was discovered in 2008 by Jørgen Christian Meyer who researched the Palmyrene countryside through ground inspections and satellite images. Most of Palmyra still remains unexplored especially the residential quarters {{in the north and}} south while the necropolis has been thoroughly excavated by the Directorate and the Polish expedition. Excavation expeditions left Palmyra in 2011 due to the Syrian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The Tetrapylon {{was erected}} during the renovations of Diocletian {{at the end}} of the third century. It is a square {{platform}} and each corner contains a grouping of four columns.

Out of sixteen columns, only one is original while the rest are from reconstruction work by the Syrian Directorate-General <b>of</b> <b>Antiquities</b> in 1963, using concrete. The original columns were brought from Egypt and carved out of pink granite.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{has deteriorated}} considerably {{as a result}} of erosion. Excavations were carried out at al-Rahba, including the presumed site of Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk along the Euphrates bank, between 1976 and 1981 under the auspices of Syria's General Directorate <b>of</b> <b>Antiquities</b> and Museums, the Institut Français d'Etudes Arabes de Damas and the University of Lyon II. In later years, surveys of the site and the surrounding desert and Euphrates and Khabur valleys were carried out by multi-disciplinary teams of Syrian, American and European archaeologists. One of the French surveyors, J. L. Paillet, sketched the plans and elevations of the fortress, which are detailed in his 1983 dissertation, Le château de Rahba, étude d'architecture militaire islamique médiévale.|$|E
