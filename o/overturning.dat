40|$|Agricultural tractor <b>overturns</b> without {{rollover}} {{protective structures}} {{are the leading}} cause of farm fatalities in the United States. To our knowledge, no studies have incorporated the spatial scan statistic in identifying high-risk areas for tractor <b>overturns.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether tractor <b>overturns</b> cluster in certain parts of Kentucky and identify factors associated with tractor <b>overturns.</b> A spatial statistical analysis using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic was performed to identify county clusters at greatest risk for tractor <b>overturns.</b> A regression analysis was then performed to identify factors associated with tractor <b>overturns.</b> The spatial analysis revealed a cluster of higher than expected tractor <b>overturns</b> in four counties in northern Kentucky (RR =  2. 55) and 10 counties in eastern Kentucky (RR =  1. 97). Higher rates of tractor <b>overturns</b> were associated with steeper average percent slope of pasture land by county (p =  0. 0002) and a greater percent of total tractors with less than 40 horsepower by county (p< 0. 0001). This study reveals that geographic hotspots of tractor <b>overturns</b> exist in Kentucky and identifies factors associated with <b>overturns.</b> This study provides policymakers a guide to targeted county-level interventions (e. g., roll-over protective structures promotion interventions) with the intention of reducing tractor <b>overturns</b> in the highest risk counties in Kentucky...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTurbulent <b>overturns</b> are {{distinguished}} from salinity-compensated intrusions in high-resolution moored thermistor string observations. The buoyancy frequency N {{is used to}} make the time dimensionless, "t*. " This results in a primary, visual means to easily compare the duration of <b>overturns</b> with N, the natural frequency that separates internal waves from turbulent <b>overturns.</b> As a secondary means, the shapes of <b>overturns</b> are investigated. Above various sloping topography between 500 and 1, 000 m water depth where the buoyancy period varies between ∼ 1, 300 and 2, 600 s, vertical <b>overturns</b> of ∼ 40 m last Δt* = 0. 2 – 0. 4. This corresponds with the timescale of growth of model-stratified turbulence {{in the wake of a}} grid. Smaller-scale, weaker-turbulent, shear-induced Kelvin-Helmholtz <b>overturns</b> of ∼ 5 m are observed to last approximately Δt* = 0. 03, whereas the passage of their train of multiple consecutive <b>overturns</b> lasts up to approximately Δt* = 0. 95. Although the shape of <b>overturns</b> can distinguish salinity-compensated intrusions from turbulent <b>overturns,</b> the present observations from internal wave breaking above sloping topography show complex results of mixed features...|$|R

50|$|In the United States, {{if there}} is a mistrial, or the case is <b>overturned</b> on appeal, {{generally}} this is without prejudice and (in the case of decision <b>overturned</b> on appeal) either all of the case is retried, or, if not all of the case is <b>overturned,</b> the parts that were <b>overturned</b> (like a sentencing hearing) are retried. If the case is dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct, it will typically be dismissed with prejudice, which means that the defendant cannot be retried.|$|R

5|$|After <b>overturning</b> a two-goal {{deficit to}} beat Woolwich Arsenal 4–3 in a {{friendly}} at Plumstead, Small Heath took on Aston Villa in their last match of the season, {{the final of the}} Birmingham Charity Cup. Unfortunately for the charities, the weather was poor and the attendance low, but those spectators present saw an exciting game. Wheldon scored first with a fierce shot that entered the net off the goalkeeper and the underside of the bar, then Bob Chatt equalised from a free kick and Charlie Athersmith outpaced Oliver and his parried shot was forced over the line. Mobley tied the scores with a long shot, but in the second half with the wind behind them, Villa scored three times to Jack Hallam's one to take the match 5–3.|$|E
5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling <b>overturning</b> the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} chores when {{farmers were}} either fatally or seriously injured and required {{emergency medical treatment}} {{as a result of}} <b>overturns</b> of tractors with or without rollover protective structures (ROPS). Data from the 2002 Kentucky Farm Tractor <b>Overturn</b> Survey were used for this study. The data were collected by a telephone survey of a population-based random sample of 6063 (7. 98 %) of Kentucky’s 76, 017 farm operators as listed in the Kentucky Agricultural Statistics Service database. Of farm operators interviewed, 551 (9. 1 %) reported 603 <b>overturns</b> and 5512 (90. 9 %) reported no <b>overturns</b> in the history of their farm, covering a period from 1925 to February 2002. Only the latest <b>overturn</b> was considered to improve recall accuracy. In addition, since the 1925 to 1959 time period had only 49 (8. 1 %) of the <b>overturns</b> reported, (14 farmers did not provide the year of most recent overturn); only data from the 1960 to 2002 period (approximately 41 years) were used. After making these adjustments, incidents evaluated included 25 cases (one fatal and four serious nonfatal injuries) that involved ROPS-equipped tractor <b>overturns</b> and 88 cases (24 fatal and 64 serious nonfatal injuries) that involved non-ROPS tractor <b>overturns.</b> Chores at highest risk for tractor <b>overturns</b> were identified for which educational and ROPS retrofit interventions could be emphasized. The highest frequency of overturn-related fatalities and nonfatal injuries were associated with hay harvesting, rotary mowing, and on-farm travel chores. These three chores represented 68. 2 % of fatal events and 50. 0 % of permanent and 56. 6 % of temporary disability <b>overturn</b> incidents. Tragically, in countries such as India and China with emerging mechanization, a large majority of tractors are produced without ROPS that can be expected to result in the same overturn-related epidemic of deaths experienced in highly mechanized countries, despite evidence of the protection provided by ROPS...|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{comfortable}} upbringing and {{his high}} social status, Pearson was a radical, and {{throughout his life}} he fought a number of campaigns on progressive and reforming issues including the removal from the Monument inscription blaming the Great Fire of London on Catholics, the abolition of packed special jury lists for political trials, and the <b>overturning</b> of the ban on Jews becoming brokers in the City. Pearson was in favour of the disestablishment of the Church of England and opposed capital punishment. Politically, he supported universal suffrage and electoral reform to balance the sizes of parliamentary constituencies. He unsuccessfully attempted to break the local monopolies developed by the gas companies, calling for the distribution pipework to be owned collectively by the consumers.|$|E

5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution.

As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for <b>overturning</b> Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E
