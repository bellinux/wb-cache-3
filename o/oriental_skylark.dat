500|$|The {{distance}} that a bird's longest primaries extend beyond its longest secondaries (or tertials) when its wings are folded {{is referred to}} as the primary extension or primary projection. [...] As with wing formulae, this measurement is useful for distinguishing between similarly plumaged birds; however, unlike wing formulae, it is not necessary to have the bird in-hand to make the measurement. [...] Rather, this is a useful relative measurement—some species have long primary extensions, while others have shorter ones. [...] Among the Empidonax flycatchers of the Americas, for example, the dusky flycatcher has a much shorter primary extension than does the very similarly plumaged Hammond's flycatcher. Europe's common skylark has a long primary projection, while that of the near-lookalike <b>Oriental</b> <b>skylark</b> is very short.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oriental</b> <b>skylarks</b> {{are about}} 16 cm long. They have streaked, {{yellow-brown}} upper plumage, with white outer tail feathers {{and a short}} crest. Both sexes are similar.|$|R
50|$|These skylarks {{frequently}} rocket up {{into the}} sky, fluttering and singing before descending down to earth. Male <b>Oriental</b> <b>skylarks</b> may also hover {{in the air and}} sing, in order to attract a mate.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Oriental</b> <b>skylark</b> (Alauda gulgula), {{also known}} as the Oriental lark or small skylark, is a species of skylark found in {{southern}} and central Asia. Like other skylarks, it is found in open grassland, often near bodies of water, where it feeds on seeds and insects.|$|E
50|$|Sykes's lark (Galerida deva) is {{a species}} of lark found in the dry open country of India. Its {{distribution}} is mainly restricted to central India, although stray records have been found elsewhere on the sub-continent. It is identified by its prominent crest and its overall rufous colouration. It has streaks on its breast which are less prominent than {{those found in the}} <b>Oriental</b> <b>skylark.</b>|$|E

40|$|Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the causative {{agent of}} {{hepatitis}} E, {{has been reported}} {{in a wide variety of}} animals, including birds, but little is known of HEV infection in pet birds in northwest China. The objective of the present investigation was to examine HEV seroprevalence in three species of pet birds, namely, Eurasian siskin, <b>Oriental</b> <b>skylark,</b> and black-tailed grosbeak from Gansu. Serum samples collected from 685 pet birds from August 2011 to September 2012 were examined independently for the presence of antibodies against HEV. A total of 59 (8. 31 %) pet birds were tested positive for HEV antibodies by the commercially available enzyme immunoassay kits. Of these, the seroprevalence was diverse in different species pet birds; the most frequent level was 10. 83 % (39 / 360) in Eurasian siskin, followed by 6. 57 % (19 / 289) in <b>Oriental</b> <b>skylark,</b> and 2. 29 % (1 / 36) in black-tailed grosbeak. Age and collecting region of pet birds were the main risk factors associated with HEV infection. The present study firstly revealed the seroprevalence of HEV infection in three species of pet birds in northwest China, which provided the baseline data for taking comprehensive countermeasures and measures for effectively preventing and controlling HEV infection in birds...|$|E
