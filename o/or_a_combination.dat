5|$|Outside of the {{seasonal}} variations, the geothermal gradient of temperatures through the crust is 25–30°C (77–86°F) per kilometer of depth {{in most of}} the world. The conductive heat flux averages 0.1MW/km2. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by fluid circulation, either through magma conduits, hot springs, hydrothermal circulation <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of these.|$|E

5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination.</b> Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{geographic}} {{variation in}} the incidence of AML. In adults, the highest rates are seen in North America, Europe, and Oceania, while adult AML is rarer in Asia and Latin America. In contrast, childhood AML is less common in North America and India than in other parts of Asia. These differences may be due to population genetics, environmental factors, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of the two.|$|E
5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E

5|$|As much as 80% of {{the lead}} in very high-content initial {{concentrates}} can be obtained as bullion; the remaining 20% forms a slag rich in lead monoxide. For a low-grade feed, all {{of the lead}} can be oxidized to a high-lead slag. Metallic lead is further obtained from the high-lead (25–40%) slags via submerged fuel combustion or injection, reduction assisted by an electric furnace, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of both.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{direction}} {{of this nature}} are most commonly observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone, the weakening of the anticyclone, a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Early {{fish from}} the fossil record are {{represented}} {{by a group of}} small, jawless, armored fish known as ostracoderms. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in Placodermi fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of factors.|$|E

Tickets can be used on a GO train, bus, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of both. They can be purchased at train stations, bus terminals, ticket agencies, or on GO buses.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated {{is very different from}} that in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer. This asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{have the}} option of trading their picks to other teams in {{exchange}} for different picks, players, money, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> thereof. It is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. Of the players selected in each draft and throughout its history, East Carolina has had 63 players picked.|$|E

After the 2007 changes to the Veterans Committee, the winner (if living) is no longer an automatic member of that body. To be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of the two.|$|E
5|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{warned in}} 2014 that {{over-the-counter}} acne products containing benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid, including Proactiv, can cause severe irritation, {{as well as}} rare but life-threatening allergic reactions. Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing problems, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions {{in a variety of}} ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.|$|E

5|$|Within the Triple Alliance, Prussia {{was hoping}} for some {{territorial}} gains in the Baltic region, through war (with Russia) or diplomacy (from the Commonwealth), <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of the above. With regard to the Balkans, the Triple Alliance aimed at restraining the Russian Empire, {{as well as the}} its ally, the Austrian Empire, and there were expectations of a war between the Alliance and Russia (and possibly Austria) around 1791.|$|E
5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, barriers, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
