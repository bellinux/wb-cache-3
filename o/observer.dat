40|$|AbstractDespite rapid {{oscillations}} of the eyes, {{visual acuity}} {{is close to}} normal in many <b>observers</b> with congenital nystagmus (CN). This study investigated whether binocular hyperacuity thresholds are also close to normal in <b>observers</b> with CN. To do so, we assessed stereothresholds for horizontally and vertically separated line targets in three normal <b>observers</b> and six <b>observers</b> with idiopathic horizontal CN. Stereothresholds in normal <b>observers</b> are better than in the <b>observers</b> with CN, especially for horizontally-separated targets and very small inter-line separations. Stereothresholds remain better in normal <b>observers</b> than in the <b>observers</b> with CN, even {{in the presence of}} conjugate retinal image motion simulating that in jerk nystagmus. However, when the simulated CN wave form also includes disconjugate position variability of the foveation periods, normal observers’ stereothresholds become similar to those of approximately half of the <b>observers</b> with CN. We conclude that stereothresholds in <b>observers</b> with CN are degraded by the more-or-less constant motion of the retinal image, by excessive vergence instability and, in some <b>observers,</b> by a neural sensory deficit...|$|R

Validity of the Scale was obtained by comparison with three-dimensional gait analysis (3 DGA). The experienced <b>observers</b> generally had higher inter-observer and intra-observer reliability than the inexperienced <b>observers.</b> Both groups showed higher agreement for assessments made at the ankle and foot than at the knee and hip. The experienced <b>observers</b> had slightly higher agreement with 3 DGA than the inexperienced <b>observers.</b> The inexperienced <b>observers</b> showed a learning effect and had higher inter-observer agreement and higher agreement with 3 DGA in the second assessment of the videotapes. This scale can be used by inexperienced <b>observers</b> but is limited to observations in the sagittal plane and by poor reliability at the knee and hip for experienced and inexperienced <b>observers...</b>|$|R
5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the <b>observer.</b> The component of movement that is {{in the direction of the}} <b>observer</b> is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the <b>observer,</b> the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the <b>observer</b> is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this shift at each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E
