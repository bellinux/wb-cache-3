5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Eric Bell, born in Belfast on 3 September 1947, {{began his}} career playing in local bands such as The Deltones, Shades <b>of</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>and</b> The Bluebeats, and the last {{incarnation}} of Them to feature Van Morrison, between September and October 1966. Bell later moved to Dublin and joined an Irish showband named The Dreams, but left in 1969 {{with a view to}} forming a rock band. An acquaintance of Bell's, Belfast organist Eric Wrixon (29 June 1947 – 13 July 2015), also a former member of Them, had also moved to Dublin and joined the showband circuit, but had similar plans to progress towards rock music.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren {{is notable}} for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays. The male in breeding plumage has a silvery blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and greyish-white belly. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> black plumage. All males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females have a black bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching. This has a patchy or spotty appearance, with a mixture <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late. Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year. Several males have been observed in breeding plumage in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.|$|E

5|$|Like other whales, males make long, loud, low-frequency sounds. The vocalizations <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> fin {{whales are}} the lowest-frequency sounds made by any animal. Most sounds are frequency-modulated (FM) down-swept {{infrasonic}} pulses from 16 to 40hertz frequency (the range of sounds that most humans can hear falls between 20hertz and 20kilohertz). Each sound lasts {{one to two}} seconds, and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each. The whale then repeats the sequences in bouts lasting up to many days. The vocal sequences have source levels of up to 184–186decibels relative to 1micropascal at a reference distance of one metre and can be detected {{hundreds of miles from}} their source.|$|E
5|$|The Martinique macaw was scientifically {{described}} by the British banker and zoologist Walter Rothschild in 1905, as a new species of the genus Anodorhynchus, A. martinicus. The taxon was solely based on a 1630s account by Père Jacques Bouton <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> orange-yellow macaws from the Lesser Antillean island of Martinique. Rothschild reclassified the species as Ara martinicus in his 1907 book, Extinct Birds, which also contained a restoration of the bird by the Dutch artist John Gerrard Keulemans. The reassignment lead to confusion as recently as 2001, when Williams and Steadman assumed the two names were meant to refer to separate birds. The Martinique amazon (Amazona martinicana) of the same island, was also based solely on a contemporary description.|$|E
5|$|The club {{eventually}} {{chose the}} colours {{of the local}} Parramatta council, which were royal blue and gold, which were represented on their jersey in horizontal stripes, or hoops. The crest used these colours and was {{like many of the}} other crests of the 1908 season, a badge with a letter 'C', to represent the first letter of Cumberland. The badge was royal blue, while the letter gold. These colours were later used by the Parramatta Eels at their introduction in the NSWRL premiership in 1947, although there was no official affiliation between Cumberland and the later Parramatta team. The club's jersey was, like most other clubs, the colours in hoops around the jersey. These hoops <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> gold were mixed with a white collar and black or grey shorts.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinctive}} Greek flag <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> white cross {{was first}} hoisted during the Greek War of Independence in March 1822. This was later modified {{so that the}} shade of blue matched that of the Bavarian coat of arms of the first King of Greece, Otto. The shield is emblazoned with the coat of arms of the Danish Royal Family, and the supporters on either side are also adapted from the Danish royal arms. Beneath the shield is the motto in Greek, Ἰσχύς μου ἡ αγάπη του λαου ("The people's love is my strength"). Beneath the motto dangles the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer, Greece's premier decoration of honor.|$|E
5|$|The {{first five}} locomotives, Nos. 6220–6224, {{were built in}} 1937 at the LMS Crewe Works at an average cost of £11,641 each. They were all {{intended}} to haul the Coronation Scot, so the locomotives and the special trainsets bore a common livery. The locomotives were streamlined and painted Caledonian Railway blue with silver horizontal lines along {{each side of the}} locomotive. The special trainsets that they hauled were painted the same shade <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> the silver lining was repeated along each side of the coaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E

5|$|Tow Law Town's home colours have {{traditionally}} been vertical black and white stripes with black shorts and socks. This is common amongst clubs in the North East of England; Football League Championship club Newcastle United play in black and white, but locally Spennymoor Town, Darlington, Ponteland United and Ashington also wear black and white kits. Tow Law Town's away strips consist <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> red halves with blue shorts and socks. Between 2006 and 2009, the club were sponsored by McInerney Homes, in a £5,000 a year deal. In August 2010, local company Bodywork Direct took over the club shirt sponsorship deal.|$|E
5|$|In March 1939, Aberdeen {{changed the}} black and gold colours to red and white, {{reflecting}} the silver and red colours of the official City of Aberdeen arms. The first red strips were worn with white shorts, with either red or white socks from 1939 until the 1965–66 season. In 1966, Aberdeen adopted red shorts, making the official kit all-red, {{similar to that of}} Liverpool, who made a similar change at around the same time. This arrangement has continued to the present day, with several variations in design, in common with most senior clubs as the replica shirt market has expanded. In the late 1970s an Admiral strip featured five vertical white stripes {{on the left side of}} the shirt and shorts, and the early 1980s shirts—as worn at the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup final—featured white vertical pinstripes. Later design changes included significant amounts <b>of</b> <b>blue,</b> <b>and</b> a one-season reversion to white shorts, although the all-red scheme returned in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Stockport County's {{traditional}} kit colours {{are blue}} and white, {{although they have}} played in other colours throughout their history. Originally competing in blue and white striped jerseys and white shorts, they experimented with red and white stripes in the early 1900s, and from the mid-1930s to mid-1960s played in white jerseys and black shorts. No set pattern has been established for the club's use <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> white as main colours, as they have played at various times in a white jersey with a blue band and blue shorts and a blue jersey with white pin stripes and white shorts. They made a short experiment with an Argentina-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black shorts, after the 1978 World Cup. This was abandoned after {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War, and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s. County marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 by bringing in a third kit – a gold colour with black trim. The kit was worn on 17 occasions, all away trips. The strip was retired 'undefeated' {{at the end of the}} year, having been worn for 13 victories and 4 draws. The kit was also worn during a match against Chester City which was abandoned after 59 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The second {{version was}} a lyric video, which {{features}} Hamasaki in a recording studio. It also features candid photos of Hamasaki in Los Angeles, Japan, and doing other endeavours outside of music. The Riff Studio version features Hamasaki as her character design AyuPan and a character titled the Bloody Bunny. Both {{of them are}} in a space ship, and travel throughout different worlds and atmospheres, until landing on a planet with blue aliens. The aliens appear to be sad, whist AyuPan and the Bloody Bunny stand there. AyuPan then plays the song from her space ship, and makes the aliens feel happy; they all begin dancing to the track. It ends with the world turning pink instead <b>of</b> <b>blue,</b> <b>and</b> has heart shapes around it. This version premiered one week before the album's release in July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E
5|$|Upon formation, the 2/15th {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Robert Marlan, an Australian Staff Corps officer of the Permanent Military Forces who arrived on {{promotion}} from major, having previously served in World War I with the 20th Battalion. The colours initially chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 15th Battalion, a unit that had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were initially purple and red in a diamond shape, but after representations from World War I veterans the colour patch was changed to brown over dark blue, in a rectangle shape. The patch was placed inside a grey diamond border added to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; this would change following the unit's involvement in the fighting at Tobruk, when it adopted a 'T'-shaped UCP consisting <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> green.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} colours of all IFK {{associations are}} blue and white, and IFK Göteborg is no exception. Soon after the club's foundation in 1904, {{it was decided}} that the kit should consist of a blue and white striped shirt with blue shorts. But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used. Thus the club's first kit used a blue shirt with a single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest. During the next few years, white or blue shirts without stripes were used. In 1910, a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time inspired by the kit of Kjøbenhavns Boldklub. This kit has remained as the home colours ever since. The small amount of sponsor logos, together with the longtime use <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> white stripes, has made the kit a classic in Swedish football. The most common away kit has been red and white in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away kit introduced in 2005 once again used red and white. An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters. In the 2010s, the away-kit colours have seen much variation, including a pink shirt with black shorts, a black kit with light-grey details, the more traditional red kit with white trimmings, and a purple kit with white details introduced in 2016.|$|E
