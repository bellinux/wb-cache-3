5|$|After a {{visit from}} his sick mother, Arletta (Jo Van Fleet), Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He {{continually}} confronts the Captain and the guards, and {{his sense of humor}} and independence prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the <b>other</b> <b>prisoners.</b> Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour.|$|E
5|$|At 11 am a {{disturbance}} {{started in the}} chapel at Strangeways Prison when some 300 prisoners attacked staff. Those prisoners then gained access to the chapel roof and then broke into the living accommodation in the main prison. <b>Other</b> <b>prisoners,</b> including those on remand, joined in the disturbance and staff had to be withdrawn. The perimeter is secure.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century Fort al-Jalali was {{the main}} prison in Oman, holding about 200 prisoners. Some were Omanis from the {{interior}} captured during the Jebel Akhdar War (1954–59), or taken after that war. <b>Other</b> <b>prisoners</b> were taken during the Dhofar Rebellion (1962–76).|$|E

5|$|Seemingly {{doomed to}} death, Kamo then {{had the good}} luck along with <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> to have his {{sentence}} commuted to a long prison term {{as part of the}} celebrations of the Romanov dynasty tricentennial in 1913. Kamo was released from prison after the February Revolution in 1917.|$|E
5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E
5|$|Aleksandras Stulginskis and Petras Klimas {{were sent}} to prison in Siberia by Soviet authorities, but survived and {{returned}} to Lithuania; Pranas Dovydaitis and Vladas Mironas were also sent to Siberia but died there. Kazys Bizauskas disappeared {{during the summer of}} 1941 while being transported to a Soviet prison in Minsk; he is presumed to have been shot along with a number of <b>other</b> <b>prisoners.</b> Donatas Malinauskas was deported to Russia on June 14, 1941.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{while this}} {{investigation}} into the affairs of one prisoner was going on, the <b>other</b> <b>prisoner,</b> Jake, was busily employed investigating his own affairs {{with a view to}} escape.|$|R
60|$|Evidently he was {{the only}} <b>other</b> <b>prisoner.</b> As he slept I leaned over and looked at him. There was {{something}} strangely familiar about his face, and yet I could not place him.|$|R
6000|$|... "The loaf and jar of water," [...] {{answered}} the <b>other</b> <b>prisoner,</b> [...] "stand in the corner, two steps {{to your right}} hand. Take them, and welcome. With earthly food I have wellnigh done." ...|$|R
5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that a prisoner serving a 27-year sentence was conducting a lone protest on the roof against conditions and was being cheered by <b>other</b> <b>prisoners.</b> The newspaper also referenced in its own report an interview with former lord chief justice Lord Woolf from {{earlier in the year}} where he described prisoners being kept in intolerable conditions–as bad as {{at the time of the}} riots. Woolf recommended prisons were kept out of politics.|$|E
5|$|In Birkenau, Vrba had {{encountered}} an acquaintance from Trnava, Alfréd Wetzler (prisoner no.29162), {{who was working}} in the mortuary. The two men hatched an escape plan, and on 7 April 1944, with the help of two <b>other</b> <b>prisoners,</b> they hid inside a pile of wood stacked between the camp's inner and outer perimeter fences, sprinkling the area with tobacco soaked in gasoline to fool the dogs.|$|E

2500|$|Adair {{was held}} with <b>other</b> loyalist <b>prisoners</b> in their [...] "block" [...] of the prison.

5|$|In that situation, Levski's {{assistant}} Dimitar Obshti robbed an Ottoman postal convoy in the Arabakonak pass on 22 September 1872, without {{approval from}} Levski or {{the leadership of}} the movement. While the robbery was successful and provided IRO with 125,000 groschen, Obshti and the other perpetrators were soon arrested. The preliminary investigation and trial revealed the revolutionary organisation's size and its close relations with BRCC. Obshti and <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> made a full confession and revealed Levski's leading role.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May 1947, Pilecki {{was arrested}} by agents of the Ministry of Public Security. Prior to trial, he was {{repeatedly}} tortured. The investigation of Pilecki's activities was supervised by Colonel Roman Romkowski. He was interrogated by Col. Józef Różański, and lieutenants S. Łyszkowski, W. Krawczyński, J. Kroszel, T. Słowianek, Eugeniusz Chimczak and S. Alaborski – men who were especially infamous for their savagery. But Pilecki sought to protect <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> and revealed no sensitive information.|$|E
5|$|The retreat {{continued}} until 11 May. On 12 May, Hampel carried out surrender {{negotiations with the}} British Army at Sankt Veit an der Glan. On 15 May {{most of the men}} were transported to Rimini in Italy, where they were incarcerated with <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> of war from 7th SS Division and 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS. Scattered remnants did not surrender until 18 May and many attempted to obliterate their SS blood group tattoo. Hampel escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Fallingbostel.|$|E
50|$|Other prison {{camps in}} Albania - Several {{individuals}} {{claimed that they}} were kidnapped and transported to these camps where they witnessed torture of <b>others</b> <b>prisoners,</b> but these individuals fail to explain why they them self were let free to tell the world.|$|R

5|$|The three remain undetected for two days, {{even as a}} {{probe and}} a group of the Martians {{themselves}} explore the basement. They also soon discover that the Martians are growing strange red-colored alien vegetation across the landscape and is quickly growing, covering trees and spreading into the basement, thus explaining the Martians' motives: to colonise Earth for their species, therefore making Earth a Mars-like planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches them sleeping. Rachel is soon abducted by a nearby Tripod; Ray allows himself to be abducted, and is placed in the same cage with Rachel and a number of <b>other</b> <b>prisoners.</b> As the Tripod selects him for harvesting, Ray takes a belt of grenades into the machine in his place, having pulled out the pins. The Tripod is destroyed and releases the cage, with Ray and Rachel, and the <b>other</b> <b>prisoners,</b> making it out alive.|$|E
5|$|When Miles {{reveals his}} secret {{identity}} to his girlfriend, Katie Bishop, {{she and her}} parents are revealed to be sleeper agents for the terrorist group Hydra, who then kidnap Miles, his father and Ganke, {{as part of a}} plan involving Dr. Doom. Miles and the <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> are freed, however, in part with help from Miles' dorm mate, Judge, Maria Hill, and other superhuman colleagues.|$|E
5|$|With {{occasional}} interruptions due {{to prison}} disciplinary actions, Abu-Jamal has {{for many years}} been a regular commentator on an online broadcast, sponsored by Prison Radio. He also is published as a regular columnist for Junge Welt, a Marxist newspaper in Germany. For almost a decade, Abu-Jamal taught introductory courses in Georgist economics to <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> around the world by correspondence.|$|E

50|$|In July 2010, after 15 {{years of}} solitary confinement, Amir {{appealed to the}} Petah Tikva District Court to be {{permitted}} to participate in group prayers in accordance to Jewish law. He claimed that the terms of his imprisonment were worse than any <b>other</b> <b>prisoner</b> {{in the history of}} the State of Israel, on the grounds that no <b>other</b> <b>prisoner</b> had been in solitary for this amount of time. He said that failure to allow him to pray in synagogue would be a violation of his right to freedom of worship. In August 2010, the court ruled that Amir would be allowed to meet another prisoner for prayer three times a week, and that he would be allowed to study Torah with another prisoner once every two weeks.|$|R
50|$|Gustav Wagner is {{the most}} clever and sadistic of the German officers. When two prisoners escape from a work detail in the nearby forest, Wagner forces the {{remaining}} 13 prisoners of the work gang to each select one <b>other</b> <b>prisoner</b> to die with them and then executes all 26.|$|R
5|$|After recovering, {{he joined}} the Kimberley Mounted Corps and guided two {{officers}} from Lichtenburg to Klerksdorp, where they persuaded the Boers to surrender by bluffing that a strong British force was following close behind. The Boers soon retook the town and Guest was captured. He was sent with <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> to Pietersburg to be executed {{but he managed to}} escape and travelled to Warmbaths. After satisfying the authorities that he had actually been taken prisoner and had not surrendered voluntarily, he returned to his depot at Kimberley. His unit had been disbanded and he was discharged.|$|E
5|$|Aleksandras Stulginskis and Petras Klimas {{were sent}} to prison in Siberia by Soviet authorities, but survived and {{returned}} to Lithuania.

5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and then be beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the <b>other</b> <b>prisoners</b> watch from {{the windows of the}} bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E
