5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if the purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan,</b> it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent {{and the subject of}} claims by creditors.|$|E

5|$|Minimum {{processing}} requirements {{also became}} {{an issue in the}} Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). Dunderdale announced {{in a speech to the}} St. John's Board of Trade in May 2013, that the loan guarantee for the Muskrat Falls project nearly fell apart because of MPRs. She said that the federal government tried to pressure her into eliminating MPRs at the eleventh hour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> guarantee negotiations to help secure the trade deal. Dunderdale said that while she was willing to look at minimum processing requirements, she was not willing to tie it to the loan guarantee.|$|E
5|$|The {{move to a}} {{new stadium}} was necessitated by the terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> York City secured from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund to {{purchase}} their Bootham Crescent ground. Planning permission for the current design, put forward by Greenwich Leisure Ltd, was granted in March 2015. Construction is expected to begin in the summer of 2016, for completion in early 2018. In addition to the stadium, the site will house a leisure complex and a community hub.|$|E

His men rob the original copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> documents in the local branch of Bank of Maharashtra and destroy the bank records. Surya slowly becomes both popular and feared as an extortionist, while Dharavi locals praise him as their saviour. Surya is aware of Bhardwaj's intentions. To safeguard himself, he traps Bhardwaj's daughter Chitra, a keen painter, by posing as a NRI businessman interested in arts. They both fall in love. However, by the time Surya realises that he truly loves her, Bhardwaj has exposed Surya's real nature to Chitra which makes her hate him. Surya is immediately arrested.|$|E

5|$|Born in Albury, New South Wales, Meredith {{was spotted}} playing {{football}} in Melbourne {{at the age}} of 16 by a Derby County scout. He was offered a trial by the club and he joined their youth system on a two-year contract in 2004. He progressed through the youth team and he signed a two-year professional contract with Derby on 19 July 2006. He joined Conference National club Cambridge United on a one-month loan on 19 October 2006 and he made his debut in a 3–0 defeat to Oxford United. He finished the loan with two appearances. He had a trial with Conference National club York City in January 2007, playing in a reserve-team match against Rotherham United. He joined League One team Chesterfield on a one-month loan on 19 February 2007, making one appearance as a left midfielder in a 2–0 defeat to Tranmere Rovers on 2 March. Following the expiry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan,</b> Chesterfield opted against extending it.|$|E
5|$|Following his loan spell at Fulham, Holtby {{returned}} to Tottenham {{and by the}} end of August 2014 had made three appearances, included in which were two in the Europa League. However, having struggled to make an impact at White Hart Lane with Spurs, and after the club signed Benjamin Stambouli from Montpellier, Holtby elected to return to Germany to join Hamburg on loan the following month. In terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> agreement, Hamburg retained the option to purchase Holtby outright for a fee of ₤6.5 million. Despite breaking his collarbone during the Rückrunde, Holtby made 22 Bundesliga appearances in his debut season for Hamburg and started in both legs of the club's relegation playoff victory over Karlsruher SC.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the New Meadowlands Stadium opened, {{replacing}} Giants Stadium. The {{new stadium}} is a 50/50 {{partnership between the}} Giants and Jets, and while the stadium {{is owned by the}} New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority on paper, the two teams jointly built the stadium using private funds, and administer it jointly through New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation. The Giants had previously planned a $300-million renovation to the Meadowlands, before deciding in favor of the new stadium which was originally estimated to cost approximately $600 million, before rising to an estimated cost of $1.2 billion. One advantage gained by owning the stadium is that the teams saved considerable money in tax payments, leasing the land from the state at a cost of $6.3 million per year. The state paid for all utilities, including the $30 million needed to install them. Both teams received $150 million loans from the NFL to pay for construction of the stadium. Representatives from the league's teams voted 30–2 in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|E
50|$|House Rules {{explicitly}} {{state that}} before entering into loans from an entity {{other than a}} financial institution, members of Congress and staff must submit <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> for review and a determination from the ethics committee on whether <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> is acceptable under the gift rule. It is not clear if Miller complied with this requirement.|$|R
50|$|Another {{issue was}} repayment: the Labour Party owed about £14 m before the election. The {{interest}} on <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> amounted to £900,000 {{a year and}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> had to be repaid within months, either through further borrowing or gifts. In these circumstances, one unanswered question concerned why Lord Levy asked for loans rather than gifts.|$|R
50|$|For example, if Bank A securitises €100m of assets, {{they may}} {{typically}} include a first loss deductible of 2%, {{meaning that they}} will be liable for up to €2m of losses incurred as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> going bad.|$|R
5|$|On 30 January 2017, Milan {{confirmed}} the loan signing of Ocampos {{for the remainder}} of the season, with Genoa retaining the option to buy from Marseille at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> spell. He was signed as a replacement for Frenchman M'Baye Niang who had moved on loan to Premier League side Watford. Ocampos made his debut for the club on 5 February, coming on as a late second-half substitute for Andrea Bertolacci in a 1–0 defeat to Sampdoria. He featured sporadically for the club, however, and at the end of the season returned to Marseille having played 29 matches and scored 3 goals across all competitions during his stints with Genoa and Milan.|$|E
5|$|Baroš joined Premier League side Portsmouth on {{loan from}} Lyon in January 2008 {{until the end of}} the season, with the option of making the move {{permanent}} at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan.</b> Baroš played a significant role in the club winning the 2008 FA Cup. He won Portsmouth's match-winning penalty kick in the quarter-final at Manchester United and assisted Nwankwo Kanu's deciding goal in the semi final match against West Bromwich Albion with a suspected handball that went unnoticed by both the referee and his assistant. The final match of Baroš' loan spell was the 2008 FA Cup Final victory over Cardiff City at Wembley Stadium, where he appeared as an 87th-minute substitute for Kanu. By the end of the season, Baroš had played 16 matches for Portsmouth, including seven as a substitute, although he failed to score. He was one of a number of Portsmouth players to be absent at the team parade after the club won the FA Cup, leading to speculation he could have played his last game for the club. At the end of the season, Baroš returned to Lyon.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Sheffield Wednesday in May 2005, Foster was {{released}} and later joined League Two side Lincoln City on a one-year contract ahead of the 2005–06 season. Foster made his debut for Lincoln in the club's {{first game of the}} season, a 2–1 defeat to Notts County. However, he failed to hold down a first-team place and had to wait a month to make another appearance for the club – coming on as a 73rd-minute substitute in Lincoln's 2–0 win against Stockport County. However, he was unable to string a series of appearances together throughout the campaign, and made 17 appearances, scoring once in a 5–0 win against Grimsby Town on 25 March 2006. Despite a lack of first-team appearances, Foster signed an extended one-year contract {{at the end of the}} season. However, Foster did not feature again for Lincoln during the 2006–07 campaign and after training with York City, he joined the Conference National team on a one-month emergency loan on 5 October 2006 due to injuries to defenders, making his debut for the club the following day in a 1–0 win against Aldershot Town. This loan deal was extended for a second month in November, but after Foster suffered an ankle injury during the last week <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan,</b> he returned to his parent club in December. He made his last appearance for York in the club's 1–0 loss to League One side Bristol City in the FA Cup first round. He made seven appearances for York during a two-month loan spell with the club.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} derive a {{theoretical}} {{model in which}} bank loans rates {{are assumed to be}} determined by <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> (re) financing. We consider that imperfect competition prevails on the credit market and that banks determine the (re-) financing structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> they grant by maximizing their profit, taking account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> demand elasticity. This model is then estimated using a panel <b>of</b> French banks. <b>The</b> estimation results indicate that banks get the necessary resources to refinance their loans, by decreasing importance, from the monetary market, from the financial market and from interest-bearings deposits. An increase of one point in the monetary base rate is shown to have an impact of about 0. 8 point on banks loans rate. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> credit risks management on <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> guaranteed under Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF), {{over the period}} 1996 - 2012. Thirty six states and the Federal Capital Territory, <b>of</b> Nigeria constitute <b>the</b> population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study. Using a sample selection formula, 30 states were randomly selected, (five from each geo-political zone). Documentary data was generated from the annual statistical bulletin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Bank <b>of</b> Nigeria 2012. Descriptive statistics, correlation and fixed-effects generalized least square regression techniques were used in analyzing the data. The study discloses that Default rate (DR) and implicit price deflator (IPD) affects <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> given by banks and guaranteed by CBN positively and significantly, while <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> claims settled increased insignificantly. Consequently, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> claims settled has a negative and significant effect on <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> guaranteed. <b>The</b> finding implies that there is sub-optimal credit risks management practice in Nigerian banks leading to substantial amount of non-performing <b>loans.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> non-performing <b>loans</b> were mostly <b>the</b> ones involving greater value. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> findings, <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nigerian Banks should come up with better credit management policies {{in order to reduce}} <b>the</b> non-performing <b>loans</b> to <b>the</b> barest minimum because of its negative effect on <b>the</b> profitability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banks.

5|$|To get {{satisfactory}} {{conditions for}} the loan, the company was recommended by banks to increase the ownership equity to 10% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan.</b> The share capital was insufficient, so the company started issuing preferred shares to individuals and the companies, and managed to secure NOK1.7 million. An exception to the rules was made, and the company was allowed to start detailed planning before the loans had been finalized. An estimate from 1966 showed that the bridge itself would cost NOK27 million, while the auxiliary roads would cost NOK4 million, excluding inflation and interest during construction. On 23 November 1966, the county council supported a proposal that {{one third of the}} construction costs be covered by national road funds. On 10 August 1967, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Norway gave permission that the company could borrow up to NOK25 million. The loan was a bond sold by Bergens Privatbank and Samvirke Forsikring, consisting of one series valued at NOK15 million issued in 1968, and one valued at NOK10 million issued in 1970, with an interest of 5.5% and 6.0%, respectively. There was a five years interest-only period, followed by ten years of repayment. The mortgage deed was secured in the right to collect tolls, supported by guarantees from the municipalities of Bergen, Fjell, Sund and Øygarden, and the county municipality. In addition, the company was granted loans from Bergens Privatbank, Bergens Sparebank and Vestlandsbanken for NOK3 million, although these were never used. The state's part of the financing was through a loan from the Regional Development Fund.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{corporate}} bonds, most securitizations are amortized, {{meaning that}} the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan,</b> rather than in one lump sum at the maturity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loan.</b> Fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets, such as home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans. Prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing ABS. The possible rate of prepayment varies widely {{with the type of}} underlying asset pool, so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity. The PSA prepayment model is a well-known example.|$|E
