5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E

5|$|Like other elements, {{a variety}} of {{processes}} alter the relative abundance <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> isotopes. The best studied of these processes is the mass-dependent fractionation <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> isotopes that accompanies the precipitation <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> minerals such as calcite, aragonite and apatite from solution. Lighter isotopes are preferentially incorporated into these minerals, leaving the surrounding solution enriched in heavier isotopes at a magnitude of roughly 0.025% per atomic mass unit (amu) at room temperature. Mass-dependent differences in calcium isotope composition are conventionally expressed by the ratio of two isotopes (usually 44Ca/40Ca) in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material. 44Ca/40Ca varies by about 1% among common earth materials.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether propofol and aminophylline affect the mobilization <b>of</b> intracellular <b>calcium</b> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Intracellular calcium {{was measured using}} laser scanning confocal microscopy. Cultured and serum-starved cells on round coverslips were incubated with propofol or aminophylline for 30 min, and then stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid, propofol and aminophylline. The results were expressed as relative fluorescence intensity and fold stimulation. Propofol decreased the concentration <b>of</b> intracellular <b>calcium,</b> whereas aminophylline caused increased mobilization <b>of</b> intracellular <b>calcium</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. Propofol suppressed the lysophosphatidic acid-induced mobilization <b>of</b> intracellular <b>calcium</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. Propofol further prevented the aminophylline-induced increase <b>of</b> intracellular <b>calcium</b> at clinically relevant concentrations. However, aminophylline reversed the inhibitory effect of propofol on the elevation <b>of</b> intracellular <b>calcium</b> by lysophosphatidic acid. Our results suggest that propofol and aminophylline antagonize {{each other on the}} mobilization <b>of</b> intracellular <b>calcium</b> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells at clinically relevant concentrations. Serious consideration should be given to how this interaction affects mobilization <b>of</b> intracellular <b>calcium</b> when these two drugs are used together...|$|R

In deep cerebellar nuclei, calcium currents are not uniformly distributed along a dendrite.

5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica is {{the result}} of {{unchecked}} hyperparathyroidism, or the overactivity of the parathyroid glands, which results in an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH causes the release <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> from the bones into the blood, and the reabsorption <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> in the kidney. Thus, excess PTH in hyperparathyroidism causes elevated blood calcium levels, or hypercalcemia.|$|E
5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation <b>of</b> <b>calcium,</b> vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts <b>of</b> <b>calcium,</b> vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E

Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals.

5|$|Excess intake <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> {{may cause}} hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition <b>of</b> <b>calcium</b> salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E
