40|$|If {{alternative}} and secondary raw materials are used, {{the demand for}} the aggregates - coarse sand, gravel and limestone - will decrease. The opinion has been voiced {{more and more to}} turn to wood <b>for</b> <b>building,</b> particularly because wood is a renewable raw material. Besides, the Dutch climate is very suitable for growing trees. The discussion whether wood is better than concrete is in full swing. There may, however, never be a complete answer to this question. In this article it has been calculated how much of our surface has to be covered with woods, should we turn to wood <b>for</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> The Netherlands. It may be expected that in the distant future The Netherlands will never be self-sufficient as far as the use of wood <b>for</b> the <b>building</b> industry is concerned. Compared to excavating, the space required for growing wood is considerably larger. It is estimated that during a period of 100 years, 10 to 60 times more space will be needed for growing wood <b>for</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> wood than <b>for</b> quarrying aggregates <b>for</b> <b>building</b> <b>in</b> concrete...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{insulation}} thickness {{may reduce the}} energy consumption and environmental load <b>in</b> <b>building</b> operation phase, but may also increase those in insulation production phase. Therefore, the life cycle energy consumption and environmental load of insulation design for a typical residential <b>building</b> were analyzed <b>in</b> this paper. Cases in four typical cities-Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou- in four different climate zones in China were compared. The results indicate that increasing {{insulation thickness}} based on the active design standards <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>in</b> Harbin, Beijing and Shanghai, is helpful to reduce building life cycle energy consumption and environmental load. But <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>in</b> Guangzhou, the insulation thickness should not be increased any more.
