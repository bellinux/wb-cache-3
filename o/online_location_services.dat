40|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>online</b> <b>location</b> <b>services</b> provides opportunities to discover useful knowledge from trajectories of moving objects. This paper addresses {{the problem of}} mining longest common route (LCR) patterns. As a trajectory of a moving object is generally represented by a sequence of discrete locations sampled with an interval, the different trajectory instances along the same route may be denoted by different sequences of points (location, timestamp). Thus, the most challenging task in the mining process is to abstract trajectories by the right points. We propose a novel mining algorithm for LCR patterns based on turning regions (LCRTurning), which discovers a sequence of turning regions to abstract a trajectory and then maps the problem into the traditional problem of mining longest common subsequences (LCS). Effectiveness of LCRTurning algorithm is validated by an experimental study based on various sizes of simulated moving objects datasets. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

In order to adopt the new algorithm, we need to redesign the <b>location</b> <b>service</b> system. Therefore, we design and implement a <b>location</b> <b>service</b> framework to solve the problem. The <b>location</b> <b>service</b> framework makes development more fast and flexible.

H 577 P COMP 2015 Thomsenxvi, 137 pages :illustrationsCheap GPS-enabled mobile {{devices have}} made <b>online</b> <b>location</b> based <b>services</b> (LBSs) {{increasingly}} common. Examples of LBS are: route planner, navigation assistance, restaurant recommendation, meeting point recommendation, and nearby friend notification. In <b>location</b> based <b>services,</b> caching {{can be used}} to reduce computational load or communication latency for queries. In this thesis, we consider three problems on caching paths and regions for mobile services. Our first problem is to investigate caching techniques for shortest paths. However, existing caching techniques do not exploit the optimal substructure property of shortest paths. We propose a novel caching problem for shortest paths, and develop algorithms and data structures for this problem. Our second problem is to explore trade-offs between the lengths and the query coverage of concise shortest paths, in online driving direction services. Driving instructions are equivalent to so-called concise shortest paths, which occupy much less space than the corresponding shortest paths. The caching of concise shortest paths has two opposite effects on the cache hit ratio. The cache can accommodate a larger number of concise paths, but each individual concise path contains fewer nodes and so may answer fewer shortest path queries. We formulate the concept of a generic shortest path enabling trade-off between a paths size and the number of queries it can answer. We present algorithms for computing and caching generic concise shortest paths. Our third problem is to compute safe regions for the sum-optimal meeting point notification problem. It has applications like social networking services or online games, in which multiple moving users in a group may wish to be continuously notified about the best meeting point from their locations. To reduce the communication frequency, an application server can compute safe regions, which capture the validity of query results with respect to users locations. Unfortunately, the safe regions in our problem exhibit characteristics such as irregular shapes and inter-dependencies, which render existing methods for single safe region inapplicable. We present algorithms for computing safe regions for sum-optimal meeting point. In summary, we make the following contributions: (i) algorithms and data structures for caching of shortest paths; (ii) algorithms for computing generic concise shortest paths; (iii) algorithms for computing the safe regions for the sum-optimal point notification problem.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} <b>location</b> <b>service</b> for Beacon Vector Routing (BVR), a {{point-to-point}} routing scheme for wireless sensor networks. A <b>location</b> <b>service</b> is necessary for decoupling the static node identifiers and dynamic BVR coordinates. This allows a node to use unique identifiers when communicating with a destination node, instead of using coordinate information directly. Our scheme uses beacons in the network as distributed look-up servers; each containing mappings of identifiers to coordinates. When a node wants to route data to another node, the sending node passes the destination node’s identifier and the payload to the <b>location</b> <b>service.</b> The <b>location</b> <b>service</b> resolves the destination node’s identifier to its associated coordinates and uses BVR to route the payload to that node. We describe our design of the <b>location</b> <b>service</b> and briefly it’s implementation. We evaluate the <b>location</b> <b>service</b> and BVR in simulation and on a sensornet testbed, and compare our results to an existing point-topoint routing scheme for sensornets. In addition, a simplified distributed hash table is implemented {{on top of the}} <b>location</b> <b>service</b> and evaluated in simulation. ...|$|R

40|$|For a {{successful}} and efficient communication in mobile ad hoc network, routing protocols {{play a vital}} role. Among those proposed in literature, location based routing protocols show their superiority over others by exhibiting low communication overhead, higher scalability and better adaptability in scenarios where node mobility is high; especially high scalability makes them attractive for large-scale deployment of ad hoc network. As the name indicates, location based routing protocols greatly rely on the precise knowledge of the mobile devices' location, which is provided by a <b>location</b> <b>service.</b> Huge research efforts have been dedicated in developing <b>location</b> <b>services</b> where the researchers have emphasized on making the services scalable but little consideration was given on their applicability in real-world environment as most services have been designed assuming an ideal deployment environment that fails to represent {{the impact of the}} real-world on node mobility and signal propagation. A <b>location</b> <b>service</b> most suitable in a realistic environment must consider the impact of environmental contexts (obstacles, pathways, etc.), making the mobility model a vital factor through which the environmental impact is reflected in simulation. This study develops a novel mobility model which emulates realistic node mobility more accurately by considering various environmental contexts. Non-uniform node distribution caused by environmental contexts impacts the performance of the existing <b>location</b> <b>services</b> drastically. This demands a pressing need for a <b>location</b> <b>service</b> that can adopt itself while ensuring seamless service. In this study non-uniform node distribution arising from natural phenomena is considered while designing a novel <b>location</b> <b>service</b> protocol that adapts itself to the presence and nature of the environmental context. As the <b>location</b> <b>service</b> utilizes the underlying location based routing protocol for transferring service related messages, signal attenuation experienced due to environmental contexts is also taken into account in the routing protocol for finding routable paths, which in turn further enhances the performance of the proposed <b>location</b> <b>service</b> significantly. The proposed <b>location</b> <b>service</b> shows a superior ability to provide location information while maintaining scalability. A detailed mathematical model of the scalability is also presented. Exhaustive simulation has been conducted using a real-world map, which demonstrates the significant superiority of the proposed scheme over other competitive <b>location</b> <b>service</b> protocols (e. g., HLS (Hierarchical <b>Location</b> <b>Service)</b> and GLS (Grid <b>Location</b> <b>Service))</b> for both uniformly and non-uniformly distributed nodes, and establishes its greater applicability to real-world environments...|$|R

The novelty of GrLS {{is in its}} exploitation of group mobility to improve {{the efficiency of the}} <b>location</b> <b>service.</b> GrLS uses different location management strategies for single nodes and for groups of nodes. A single node is responsible for recruiting its own location servers and performing location update. On the other hand, in a group of nodes, only the group leader recruits the location servers and updates its location to a specific home region called group home region. Since the location update cost normally dominates the <b>location</b> <b>service</b> cost for all practical purposes, the overhead of the <b>location</b> <b>service</b> protocol is significantly reduced. Furthermore, when the nodes join or leave groups, GrLS can provide seamless <b>location</b> <b>service</b> handoff.
