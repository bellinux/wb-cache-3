5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, which awarded a green jersey.

Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the Cima Coppi), which in 2009 was Sestrière in stage 10, afforded more points than the other first-category climbs.|$|E

He also wrote the Book of Roger, a geographic study of the peoples, climates, resources and industries of the whole of the world known at that time. The Ottoman admiral Piri Reis (c. 1470–1553) made a map of the New World and West Africa in 1513. He made use of maps from Greece, Portugal, Muslim sources, and perhaps one made by Christopher Columbus. He was part of a major tradition of Ottoman cartography.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, Argentine airstrikes will {{frequently}} sink Royal Navy ships, depending on how many of them were initially allocated to defensive positions. In addition, Argentine air forces will occasionally bomb and destroy British forces on the ground, which are represented as animated sprites on the map. The map also displays terrain details, including rivers and mountains. If troops are situated on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain,</b> they will receive a defensive bonus once attacked; however, due to the steep terrain, they will move more slowly. If the player chooses to enter an enemy-controlled zone, the move will instantly end, leaving the unit vulnerable to an Argentine attack.|$|E

5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air up the side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain</b> or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall and the decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E
5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain</b> than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E

Smythe remained in Europe after the war, found the gold with the help <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain</b> guide, and killed him in order to keep it for himself. Bond was put on the case after the guide's body fell out of a glacier and he recognized the man as a ski instructor and father figure from his youth. Smythe is now a melancholy alcoholic living alone on the beach, interacting mainly with the residents of its coral reef – including the titular Octopussy, a beloved 'pet' octopus that Smythe feeds and talks to.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Reef {{area was}} first {{inhabited}} by Anasazi Native Americans between about 200AD and 1300AD. The Anasazi were nomads who followed {{the migration of}} the animals they hunted, typically deer, mountain sheep, elk, and jackrabbits. They were also farmers and gardeners, growing corn, wheat, rye, and barley. Many were potters, and pottery {{can be found in}} abandoned villages. The Anasazi usually constructed temporary dwellings out of sticks and leaves, often using bark for the roofs. Occasionally they built more permanent dwellings out of rocks, usually along the side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain,</b> often large enough to accommodate several families. Storage pits were often placed behind the rock dwellings. Settlements were typically small, as food was scarce. A group of Virgin Anasazi lived in what is now the Red Cliffs Anasazi Site in Red Cliffs Recreation Area.|$|E
5|$|TumbleSeed is an indie action video game, {{created by}} {{developer}} Benedict Fritz and designer Greg Wohlwend, {{in which the}} player balances a rolling seed on an ascending, horizontally slanted vine past procedurally generated obstacles {{to reach the top}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain.</b> It is based on the mechanical arcade game Ice Cold Beer and built partially through the Cards Against Humanity game incubation program. TumbleSeed was released in May 2017 to generally favorable reviews on macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. Critics, in particular, appreciated their haptic sense of the rolling seed from the Nintendo Switch's sensitive HD Rumble. Many reviewers noted TumbleSeed intense and sometimes uneven difficulty, which the developers hoped to address in a post-release update. They credited this stigma and a tepid critical reception for the game's slow sales, but were proud of their work.|$|E

5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain,</b> a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the carriage up to the house, lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes on the things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|E
5|$|After {{unearthing}} {{an ancient}} crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen {{discovered that the}} cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, {{could be used to}} calculate the height of a distant mountain {{in the same way that}} mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height. Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Provençal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) wrote of it in 1321. Shen wrote that while viewing the whole <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain,</b> the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.|$|E
5|$|Early on June4, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} {{low pressure}} associated with deep convection about 780km (485mi) south-southeast of Hong Kong. Later that day, following notable development, they classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W. At the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also began monitoring the system as a tropical depression. Slowly moving towards the southeast, 07W gradually strengthened, being classified a tropical storm by the JTWC at 1200UTC the next day. Around the same time, the storm entered the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration's area of responsibility and was given the local name Frank. Twenty-four hours later, 07W made its closest approach to the Philippines, passing within 295km (185mi) of Manila. A few hours later, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Conson; a name contributed by Vietnam that is a picturesque place in the country, consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mountain,</b> pine forest, streams, pagodas and many historical monuments.|$|E
