25|$|Headphone size {{can affect}} the balance between {{fidelity}} and portability. Generally, headphone form factors {{can be divided into}} four separate categories: circumaural (over-ear), supra-aural (<b>on-ear),</b> earbud and in-ear.|$|E
25|$|Supra-aural {{headphones}} or <b>on-ear</b> headphones have pads {{that press}} against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with personal stereos during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally {{tends to be}} smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones {{can also lead to}} discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.|$|E

50|$|The Bose <b>On-Ear</b> {{headphones}} {{were introduced}} on October 12, 2006. The Bose <b>On-Ear</b> {{is similar to}} the Bose QuietComfort 3 Headphones, but without active noise cancellation. The cord is detachable; both 43 and 16-inch cords are available. Shortly after the release of the iPhone in 2007 Bose redesigned the OE's headphone plug on the detachable cords to make it iPhone compatible. In 2008, the Red Dot Award for product design was awarded to Bose <b>On-Ear</b> Headphones.|$|E

Bose states that, although headphones which envelope the ear provide greater passive noise isolation, the QC3s have {{the same amount of}} total noise reduction as the QC2s due to improved active noise cancellation. Memory foam is used to improve the passive noise isolation.|$|E
50|$|Alcantara {{is being}} used {{currently}} as a flame-retardant driver seat covering material for Formula One race cars, including the Williams Formula One 2011 FW33 car. It is also used as a covering material for high-end headphones including the Sennheiser HD800, the Sennheiser Momentum <b>On-Ear,</b> and Bose QuietComfort 35 {{as well as for}} other consumer products such as Microsoft's Alcantara keyboard cover for Surface Pro 4, Microsoft's Surface Laptop keyboard and Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphone cover.

40|$|We report {{results from}} an {{investigation}} into the relationships between acoustic performance, price, and perceived quality of earphones. In Singapore today, the most common situation where people listen to music is while commuting, however such environments have generally high ambient noise levels. A survey (N= 94) of listener habits on buses and trains was conducted. Results showed that people use a wide range of earphones, both in terms of price and measurable acoustic performance. Five typical earphone models were identified and employed in a perceptual experiment (N= 15). Volunteers rated various aspects of earphone quality while listening to music under two conditions: studio silence and a reproduced commuter environment. Results showed that participants displayed a strong preference towards in-ear earphones and this can be attributed to these having better acoustic isolation than <b>on-ear</b> earphones. People tend to describe the music listening experiences in terms of sonic clarity and noise isolation. We believe that these results can inform development of an ecologically valid model of how noisy environments affect people’s perception of audio quality, and through that, of music experience. Such a model could inform consumers as well as manufacturers...|$|E
