5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing the <b>offenders,</b> <b>who</b> were now seen as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance and patience {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions of the Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the regular}} courts handled {{political}} cases and even issued death sentences for these cases, {{a new type}} of court, the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters. This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials. Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment: hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews and others deemed undesirable. Political <b>offenders</b> <b>who</b> were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.|$|E

5|$|As a maximum-security prison, it hosts {{dangerous}} {{as well as}} highly dangerous criminals, such as rapists, murderers, and child molesters. They compose half of the population, while {{a third of the}} residents are drug offenders. Sex <b>offenders,</b> <b>who</b> may face violence from other inmates, and prisoners who require close psychiatric or medical supervision, are located in Unit A, a restrictive and separated area. There is also a special unit (C8) focused on addiction recovery. Most inmates live in Units B and C, which are freer and have mixed cell blocks. Halden Prison receives both domestic and international criminals; as only around three-fifths of the prisoners are Norwegians (as of 2015), both Norwegian and English are used, and the prison has English teachers. However, fluency in Norwegian is a requirement to live in C8, because group and individual counseling is conducted in Norwegian.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{resulted}} in a public outcry over the event which pressured {{all levels of the}} government right up to the top ranks of the federal government to investigate into the matter. In the closing months of 1992, and also the opening months of 1993, dozens of articles mentioning misdeeds by the royal families of several states–but in particular Sultan Iskandar himself were published. A good deal of these alleged misdeeds that were mentioned included the charging of exorbitant fines–way above the prescribed legal limits–upon <b>offenders</b> <b>who</b> had obstructed the Sultan's car, amongst others. Sultan Iskandar, nevertheless bore the brunt of the backlash by the numerous references centred towards alleged acts of criminal wrongdoings even though many of the listed acts were committed by other members of the royal family.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} {{legislative}} session in 2003, Anderson championed House Bill 49, {{of which he}} was co-sponsor, to expand the state DNA database by requiring DNA samples from all convicted felons; any person convicted of a felony or misdemeanor crime against a person, such as assault; and anyone convicted of a misdemeanor sex offense. The bill applied the DNA sample requirement retroactively to people currently imprisoned or on parole for those crimes, as well as anyone required to register as a sex offender. Some serious juvenile offenders were also included under HB 49. The bill enjoyed wide bipartisan support, and was signed into law by Gov. Frank Murkowski on June 13, 2003. However, in October 2003 a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order which disallowed the state from requiring DNA samples from convicted sex <b>offenders</b> <b>who</b> had completed their sentences unless the state had first obtained a warrant and shown probable cause to believe a crime had been committed. Ultimately, the portion of the law requiring registered sex <b>offenders</b> <b>who</b> had completed their sentences to provide DNA samples was struck down as unconstitutional by U.S. District Judge John Sedwick; other provisions of the law remained intact.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} common {{limitations}} to studies of treatment effectiveness.

Many do not select their treatment and control groups randomly. <b>Offenders</b> <b>who</b> refuse or quit treatment are at higher risk of offending, so excluding them from the treated group, while not excluding those who would have refused or quit from the control group, can bias the treated group in favor of those with lower recidivism.
