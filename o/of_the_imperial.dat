5|$|While {{eight of}} the Nine Ministers could be of {{commoner}} origin, the post of Minister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Clan (Zongzheng 宗正), {{also known as the}} Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Clan, was always occupied by a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imperial</b> family. He oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. His ministry was responsible for record-keeping of all nobles, a register being updated {{at the beginning of each}} year. When a serious infraction was committed by a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imperial</b> family, the Minister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Clan was the first high official to be notified before the emperor, who made the ultimate decision about any possible legal action. This minister's subordinates heard grievances of imperial family members and informed them about new ordinances. Unlike kings and marquesses, who were not responsible to any of the Nine Ministers, imperial princesses and their fiefs were kept under surveillance by the Minister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Clan.|$|E

The museum occupies a site overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal in Trafford Park, an area which during the Second World War was a key industrial centre and consequently heavily bombed during the Manchester Blitz in 1940. The area is now home to the Lowry cultural centre and the MediaCityUK development, which stand opposite the museum at Salford Quays.|$|E

5|$|The War of the Second Coalition (1799–1802) {{resulted}} in the defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imperial</b> and allied forces by Napoleon Bonaparte. The treaties of Lunéville (1801) and Amiens (1802) and the Mediatization of 1803 transferred large portions of the Holy Roman Empire to the dynastic states and secularized ecclesiastical territories. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imperial</b> cities disappeared from the political and legal landscape, and the populations living in these territories acquired new allegiances to dukes and kings. This transfer particularly enhanced the territories of Württemberg and Baden. In 1806, after a successful invasion of Prussia and the defeat of Prussia and Russia at the joint battles of Jena-Auerstedt, Napoleon dictated the Treaty of Pressburg, in which the Emperor dissolved the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{withdrawal}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imperial</b> {{forces from}} Sicily {{resulted in the}} rapid collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imperial</b> position there. Under Maniakes, the Byzantines had conquered the eastern portion of the island, but by 1042, only Messina remained in Byzantine hands. On the mainland, Boioannes did not fare better than his predecessor, as he was defeated and taken prisoner at the Battle of Montepeloso in September. This succession of defeats signalled {{the beginning of the}} end for Byzantine rule in southern Italy, a process which was completed three decades later with the fall of Bari to the Normans under Robert Guiscard.|$|E

5|$|Where {{he did not}} {{overwrite}} Maxentius' achievements, Constantine upstaged them: the Circus Maximus was redeveloped so {{that its}} total seating capacity was twenty-five times larger than that of Maxentius' racing complex on the Via Appia. Maxentius' strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the Praetorian Guard and Imperial Horse Guard (equites singulares) were disbanded. The tombstones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Horse Guard were ground up and put to use in a basilica on the Via Labicana. On November 9, 312AD, barely two weeks after Constantine captured the city, the former base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Horse Guard was chosen for redevelopment into the Lateran Basilica. The Legio II Parthica was removed from Alba (Albano Laziale), and the remainder of Maxentius' armies were sent to do frontier duty on the Rhine.|$|E

5|$|A Dutch {{proposal}} {{to build new}} battleships was originally tendered in 1912, after years of concern over the expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Imperial</b> Japanese Navy and the withdrawal of allied British warships from the China Station. Only four coastal defense ships were planned, but naval experts and the Tweede Kamer (lower house of the parliament) believed that acquiring dreadnoughts would provide a stronger defense for the Nederlands-Indië (Netherlands East Indies, abbr. NEI), so a Royal Commission was formed in June 1912.|$|E

It should, however, be noted that several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time are attributed to Theophano by hostile sources, usually by poison.|$|E
