40|$|Capitalising on {{a natural}} {{experiment}} in Hampshire Constabulary, this research utilised police officially recorded data to directly compare {{a sample of}} grade- 3 domestic abuse incidents that received a telephone-based response from the force’s Resolution Centre to a similar sample of incidents dealt with by the same force one year later that received the standard provision of ‘slow time’ deployment. A clear pattern of findings emerged, which taken together demonstrate the efficacy of providing a telephone-based response to certain types of domestic abuse incidents. Specifically, a detailed and formalised <b>operations</b> <b>protocol</b> has been embedded into {{the work of the}} Resolution Centre and all evidence suggests this is leading to a higher quality response overall to grade- 3 domestics. The initial response provided by the Resolution Centre results in more crimes being recorded and more investigations that result in formal police action. The practice of risk assessment appears to be more comprehensive and detailed, generating a higher number of disclosures and more cases classified as ‘medium’ and ‘high’ risk. Due to the robust methodological approach of the research, these positive findings can be directly attributed to the setting where the police work was performed, rather than any differences in case characteristics...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the report}} of an {{internal}} review, headed by former NSW Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street, looking at {{the way in which}} the AFP works with its partner agencies on counter-terrorism investigations. The committee made recommendations covering the four broad areas of operational decision-making processes, joint taskforce arrangements, information sharing, and training and education. The AFP has accepts all the recommendations and will work closely with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and other national security agencies to ensure the recommendations are implemented as soon as possible. ASIO officers will soon be attached to the Melbourne and Sydney Joint Counter-Terrorism Teams (JCTT), ensuring better communication between the agencies at an operational level. The AFP will act immediately on the recommendation to participate in exercises simulating the investigation and prosecution of terrorism offenders in Australia and more will be done to retain expertise in the joint counter-terrorism teams. In relation to the other recommendations: • the AFP will develop a joint <b>operations</b> <b>protocol</b> with ASIO, • guidelines will be drafted on the role of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in counter-terrorism investigations; and • a committee comprising the AFP Commissioner, the Director-General of Security and Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will be established to ensure national security issues, strategic priorities and enhanced interoperability are reviewed on a regular basis.

40|$|We are {{entering}} {{a new era in}} space exploration. Reduced operating budgets require innovative solutions to leverage existing systems to implement the capabilities of future missions. Custom solutions to fulfill mission objectives are no longer viable. Can NASA adopt international standards to reduce costs and increase interoperability with other space agencies? Can legacy systems be leveraged in a service oriented architecture (SOA) to further reduce operations costs? The Operations Technology Facility (OTF) at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) is collaborating with Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) to answer these very questions. The Mission Operations and Information Management Services Area (MOIMS) Spacecraft Monitor and Control (SM&C) Working Group within the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) is developing the Mission Operations standards to address this problem space. The set of proposed standards presents a service oriented architecture to increase the level of interoperability among space agencies. The OTF and DLR are developing independent implementations of the standards as part of an interoperability prototype. This prototype will address three key components: validation of the SM&C Mission <b>Operations</b> <b>protocol,</b> exploration of the Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS), and the incorporation of legacy systems in a SOA. The OTF will implement the service providers described in the SM&C Mission Operation standards to create a portal for interaction with a spacecraft simulator. DLR will implement the service consumers to perform the monitor and control of the spacecraft. The specifications insulate the applications from the underlying transport layer. We will gain experience with a DDS transport layer as we delegate responsibility to the middleware and explore transport bridges to connect disparate middleware products. A SOA facilitates the reuse of software components. The prototype will leverage the capabilities of existing legacy systems. Various custom applications and middleware solutions will be combined into one system providing the illusion of a set of homogenous services. This paper will document our journey as we implement the interoperability prototype. The team consists of software engineers with experience on the current command, telemetry and messaging systems that support the International Space Station (ISS) and Space Shuttle programs. Emphasis will be on the objectives, results and potential cost saving benefits...|$|E

40|$|Collaborative genome-scale {{reconstruction}} endeavors of metabolic networks {{would not}} be possible without a common, standardized formal representation of these systems. The ability to precisely define biological building blocks together with their dynamic behavior has even been considered a prerequisite for upcoming synthetic biology approaches. Driven by the requirements of such ambitious research goals, standardization itself has become an active field of research on nearly all levels of granularity in biology. In addition to the originally envisaged exchange of computational models and tool interoperability, new standards have been suggested for an unambiguous graphical display of biological phenomena, to annotate, archive, as well as to rank models, and to describe execution and the outcomes of simulation experiments. The spectrum now even covers the interaction of entire neurons in the brain, three-dimensional motions, and the description of pharmacometric studies. Thereby, the mathematical description of systems and approaches for their (repeated) simulation are clearly separated from each other and also from their graphical representation. Minimum information definitions constitute guidelines and common <b>operation</b> <b>protocols</b> in order to ensure reproducibility of findings and a unified knowledge representation. Central database infrastructures have been established that provide the scientific community with persistent links from model annotations to on-line resources.

Regular meetings and workshops of developers and users lead to continuous improvement and ongoing development of these standardization efforts.
