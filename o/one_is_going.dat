[...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and no <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'."

The Edge noted [...] "it came to us in installments". Bassist Adam Clayton said [...] "it was hard to figure out how we would do it. I mean, no <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to mistake us for Frank Sinatra's backing band. A very humble little combo sound is what we ended up with and that really worked." [...] The Edge added [...] "I was playing around on piano with some old-school chord progressions trying to summon up the spirit of Frank Sinatra. It's definitely not from a rock and roll tradition."

500|$|On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were {{travelling}} by limousine to a New York {{airport for}} their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then {{reminded him that}} they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: [...] "Jimi, I know you have something in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs." [...] Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: [...] "Trust me, Bob, no <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to recognize me", to which he replied: [...] "Recognize you? They will be waiting at customs for you." [...] Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, waiting for it to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication.|$|E
500|$|Michael Sragow of Baltimore Sun {{described}} the only [...] "perfect aspect" [...] of Jennifer's Body as being its title. [...] "No <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> {{to like this}} movie for its brain", he said. Claudia Puig of USA Today stated of the film, [...] "Jennifer's Body is not as hot as you hope it would be". Where others praised the film's dialogue, MSNBC's Alonso Duralde called the writing lazy and [...] "orse still, all of Cody's trademark pop-culture–infused dialogue stands out as artificial and precious". Jennifer's Body, he said, wants [...] "so badly" [...] to be a Heathers-esque dark comedy, [...] "but its shortcomings makes you appreciate why that earlier film was so great". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe also said the film wants to be like Heathers, and reminded him [...] "a lot" [...] of Heathers but the only scene in the film that [...] "actually feels dangerous" [...] is when the possessed Jennifer initiates a long and passionate kiss with Needy, which the film [...] "very, very nervously backs away from" [...] and that [...] "Jennifer's Body falls into the dispiriting category of dumb movies made by smart people, {{in this case a}} glibly clever writer and a talented director who think a few wisecracks are enough to subvert the teen horror genre".|$|E
500|$|Playwright Alan Bennett was {{particularly}} repulsed by Witchfinder. In his regular column in The Listener, published eight {{days after the}} film's release, Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be [...] "punctuated by belly laughs" [...] and attacked Reeves's completely humourless movie as [...] "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience by which I mean {{it made me feel}} dirty." [...] Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in The Listener, Reeves noted: [...] "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence... Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such– and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. I wish I could have witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him. It would have been proof of the fact that Witchfinder General works as intended." ...|$|E

However, the marriage ended, {{paving the way for}} a reunion between Billy and his high school sweetheart, Mac Browning (Clementine Ford). In response {{to whether or not the}} Chloe and Billy pairing should be revisited, Hendrickson stated, [...] "You know what, I really hope so. I’ve definitely asked for it." [...] Chloe's next relationship is with Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson who is a virgin. Speaking of the developing romance, John Driscoll said, [...] "At this point Chloe is the object of his affection, and he is attracted to her. He is very interested in her because she has a very rocky background, but through and through she has just been herself. He respects her, and there is a spark and energy between them." [...] Chance loses his virginity to Chloe and they become engaged, though she develops into a [...] "clingy" [...] fiancé. The relationship ends after he cheats on her with Heather Stevens (Eden Riegel). Soon after, Chance fakes his death and enters the Witness Protection Program. Of Chloe's [...] "heartbroken" [...] reaction to his [...] "death" [...] in spite of the bitter break-up, Hendrickson said, [...] "to open up and show what was going on with her was a great release for me, because that entire time she was remaining strong and stable, and like no <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to mess with her. I mean, no one dumps Chloe Mitchell!" ...|$|E
500|$|Against Boston College, {{running back}} Da'Rel Scott handled {{some of the}} kickoff return duties, but Smith {{returned}} two for 38yards. He also caught eight passes for 34yards and a touchdown. The following week, Maryland clinched bowl eligibility with a 62–14 rout of Wake Forest. Regarding the turnaround from the previous season's 2–10 record, Smith said, [...] "We {{expected to be in}} this position. No one else expected it," [...] but added [...] "No <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to respect us [...] because we have not beaten any top dogs." [...] In the game, Smith had five catches for 66yards, including a 17-yard touchdown reception. Before the game against Miami, the coaching staff reported Smith's ankle had improved and he was [...] "as healthy as he has been in a while." [...] Against Miami, he had three receptions for 35yards. Smith also compiled 46yards on two kickoff returns to break the ACC career kickoff return yards record with 2,724 yards, which surpassed the previous mark of 2,688 yards held by Brandon Tate of North Carolina. At Virginia, Smith took advantage of the Cavaliers' man-to-man coverage and had seven receptions for 157yards, including a 12-yard touchdown. On a 62-yard catch, he said he was tackled on the seven-yard line only because he was exhausted. Quarterback Danny O'Brien expressed his readiness to throw deep passes to Smith in single coverage, [...] "If it's even, I put it up." [...] Maryland entered the game against 25th-ranked Florida State in contention for the ACC Atlantic Division championship. Smith recorded a phone message and video appealing to fans in a bid to improve home attendance, which had been lackluster throughout the season. The game was attended by 48,115 spectators, which surpassed the athletic department's projections. Maryland lost, 30–16, and Smith had seven receptions for 69yards.|$|E
500|$|June {{started off}} {{as all the}} {{previous}} months had, with Dodd campaigning in New Hampshire and Iowa, but at the June 3 debate in Manchester he made a notable statement {{that led to a}} huge applause from the crowd.

[...] After the debate Dodd went back to the trails, but while campaigning he found a new tool to help spread his message. The campaign encouraged voters to confront politicians with video cameras and ask them to talk about Iraq and to support the [...] "Dodd Amendment" [...] which would have required American troops to start redeployment in 30 days. The final step was for the voters to post the interactions on YouTube. The Dodd campaign has used the internet more frequently than other campaigns, often airing staff meetings via the web. The campaign released a new advertisement on June 16 entitled [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] which focused on Dodd's time in the Peace Corps. As June came to a close Dodd made his final appearance of the month at a forum in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, the first time he visited the state which moved up its primary dates, causing a controversy with the DNC.
