5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the first}} Ridge Racer, the player {{normally}} starts with four cars.

After the player wins the first three circuits, reversed versions are unlocked, and Time Trial features an additional opponent driving a secret car. There are three secret cars; the '13th Racing' (from the first Ridge Racer) of the Novice course, and the new '13th Racing Kid' (of the Intermediate course) and 'White Angel' (<b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Expert</b> course). These cars are unlocked upon winning the respective course's Time Trial race.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} whether a career-minded expert would make better decisions if the principal could observe <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action. <b>The</b> previous literature {{has found that}} this “transparency of consequence ” can only improve <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> decision making. We show, however, that this conclusion is very sensitive to the specified cost structure. While learning <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action makes <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> more likely to choose the action most likely to correspond to <b>the</b> true state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, when costs are asymmetric, this {{may be associated with}} a decrease in the principal’s expected welfare. In addition, for a range <b>of</b> parameters, if <b>the</b> principal benefits from learning <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action, her utility is higher if she observes only the consequences and not the action taken. As such, the optimal transparency regime will involve either the principal observing only <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action or only <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action; it will but never be optimal to observe both. We illustrate these results with examples from finance and public policymaking...|$|R
5|$|Three {{days before}} {{scheduled}} services were to start, {{permission to use}} the trains had still not been granted by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. The inspectorate had a series of safety concerns, including follow-up on the safety terms for the wheels and axles; lack of documentation of the crew's training; denying NSB's request to have fewer inspections and less maintenance on the trains; lack of consideration of critical events deemed to have a high probability to occur but have a low consequence; lack of a safety inspector for operations and maintenance; and that the trains were so heavy that they would exceed the permitted axle load of the lines. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) warned against a possible weakness in the axles. NSB wanted to use an expert from Deutsche Bahn to perform the necessary tests, but limited availability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> resulted in the Norwegian National Rail Administration granting a half-year delay of the inspections.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko {{wrote to}} the then President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter, in which Savenko asked Medvedev {{to submit to the}} State Duma a draft law {{prepared}} by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. The open letter says that the level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> reports has dropped {{to such an extent that}} it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise. According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural rules, do not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.|$|E
