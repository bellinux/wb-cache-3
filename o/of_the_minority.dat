40|$|<b>The</b> subject <b>of</b> this diploma {{thesis is}} a {{comparison}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> during <b>the</b> transition process and democratic consolidation in Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia. The study analyses the influence and participation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> in <b>the</b> democratic transition and their {{engagement in the}} new democratic system. We also focus on the question whether the new established systems made <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> more complicated. In the first chapter, we describe <b>the</b> problems <b>of</b> transitology and analyse approaches to the consolidation by S. P. Huntington, J. J. Linz and A. Stepan and W. Merkel. In the next part, we focus on Bulgaria. We describe <b>the</b> situation <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> before 1989, <b>the</b> transition process {{in the country and}} <b>the</b> resulting engagement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> in legislative and executive institutions. The third chapter deals with Romania and also examines <b>the</b> situation <b>of</b> <b>minorities,</b> <b>the</b> transition process and <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> or their participation in democratic system. The fourth section focuses on Slovakia. We analyse <b>the</b> situation <b>of</b> minoritites before democratic changes and describe the transition and <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> and their attitudes in the new regime.

5|$|In a sense, Rule 184 solves this problem, as follows. if Rule 184 is run on {{a finite}} set of cells with {{periodic}} boundary conditions, with an unequal number of 0s and 1s, then each cell will eventually see two consecutive states of the majority value infinitely often, but will see two consecutive states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> value only finitely many times. The majority problem cannot be solved perfectly if it is required that all cells eventually stabilize to the majority state but the Rule 184 solution avoids this impossibility result by relaxing the criterion by which the automaton recognizes a majority.|$|E

The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery {{provisions of the}} Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the House bill (by the vote <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> Democrats and several southern Whigs), designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House-amended bill.|$|E

In late October he was named chancellor of the see of Chichester, but was then elected Bishop of Chichester on about 1 November 1222. He was given control of the temporalities of the bishopric on 3 November 1222, and was consecrated on 21 April 1224. In April 1223 Neville was ordered by Pope Honorius III to cease using the Great Seal on the command of the justiciar or other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> council, but instead to do so only at the king's command, essentially ending the royal minority.

40|$|Middleman {{minority}} theory {{explains why}} certain minorities in America have made impressive socioeconomic achievements. It is {{found that their}} occupational patterns {{play an important role}} in their socioeconomic success. Middleman minorities usually concentrate in certain occupations and dominate these occupations. The term 2 ̆ 2 middleman 2 ̆ 2 indicates that such ethnic minorities are functioning as middleman between lower and upper class, customer and producer in the host society. The three preconditions through which middleman minorities get into these occupations are cultural, contextual and situational variables. The cultural variables concern mainly <b>the</b> homeland <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minorities,</b> <b>the</b> value system <b>of</b> their native culture, and <b>the</b> economic background <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minorities.</b> <b>The</b> second precondition consists of situational variables such as immigrants 2 ̆ 7 intention to return to their homeland.

In Sweden it has long been used in local and state government and most of the educational system but remained only a de facto primary language with no official status in law until 2009. A bill was proposed in 2005 that would have made Swedish an official language but failed to pass by the narrowest possible margin (145–147) due to a pairing-off failure. A proposal for a broader language law, designating Swedish as the main language of the country and bolstering the status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> languages, was submitted by an expert committee to the Swedish Ministry of Culture in March 2008.
