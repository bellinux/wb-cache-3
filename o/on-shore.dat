5|$|Many brick {{structures}} {{have been}} located at Kaveripumpattinam during <b>on-shore,</b> near shore and off-shore explorations; these provide proof for building construction during Sangam age. The <b>on-shore</b> structure include an I-shaped wharf and {{a structure that}} looks like a reservoir. The wharf has a number of wooden poles planted in its structure to enable anchorage of boats and to facilitate the handling of cargo. Among other structures, there is a Buddhist vihara with parts of it decorated using moulded bricks and stucco. Near shore excavations yielded a brick structure and a few terracotta ring wells. Off-shore explorations located a fifteen course brick structure, three courses of dressed stone blocks, brick bats and pottery. At Arikamedu, there were indications of a structure built substantially of timber, possibly a wharf. Conical jars that could have been used for storing wine and oil have been found near structures that could have been shops or storage areas. Evidence of continued building activity are present at this site, with the most distinctive structures being those of a possible warehouse, dyeing tanks and lined pits.|$|E

The individual concerned had left the control room some time before the trouble started (see below) and his absence may have contributed to a lack of urgency in responding to events. Exactly what happened that night has never been established beyond doubt.|$|E
5|$|In January 1776, Allen and his {{men were}} put on board HMS Soledad, which sailed for Cork, Ireland. The people of Cork, when they learned that the famous Ethan Allen was in port, took up a {{collection}} to provide him {{and his men}} with clothing and other supplies. Much of the following year was spent on prison ships off the American coast. At one point, while aboard HMS Mercury, she anchored off New York, where, among other visitors, the captain entertained William Tryon; Allen reports that Tryon glanced at him without any sign of recognition, although it is likely the New York governor knew who he was. In August 1776, Allen and other prisoners were temporarily put ashore in Halifax, owing to extremely poor conditions aboard ship; due to food scarcity, both crew and prisoners were on short rations, and scurvy was rampant. By the end of October, Allen was again off New York, where the British, having secured the city, moved the prisoners <b>on-shore,</b> and, as he was considered an officer, gave Allen limited parole. With the financial assistance of his brother Ira, he lived comfortably, if out of action, until August 1777. He then learned {{of the death of}} his young son Joseph due to smallpox.|$|E

25|$|One of the cited {{limitations}} for Autolycus {{was a lack}} of discrimination between submarine exhaust, trawlers and <b>on-shore</b> sources. In practice this {{does not appear to have}} been a major limitation as it was used for initial detection, not identification or tracking.|$|E
25|$|The main {{economic}} activity on the island is centred on the military bases at Wideawake Airfield, and the BBC World Service's Atlantic Relay station. The Ministry of Defence estate and facilities are managed by the infrastructure support provider Interserve Defence. Serco runs the airport services and Sodexo provides catering and domestic facilities. A former feature of Ascension was a 70,000 tonne tanker permanently moored offshore that was operated by Maersk as a bulk fuel facility. In December 2002, this was replaced by an <b>on-shore</b> Petroleum Supply Depot under military management, with fuel still being delivered by a chartered tanker, the Maersk Rapier, which operates on an MOD resupply contract for both Ascension and the Falkland Islands every two months. Fuel for the island is transferred via a floating hose, which {{is connected to the}} <b>on-shore</b> depot at the island's pier head and to the ship at anchor.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{reorganisation}} of the Royal Navy in 1864, {{use of the}} White Ensign (a red St George's Cross on a white {{field with}} the Union Flag in the canton) has been restricted to ships, boats, submarines and <b>on-shore</b> establishments of the Royal Navy.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 December, the Portuguese sloop NRP Afonso de Albuquerque was {{anchored}} off Mormug√£o Harbour. Besides engaging Indian naval units, the Afonso de Albuquerque was also tasked with providing a coastal artillery battery to defend the harbour and adjoining beaches, and providing vital radio communications with Lisbon after <b>on-shore</b> radio facilities had been destroyed in Indian airstrikes.|$|E
25|$|Maui, Hawaii {{illustrated}} {{the complexities of}} even small-scale nourishment projects. A project at Sugar Cove transported upland sand to the beach. The sand allegedly was finer than the original sand and contained excess silt that enveloped coral, smothering it and killing the small animals that lived in and around it. As in other projects, <b>on-shore</b> sand availability was limited, forcing consideration of more expensive offshore sources.|$|E
25|$|When the {{fisheries}} policy was originally {{set up the}} intention {{was to create a}} free trade area in fish and fish products with common rules. It was agreed that fishermen from any state should have access to all waters. An exception was made for the coastal strip, which was reserved for local fishermen who had traditionally fished those areas. A policy was created to assist modernisation of fishing vessels and <b>on-shore</b> installations.|$|E
25|$|If the Santa Anas are strong, {{the usual}} day-time sea breeze may not arise, or develop weak {{later in the}} day because the strong {{offshore}} desert winds oppose the <b>on-shore</b> sea breeze. At night, the Santa Ana Winds merge with the land breeze blowing from land to sea and strengthen because the inland desert cools more than the ocean due to differences in the heat capacity and because there is no competing sea breeze.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Singapore {{separated}} from Malaysia {{to become an}} independent republic. On January 1, 1966, HMMS Laburnum {{was assigned to the}} Singapore Naval Volunteer Force (SNVF) as a training vessel, while remaining berthed at Telok Ayer Basin. On May 5, 1967, the ship was re-commissioned as RSS Singapura and became the official headquarters of the Republic of Singapore Navy. The naval headquarters was relocated <b>on-shore</b> in mid-1968, at which time the RSS Singapura was sold for scrap.|$|E
25|$|Meteotsunami {{should not}} be {{confused}} with storm surges, which are local increases in sea level associated with the low barometric pressure of passing tropical cyclones, nor should they be confused with setup, the temporary local raising of sea level caused by strong <b>on-shore</b> winds. Storm surges and setup are also dangerous causes of coastal flooding in severe weather but their dynamics are completely unrelated to tsunami waves. They are unable to propagate beyond their sources, as waves do.|$|E
25|$|Andros has {{a variety}} of close-to-shore and <b>on-shore</b> {{ecosystems}} that may be unique on Earth: tidal inland and ocean blue holes, shallow sand and mud flats, tidal estuaries, mangrove swamps, the pelagic eco-zone of the 6000-foot drop-off only a mile from shore, the world's third-largest barrier reef, and huge freshwater aquifers. The marine biosphere is fed by both the teeming life of the mangrove marshes and estuaries on the mainland, and the upwelling of cool water from the Tongue of the Ocean, resulting in an unparalleled variety of sea life.|$|E
25|$|Macau is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China. Macau {{became a}} colony of the Portuguese empire in 1557. It was lent to Portugal as a trading post but {{remained}} under Chinese authority and sovereignty. Self-administration was next achieved in the 1840s. When the Qing dynasty and Portugal signed the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking in 1887, the treaty terms made Macau a Portuguese territory again until 1999, when it was handed over to China. Macau was the last extant European territory in continental (<b>on-shore)</b> Asia.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} modules {{have dropped}} about 75 per cent in price. Current {{scientific and technological}} advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be so cheap that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation. <b>On-shore</b> wind power is spreading over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions. Concentrated solar thermal power (CST) with thermal storage has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still {{has the potential for}} further cost reductions of about 50 per cent.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Triassic, the {{sea level}} once again rose and {{periodic}} flooding caused by high spring tides and strong <b>on-shore</b> winds {{led to the formation of}} on shore saline lagoons or sabkha environments. (A sabkha is a wide area of coastal flats bordering the sea, the name coming from certain coastal areas of Arabia). Intense evaporation from these lagoons resulted in the precipitation of a carbonate-sulphate complex and the thick halite beds as seen to the south west of Alderley in Northwich where the salt is mined commercially. It was in this type of environment that the Mercia Mudstone Group (formerly Keuper Marl) was deposited.|$|E
25|$|Unsponsored shares {{trade on}} the {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) market. These shares are issued in accordance with market demand, and the foreign company has no formal agreement with a depositary bank. Unsponsored ADRs are often issued {{by more than one}} depositary bank. Each depositary services only the ADRs it has issued. Since the company is not formally involved in an unsponsored issue, the motivation of the company to list overseas is irrelevant for unsponsored programs. Instead, the dynamics of this market is determined by the incentive structure of three types of players: holders of the securities <b>on-shore,</b> the investors in depository receipts off-shore and the intermediaries (depository banks and exchanges).|$|E
25|$|A Santa Ana fog is a {{derivative}} phenomenon {{in which a}} ground fog settles in coastal Southern California {{at the end of}} a Santa Ana wind episode. When Santa Ana conditions prevail, with winds in the lower two to three kilometers (1.25-1.8 miles) of the atmosphere from the north through east, the air over the coastal basin is extremely dry, and this dry air extends out over offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean. When the Santa Ana winds cease, the cool and moist marine layer may re-form rapidly over the ocean if conditions are right. The air in the marine layer becomes very moist and very low clouds or fog occurs. If wind gradients turn <b>on-shore</b> with enough strength, this sea fog is blown onto the coastal areas. This marks a sudden and surprising transition from the hot, dry Santa Ana conditions to cool, moist, and gray marine weather, as the Santa Ana fog can blow onshore and envelope cities in as quickly as fifteen minutes. However, a true Santa Ana fog is rare, because it requires conditions conducive to rapid re-forming of the marine layer, plus a rapid and strong reversal in wind gradients from off-shore to <b>on-shore</b> winds. More often, the high pressure system over the Great Basin, which caused the Santa Ana conditions in the first place, is slow to weaken or move east across the United States. In this more usual case, the Santa Ana winds cease, but warm, dry conditions under a stationary air mass continue for days or even weeks after the Santa Ana wind event ends.|$|E
25|$|Oceaan 7 {{was very}} small for the purpose to which it was being put. The cramped living {{accommodation}} and lack of privacy on board soon caused tensions among the personnel. It proved difficult to maintain the vessel in position off Scarborough as the winter storms came. In November 1966 one storm was so severe that waves were breaking over the vessel's deck and water entered the living quarters and studio. The station carried on broadcasting through {{the early part of}} the storm although the presenters were obviously in fear for their lives. Listeners <b>on-shore</b> (including 270 staff member Paul Burnett) were horrified by what was happening. In the aftermath of the storm, the station went off the air for 8 days while repairs were carried out.|$|E
25|$|July 3 - Battle of Santiago de Cuba: On July 1, the Spanish Governor of Cuba, General Blanco, ordered Admiral Cervera {{to run the}} {{blockade}} and escape the harbor at Santiago de Cuba. Cervera does so at 9:00 A.M. on July 3, just hours after U.S. Rear Admiral Sampson leaves his fleet for an <b>on-shore</b> conference (leaving Commodore Schley in command of both the Flying Squadron and North Atlantic Squadron). Cervera's fleet consists of the armored cruisers Infanta Maria Teresa (his flagship), Vizcaya, Crist√≥bal Col√≥n, and Almirante Oquendo, and the destroyers Plut√≥n and Furor. Although Cervera surprises the American fleet by sortying during daylight, the American ships respond quickly, and are three times larger than and outgun Cervera's ships (whose weapons are in disrepair). The Spanish Navy loses all six ships (sank or scuttled); 323 Spanish sailors are wounded, 151 killed, and 1,720 captured, while just one American sailor is killed and one is wounded.|$|E
25|$|Some {{benefits}} from the piracy have also been noted. In the earlier years of the phenomenon in 2008, {{it was reported that}} many local residents in pirate hubs such as Harardhere appreciated the rejuvenating effect that the pirates' <b>on-shore</b> spending and restocking had on their small towns, a presence which often provided jobs and opportunity when there were comparatively fewer. Entire hamlets were in the process reportedly transformed into boomtowns, with local shop owners and other residents using their gains to purchase items such as generators for uninterrupted electricity. However, the election of a new administration in 2009 in the northeastern Puntland region saw a sharp decrease in pirate operations, as the provincial authorities launched a comprehensive anti-piracy campaign and established an official maritime police force (PMPF). Since 2010, pirates have mainly operated from the Galmudug region to the south. According to the Somalia Report, the significant infrastructural development evident in Puntland's urban centers has also mainly come from a combination of government development programs, internal investment by local residents returning to their home regions following the civil war in the south, and especially remittance funds sent by the sizable Somali diaspora. The latter contributions have been estimated at around $1.3‚Äì$2 billion a year, exponentially dwarfing pirate ransom proceeds, which total only a few million dollars annually and are difficult to track in terms of spending.|$|E

The following day, USMC AV-8Bs attacked Iraqi positions in southern Kuwait. Throughout the war, AV-8Bs performed armed reconnaissance and worked in concert with coalition forces to destroy targets.|$|E
500|$|The {{fishing harbour}} was built between 1904 and 1907, with {{inner and outer}} {{sections}} established {{under the supervision of}} hydraulic engineer Palle Bruun.

500|$|Three routes were {{allocated}} to the evacuating vessels. The shortest was Route Z, a distance of , but it entailed hugging the French coast and thus ships using it were subject to bombardment from <b>on-shore</b> batteries, particularly in daylight hours. Route X, although the safest from shore batteries, travelled through a particularly heavily mined portion of the Channel. Ships on this route travelled [...] north out of Dunkirk, proceeded through the Ruytingen Pass, and headed towards the North Goodwin Lightship before heading south around the Goodwin Sands to Dover. The route was safest from surface attacks, but the nearby minefields and sand banks meant {{it could not be}} used at night. The longest of the three was Route Y, a distance of using this route increased the sailing time to four hours, double the time required for Route Z. This route followed the French coast as far as Bray-Dunes, then turned north-east until reaching the Kwinte Buoy. Here, after making an approximately 135-degree turn, the ships sailed west to the North Goodwin Lightship and headed south around the Goodwin Sands to Dover. Ships on Route Y were the most likely to be attacked by German surface vessels, submarines, and the Luftwaffe.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, 1994, 1996, 1998 and 2000, RMS Titanic Inc. {{carried out}} an {{intensive}} series of dives {{that led to}} the recovery of over 4,000 items in the first two expeditions alone. The 1996 expedition controversially attempted to raise a section of Titanic itself, a section of the outer hull that originally comprised part of the wall of two First Class cabins on C Deck, extending down to D Deck. It weighed 20 tons, measured [...] and had four portholes in it, three of which still had glass in them. The section had come loose either during the sinking or {{as a result of the}} impact with the sea bed. Its recovery using diesel-filled floatation bags was turned into something of an entertainment event with two cruise ships accompanying the expedition to the wreck site. Passengers were offered the chance, at $5,000 per person, to watch the recovery on television screens in their cabins while enjoying luxury accommodation, Las Vegas-style shows and casino gambling aboard the ships. Various celebrities were recruited to enliven the proceedings, including Burt Reynolds, Debbie Reynolds and Buzz Aldrin, and [...] "Grand Receptions" [...] for VIPs were scheduled <b>on-shore</b> where the hull section would be displayed. However, the lift ended disastrously when rough weather caused the ropes supporting the bags to snap.

500|$|According to Abraham, the Sangam era {{corresponds}} roughly to {{the period}} 300 BCE‚Äì300 CE, based on archaeology. Many historical sites have been excavated in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, {{many of them in}} the second half of the 20th century. One of the most important archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu is Arikamedu, located [...] south of Pondicherry. According to Wheeler, it was an Indo-Roman trading station that flourished during the first two centuries CE. It has been suggested that Arikamedu was first established as a settlement c. 250 BCE and lasted until 200 CE. Kodumanal and Perur, villages on the banks of the Noyyal river in Coimbatore district, were situated on the ancient trade route between Karur and the west coast, across the Palghat gap on the Western Ghats. Both sites have yielded remains belonging to the Sangam age. Kaveripumpattinam, also known as Puhar or Poompuhar, is located near the Kaveri delta and played a vital role in the brisk maritime history of ancient Tamilakam. Excavations have been carried out both <b>on-shore</b> and off-shore at Puhar and the findings have brought to light the historicity of the region. The artefacts excavated date between 300 BCE and early centuries CE. Some of the off-shore findings indicate that parts of the ancient city may have submerged under the advancing sea, as alluded to by the Sangam literature. Korkai, a port of the early Pandyas at the Tamraparani basin, is now located 7km inland due to the retreating shoreline caused by sediment deposition. Alagankulam, near the Vaigai delta, was another port city of the Pandyas and an archaeological site that has been excavated in the recent years. Both the Pandyan ports have provided clues about local occupations, such as pearl fishing. Other sites that have yielded remnants from the Sangam age include Kanchipuram, Kunnattur, Malayampattu and Vasavasamudram along the Palar river; Sengamedu and Karaikadu along the Pennar river; Perur, Tirukkampuliyur, Alagarai and Urayur along the Kaveri river.|$|E
