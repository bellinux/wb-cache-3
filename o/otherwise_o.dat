The strength and prominence of iron emission, together with the absence of O-rich ejecta, demonstrate that Kepler resulted from a thermonuclear supernova, even though evidence for circumstellar interaction is also strong. We have analyzed spectra of over 100 small regions, and find that they fall into three classes. (1) The vast majority show Fe L emission between 0. 7 and 1 keV and Si and S Kα emission; we associate these with shocked ejecta. A few of these are found at or beyond the mean blast wave radius. (2) A very few regions show solar O/Fe abundance rations; these we associate with shocked circumstellar medium (CSM). <b>Otherwise</b> <b>O</b> is scarce. (3) A few regions are dominated by continuum, probably synchrotron radiation. Finally, we find no central point source, with a limit ∼ 100 times fainter than the central object in Cas A.

We observed that the larvae lived in soft, water-saturated sediment, maintained by open burrows accreted by the animal’s mucous. Chironomid-larvae bur-rows were small and Y-shaped (e. g., Polykladichnus-like) or Y-shaped with basal branches (Thalassinoides-like) and were 20 cm deep. The larvae moved up and down from the oxygenated zone (‘‘sounding’ ’ behavior) to exploit food in suboxic and anoxic sedi-ment. Geochemical analyses showed that H 2 S was present in the pore waters to within 1. 5 mm of the sediment-water interface during the summer, when lake-bottom algae and cyanobacteria generated suf-ficient O 2 to drive the oxic-anoxic redoxcline into the sediment. In the winter, the H 2 S front extended upward into the water column owing to the cessation of algal and cyanobacterial activity. The prev-alence of H 2 S results {{from a combination of}} high-dissolved-sulfate concentrations in the lake and the abundance of microbial biomass that fuels an active subsurface population of sulfate-reducing bacte-ria. Interestingly, burrowing behavior was not linked to seasonal changes in the sediment chemistry.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} decades, {{it has been}} {{demonstrated}} that many animal species orient in the Earth magnetic field. One of the best-studied examples {{is the use of}} the geomagnetic field by migratory birds for orientation and navigation. However, the biophysical mechanism underlying animal magnetoreception is still not understood. One theory for magnetoreception in birds invokes the so-called radical-pair model. This mechanism involves a pair of reactive radicals, whose chemical fate can be influenced by the orientation with respect to the magnetic field of the Earth through Zeeman and hyperfine interactions. The fact that the geomagnetic field is weak, i. e., ∼ 0. 5 G, puts a severe constraint on the radical pair that can establish the magnetic compass sense. For a noticeable change of the reaction yield in a redirected geomagnetic field, the hyperfine interaction has to be as weak as the Earth field Zeeman interaction, i. e., unusually weak for an organic compound. Such weak hyperfine interaction can be achieved if one of the radicals is completely devoid of this interaction as realized in a radical pair containing an oxygen molecule as one of the radicals. Accordingly, we investigate here a possible radical pair-based reaction in the photoreceptor cryptochrome that reduces the protein's flavin group from its signaling state FADH• to the inactive state FADH– (which reacts to the likewise inactive FAD) by means of the superoxide radical, O 2 •–. We argue that the spin dynamics in the suggested reaction can act as a geomagnetic compass and that the very low physiological concentration (nM-μM) of <b>otherwise</b> toxic <b>O</b> 2 •– is sufficient, even favorable, for the biological function...|$|R

30|$|The {{additional}} {{level of}} salt tolerance found in Oa-VR offers a potential tool for crop improvement, especially in that Oa-VR {{is from a}} wild Oryza population with the unique EE genome (Jacquemin et al. 2013), and is thus phylogenetically remote from O. sativa; this enhances the possibility of identifying novel mechanisms of salt tolerance unique to O. australiensis. By contrast, IR 29 is reputedly highly salt-sensitive (Martinez-Atienza et al. 2006; Islam et al. 2011). Surprisingly, for the most salt-sensitive of the wild rice genotypes (Oa-D and Oa-KR) in very moderate salinity (40 [*]mM NaCl), biomass and ion concentrations were more strongly affected by salt than leaf symptoms, possibly indicating genotypic variation in tissue tolerance to NaCl, as reported earlier (Yeo et al. 1990). In reverse, the very slow absolute growth rates of IR 29 appeared, paradoxically, {{to result in a}} small effect of salt on relative growth rates (Fig. 3) but much larger effects on senescence (Fig. 1 a). This suggests that a range of performance criteria is essential to distinguish the intrinsic differences in salt tolerances in screening experiments. This underlines the polygenic nature of salt tolerance, where genes determining ion import, compartmentation and metabolic responses to salt are likely to play a collective role in physiological tolerance (Munns et al. 2008). Therefore, based on the overall indicators of salt tolerance and rates of shoot development, Oa-VR and Oa-D were chosen as complementary O. australiensis genotypes for image analysis (Fig. 4), representing contrasting tolerance to salt in <b>otherwise</b> indistinguishable <b>O.</b> australiensis accessions. While the salt-tolerant genotype (Oa-VR) is from the Northern Territory and the salt-sensitive accession is from the Kimberley region of Western Australia, there is no obvious basis for predicting their respective tolerances to salinity without a fine-scale investigation of the collection sites and the seasonal fluctuations in soil water content and soil chemistry.|$|R

30|$|For better {{interpretation}} of the obtained results, {{it would be useful}} to estimate the size of pores in the PPD membranes produced by different methods. However, direct determination of the pore size in PPD membrane is almost impossible, since the membrane consists of multiple layers of PD and pores in bottom layers can have different size. Killoran and O’Neill determined that the thickness of effective membrane from m-PD was 15  nm, and cross-sectional area of one oligomeric polymer strand estimated by del Valle et al. was 1  nm [7, 15]. Thus, the PPD membrane contains roughly 15 layers of polymer. Since the PPD membrane has hydrophobic and isolating properties, the membrane should have perforating nanopores that stretch to the electrode surface and allow by-pass of hydrogen peroxide molecules, <b>otherwise</b> H 2 <b>O</b> 2 cannot be oxidized and generate amperometric signal. The pores are definitely not uniform and the minimal diameter of pores should be less than 1  nm in order to reject electroactive molecules, and thus it is quite difficult to analyze the pores even with electron or atomic force microscopes. For these technical reasons, it is much easier to estimate effectiveness of the PPD membrane by evaluating the membrane permeability for different molecules. Such indirect approach is widespread and allows comparison of practical characteristics of different membranes.|$|R

Method: Parents of 3, 400 8 -year-old twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study completed the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test, a screening instrument for autism spectrum symptoms in mainstream samples. Genetic model-fitting of categorical and continuous data is reported. Results: High heritability was found for extreme autistic-like traits (0. 64 Y 0. 92 for various cutoffs) and autistic-like traits as measured on a continuum (0. 78 Y 0. 81), with no significant shared environmental influences. All three subscales were highly heritable but showed low covariation. In the genetic modeling, distinct genetic influences were identified for the three components. Conclusions: These results suggest the triad of impairments that define autism spectrum disorders is heterogeneous genetically. Molecular genetic research examining the three components separately may identify different causal pathways for the three components. The analyses give no indication that different genetic processes affect extreme autistic impairments and autistic impairments as measured on a continuum, but this can only be directly tested once genes are identified.

This paper deals with the effect of moisture content on strength of older alluvium under dry, wet and saturated conditions. Older alluvium is semi cemented eroded deposited and reshaped by water to make non-marine setting. Specimens were tested in for shear strength, hardness and point load index. According to these results, the petrophysical properties of older alluvium decrease with increasing moisture. The strength was extremely reduced after the moisture content increased over the range of natural moisture content i. e. at saturated condition. For soil mechanics and soil engineering projects the shear strength, friction angle and cohesion assess at dry condition in order to give classification for soil strength. While the design parameters (shear strength, friction angle and cohesion) were taken at weak condition i. e. saturated and wet condition. However the difficulties and non reliable preparing regular samples at laboratory, most of samples destroyed during the sample preparation.

Older alluvium shows equilibrium between distribution of the clay/silt and gravel with percent finer approximately 38 % and 38. 5 % respectively, and lower presence of sand with percent finer approximately 23. 4 %. The range of natural moisture content was within range of 17. 98 to 19. 65 %. The results revealed that moisture content have great influence in the reduction of the shear strength t, friction angle Ø and cohesion c. When the moisture content on older alluvium deposits increased the shear strength reduced to 22. 3 % and to 75. 3 % at wet and saturated condition respectively (the shear strength equal to 57. 4 kPa and 18. 3 kPa for wet and saturated condition respectively) in comparison to the magnitude of shear strength at dry condition (shear strength at dry condition equal to 74. 1 kPa). The same as for friction angle, when the moisture content increased the friction angle reduced to 18. 6 % and 66. 9 % at wet condition and saturated condition respectively (friction angle equal to 55. 19 o and 22. 45 o for wet and saturated condition respectively) in comparison to the magnitude at dry condition (at dry condition friction angle equal to 67. 83 <b>o).</b> <b>Otherwise</b> the effective of increase the moisture content at cohesion is different i. e. the magnitude of cohesion at dry condition was equal to 21. 044 kPa. At wet condition the cohesion increased to 12. 7 % (cohesion equal to 23. 71 kPa) in comparison to the magnitude at dry condition. At saturated condition the cohesion value will decreased to 54. 6 % (cohesion equal to 9. 54 kPa) in comparison to the magnitude at dry condition...|$|R
