40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the risk factors}} for recurrence after surgery for biliary pancreatitis. MethodsA total of 284 patients with biliary pancreatitis who were treated in The Fourth Hospital of PLA from January 2008 to December 2014 were followed up, and the risk factors for postoperative recurrence were analyzed. The chi-square test was used for categorical data, and the unconditional logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. ResultsThe follow-up period ranged from 6 to 27 months (mean 36. 4 ± 8. 4 months). Of all patients, 27 experienced recurrence, and the recurrence rate was 9. 51 %. The univariate analysis showed that postoperative recurrence {{was associated with a}} family history of gallstone disease, high-fat diet, sand-like stones, intrahepatic bile duct stones, biliopancreatic <b>duct</b> <b>opening</b> stenosis, and diverticulum around the ampullar region (χ 2 = 8. 721, 5. 979, 8. 641, 15. 996, 33. 833, and 27. 203, all P＜ 0  05). The multivariate logistic analysis showed that high-fat diet (OR= 2. 296, P= 0. 012), biliopancreatic <b>duct</b> <b>opening</b> stenosis (OR= 2. 280, P= 0. 007), and diverticulum around the ampullar region (OR= 2. 522, P= 0. 009) were independent risk factors for recurrence after surgery for biliary pancreatitis. ConclusionBiliary pancreatitis patients with high-fat diet, biliopancreatic <b>duct</b> <b>opening</b> stenosis, or diverticulum around the ampullar region tend to experience recurrence after surgery. Intervention and close follow-up should be performed for these patients to prevent recurrence...|$|R
50|$|Although {{some species}} are parthenogenic, {{both males and}} females are usually present, each with a single gonad located above the intestine.

50|$|The {{mandible}} is {{the insect}} organ for biting and crushing, {{analogous to the}} jaw in mammals. In the genus Polistes, the lateral mandibular groove is smaller in size than in other genera of social wasps. A common misconception is that the mandibular gland is the anatomical portion shaped like a sac. In actuality, the sac formation is the gland reservoir that feeds into the gland itself. The actual gland is pressed up against the sac surface. Gland cells are shaped like polygons. Like poisonous structures in formicine ants, gland cells are continuous with the gland reservoir, but no filaments extend from the gland or sac {{as they do in}} the ants. The sac is closest to mandible’s medial portion. A duct exits the sac. The <b>duct</b> <b>opening</b> is encircled by a sphincter muscle controlling the gland’s secretions. The duct is opened by sclerotized bars in conjunction with the hypopharynx. When the hypopharynx moves, pressure forms on the <b>opening</b> of the <b>duct</b> via the bars. When the bars dissipate this pressure, the duct closes.|$|R

50|$|Dufour’s gland {{was first}} {{described}} by Léon Jean Marie Dufour in 1841. Along with the spermatheca and the poison gland, it develops as an invagination of valves of the sternum.

The gland is lined by a single layer of epithelial cells which secrete substances into the hollow interior. Muscles round the <b>opening</b> of the <b>duct</b> may help control the outflow.|$|R
