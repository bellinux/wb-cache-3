5|$|The first {{mission of}} the new {{operation}} was launched on 2 March against an ammunition storage area near Xom Bang. On the same day, 19 VNAF A-1 Skyraiders struck the Quang Khe Naval Base. The Americans were shocked when six of their aircraft were shot down during the mission. Five of the downed crewmen were rescued, {{but it was a}} portent <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
5|$|Jenna {{has become}} more famous after gaining weight, and sorts through large amounts of fan mail. Jack congratulates her on her weight, and Jenna enjoys her new {{friendship}} with him. While talking to Liz, Jenna begins to worry about losing weight, and fears her popularity will decline. Upset that Jenna is losing weight, Jack sends Kenneth to follow her around and make sure she keeps her weight on. Liz tells Kenneth to insult Jenna if he wants her to eat more, and writes down a list <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> say to Jenna to hurt her. Jenna takes the insults as compliments, and tries to seduce Kenneth.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell), {{having left}} Dunder Mifflin with Pam (Jenna Fischer) to form his own company, {{is having trouble}} {{starting}} his first day {{as president of the}} Michael Scott Paper Company. Pam tries to keep things together and suggests they create a list <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> do to maintain a positive working atmosphere. Michael sets up a meeting with a potential investor and makes a list of potential salesmen to join the company. He receives a letter from his realtor saying that running a business from his condominium is in violation of his residence agreement, so he needs to find office space for the company. Michael and Pam leave to find potential salesmen and then have their meeting with the potential investor.|$|E

6000|$|... 'That,' I said firmly, 'is {{altogether}} out-of-date. You {{should have}} brought a larger mentality, a more vital uplift, and--er--all that sort <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>to</b> bear on--all that sort <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> you know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{last the}} Major dried his eyes openly, and said: [...] "Nice sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> spring on an English family! What shall we do?" ...|$|R
5|$|The Definite Synodical Platform was {{not enough}} to cause the Pennsylvania Ministerium to leave the General Synod, but it was a foretaste <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come. When the Frankean Synod, a Lutheran church body noted for its {{progressive}} politics and its utter disregard for the Lutheran Confessions, was admitted to the General Synod, the leadership of the Ministerium had seen enough. At the 1864 gathering of the General Synod, at which the Frankeans were admitted, the delegates from the Ministerium left in protest. Unfortunately, the delegates left before the General Synod passed a resolution affirming and strengthening their commitment to the Augsburg Confession.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} the Godesburg and its {{subsequent}} destruction were a mere taste <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come. It {{was the first}} of many sieges in the Cologne War, and the castle's fall eventually led to the fall not just of Bonn, but of several other principal towns and cities in the Electorate of Cologne: Hülchrath, Neuss and Werl. Several smaller fortified towns such as Gelsenkirchen, Unkel and Brühl were also either heavily damaged or destroyed before, during and after the siege. In addition to damage to the towns and cities, Ernst's supporters managed to restrict imports and exports to and from the Electorate, not only crippling Gebhard's financial resources but resulting in economic hardship for the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The term Rosetta stone {{has been}} used idiomatically to {{represent}} a crucial key {{in the process of}} decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first figurative use of the term appeared in the 1902 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the phrase is found in H. G. Wells' 1933 novel The Shape <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> <b>to</b> Come, where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both longhand and on typewriter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well--Well, anyhow, look here, I'll {{think it}} over, {{and let you}} know to-morrow. It's not the sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> rush through without {{thinking}} about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Must apologise to you fellows, really. Dam silly, clumsy kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do; {{might have}} been awkward too. Thank you, Byfield, my boy, I will: two fingers only--a {{harmless}} steadier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{remind me}} to have a board done about trespassers, and spring guns, and all that sort <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>to</b> keep the common people out. Do you hear, Hunt; do you hear?' ...|$|R
5|$|All {{day train}} service was {{restored}} from Burlington to Whitby, and peak service was finally brought to Oshawa in 2000, {{but this would}} be only one indicator <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come. A large initiative to expand the GO Transit network in the mid-2000s under the GO Transit Rail Improvement Plan, or GO TRIP. $1 billion was invested in multiple rail and bus projects, making it the largest commuter rail project in Canadian history. This was later dwarfed by a further slate of new GO infrastructure proposed in MoveOntario 2020, the provincial transit plan announced by Premier Dalton McGuinty in the leadup to the 2007 provincial election. With significant re-investment in regional transit, GO experienced significant growth in its train network: all day service was restored to Oshawa in 2006 and Aldershot in 2007; service was expanded to Barrie South in 2007, to Lincolnville in 2008 and to Kitchener in 2011; and an excursion train now operates on summer weekends to Niagara Falls.|$|E
5|$|By his standards, Roger Federer had a weak season: {{he failed}} to win a Grand Slam tournament title {{for the first time}} since 2002, losing to Nadal for the fourth time in a French Open final, and the sixth time overall in Major finals. He dropped to world No. 4 in November, the first time he had been ranked outside the top 3 since 2002. Federer's drop was caused by Murray's {{remarkable}} run of form in Asia in October, winning three successive titles. However, Federer rallied, winning his three final tournaments (a sign <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come in the subsequent season), including the World Tour Finals, which was enough to secure an end-of-season ranking of No. 3. Murray, meanwhile, was making significant improvements to his game and made the semifinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments, with his best result a defeat in the Australian Open final against Djokovic. He ended the year with two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles for the fourth consecutive year, and five titles in total.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{switched}} to Dunlop tires for the 1982 season, as Goodyear {{pulled out of}} motorcycle racing. New competition had arrived as Honda entered their new two-stroke NS500 ridden by defending champion Lucchinelli, former 350cc world champion, Takazumi Katayama and newcomer Freddie Spencer. Roberts won the season-opening round in Argentina on the old square-four Yamaha, but then {{switched to}} the new OW61 YZR500 V4 engined bike. He came in third at the Austrian Grand Prix then, sat out the French Grand Prix at Nogaro as {{he and the other}} top riders boycotted the race over unsafe track conditions. Roberts then won the Spanish Grand Prix at Jarama ahead of Sheene, and scored a second place behind Suzuki rider Franco Uncini in the Netherlands. In a portent <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come, Roberts was leading the Belgian Grand Prix when his Dunlop tires lost their grip and he had to settle for fourth place as Spencer went on to win his first Grand Prix for Honda. Roberts then injured his knee and finger at the British Grand Prix and had to miss the Swedish round, but by then the world championship had been claimed by Uncini with a total of five victories while Roberts fell to fourth place. By the end of the 1982 season, Roberts had won sixteen 500cc Grand Prix races, more than double that of any of his contemporaries.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{never knew}} kings went to chapel much,' said Mr Springett. 'But I always hold with a man--don't care who he be--seein' {{about his own}} grave before he dies. 'Tidn't the sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> leave to your family after the will's read. I reckon 'twas a fine vault?' ...|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT. I'm not crying. I--I--I {{leave that}} sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> your damned sentimental Irishmen. You think I have no feeling because I am a plain unemotional Englishman, with no powers of expression.|$|R

25|$|A fourth special, The Road to Season 2, {{aired on}} June 1, 2008. This hour {{presented}} highlights {{from the first}} season and gave a preview <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come in the second one.|$|E
25|$|After the {{remaining}} centers of resistance were destroyed, Genghis returned to Mongolia, leaving Mongolian garrison troops behind. The destruction and absorption of the Khwarezmid Empire {{would prove to}} be a sign <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come for the Islamic world, as well as Eastern Europe.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I {{have not}} seen the squire as yet. I will do so before I go back, of course. But it seemed such a commonplace sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> go round by the village." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{when she}} is at home!" [...] Fanny only shrugged her shoulders. [...] "The truth is, you know," [...] said Max, [...] "that it {{was not at all}} the proper sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do!" ...|$|R
60|$|Jeeves had {{projected}} {{himself in}} from the dining-room and materialized on the rug. Lady Malvern tried to freeze him with a look, but you can't do that sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> Jeeves. He is look-proof.|$|R
25|$|As the {{settlers}} came into Iowa, they naturally established communities. Significant {{of these were}} Burlington, Dubuque, Davenport, Keokuk, Fort Madison, and Muscatine. By 1836, when the first census was taken in Iowa, there were 10,531 inhabitants. This rapid immigration was but a sign <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} future, this battle would represent the shape <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> {{come in the}} Civil War: it {{marked the first time}} that a state openly defied the federal government, raised its own military, and marched into federal territory in specific and open defiance of federal law and treaties.|$|E
25|$|Helnwein's Mickey {{is painted}} {{in shades of}} gray, as if pictured on an old {{black-and-white}} TV set. We {{are meant to be}} transported to the flickering edges of our own childhood memories in a time imaginably more blameless, crime-less and guiltless. But Mickey's terrifying demeanor hints <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come...".|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a nice}} sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> hear almost one's {{first night}} in England," [...] Hamel remarked a little gloomily. [...] "Tell me some more about this conference. Are you sure that your {{information}} is reliable?" ...|$|R
50|$|Principle. The {{subordination}} <b>of</b> material <b>things</b> <b>to</b> spiritual <b>things.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the same}} sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> me, I can tell you. A man can't be {{moderate}} when he feels that he should like to break his own neck. I declare I almost {{tried to do it}} to-day." ...|$|R
25|$|Belgium {{hosted the}} 1972 tournament, which West Germany won, beating the USSR 3–0 in the final, with goals coming from Gerd Müller (twice) and Herbert Wimmer at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels. This tournament {{would provide a}} taste <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come, as the German side {{contained}} many of the {{key members of the}} 1974 FIFA World Cup Champions.|$|E
25|$|Bellamy again managed nine {{goals as}} his team reached the UEFA Cup semi-finals, {{eventually}} losing out 2–0 on aggregate to Olympique Marseille, though he also played considerably fewer games from his two previous seasons at Newcastle United, a sign <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come, as Bellamy's career was blighted by {{injury in the}} next few years.|$|E
25|$|Varitek {{was called}} {{up for a}} single game on September 24, 1997, {{collecting}} a single in his only at bat. During the 1998 season, Varitek split time with incumbent catcher Scott Hatteberg playing in 86 games. Varitek showed signs <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> come in the season, and with a strong spring training the following season, Varitek earned the starting catcher position.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a nice sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{say to a}} fellow," [...] said Marmaduke, roused. [...] "I have a great mind {{to bring}} you to your senses as Douglas does, by not {{speaking}} {{to you for a}} week." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How delightfully {{confidential}} {{she must}} have been!--but I assure you, sir, that she never said that sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> me. There were things she liked and things she did not like, but she {{showed no signs of}} rebellion." ...|$|R
60|$|RICHARD (with {{the horror}} of death upon him). Do {{you think this is}} a {{pleasant}} sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be kept waiting for? You've made up your mind to commit murder: well, do it and have done with it.|$|R
