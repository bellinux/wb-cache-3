40|$|For {{safe and}} stable {{operations}} of power plants, {{it is essential}} to monitor closely crucial measurement values related to power plant trips. In this paper, an intelligent power plant operating state monitoring technique enabling the <b>operating</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> to monitor conveniently the status of the important measurement values and to perceive almost instantly the significance of the implications of those measurement values is developed. The proposed technique is called a “POST(Plant Operating State Tracking) Chart ” technique and provides the foundations in developing an intelligent and integrated power plant operating state monitoring support system called the “P-OASIS”(Plant Operation Assessment and Support Intelligent System). The P-OASIS is applied to a thermal power plant o...|$|E

5000|$|Orion 2 was {{installed}} onboard Soyuz 13 in December 1973, a spacecraft modified {{to become the}} first manned space observatory. The observatory was <b>operated</b> by <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> Valentin Lebedev. The designer of the observatory was Grigor Gurzadyan, then at Garni Space Astronomy Laboratory in Armenia. Ultraviolet spectrograms of thousands of stars to as faint as 13th stellar magnitude were obtained by a wide-angle meniscus telescope. [...] The first satellite UV spectrogram of a planetary nebula (IC 2149) was obtained, revealing spectral lines of aluminum and titanium - elements not previously observed in planetary nebulae. Two-photon emission in that planetary nebula and a remarkable star cluster in Auriga were also discovered.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{follow-on}} to the HL-20 program, the NASA {{intent was}} to apply Administrator Dan Goldin's concept of [...] "better, faster, cheaper" [...] to the program. The CRV design concept incorporated three main elements: the lifting-body reentry vehicle, the international berthing/docking module, and the Deorbit Propulsion Stage. The vehicle was to be designed to accommodate up to seven <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> in a shirt-sleeve environment. Because {{of the need to}} be able to <b>operate</b> with incapacitated <b>crew</b> <b>members,</b> flight and landing operations were to be performed autonomously. The CRV design had no space maneuvering propulsion system.|$|R

50|$|The astrophysical Orion 1 Space Observatory {{designed}} by Grigor Gurzadyan of Byurakan Observatory in Armenia, {{was installed in}} Salyut 1. Ultraviolet spectrograms of stars were obtained {{with the help of}} a mirror telescope of the Mersenne system and a spectrograph of the Wadsworth system using film sensitive to the far ultraviolet. The dispersion of the spectrograph was 32 Å/mm (3.2 nm/mm), while the resolution of the spectrograms derived was about 5 Å at 2600 Å (0.5 nm at 260 nm). Slitless spectrograms were obtained of the stars Vega and Beta Centauri between 2000 and 3800 Å (200 and 380 nm).

40|$|The manned core {{platform}} of the Space Station will repeatedly provide {{observations of the}} tropical and subtropical parts of earth from about 500 km altitude in a 28. 5 degree orbit. This orbit covers most of the landmasses in the Southern Hemisphere, {{half of the world}} ocean, and more than 120 nations. The platform can provide remote-sensing activities by means of: (1) sensors attached to structural members of the platform; (2) sensors deployed on one or more pointable platforms attached to structural members, or man-tended in separate orbits; (3) sensors operated from the resource nodes; (4) sensors operated through earth-viewing, optical-quality windows; and (5) hand-held cameras <b>operated</b> by <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> throughout the facility.

50|$|The Orion 2 Space Observatory, {{designed}} by Grigor Gurzadyan, was <b>operated</b> by <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> Lebedev. Ultraviolet spectrograms {{of thousands of}} stars to as faint as 13th magnitude were obtained by a wide-angle meniscus telescope of the Cassegrain system, with an aperture diameter of 240 mm, an equivalent focal length of 1,000 mm, and a 4-grade quartz prism objective. The dispersion of the spectrograph was 17, 28 and 55 nm/mm, at wavelengths of 200, 250 and 300 nm respectively. The first satellite UV spectrogram of a planetary nebula (IC 2149 in Auriga) was obtained, revealing lines of aluminium and titanium - elements not previously observed in objects of that type. Two-photon emission in that planetary nebula and a remarkable star cluster in Auriga were also discovered. Additionally, comet Kohoutek was observed.|$|R

5000|$|The player {{begins the}} game in a space station called Starport Outpost 1 with a meager {{allotment}} of funds for outfitting a spaceship and training <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> in {{the skills needed to}} <b>operate</b> it. <b>Crew</b> <b>members</b> are chosen from one of five races, each of which possesses certain strengths and weaknesses, and are assigned to the positions of captain, science officer, navigator, engineer, communications officer, and doctor. Aside from the captain, specialized training is available for each position at a cost that increases in proportion to the amount of training received. Training raises the proficiency at which <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> perform their duties and reduces the number of errors they make. Spacecraft engines, lasers, missiles, shields and armor are available for purchase at levels ranging from one through five, each successive level representing an increase in the power and the cost of the item. Also available for purchase are cargo pods that expand the spaceship's storage capacity, jump pods (single-use devices capable of almost instantaneously transporting the spaceship to any point within the region), and blasto pods (single-use torpedoes with considerable destructive power). Additional training and spaceship accessories may be purchased at any time throughout the game. Before the player may leave Starport and explore the surrounding universe, the spaceship's [...] "navigation system must be calibrated", a procedure serving as the game's copy protection scheme in which stars must be counted within a specified part of the paper star map included in the game's packaging (a [...] "master code", 34789, will always be considered correct and can be used to bypass the scheme).|$|R

The basic Il-96-300 is equipped with modern Russian avionics integrating six multi-function colour LCD displays, inertial and satellite navigation systems, and a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (including mode [...] "S"). It allows the airplane to be <b>operated</b> with two <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b> The avionics correspond to modern requirements on international routes in Europe and North America (RNP-1) and allow navigation and landing under ICAO CAT III/A conditions.

The turret was <b>operated</b> by two <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> {{and this was a}} significant drawback as it put excessive workload on the tank's commander as most new tanks were designed with three-man turrets, following the successful example of the German Panzer III. The main weapon was the 75/34 cannon, a development of the Model 37 divisional gun (34 calibres long), retaining the same dimensions. This weapon had a muzzle velocity of around 700 m/s. The P26/40 originally fielded three machine guns, but one was removed along with the deletion of the frontal, dual barbette machine gun mount.|$|R
