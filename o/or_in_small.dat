5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. Fruit bodies {{are found in}} wet coniferous and deciduous forests, where they grow singly <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups {{on the ground in}} litterfall or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs in the summer and autumn.|$|E
5|$|Other Marasmius {{species with}} a {{pinwheel}} arrangement of gills are readily distinguished from M.rotula by differences in color, including the orange M.siccus, the pink M.pulcherripes, and the rust M.fulvoferrugineus. Mycena corticola {{is smaller than}} Marasmius rotula, has a pale pink-brown cap, and is usually found growing singly <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups on bark near the base of living trees.|$|E
5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} {{is usually}} seen singly <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups as it stalks about in shallow lakes or drying lake beds and garbage dumps. It is {{often found in}} the company of kites and vultures and will sometimes sit hunched still for long durations. They may also hold their wings outstretched, presumably to control their temperature. They soar on thermals using their large outstretched wings.|$|E

5|$|The {{sculptured}} puffball grows solitarily <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> {{groups in}} forest duff. It is {{typically associated with}} coniferous forests at high elevations, greater than about , on western mountains like the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range. The United States distribution includes the states of California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. An uncommon species, it fruits throughout spring, summer, and fall during wet weather.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in Mexico, where it grows singly <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups in clayey soils in {{subtropical}} coffee plantations, and from Colombia and Brazil in South America. The mushroom contains the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and psilocin, and all parts will stain blue or bluish black when handled or injured. P.hoogshagenii is used for divinatory purposes by some indigenous groups in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater {{is usually}} seen singly, in pairs, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> family groups when not migrating. They forage as individuals, as pairs or as {{small groups of}} up to ten birds, and during {{migration}} in larger groups. They sometimes feed in large mixed-species foraging flocks composed predominately of insectivorous birds.|$|E

5|$|All baleen {{whales are}} carnivorous; however a 2015 study {{revealed}} they house gut flora {{similar to that}} of terrestrial herbivores. Different kinds of prey are found in different abundances depending on location, and each type of whale is adapted to a specialized way of foraging. There are two types of feeding behaviors: skim-feeding and lunge-feeding, but some species do both depending on the type and amount of food. For example, Antarctic whales mostly feed on euphausiids; however, this is mainly effective for lunge-feeders, whereas skim-feeders, like the right whales, feed primarily on copepods. They feed alone <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food, and their kidneys excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the velvet belly {{is one of}} the most abundant deep-sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance increases in the older age classes. In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups. However, this pattern has not been observed at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|Being {{the most}} {{abundant}} carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with wolves. A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Competition would favor the wolf, which is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pinophilus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with pine (Pinus), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea). It {{can therefore be}} located wherever those trees grow, particularly with Scots pine in Britain, preferring the poor, acidic, and sandy soils associated with coniferous forests. It appears to favour Pinus, while {{the form of the}} mushroom occurring in association with Abies and Picea has been labeled Boletus pinophilus var. fuscoruber. However, it is not confined to coniferous trees and may also be found fruiting in deciduous forests, such as under chestnut trees. Fruiting bodies can occur singly, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups throughout the summer and autumn months, although they are known to appear as early as April in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Crinipellis zonata is saprobic, {{living on}} the debris or roots of hardwoods; it {{contains}} wood-decaying enzymes that can break down the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene. The mushrooms grow individually <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> clusters, {{and can be found}} between August and September. In North America, it is distributed east of the Rocky Mountains, and has been recorded as far west as Indiana and Texas. In Europe, it has been collected in Portugal. It has also been collected in South Korea.|$|E

5|$|Handkea utriformis is widespread, and {{frequent}} in northern temperate zones. It {{is found in}} Europe, continental Asia, Japan, eastern atlantic North America, Mexico, and South Africa. It has also been collected in Chile, and New Zealand. Growing alone <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups, it favors sandy open pastures, or heaths, and is often found in coastal regions. It typically fruits in summer through late autumn (July - November in the UK).|$|E
5|$|In North America, C.violaceus favours conifers, and, though rare {{over much}} of the continent, is {{relatively}} common in certain areas, including Mount Rainier National Park and Olympic National Park. It is more common in old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, though has sprung up in regrowth areas populated with fir, pine, aspen and alder in the Great Lakes region. Fruit bodies occur singly <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups, often near rotting wood, and can grow in fairy rings. Closely related species that look like C.violaceus can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis {{is found}} in Europe; it does not occur in North America, {{although}} a number of similar brownish-orange species were formerly classified under this species. It {{is found in}} broad-leaved woodland, especially {{on the floor at}} the base of beech trees. Along with L. vellereus, L.subdulcis is the most common fungi found on beech trees. The mushrooms can be found from late summer to late autumn, and are common. They are found individually, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups. They can also be found in fields, generally appearing in large batches, with groups of over a hundred mushrooms not uncommon.|$|E

5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum can {{be found}} either solitary <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups. It {{typically}} grows {{on the ground in}} deciduous forests and grassy areas, glades and pastures, on moss, humus, or woody debris. The fungus has been noted to have a preference for beech woods. Fruit bodies may make their appearance anytime from the late spring to autumn. Older specimens {{are more likely to be}} overlooked, as their brown color blends into the surrounding environment of dead leaves and dead wood. The puffball is used by various species of scuttle flies (family Phoridae) as larval food.|$|E
5|$|Lysurus mokusin is saprobic, {{and grows}} solitarily <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups in forest litter, and wood chip mulch used in landscaping, and compost. Documented {{sightings}} of L.mokusin include Australasia, the Canary Islands, Korea, Japan, China (Fujian Province), and the Bonin Islands. The species was unknown in Europe {{until it was}} reported in Italy in 1979; it is considered an alien species in that continent. In the United States, it has been collected from the states of California, Texas, and Washington, D.C..|$|E
5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii, {{commonly}} known as the slender parasol or graceful parasol, is a species of mushroom-forming fungus in the family Lepiotaceae. The species is found in Australia and New Zealand, where it fruits singly <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups on the ground in eucalypt woodlands, parks, and roadsides. It is a tall mushroom up to roughly , with a broad cap covered with distinctive rings of dark brown scales. The whitish gills on the cap underside are closely spaced and free from attachment to the slender stipe, which has a loose ring on its upper half, and a bulbous base. The edibility of the mushroom is not known with certainty, but closely related parasol mushrooms are edible and some are very sought after.|$|E
