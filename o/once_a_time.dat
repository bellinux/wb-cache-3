In Brazil, the news of the Emperor's death [...] "aroused a genuine sense of regret among those who, without sympathy for a restoration, acknowledged both the merits and the achievements of their deceased ruler." [...] The overthrown monarchy was still a fresh memory to Brazilians, to which was added a feeling of remorse over what they perceived as an unjust exile, followed by his lonely demise. Some republicans [...] "reconsidered the long banishment and reflected upon the severity of such action." [...] Even they believed that PedroII deserved a better end, and nostalgia spread among them as they [...] "started to see in the Imperial epoch a happier time, a golden age, forever gone." [...] The Empire began to be viewed more tolerantly by the new governments, and its considerable achievements were openly recognized.

60|$|There was <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when New England groaned {{under the}} actual {{pressure}} of heavier wrongs than those threatened ones which brought on the Revolution. James II, the bigoted successor of Charles the Voluptuous, had annulled the charters {{of all the}} colonies, and sent a harsh and unprincipled soldier to take away our liberties and endanger our religion. The administration of Sir Edmund Andros lacked scarcely a single characteristic of tyranny: a Governor and Council, holding office from the King, and wholly independent of the country; laws made and taxes levied without concurrence of the people immediate or by their representatives; the rights of private citizens violated, and the titles of all landed property declared void; the voice of complaint stifled by restrictions on the press; and, finally, disaffection overawed by the first band of mercenary troops that ever marched on our free soil. For two years our ancestors were kept in sullen submission by that filial love which had invariably secured their allegiance to the mother country, whether its head chanced to be a Parliament, Protector, or Popish Monarch. Till these evil times, however, such allegiance had been merely nominal, and the colonists had ruled themselves, enjoying far more freedom than is even yet the privilege of the native subjects of Great Britain.|$|E
6000|$|... § 32. One more {{argument}} remains, and that, I believe, an unanswerable one. As, by {{the accident}} of education, {{the love of}} nature has been, among us, associated with wilfulness, so, by the accident of time, it {{has been associated with}} faithlessness. I traced, above, the peculiar mode in which this faithlessness was indicated; but I never intended to imply, therefore, that it was an invariable concomitant of the love. Because it happens that, by various concurrent operations of evil, we have been led, according to those words of the Greek poet already quoted, [...] "to dethrone the gods, and crown the whirlwind," [...] it is no reason that we should forget there was <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when [...] "the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind." [...] And if we now take final and full view of the matter, we shall find that the love of nature, wherever it has existed, has been a faithful and sacred element of human feeling; that is to say, supposing all circumstances otherwise the same with respect to two individuals, the one who loves nature most will be always found to have more faith in God than the other. It is intensely difficult, owing to the confusing and counter influences which always mingle in the data of the problem, to make this abstraction fairly; but so far as we can do it, so far, I boldly assert, the result is constantly the same: the nature-worship will be found to bring with it such a sense of the presence and power of a Great Spirit as no mere reasoning can either induce or controvert; and where that nature-worship is innocently pursued,--i.e. with due respect to other claims on time, feeling, and exertion, and associated with the higher principles of religion,--it becomes the channel of certain sacred truths, which by no other means can be conveyed.|$|E
