5|$|The vote, to be {{administered}} by the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), was originally scheduled for 8 August but later postponed until 30 August. Indonesia also took responsibility for security; this arrangement caused worry in East Timor, but many <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> that Indonesia would have refused to allow foreign peacekeepers during the vote.|$|E
5|$|To recover lost ground, the PVA 45th Division {{commander}} Cui Jiangong {{attempted a}} sneak attack with three infantry companies by 7 pm. When flares broke the night cover, the attackers launched bayonet charges and hand-to-hand fighting ensued. The UN forces responded with heavy artillery fire, but the determined Chinese assault troops marched through both Chinese and UN artillery screens {{to reach the}} UN positions – a strange sight that made some American <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> that the attackers were {{under the influence of}} drugs. The intense fighting prevented UN forces from receiving any resupply, and the UN defenders were forced to give up all captured ground after running out of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|China has {{installed}} a grassroots network of officials throughout Xinjiang, its predominantly Muslim north-west frontier region, to address social risks and spot {{early signs of}} unrest: Hundreds of cadres have been transferred from southern Xinjiang, the region’s poorest area, into socially unstable neighbourhoods of Ürümqi; a policy has been implemented where if all family members are unemployed, the government arranges for {{one person in the}} household to get a job,; official announcements are calling upon university students to register for those payouts. The areas around slums are being redeveloped to reduce social risks, opening way to new apartment blocks. However, independent <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> that fundamental inequalities need to be addressed, and the mindset must change for there to be any success; Ilham Tohti warned that the new policy could attract more Han immigration, and further alienate the Uyghur population.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>observers</b> <b>believed</b> {{that the}} People's Republic of China (PRC) would have {{preferred}} to see Chen Shui-bian replaced by an administration less sympathetic to Taiwan independence and more in favor of Chinese reunification. However, some <b>observers</b> <b>believed</b> that the PRC cared less about who became the President of the ROC, than that this person establish economic linkages which Beijing believes would bind Taiwan irrevocably to the Mainland.|$|R

25|$|In the 2 June referendum, {{a decisive}} {{majority}} voted to make Italy a republic. The republic was formally proclaimed four days later, ending Umberto's brief 34-day reign as king. Many <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> that had Victor Emmanuel abdicated sooner, the monarchy might have survived.|$|E
25|$|In the 1991 Gulf War resolution, the PRC abstained, and it {{voted for}} the {{ultimatum}} to Iraq in the period {{leading up to the}} 2003 War in Iraq.

50|$|The {{debate was}} largely {{regarded}} as a draw. However, many <b>observers</b> <b>believed</b> Thatcher more than held his own against the formidable Douglas. The debate established Thatcher as the province's main anti-CCF standard bearer.|$|R
5000|$|Musawi {{considered}} Berri's actions [...] "treasonous" [...] and Amal's orientation too secular. In response, Musawi {{broke from}} Amal {{and set up}} his own faction, which <b>observers</b> <b>believed</b> was organized primarily along family lines.|$|R
25|$|Abdul Haq, who {{was killed}} by the Taliban on October 26, 2001, enjoying strong popular support among Afghanistan's Pashtuns, wanted to create and support a popular {{uprising}} against the Taliban - also dominantly Pashtuns - among the Pashtuns. <b>Observers</b> <b>believe</b> that the Taliban were only able to capture him with the collaboration of the ISI.|$|E
25|$|Former Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and his {{predecessor}} Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad have both suggested that Malays should depend less on government assistance. Many <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> full abolition of bumiputra privileges is unlikely, especially {{in view of}} the constitutional issues involved, although successive administrations since Mahathir have attempted to reform the system of government aid for the bumiputra. Some bumiputra groups believe further affirmative action is necessary.|$|E
25|$|Since McLain's 31-win season, {{only two}} other {{pitchers}} have approached the 30-game milestone (Steve Carlton won 27 games in 1972 and Bob Welch also with 27 victories in 1990). With Major League Baseball {{moving from the}} four-man pitching rotation of McLain's era to five-man rotations, and with the increased reliance on relief pitchers, some <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> that another 30-game winner may not occur {{because of the way}} the game is played today.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} months of 2008, many <b>observers</b> <b>believed</b> that a U.S. {{recession}} had begun. The collapse of Bear Stearns and the resulting financial market turbulence signaled that the crisis would not be mild and brief.|$|R
50|$|On 6 December 1990, after 2 {{months of}} {{widespread}} civil unrest, Ershad offered his resignation. On 27 February 1991, {{an interim government}} oversaw what most <b>observers</b> <b>believed</b> to be the nation's second most {{free and fair elections}} to date.|$|R
25|$|In an {{election}} for the National Assembly in northern Vietnam, the Viet Minh and allied nationalist groups won 300 of 350 seats. Most <b>observers</b> <b>believed</b> the elections were fair, {{although there were}} a few charges that voters had been intimidated.|$|R
25|$|Natural <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> {{that most}} bear species are near-sighted, which allows bears to forage for small {{objects such as}} berries. However, bears are also capable of discerning faraway movements, helping them hunt prey. The Kodiak bear, when {{compared}} to other species, appears to have vision comparable to a human (not near-sighted). Experiments show that black bears can see color, unlike many mammals. With scientists still working to determine exactly how perceptive bear eyes are, it is difficult to compare bear eyesight with human eyesight.|$|E
25|$|His {{international}} {{career with}} Ghana dried up {{after he was}} sent off in the 1996 African Cup of Nations semi-final game against South Africa on 31 January 1996. The Black Stars finished fourth, after losing to Zambia in the 3rd Place play-off game without the suspended Lamptey. Lamptey did not play for Ghana again after they lost 8–2 to Brazil in São José do Rio Preto, 27 March 1996 in a Pre-1996 Summer Olympics friendly match. Many <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> that the numerous back and forth travels to Africa for International matches, stalled his young career at Club level. His career later went into a slump.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the Alliance for Natural Health (ANH) and two British trade {{associations}} introduced a legal {{challenge to the}} Food Supplements Directive referred to the European Court of Justice by the High Court in London. European judges found the restrictions to be legal but stated {{that there must be}} clear procedures to allow substances {{to be added to the}} permitted list based on scientific evidence. They also said that any refusal to add a product to the list must be open to challenge in the courts. Some media <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> that, as a result of this legislation, a black market will emerge, and that controls over ingredients and quality will vanish.|$|E

25|$|Since November 19, 2004, {{there have}} been over 2,800 {{incidents}} of lasers directed at aircraft within the United States. These concerns have led to an inquiry in the US Congress. Exposure to hand-held laser light under such circumstances may seem trivial given the brevity of exposure, the large distances involved and beam spread of up to several metres. However, laser exposure may create dangerous conditions such as flash blindness. If this occurs during a critical moment in aircraft operation, the aircraft may be endangered. In addition, some 18% to 35% of the population possess the autosomal dominant genetic trait, photic sneeze, that causes the affected individual to experience an involuntary sneezing fit when exposed to a sudden flash of light. Some <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> that the danger is greatly exaggerated, at least for small hand-held lasers.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of HIV presents an enormous challenge for researchers. And, because {{the virus has}} the ability to evade neutralizing antibodies produced by natural immunity, the standard vaccine strategy of mimicking natural infection to induce antibodies has so far proved impossible. Strengthening cell-mediated immunity offers another possible route to success. About 90% of candidate HIV vaccines in development use this approach. These products will not prevent infection. But it is hoped that they will lower viral load and therefore progression to AIDS and secondary transmissions. Some <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> that a vaccine to prevent HIV will never be achieved. Ultimately, even if an HIV preventive vaccine were to be developed, they are unlikely to be 100% effective. It has come to be realised that no single approach alone will be able to stem the spread of HIV. The future of HIV prevention will most likely involve combining new methods with existing approaches, such as condom use.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{other sources}} also reveal that Antonio Cárdenas (a.k.a. Tony Tormenta), brother of Osiel Cárdenas {{and one of}} the successors of the Gulf Cartel, was {{addicted}} to gambling, sex, and drugs, leading Los Zetas to consider his leadership {{as a threat to the}} organization. Other reports mention, however, that the rupture occurred due to a disagreement on who would take on the leadership of the cartel after the extradition of Cárdenas. The candidates of the Gulf Cartel were Antonio Ezekiel Cárdenas Guillén and Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, while Los Zetas wanted the leadership of their current head, Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano. Other sources, however, mention that the Gulf Cartel began looking to form a truce with their Sinaloa Cartel rivals, and Los Zetas did not want to recognize the treaty settlement, which led them to act independently and eventually break apart. On the other hand, other sources reveal that Los Zetas separated from the Gulf Cartel to form an alliance with Beltrán-Leyva Cartel, which led to conflict between them. Other sources mention that what initiated the conflict between them was when Samuel Flores Borrego, alias El Metro 3, lieutenant of the Gulf Cartel, killed Sergio Peña Mendoza, alias El Concorde 3, lieutenant of Los Zetas, due to a disagreement for the drug corridor of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, whom both protected. Soon after his death, Los Zetas demanded for the Gulf Cartel to hand over the killer, but they didn't, and <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> that triggered the war.|$|E

25|$|Jiang's time {{in power}} saw a marked {{increase}} in patronage appointments that spanned the military, the provinces, {{and the party}} apparatus. Patron-client relationships, rather than merit, became the primary factor in securing promotions, giving rise {{to the formation of}} internal factions based on personal loyalty. Prominent examples of factions identified by observers include Jiang's Shanghai clique, Zhou Yongkang's spheres of influence in the state oil and public security sectors, and the so-called Xishan Society of Shanxi officials – apart from these well-known cases, political factionalism seemed to be {{the order of the day}} down to the lowest levels of party bureaucracy. This meant that factional patrons often exerted massive influence through informal channels rather than through the offices they hold. Indeed, the refusal of Jiang Zemin to relinquish his influence years after he had formally left office was said to have caused much unease with the party rank-and-file. It also had unduly constrained the ability of his successor Hu Jintao to enact systemic reforms or to carry out a cohesive agenda. By reversing this part of Jiang's legacy, some <b>observers</b> <b>believe,</b> Xi would be better equipped to discipline and unite the party under a common agenda. Proponents of this view believe that the ultimate aim of the campaign is to strengthen the role of institutions and stamp out factionalism and networks of personal loyalty, thereby creating a more united and meritocratic organization and achieving greater efficiency for governance.|$|E
500|$|Most <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> {{that the}} reasons behind Goukouni's {{accepting}} the accord {{may be found in}} a mix of threats, intense pressure and the financial help promised by Gaddafi. Just before his visit to the Libyan capital, Goukouni had sent two of his commanders to Libya for consultations; at Tripoli, Goukouni learned from Gaddafi that they had been assassinated by [...] "Libyan dissidents", and that if Goukouni did not want to risk losing Libyan favour and lose power, he should accept the merger plan.|$|E
500|$|On 15 March, Bo was {{dismissed}} as Chongqing party chief and its related municipal posts, while temporarily retaining {{a seat on}} the Politburo. Due to the potentially destructive effects Bo's dismissal would have on party unity, party elders were consulted on the matter. The decision was reportedly made {{at a meeting of the}} Politburo Standing Committee on 7 March, during which security tsar Zhou Yongkang cast a lone dissenting vote. On 14 March, Bo was reprimanded by Premier Wen Jiabao during the Premier's annual press conference. Wen called the achievements of Chongqing [...] "significant," [...] but the result of [...] "multiple administrations," [...] i.e., not just Bo himself. Wen also made numerous allusions to the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution, an indirect rebuke of Bo's efforts to revive [...] "red culture". Addressing high-level political changes by a Premier to an open public forum was unprecedented. Political <b>observers</b> <b>believe</b> that Wen's remarks and Bo's downfall represented a consensus within the central leadership that Bo not only needed to shoulder the responsibility for the Wang Lijun scandal, but also represented a political triumph for the 'liberal reformer' wing of the Communist Party.|$|E
