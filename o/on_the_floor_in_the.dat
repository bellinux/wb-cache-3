There is a cut back to Noriko, now looking sad and pensive, almost in tears. Then there is a ten-second shot of the same vase, identical to the earlier one, as the music on the soundtrack swells, cuing the next scene (which takes place at the Ryōan-ji rock garden in Kyoto, the following day).|$|E
25|$|Sutherland {{declined}} {{to run for}} a second term and returned to Utah to campaign for election to the United States Senate. With the state legislature firmly under Republican control, the contest was an intra-party battle with the incumbent, Thomas Kearns. With the backing of Utah's other senator, Reed Smoot, Sutherland secured the unanimous support of the caucus in January 1905. Sutherland repaid his debt to Smoot in 1907 by speaking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate in defense of the senior senator during the climax of the Smoot hearings.|$|E
25|$|In 1959 Anderson left Seattle for good. He {{rented a}} house on the edge of La Conner, where he found {{inspiration}} from the vast skies and natural settings of the surrounding area. He gathered rocks and driftwood, which he composed around his rustic home in various assemblages. He began painting large works on roofing paper purchased from a local lumber company. Working with large sheets of paper <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio above his living room, Anderson used thinned oil paint and large brushes. The scale of the format enabled his brushstrokes to become expansive and expressive, while its texture gave unexpected complexities which he valued.|$|E

25|$|During {{the winter}} of the Phoney War {{at the start of}} the Second World War, Václav Robert Bozděch and Pierre Duval were sent on a {{reconnaissance}} mission over the German front in their twin-seater Potez 630 aircraft from the French airbase at Saint-Dizier. It was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed in no-mans land between the French and German lines. Bozděch helped the injured Duval to an abandoned farm house nearby, wherein the Czech airman discovered a German Shepherd puppy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen. While the dog was not initially fond of Duval, it accepted Bozděch. Concerned that the puppy was emaciated, he began to feed it chocolate, but it would not eat it until the rations were partially melted. Bozděch also found an old frying pan, filled it with snow and melted it so that the dog could drink it.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of the ticket hall is an office and service room for the station manager. Parts of the timber framing to the ticket windows are visible on its {{south-eastern}} wall. The floors are carpeted and the walls and ceiling are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. The windows are double-hung sashes with interior sills made with a terrazzo different from that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ticket hall. Adjacent to these rooms to the north is the semi-enclosed waiting area. Its floor has a terrazzo tile pattern to match that in the ticket hall. Its southern wall is face brick, while the remainder are plastered. On each side wall, there are two banks of the same double-hung sashes as in the office, with interior terrazzo sills. There is also some solid timber shelving here. The seating, which lines three walls, is made with timber slats and framing on shaped concrete legs. Two timber-framed and screen-infill doors, with matching surrounds provide entry from each side of the platform. At the northernmost end of the building are the toilets, which consist of two toilet cubicles and wash areas accessed by timber doors on the south-western and north-eastern sides. Metal framed louvres open off all three exterior walls at two metre sill height. Approximately one and a half metres from the north- eastern face of the building stands a cast iron drinking fountain. A number of timber and concrete seats, the same as those used in the northern waiting room, sit against the building on its long facades.|$|E

[...] However, several sportswriters criticized his decision, and some said that he should also have been penalized. It was also suggested that Karl was trying to humiliate Thomas due to the perception that Thomas had mistreated Larry Brown, a friend of Karl's. Karl was also blamed for putting his players {{in a position to}} start a fight.|$|E

Ric held the interviews open until Maddy was well enough, and today she's going to make sure she gets the job. Maddy's going to show them that they can throw anything at her and she'll cope...even after being stabbed. Linden wants Maddy to be careful and take things easy, as she nearly died, but Maddy wants {{to get back to work}}.|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} year at the Liverpool College of Art, Sutcliffe worked as a bin man on the Liverpool Corporation's waste {{collection}} trucks. Lennon was introduced to Sutcliffe by Bill Harry, a mutual friend, when all three were studying at the Liverpool College of Art. According to Lennon, Sutcliffe had a [...] "marvellous art portfolio" [...] and was a very talented painter {{who was one of the}} [...] "stars" [...] of the school. He helped Lennon to improve his artistic skills, and with others, worked with him when Lennon had to submit work for exams. Sutcliffe shared a flat with Murray at 9 Percy Street, Liverpool, before being evicted and moving to Hillary Mansions at 3 Gambier Terrace, where another art student lived, Margaret Chapman, who competed with Sutcliffe to be the best painter in class. The flat was opposite the new Anglican cathedral in the rundown area of Liverpool 8, with bare lightbulbs and a mattress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner. Lennon moved in with Sutcliffe in early 1960. (Paul McCartney later admitted that he was jealous of Sutcliffe's relationship with Lennon, as he had to take a [...] "back seat" [...] to Sutcliffe). Sutcliffe and his flatmates painted the rooms yellow and black, which their landlady did not appreciate. On another occasion the tenants, needing to keep warm, burned the flat's furniture.|$|E

2500|$|Consulting {{producer}} for A Nero Wolfe Mystery, Doyle was the show's only full-time writer — overseeing {{the work of}} freelance screenwriters and writing 11 of the teleplays herself.

Frequently I end up moving words — tenderly and respectfully — but retaining as much of the language as possible. I feel a great belief in Rex Stout.

2500|$|Christmas Eve being a fast day, {{the dinner}} is {{prepared}} {{in accordance with}} that, but it is copious and diverse in foods. Besides a round unleavened loaf of bread called badnjački kolač, and salt, which are necessary, this meal may comprise roast fish, cooked beans, sauerkraut, noodles with ground walnuts, honey, and wine. It used to be served in some villages on a sack filled with straw, with the family seated around it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> north Dalmatian region of Bukovica, a part of food that remained after the dinner used {{to be put on}} a potsherd, and taken to the rubbish heap.

2500|$|The {{first single}} was the ballad [...] "Where Are We Now?", a track which Visconti {{described}} as [...] "the only track {{on the album}} that goes this much inward for him". Visconti suggested that Bowie chose [...] "Where Are We Now?" [...] as the opening single because [...] "people {{had to deal with}} the shock that he was back [...] " [...] and that the introspective nature of the song made it an appropriate choice. Opening lyrics for [...] "Where Are We Now" [...] reflectively recall the name of a train station (plaza) and a street in west Berlin, where Bowie once lived. A video accompanying the single includes props such as a dismantled photo frame lying discarded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening shot, a large ear in the background, and a two-headed soft doll with the torn faces of Bowie and a voiceless counterpart [...] "pasted" [...] onto it in.
