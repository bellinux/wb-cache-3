5|$|Being highly {{arboreal}} and {{the most}} frugivorous of the lemurs, they thrive only in primary forest with large fruiting trees, where they {{spend most of their}} time in the upper canopy.

5|$|The red-winged fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, {{with a pair}} or small group of birds maintaining and defending a territory year-round.

5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction <b>of</b> <b>tall</b> buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.|$|E
5|$|Below Colthrop Lock in Thatcham {{the river}} leaves behind the {{built-up}} area of Newbury and runs in generally rural surroundings. It {{passes through the}} Woolhampton Reed Bed, another SSSI which consists of dense reed bed with smaller areas <b>of</b> <b>tall</b> fen vegetation and carr woodland. It is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting passerine bird populations, which include several uncommon species such as reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), a species that in Britain nests almost exclusively in this habitat.|$|E
5|$|By 10:00 the 2/4th Somerset Light Infantry, 1/5th Devonshire Regiment, 2/5th Hampshire Regiment, 1/4th Wiltshire Regiment, 2/3rd and 3/3rd Gurkha Rifles (from the 232nd and the 233rd Brigades, 75th Division) were {{advancing}} {{along the}} main road. They occupied the undefended villages <b>of</b> <b>Tall</b> al-Turmus, Qastina and Yazur. The 52nd (Lowland) Division had already occupied Bashshit. The 75th Division proceeded to attack Mesmiye on a lower and southward extension of the ridge on which Qatra and el Mughar were situated with the 52nd (Lowland) Division attacking directly towards these two villages. But these attacks were held up by very strong Ottoman defences.|$|E

5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations <b>of</b> <b>tall</b> buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, several {{portions}} of Downtown Brooklyn were rezoned to promote more commercial, residential, and retail development. This rezoning allowed for greater density of development, and {{combined with an}} increased demand for housing, these areas experienced a boom in the construction <b>of</b> <b>tall</b> buildings. In addition to Downtown Brooklyn, high-rise buildings are also concentrated in the Fort Greene and Williamsburg neighborhoods, although other Brooklyn neighborhoods have significant numbers of high-rises.|$|E

5|$|The Broadmead {{shopping}} centre was redeveloped {{in the early}} years of the century, involving the demolition of one the city's tallest mid-century towers, Tollgate House, in the construction of Cabot Circus. The former Bristol and West Tower was reworked into a glass skyscraper with glass panels in place of its concrete outer cladding. In 2005, the city council undertook extensive consultations about the future <b>of</b> <b>tall</b> buildings in Bristol, and identified support for new tall buildings so long as they are well designed, sustainable, distinctive and 'fit' into the existing urban landscape.|$|E

Capon Chapel is landscaped with boxwoods on its north and south sides, a single holly on its east side, and forsythias along its west side. The Capon Chapel property consists of the church structure (c. 1852), and its associated cemetery, which is enclosed partly by the historic wrought iron fence and partly by a chain link fence. A flagpole stands {{at the center of}} the cemetery's eastern perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's output {{included}} new churches, restoring and renovating existing churches, church furnishings, {{new houses}} and alterations to existing houses, {{and a variety}} of other buildings, including shops, banks, offices, schools, memorials and public buildings. His architectural styles were eclectic. Douglas worked during the period of the Gothic Revival, and many of his works incorporate elements of the English Gothic style. He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French, German and Dutch architecture. However he is probably best remembered for his incorporation of vernacular elements in his buildings, in particular half-timbering, influenced by the black-and-white revival in Chester. Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging, pargeting, and the use of decorative brick in diapering and the design <b>of</b> <b>tall</b> chimney stacks. Of particular importance is Douglas's use of joinery and highly detailed wood carving.|$|E

5|$|During the Classic period (c. AD 250-900) {{the royal}} dynasty of Tikal {{developed}} the complex into a royal necropolis, with each successive ruler superimposing new temples over earlier structures. Around AD 250, the pre-existing architecture was demolished {{and a new}} basal platform was built, supporting four corbel-vaulted structures. Around AD 400 the complex was expanded southwards from its original basal platform {{with the addition of}} a row <b>of</b> <b>tall</b> pyramids that divided the original architecture from Tikal's main plaza. Towards the end of the 7th century, King Jasaw Chan K'awiil I ordered the construction of a new version Temple 33, possibly to house the remains of Nuun Ujol Chaak, his father. This new building completely blocked the entrance to the North Acropolis, formerly ending its role as the preferred burial ground of Tikal's kings. Around AD 734 king Jasaw Chan K'awiil was entombed in Temple I on the east side of the plaza, ending the tradition of interring rulers within the North Acropolis.|$|E
5|$|During their RAAF service, the Chinooks also {{undertook}} {{a range of}} non-military tasks. The helicopters frequently formed part of the Australian Defence Force's response to natural disasters, including by delivering food for people and livestock cut off by floods. They were also used for civilian construction tasks such as emplacing lighthouses and carrying air conditioning plants to the top <b>of</b> <b>tall</b> buildings. On two occasions Chinooks supported Queensland Police Service drug eradication efforts in remote {{parts of the state}} by transporting fuel for RAAF Iroquois helicopters and carrying seized narcotics. In August 1981, two CH-47s lifted containers from the cargo ship Waigani Express to enable the vessel to be refloated after it ran aground in the Torres Strait. A similar operation was undertaken to free the Anro Asia when it ran aground near Caloundra, Queensland, in November the same year. Another unusual task was conducted in December 1981 when a Chinook transported two bulldozers onto a grounded iron ore carrier near Port Hedland, Western Australia, so that they could be used to reposition the ship's load.|$|E
5|$|Godley {{continued}} as divisional commander {{for most of}} the campaign at Gallipoli. <b>Of</b> <b>tall</b> stature, he made constant tours of the front line amidst jokes that the communication trenches needed to be dug deeply to allow for his height. On one visit to Quinn's Post on 7 May, he personally directed troop deployments to counter a potential Turkish counterattack. Despite his inspections, his reputation amongst the rank and file of the division did not improve. Nor was his co-ordination of offensive operations sound; during the August offensive, his lack of oversight allowed one of his brigade commanders, Brigadier General Francis Johnston, a British Army officer on secondment to the NZEF, to vacillate over deployment of reinforcements. On the morning of 8 August, the Wellington Infantry Battalion was in tenuous possession of Chunuk Bair but required support to consolidate its position. Johnstone did not order his reinforcements forward until later that day. Crucial momentum was lost and Chunuk Bair was later recaptured by the Turks.|$|E
