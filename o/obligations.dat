40|$|Divine voluntarism (Divine command theory) is {{a series}} of {{theories}} that claim that God is prior to moral <b>obligation</b> and that moral <b>obligation</b> is determined by God's will.

Also, while it avoids these undesirable implications, divine voluntarism must not imply that God is, in some way, restricted by moral <b>obligation</b> which exists independently of Him. Divine voluntarism can admit God's sovereignty over moral <b>obligation</b> and avoid making moral <b>obligation</b> arbitrary or God's goodness trivial by admitting various aspects of God's will.

40|$|The City of Detroit's {{filing for}} {{municipal}} bankruptcy in July, 2013, {{has added to}} a continuing controversy of whether general <b>obligation</b> bondholders have a secured lien. The City of Detroit claimed its general <b>obligation</b> bondholders {{did not have a}} fully secured lien because the law of the state of Michigan did not create a statutory lien. Without the creation of a lien by state law, during the insolvency or bankruptcy of municipalities, general <b>obligation</b> bondholders will potentially have a mere promise to pay versus a binding <b>obligation</b> to pay, and therefore, will not have a secured lien. Treating otherwise secured general <b>obligation</b> bonds as unsecured will create more risk for investors and increase the cost of borrowing for cities. This article discusses the treatment of general <b>obligation</b> bonds in recent municipal bankruptcies; identifies the states that create a binding <b>obligation</b> to pay general <b>obligation</b> bondholders; describes problems of not treating general <b>obligation</b> bonds as secured; and proposes that states create clear laws that grant statutory liens for general <b>obligation</b> bondholders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{the large}} {{literature}} analysing {{factors related to}} depression, several factors such as caregiving <b>obligation</b> and the interrelationships among the different variables relating to depression have been little studied. The current study aimed to analyse the effect of caregiving <b>obligation</b> (beliefs regarding <b>obligation</b> and social pressure) on depression, and the mediating effects of perceived burden {{on the relationship between}} stressors and depression, in primary caregivers of older relatives. Methods Cross-sectional study design. A probabilistic sample of caregivers from Spain (N[*]=[*] 200) was used. The data collection was conducted in 2013 through structured interviews in the caregivers’ homes. The measures included sense of <b>obligation</b> for caregiving, perceived burden, stressors and depression. Results Depression had a direct and positive association with perceived burden, behavioural problems, and social pressure, and it was indirectly related through perceived burden to behavioural problems, independence for the activities of daily living and beliefs of <b>obligation.</b> Conclusions Our results support the multidimensional concept of <b>obligation,</b> suggesting the existence of both an external <b>obligation</b> (social pressure) and an internal <b>obligation</b> (beliefs of obligation); (b) our findings support the hypothesis that external <b>obligation</b> is related to negative caregiving consequences, while internal <b>obligation</b> protects from these consequences; and (c) our findings support the partial mediation of stressors on depression by perceived burden. The relevance of the research to clinical practice includes the importance of understanding the perceived <b>obligation</b> of caregiving related to both internal and external sources of <b>obligation...</b>|$|R
