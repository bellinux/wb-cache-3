5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After the closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E

5|$|A second project, {{the full}} {{duplication}} of the Cronulla branch line, {{was completed in}} 2010.

5|$|Although {{work had}} begun on the Millfields station, {{including}} {{the completion of}} the station hotel (now the Unicorn pub), the population of Chesham were unhappy at the station being built such a distance from the town. With the extension to meet the LNWR abandoned the railway no longer needed to curve away from the town, and a public subscription raised £2,000 fund a 71-chain (1,562-yd; 1,428m) extension to a site near the town centre. Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> to Chesham began in late 1887.|$|E
5|$|Following the Second World War, service levels dropped {{dramatically}} along the Portishead branch. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, services at Parson Street {{came under the}} auspices of the Western Region of British Railways, and by the time the branch was closed to passengers in 1964, there were only six trains each weekday, and none on Sundays. With the closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch,</b> Parson Street lost its interchange status, and in January 1971 the station buildings were demolished. Some special services did continue along the branch to , carrying fans to Bristol City FC games at the nearby Ashton Gate Stadium. These ceased in 1977, and Parson Street became the arrival and departure point for these trains.|$|E

5|$|In 1861 the London and North Western Railway revived powers {{granted to}} the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to build a railway from Eccles to Wigan through the town. Tyldesley railway station was {{to the east of}} the {{junction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> to Kenyon Junction on the Liverpool to Manchester Line via Leigh and Pennington. The Earl of Ellesmere cut the first sod at Worsley on 11September 1861 and the line opened to traffic on 1September 1864.

5|$|In 1989 the centenary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> saw {{a revival}} of {{interest}} in the line. Over the weekends of 1–2 and 8–9 July special services were run between Watford and Chesham, using two preserved Metropolitan Railway steam locomotives and a former MR electric locomotive. The service was a great success, with over 9,000 people travelling on the trains and large numbers of people travelling to the area to watch the trains. The success prompted LT to repeat the Steam on the Met event annually until 2000, although often running to Amersham rather than Chesham.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the cemetery's operation, the {{locomotives}} hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down the branch into the cemetery, as it would leave the engine at the wrong end of the train for the return journey. Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled from the engine. A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the branch line the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> and onto the main line.|$|E

5|$|On September13, 1966, NY111 was realigned {{south of}} Hauppauge {{to follow a}} {{slightly}} more westerly alignment to the hamlet of Islip along Joshua's Path and Islip Avenue, two streets that ran parallel to the route's original path on Carleton Avenue and Wheeler Road. Ownership and maintenance of NY111's former routing was transferred to Suffolk County, which redesignated the road as CR17. The ultimately cancelled eastern extension of the Northern State Parkway would have crossed NY111 just south of Village <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> at a point north of Mount Pleasant Road. An interchange between the parkway and NY111 was planned at that location.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} ceratopsians, but closer to Triceratops than Yinlong. Once in its own family, Psittacosauridae, with other genera like Hongshanosaurus, it is now considered to be senior synonym of the latter and an early offshoot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> that led to more derived forms. The genera closely related to Psittacosaurus are all from Asia, with the exception of Aquilops, from North America. The first species was either P. lujiatunensis or closely related, and it may have given rise to later forms of Psittacosaurus.|$|E

This {{is the only}} branch of service with an emblem that does not invoke the rayed Imperial Standard. However, the branch does have an ensign to fly on bases and during parades. The ensign was created in 1972, which was the third used by the JASDF since its creation. The ensign contains the emblem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> centered on a blue background.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{passes the}} American Real Estate School and a campus of Empire State College before {{intersecting}} NY454 (Veterans Highway). Not far from NY454, NY111 has a short concurrency with CR76 (Townline Road) along the Islip–Smithtown {{and then the}} names changes to Hauppauge Road town line before fully crossing into Smithtown. After forking from CR76, NY111 continues northeast through the hamlet of Hauppauge, crossing NY347 (Smithtown Bypass) at-grade as it runs across another residential stretch. The route soon enters Village <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Branch,</b> where it bends northward into a large commercial area {{at the center of}} the community. Here, NY111 intersects with East Main Street, which enters the junction from the west as NY25 and NY25A.

Gloeocystidia (thin-walled cystidia with refractive, frequently granular contents) are common; they measure 50–85 by 6.5–8.5µm, and are club-shaped (sometimes elongated), thin-walled, and often {{have one or two}} lobes with rounded tips. Containing foamy and pale yellow contents, they are a refractive yellow color under phase contrast. Initially they are erect but they soon fall under their own weight to lie on the agar surface.
