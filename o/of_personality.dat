5|$|After {{years of}} declining health, Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982 and was quickly succeeded in his post as General Secretary by Yuri Andropov. Andropov only held {{the office of}} General Secretary for {{less than two years}} until his 1984 death. Brezhnev had fostered a cult <b>of</b> <b>personality,</b> {{although}} not nearly to the same degree as Stalin. Mikhail Gorbachev, who would lead the USSR from 1985 to 1991, denounced his legacy and drove the process of liberalisation of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, {{he had little}} {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great charisma and force <b>of</b> <b>personality,</b> characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.|$|E

5|$|Cho {{offered some}} of the {{earliest}} contributions to Kim Il-sung's cult <b>of</b> <b>personality.</b> His most famous work is Mt. Paektu (1947), a lyrical epic praising Kim Il-sung's guerrilla activities and promoting him as a suitable leader for the new North Korean state. Other notable works by Cho include , a seemingly non-political love poem which was later adapted as a popular song that is known in both North and South Korea.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Han {{survived a}} number of purges that were caused by {{factional}} strife within the Workers' Party. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered {{some of the earliest}} known contributions to the cult <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> of Kim Il-sung. His influence is felt in North Korea even today, though his name has been forgotten from official histories. Han's best known work, the anti-American novella Jackals, however, has been invoked in the 2000s.|$|E

5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} a number <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in}} the executive dining room by sending them a blue chip that had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad. Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth <b>of</b> <b>personality,</b> which has been {{compared with that of}} the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E

5|$|On 9 October 1959, Hordern {{made his}} debut on Broadway at the Cort Theatre in Marcel Aymé's comedy Moonbirds, {{alongside}} the comedian Wally Cox.

Little was offered {{in the way of}} praise, although critics singled out Hordern's performance in particular as being good. He was unsure why the play failed, and attributed it to clashes <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> between cast and management.|$|E
5|$|After Joseph Stalin's death, {{the process}} of destalinization {{prompted}} debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire Eastern Bloc. Nikita Khrushchev's speech On the Personality Cult and its Consequences had wide implications outside the Soviet Union and in other communist countries. In Poland, {{in addition to the}} criticism of the cult <b>of</b> <b>personality,</b> popular topics of debate centered on the right to steer a more independent course of 'local, national socialism' instead of following the Soviet model down to every little detail; such views were seen in discussion and critique by many Polish United Workers' Party members of Stalin's execution of older Polish communists from Communist Party of Poland during the Great Purge.|$|E

5|$|After much delay, the new Massachusetts Constitution {{finally went}} into effect in October 1780. To no one's surprise, Hancock was elected Governor of Massachusetts in a landslide, garnering over 90% of the vote. In the absence of formal party politics, the contest was one <b>of</b> <b>personality,</b> popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably {{patriotic}} given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. James Bowdoin, his principal opponent, was cast by Hancock's supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor health) to serve in the First Continental Congress. Bowdoin's supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his rule, the government was divided between two PDPA factions: the Khalqists (which Taraki was the leader of), the majority, and the Parchamites, the minority. In 1978, shortly after his rule began, Taraki started a purge of the government and party which led to several high-ranking Parchamite members being sent into de facto exile by being assigned to serve overseas as ambassadors. His reign was marked by a cult <b>of</b> <b>personality</b> centered on himself that had been cultivated by Amin. His relationship with Amin turned sour during his rule, ultimately resulting in Taraki's overthrow on 14 September 1979 and subsequent murder on 8 or 9 October, upon Amin's orders.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Chinese and North Koreans were {{exhausted}} by the war and were prepared to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized, totalitarian dictatorship – which continues to date – according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult <b>of</b> <b>personality.</b> In the South, the American-backed strongman Syngman Rhee ran a significantly less brutal but deeply corrupt and authoritarian regime. After Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea fell within a year under a period of military rule that lasted until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Personality is an {{important}} characteristic of individual variability which in some way restricts the full behavioural flexibility. Generally, it is not known, {{what is the relationship}} between environmental variability and variability in cognitive abilities of animals? More specifically, how this relationship impacts on the evolution of behavioural plasticity and the expression <b>of</b> animal <b>personality.</b> It is assumed that there is a correlation between the type <b>of</b> <b>personalities</b> and cognitive abilities but mutual causal relationship of this interaction is not yet fully understood. Proactive types <b>of</b> <b>personalities</b> in cognitive tests seem to be neophilic but slower in adapting to changes in the environment or in the analysing of signals with the changed meaning (reversal learning). On the contrary, reactive types <b>of</b> <b>personalities</b> are probably neophobic, they less risk and they are more flexible. However, it is questionable whether these behavioural types have an influence on cognitive abilities and how this influence manifests itself specifically to them. In this thesis, we will focus on whether and how different types <b>of</b> <b>personalities</b> are reflected in these cognitive abilities for each species and what is the methodology for testing these dependencies.
