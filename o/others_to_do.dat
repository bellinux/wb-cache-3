5|$|Such reenactment pantomimes became {{hugely popular}} and spread {{throughout}} Christendom. Within {{a hundred years}} every church in Italy was {{expected to have a}} nativity scene at Christmastime. Eventually, statues replaced human and animal participants, and static scenes grew to elaborate affairs with richly robed figurines placed in intricate landscape settings. Charles III, King of the Two Sicilies, collected such elaborate scenes, and his enthusiasm encouraged <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same.|$|E
5|$|The Landlord, {{the leader}} of Thongs and Octopus, is played by Michael Hui, a Hong Kong Film Award-winning comedic actor who starred in various box office hits from 1970s to 1990s before emigrating to Canada shortly before the {{handover}} of Hong Kong. Hui was chosen for the part {{because he is the}} ideal actor to play a character who persuades <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> bad things. The producers had originally intended Hui to fight along with Chan and Koo, however, it was eventually decided that Hui would simply act as the brains of the gang.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

25|$|With {{their new}} manager and signings, Hearts {{got off to}} a {{tremendous}} start in the 200506 season. The team won their first eight league matches, equaling a club record set in 1914. Romanov increased his shareholding in Hearts to 55.5% on 21 October 2005, and offered to buy the rest of the shares. Chairman George Foulkes sold his shares to Romanov and encouraged <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> likewise. Romanov eventually increased his majority share in Hearts to 82%.|$|E
25|$|Others have conquered and ruled; we alone conquer for conquest's {{sake and}} Dominate {{for no other}} purpose than Domination itself; the name we half-consciously chose for our state is no accident.

25|$|Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or {{the alien}} {{equivalent}} of it—is {{the reason for}} any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely {{for them to be}} the first ones to make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the first}} Dizzy game that was not fully {{designed}} and coded by the Oliver Twins, the creators of Dizzy. After Fantasy World Dizzy they had started working more closely with Codemasters, developing games for the American market where the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was quickly capturing a large audience. In order to continue the Dizzy series, which remained popular in Codemasters' home market, the Twins had to bring in <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{the majority of the}} design and coding. This gave them time to concentrate on their other projects. The coding of Magicland Dizzy was contracted out to Big Red Software.|$|E
25|$|Beethoven's {{business}} dealings with publishers {{also began to}} improve in 1802 when his brother Kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume {{a larger role in}} the management of his affairs. In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of Beethoven's earlier unpublished works, and encouraged Beethoven (against the latter's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations. Beethoven acceded to these requests, as he could not prevent publishers from hiring <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> similar arrangements of his works.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Phil was calmer than Grant {{but both}} {{brothers}} {{had a sense}} of physical danger, displaying stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Phil was originally depicted as the thinker and the more streetwise of the pair, often bailing his more spontaneous brother out of trouble, although later plotlines drove the character down a darker, more destructive route. Phil can be very violent, but unlike Grant, he occasionally showed restraint when dealing with various enemies encountered – exacting revenge over time, using mind games or getting <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his dirty work, amongst other things.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} Catherine Mattice and Brian Spitzberg at San Diego State University, USA, {{found that}} narcissism revealed {{a positive relationship}} with bullying. Narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics (such as withholding information that affects others' performance, ignoring others, spreading gossip, constantly reminding others of mistakes, ordering <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> work below their competence level, and excessively monitoring others' work) rather than direct tactics (such as making threats, shouting, persistently criticizing, or making false allegations). The research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully, and that to some extent, they are left with feelings of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs.|$|E
25|$|Although 5 to 30% of South Koreans {{have eaten}} dog meat {{at least once}} in their lifetime, only a small {{percentage}} of the population eats it regularly. There is a large group of Korean people that are against the practice of eating dog meat. There is also a large population of people in South Korea that do not eat or enjoy the meat, but do feel strongly that it is the right of <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. There is a smaller group of pro-dog cuisine people in South Korea who want to popularize the consumption of dog in Korea and the rest of the world, considering it to be part of the traditional culture of Korea with a long history worth preserving.|$|E
25|$|Charlemagne’s son, Louis the Pious, {{is rarely}} shown {{engaging}} in battle by the annalists, but rather directs <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, or negotiates for peace. The contrast between Louis {{and his father}} and grandfather is clear. While the past kings were unshakeable figures, depicted as the better of their foes even in defeat by the revised edition, the annalists’ Louis is a smaller man who invests the power of the military in others, not unlike the annals’ earlier depiction of the Merovingian kings. Miracles aid Charlemagne and his men, and the grace of God leads him to victory; mostly ill portents surround Louis, such as an omen in the stars supposedly foretelling his army’s defeat at the hands of Count Aizo, and the sudden collapse of a wooden arcade atop him in 817.|$|E

25|$|Neither caliph {{participated in}} the direct {{military}} operations of the war. In Al-Musta'in's case, he was generally content to leave the responsibility of conducting the war effort to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah. As commander, Muhammad opted for an overall defensive strategy. Relying on his position in Baghdad, {{he was reluctant to}} engage in any sort of offensive operations outside the city and its surrounding districts, even when he was advised by <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. While he did make an effort to securing the nearby towns that controlled access to the city, {{there is no mention of}} any attempt to attack Samarra. By staying within Baghdad and keeping the city's supply routes open, while at the same time cutting off foodstuffs and tax receipts meant for Samarra, Muhammad likely believed that he could outlast al-Mu'tazz's armies.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was to acquire a journal to spread their ideas. This was the weekly Reader, which they bought, revamped and redirected. Huxley had already become {{part-owner}} of the Natural History Review bolstered by the support of Lubbock, Rolleston, Busk and Carpenter (X-clubbers and satellites). The journal was switched to pro-Darwinian lines and relaunched in January 1861. After a stream of good articles the NHR failed after four years; but it had helped at a critical time for the establishment of evolution. The Reader also failed, despite its broader appeal which included art and literature as well as science. The periodical market was quite crowded at the time, but most probably the critical factor was Huxley's time; he was simply over-committed, and could not afford to hire full-time editors. This occurred often in his life: Huxley took on too many ventures, and was not so astute as Darwin at getting <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> work for him.|$|E
25|$|Darras {{formally}} enlisted as an esquire in the retinue of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel in 1387. Among <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, {{and probably}} thereby form {{a political and}} personal bond with Arundel, was Thomas Whitton, a long-term associate of Darras. At this point Arundel {{was one of the}} Lords Appellant, a leader of the opposition to Richard II's favourites and his policy of peace with France. Darras served with him in a naval campaign against the French, which culminated in a significant victory off Margate. As a client of the earl, and in association with two other members of his affinity, John Burley and Fulk Sprenghose, Darras was made trustee of estates belonging to Richard, 4th Lord Talbot, who was married to Arundel's niece, Ankaret le Strange of Blackmere. In 1393 he represented his county in the parliament that began on 20 January and lasted about three weeks. His fellow MP was Sir William Hugford, who was closely associated with John le Strange, 6th Baron Strange of Knockin: although powerful, the 11th Earl of Arundel seems to have been much happier to share influence than was to prove the case with his son.|$|E
