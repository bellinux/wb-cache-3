While Mays (who had argued the case {{previously}} before the U.S. and Virginia Supreme Courts) supervised the brief and attended the <b>oral</b> arguments (<b>Robert</b> L.

Hall discusses her own educational background and introduction to DARE as well as the internal structure of the project throughout its decades-long history, including its many funding challenges and technological advancements.

5000|$|On July 1, 2012, CBS News, citing unnamed sources {{within the}} Court, said {{that over the}} course of {{internal}} deliberations Roberts changed his position from striking down the mandate to upholding it. The article, written by journalist Jan Crawford, reported that during the Court's private conference immediately after the <b>oral</b> arguments, <b>Roberts</b> was inclined to strike down the mandate but, in disagreement with the other four conservative justices, was not certain this required striking down the law in its entirety. News articles in May 2012 that warned of potential [...] "damage to the court—and to Roberts' reputation—if the court were to strike down the mandate" [...] increased the external pressure on Roberts, who [...] "is keenly aware of his leadership role on the court and is sensitive to how the court is perceived by the public", and pays more attention to media coverage of the Court than some of his colleagues. It was around this time that Roberts decided to uphold the law. One of the conservative justices reportedly pressed Roberts to explain why he had changed his view on the mandate, but was [...] "unsatisfied with the response".|$|R

After Rolle left LSU, he was courted by Division I schools Wyoming, Marshall, <b>Oral</b> <b>Roberts,</b> Delaware, Louisiana Tech, and South Florida.

50|$|Chippewa notation: Frank Linderman's papers {{indicate}} Chief Rocky Boy died at Ft. Assiniboine April 18, 1916; {{he was not}} in Babb at {{the time}} of death. Media reports of the day also indicate Rocky Boy died in Ft. Assiniboine. Chippewa <b>oral</b> historians, (namely <b>Robert</b> Gopher, a full-blood Blackfeet tribal member,states a different story) the history on the Chippewa side states: Rocky Boy was assassinated by poison roots administered by rival Cree in the area who were anxious to settle there. Little Bear was a known user of a specific poison, (oral traditions of Saskatchewan Cree), a root that he used to dispatch his political rivals. If this is the case, this would mean there was great uncertainty hanging over Cree fate. Rocky Boy's last words relayed to Linderman seem to also indicate Rocky Boy did not intend to situate Cree on the newly established reservation.|$|R
40|$|We {{present in}} this {{manuscript}} {{for the first}} time the electrochemical oxidation of acetyl salicylic acid and its voltammetric sensing in real samples at a sensitive edge plane pyrolitic graphite electrode (EPPGE) modified with graphene. The electrochemical response of the sensor was improved compared to edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrode and displayed an excellent analytical performance for the detection of acetyl salicylic acid. These characteristics were attributed to the high acetyl salicylic acid loading capacity on the electrode surface and the outstanding electric conductivity of graphene. A linear response was obtained over a range of acetyl salicylic acid concentrations from 10 nM to 100 nM into a pH 4 buffer solution (N defined as the sample size N = 7) with a detection limit of 3 nM based on (3 -s/slope). The methodology is shown to be useful for quantifying low levels of acetyl salicylic acid in a buffer solution. The protocol is also shown to be applicable for the sensing of acetyl salicylic acid in human oral fluid samples. A linear response was obtained from 30 nM to 150 nM into a human oral fluid solution (N = 7) with a detection limit of 17. 3 nM. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) using EPPG modify with graphene has been employed in the proposed method for the determination of ASA in drug preparations and human <b>oral</b> fluid. <b>Robert</b> Gordon University, Scottish Sensor Systems Centre, IDEAS research institute, Center of Excellence for Innovation in Chemistry...|$|R
