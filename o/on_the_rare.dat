5|$|Among scientists, he {{is perhaps}} best known for his work on the {{ligament}} which bears his name. His work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> and vestigial Ligament of Struthers {{came to the attention of}} Charles Darwin, who used it in his Descent of Man to help argue the case that man and other mammals shared a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} publishes {{an annual}} report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> birds occurring each year, in British Birds.

5|$|Frank Spedding, {{celebrated for}} his {{development}} of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related {{the story of how}} he was lecturing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman {{had turned out to be}} Herbert Newby McCoy, who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known to kill deer, {{especially}} in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the Everglades showed a large majority of kills (33 of 39) were fawns, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken. It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> occasions a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.|$|E

25|$|As {{fluoroquinolone}} {{is one of}} the few antibiotics widely {{effective against}} P. aeruginosa, in some hospitals, its use is severely restricted to avoid the development of resistant strains. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> occasions where infection is superficial and limited (for example, ear infections or nail infections), topical gentamicin or colistin may be used.|$|E
25|$|Since World War II Maltese {{political}} culture has {{developed into a}} two-party system dominated by the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party. Although other political parties have presented candidates and, in some cases, elected MPs, in most cases these were splinter groups of the main parties and, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> occasions when they were successful, this success was short-lived.|$|E
25|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> {{occasions}} that stress {{needed to be}} specified, as in explanatory material or with proper names, Zamenhof used an acute accent.

5000|$|There was massive {{attention}} to the incident in the secular and religious press. Daniel Callaghan wrote in the June 26 Commonweal: [...] "While it is open to doubt whether ‘removal’ of a Cardinal {{is the way to}} solve such problems, it is a shame that a priest should feel compelled to castigate his Ordinary in public. Only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rarest</b> of occasions should he actually do so. I think Los Angeles, 1964, is one of those occasions." ...|$|R

25|$|In general, an O is very {{unlikely}} to experience {{changes in its}} ownership, since it is often {{a significant source of}} revenue for its owner; and since its owner is also its parent network, the chances for an O to ever switch networks are also rather low – unless the station is, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> chance, sold to another network.|$|E
25|$|Mount Binuluan {{is usually}} covered in cloud or mist and so {{photographs}} could {{be difficult to}} obtain. The village of Bangtitan in Upper Uma in Lubuagan is a good vantage point for views and photography of the mountain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> occasions when the primary peak is not mist-enshrouded. It is not known if Binuluan itself has ever been climbed as access to the site is very difficult. The terrain is rugged and undeveloped.|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} most {{commonly}} seen at dusk, foraging around street lamps or over golf courses. Lasiurus intermedius prefers foraging in open areas, typically 5–7 meters (17–23 feet) {{above the ground}} usually in areas with minimal shrubs and scattered clumps of trees, above grassy regions (such as airports, pastures, golf courses, lake edges), and along forest edge. The majority of their diet is composed of true bugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, leafhoppers, flying ants, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> occasion, damselflies and dragonflies.|$|E

5000|$|Kanishka's copper coinage {{which came}} into the scene during 100-200 CE was of two types: one had the usual [...] "standing king" [...] obverse, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rarer</b> second type <b>the</b> king {{is sitting on a}} throne. At about the same time there was Huvishka's copper coinage which was more varied; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reverse, as <b>on</b> Kanishka's copper, there was always one of <b>the</b> {{numerous}} deities; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> obverse the king was portrayed (1) riding on an elephant, or (2) reclining on a couch, or (3) seated cross-legged, or (4) seated with arms raised.|$|R

25|$|Ridgway {{was born}} in Stockport, Cheshire, England on 10 August 1923. As a county cricketer, Ridgway, {{although}} not appearing a likely successful pace bowler because of his slight build, was the mainstay of Kent's opening attack for a decade after World War II, except <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> occasions that Jack Martin could get away from business. Ridgway did not play regularly in 1946, but the following year he jumped into prominence with 12 for 86 on a rain-affected pitch against Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|On the Royalist side, the {{campaign}} of 1645 opened in the west, where Charles II, the young prince of Wales was sent with Hyde (later, Earl of Clarendon), Hopton, and others as his advisers. General (Lord) Goring, however, now {{in command of the}} Royalist field forces in this quarter, was truculent, insubordinate and dissolute. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> occasions when he did his duty, however, he did display a certain degree of skill and leadership, and the influence of the prince's counsellors was but small.|$|E
25|$|The New York parade {{is moved}} to the {{previous}} Saturday (16 March) in years where 17 March is a Sunday. The event also has been moved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> occasions when, due to Easter's falling on a very early date, 17 March would land in Holy Week. This same scenario arose again in 2008, when Easter fell on 23 March, but the festivities occurred on their normal date and were enjoyed by {{a record number of}} viewers. In many other American cities (such as Philadelphia), the parade is always held on the Sunday before 17 March, regardless of the liturgical calendar.|$|E

25|$|For state ceremonies, the dignitaries {{would enter}} through the Kenreimon (建礼門), {{which has a}} cypress-wood roof, and is {{supported}} by four unpainted wooden pillars. This gate would have been used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> occasions of the emperor welcoming a foreign diplomat or dignitary, {{as well as for}} many other important state ceremonies. Passing through the Kenreimon, the inner gate Jomeimon would appear, which is painted in vermilion and roofed in tile. This leads to the Shishin-den, which is the Hall for State Ceremonies. The Gekkamon is a smaller gate {{on the west side of}} the main courtyard.|$|E
25|$|As a centre-back, Maldini was {{renowned for}} his marking, {{awareness}} {{and ability to}} anticipate a threat from the opposition. Despite being a precise tackler and an imposing defensive presence, he often avoided committing to challenges when he deemed them unnecessary, preferring to restrict the offensive play of his opponents through his positioning and marking. Maldini was also known for his aerial ability, strength, tackling and man-marking, {{as well as his}} tactical knowledge. His passing range and ability to begin plays from the backline also allowed him to advance into the midfield and excel in the sweeper or libero position, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> occasion that he was deployed in this role.|$|E
25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> occasions that they do manage to find something to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
