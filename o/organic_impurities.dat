25|$|One major {{industrial}} application involves use of activated carbon {{in the metal}} finishing field. It is very widely employed for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is a main purification technique for removing <b>organic</b> <b>impurities</b> from bright nickel plating solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect the plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level.|$|E
2500|$|Concrete is {{a mixture}} of coarse (stone or brick chips) and fine (generally sand or crushed stone) {{aggregates}} with a paste of binder material (usually Portland cement) and water.

2500|$|The high {{plasticization}} {{temperature of}} PET {{in the range}} of [...] is the reason why almost all common <b>organic</b> <b>impurities</b> such as PVC, PLA, polyolefin, chemical wood-pulp and paper fibers, polyvinyl acetate, melt adhesive, coloring agents, sugar, and protein residues are transformed into colored degradation products that, in their turn, might release in addition reactive degradation products. Then, the number of defects in the polymer chain increases considerably. The particle size distribution of impurities is very wide, the big particles of 60–1000µm—which are visible by naked eye and easy to filter—representing the lesser evil, since their total surface is relatively small and the degradation speed is therefore lower. The influence of the microscopic particles, which—because they are many—increase the frequency of defects in the polymer, is relatively greater.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of a novel group of potential photocatalysts, based on sol-gel-derived MgO-ZrO 2 oxide material. The material was synthesized in a typical sol-gel system using organic precursors of magnesia and zirconia, ammonia as a promoter of hydrolysis and methanol as a solvent. All materials were thoroughly analyzed, including morphology and particle sizes, chemical composition, identification of characteristic functional groups, porous structure parameters and crystalline structure. The proposed methodology of synthesis resulted in obtaining pure MgO-ZrO 2 oxide material with micrometric-sized particles and a relatively high surface area.

For our data set, discriminant analysis using a combination of the IRMS data and GCMS data ('Van Deursen' impurities pre-treated with the fourth root method) provided the most accurate discrimination of the MDMA.

High similarity of TOFMS spectra of impurities was obtained against commercial MS libraries. 16 components from the two-dimensional profiles were selected for comparison of the 24 ecstasy tablets, most of which proved to be benzodioxole derived compounds. All tablets were correctly classified in eight groups according to their post-tabletting characteristics,when appropriate data pre-treatment was applied.

Samples from Macedonia were elevated in N-formyl-MDMA and N-acetyl-MDMA while samples from Australia were elevated in 3, 4 -methylenedioxypropane and 3, 4 -methylenedioxyacetophenone. Furthermore, three components were found to be unique for one of the source countries.

The chromatography was performed at 20 °CusingaC 18 XTerraTM (5 �m, 150 � 4, 6 mm) column at a flow rate 1. 0 ml/min. The drug and its impurity were detected at 225 nm. The mobile phase consisted of TEA (1 %) – methanol (67. 2 : 32. 8 v/v), the pH of which was adjusted to 6. 8 with 85 % orthophosphoric acid. Quantification was accomplished by the internal standard method. The developed RP HPLC method was validated by testing: accuracy, precision, repeatibility, specificity, detection limit, quantification limit, linearity, robustness and sensitivity. High linearity of the analytical procedure was confirmed over the concentration range of 0. 05 – 1. 00 mg/ml for eletriptan hydrobromide and from 0. 10 – 1. 50 �g/ml for UK 120. 413, with correlation coefficients greater than r = 0. 995. The low value of the RSD expressed the good repeatability and precision of the method. Experimental design and a response surface method were used to test robustness of the analytical procedure and to evaluate the effect of variation of the method parameters, namely the mobile phase composition, pH and temperature. They showed small deviations from the method setting.
