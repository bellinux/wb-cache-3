Here Wade tied his horses, and, {{whispering}} to Fox, he proceeded stealthily through this strip of spruce. He came out to an <b>open</b> <b>point,</b> taking care, however, to keep well screened, from which he had {{a glimpse of a}} parklike hollow, grassy and watered. Working round to better vantage, he soon espied what had made Fox stand so stiff and bristling. A herd of elk were trooping up the opposite slope, scarcely a hundred yards distant. They had heard or scented him, but did not appear alarmed. They halted to look back. The hunter's quick estimate credited nearly two dozen to the herd, mostly cows. A magnificent bull, with wide-spreading antlers, and black head and shoulders and gray hind quarters, stalked out from the herd, and stood an instant, head aloft, splendidly significant of the wild. Then he trotted into the woods, his antlers noiselessly spreading the green. Others trotted off likewise. Wade raised his rifle and looked through the sight at the bull, and let him pass. Then he saw another over his rifle, and another. Reluctant and forced, he at last aimed and pulled trigger. The heavy Henry boomed out in the stillness. Fox dashed down with eager barks. When the smoke cleared away Wade saw the opposite slope bare except for one fallen elk.|$|E

The critical modes prevention by means of a closed-loop control synthesis is also shown and the connection between flexible dynamics and capture system design is highlighted, giving engineering answers to most challenging <b>open</b> <b>points</b> to lead to a ready to flight solution.

5000|$|The spire s conical, subscalar in {{consequence}} of the prominence of the keel. The apex is small, roundedly sharp, consisting of 3¼ carinated, but otherwise perfectly smooth, whorls, which form a shortcompact little cone, of which the extreme tip is a little obliquely flattened down on one side. The shell contains 10 whorls in all. There is a drooping and very slightly concave shoulder below the suture. The greatest breadth is at the keel, below which the whorls begin faintly, and with a very slightly convex profile, to contract into the inferior suture. The last contracts rather rapidly into a short conical base, running out into a narrow, straight, somewhat one-sided, and not very long snout. The suture is invisible but for the marginating threads above and below it. The aperture is club-shaped, being pointedly ovate above, and running out below into a well-marked siphonal canal. The outer lip is concave below the suture and angulated at the keel. It is convex in its sweep {{to the edge of}} the siphonal canal, from which it runs directly and obliquely to the rounded and <b>open</b> <b>point</b> of the columella. In leaving the body it retreats at once to the right to form the rounded sinus, which has an excessively short upper side, but becomes large (though hardly deep) from the great forward winglike sweep of its lower margin, whose course is quite independent of the ribs. Toward the edge of the siphonal canal this curve again retreats to the point of the shell. The inner lip is a thin narrow glaze margined with a minute furrow. It is oblique, but scarcely convex across the body, direct on the short columella, and cut off with a long slope to the point of the siphonal canal, its edge being narrow, rounded, and scarcely at all twisted.|$|E
5000|$|... (Original description) The {{shell is}} broadish, conical and sharply keeled. It has a shortish {{contracted}} base {{and a short}} snout, short narrow ribs, and spiral threads, a bulbous apex, strong, porcellaneous. Below the sinus area and about one third down the whorl from the suture arise, not quite abruptly, longitudinal ribs slightly tubercled at the top, straight, direct, narrow, and parted by shallow furrows about twice their breadth. They become feeble toward the lower suture. On the body whorl they do not continue to the base,and become broader and weaker toward the aperture. There are eleven on the last and penultimate whorls. On the first infra-embryonic whorl there are about seventeen, crowded, sharp, scarcely curved and oblique. The lines of growth are numerous and unequal. In the sinus-area they are sharp and delicate, {{on the rest of}} the shell coarse and puckered. Marginating the suture at the top of each whorl is a narrow scarcely swollen spiral band. Below this the sinus area is very finely, almost microscopically, scratched and this scratch-sculpture is continued, though less distinctly, {{on the rest of the}} surface. The projection of the top of the ribs forms a sharp keel. The rib area is crossed by five coarsish threads, which rise into small tubercles on the ribs. One or two smaller threads come in between the lines of these spirals. The same sort of threads, but less distinct, are found on the base. Those on the columella and snout are a little more distinct. The colour is dull porcellaneous white. The epidermis is quite gone. The spire is rather short, conical, very slightly scalar, cylindrical toward the top. The apex consists of two smooth embryonic whorls, swollen and roundedly pressed down, with a deepish suture, rather more prominent than the regular whorl which follows. The shell contains 6½ short whorls, of rather rapid increase. The body whorl is large relatively to the rest. From the suture to the ribbing they are concavely shouldered. The projection of the tubercles at the top of the ribs forms a carination. which does not really exist in the form of the whorls themselves. There is a very slight contraction towards the lower suture. The body whorl contracts slightly from the keel to the edge of the base, and from that point rapidly to the small, narrow, straight, and direct snout. The suture is coarse, slightly impressed, and well defined by the band below it. The aperture is narrowly oval, pointed above, with an oblique, short, rather open and gradually contracted siphonal canal in front. The outer lip is a rather depressed convex curve, a little concave at the top and flattened toward the point: on leaving the body it retreats at once, forming a shallow, blunt V-shaped sinus, from the lower side of which, with little of angulation, it advances very straight to the edge of the siphonal canal, whence it slowly curves backward round the <b>open</b> <b>point</b> of the snout. The inner lip spreads as a very narrow porcellaneous glaze. It runs very obliquely to the base of the shortish narrow columella, below which point it is a very little hollowed. The point of the columella is cut off with a very slight obliquity, and has a blunt and very slightly twisted edge. The operculum is small, oval, smooth, with hair-like striae. The apex is terminal The colour is pale brownish yellow.|$|E
