40|$|A {{detailed}} socio-economic {{description is}} given of this rustic farm {{community on the}} Atlantic Coast of Colombia. Where cassava is {{the main source of}} income. Av temp is 28 degrees Celsius, annual rainfall 1556 mm; the sandy soils (pH 5. 5 - 6) have less than 1 percent OM, less than 15 ppm P and less than 0. 15 meq K/g. Since 1960 the farmers have had contact with several agricultural institutions including the Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario and CIAT, which 1 st held regional trials there in 1974. In 1977 the validation of technology was begun {{based on the results of}} these trials. The preferred var. is Venezolana (av yield 7 t). Cassava is usually planted in association with maize, cowpeas or sesame, according to the time of year; when planted alone, a ground cover (Citrullus vulgaris) is usually used. The most profitable association is cassava-maize-sesame. Some farmers practice crop rotation with sesame every 2 - 4 yr or leave the land planted to guinea grass (Panicum maximum) 1 1 / 2 - 3 yr. Pests of importance are termites, mites and the whitefly Aleurotrachelus sp.; diseases are white and brown leaf spots, CBB and superelongation. Cassava is used for <b>on-farm</b> <b>consumption</b> including animal feed and is sold on a nearby market for starch. Prices fluctuate, being higher in the rainy season when the farmer is planting and lower when he is harvesting. (CIAT...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate the links between organic farming and ecotourism, and their benefits to the tourism industry. It opens by describing Croatia as a destination for environmentally and socially responsible travellers who tend to consume organic food and other environmentally-friendly products. The paper then focuses on the FAO’s view of ecotourism as an opportunity for farmers/foresters to generate additional income. It then covers agrotourism, pointing to the symbiotic relationship between tourism and agriculture as a key element of responsible tourism. It explains the terms agro-ecotourism and eco-organic tourism. Two countries facing rising economic prosperity are analyzed from the point of view of ecotourism and organic agriculture – China and India. Experts cite tourism as a leading cause of environmental degradation in these countries. But ecotourism has the potential to benefit both the economy and the environment. A study from Taiwan suggests that the links between organic agriculture and agro-ecotourism are capable of maximizing the economic benefits of organic agriculture. Another article, dealing with the Himalayan areas of India, is also considered. Despite the area’s world-renowned scenery and wilderness, tourism in these areas “remains a highly seasonal activity, served by a poor infrastructure and exhibiting unsustainable practices”. Thus, in India organic farming and food production are expected to be services allied to ecotourism. Those, in turn, are expected to generate quality jobs and income. The paper then returns to Europe, illustrating several cases of successful co-operation between ecotourism and organic farming. It mentions certain organic farming practices which “benefit the environment while rewarding farmers: accommodation in buildings renovated/constructed according to ecological architecture; <b>on-farm</b> <b>consumption</b> or selling of organic foods and beverages; educational programmes and training (organic gardening, composting, wild herb collection and drying, traditional food and beverage production), and raising guests’ awareness of rational use of natural resources” (FAO). It mentions the Italian Association for Organic Agriculture established in 1998, and German Demeter Travel as the first agency that pursues the holistic goal of an organic farming association. The importance of eco-labels as vital marketing instruments for agro-ecotourism is underlined. The paper then provides an overview of the best-known forms of certification, as well as the regulatory mechanism developed by the BIO-Hotels Association from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, established in 2001. The paper concludes with the open question of how serious Croatia is in pursuing its declared aim of being an ecotourist destination.

40|$|This study quantifies the {{environmental}} impact of milk production of Italian Mediterranean buffaloes and points out the farm characteristics that mainly affect their environmental performance. Life cycle assessment was applied in a sample of 6 farms. The functional unit was 1 kg of normalized buffalo milk (LBN), with a reference milk fat and protein content of 8. 3 and 4. 73 %, respectively. The system boundaries included the agricultural phase of the buffalo milk chain from cradle to farm gate. An economic criterion was adopted to allocate the impacts on milk production. Impact categories investigated were global warming (GW), abiotic depletion (AD), photochemical ozone formation (PO), acidification (AC), and eutrophication (EU). The contribution to the total results of the following farm activities were investigated: (1) on-farm energy consumption, (2) manure management, (3) manure application, (4) on-farm feed production (comprising production and application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides), (5) purchased feed production, (6) enteric fermentation, and (7) transport of purchased feeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides from producers to farms. Global warming associated with 1 kg of LBN resulted in 5. 07 kg of CO₂ Eq [coefficient of variation (CV) = 21. 9 %], AD was 3. 5 × 10 (- 3) kg of Sb Eq (CV= 51. 7 %), PO was 6. 8 × 10 (- 4) kg of C₂H₄ Eq (CV= 28. 8 %), AC was 6. 5 × 10 (- 2) kg of SO₂ Eq (CV= 30. 3 %), and EU was 3. 3 × 10 (- 2) kg of PO₄(3 -) Eq (CV= 36. 5 %). The contribution of enteric fermentation and manure application to GW is 37 and 20 %, respectively; <b>on-farm</b> <b>consumption,</b> on-farm feed production, and purchased feed production are the main contributors to AD; about 70 % of PO is due to enteric fermentation; manure management and manure application are responsible for 55 and 25 % of AC and 25 and 55 % of EU, respectively. Methane and N₂O are responsible for 44 and 43 % of GW, respectively. Crude oil consumption is responsible for about 72 % of AD; contribution of CH 4 to PO is 77 %; NH₃ is the main contributor to AC (92 %); NO₃(-) and NH₃ are responsible for 55 and 41 % of EU, respectively; contribution of P to EU is only 3. 2 %. The main characteristics explaining the significant variability of life cycle assessment are milk productivity and amount of purchased feed per kilogram of LBN. Improvement of LBN production per buffalo cow is the main strategy for reducing GW and PO; improvement of the efficiency of feed use is the strategy proposed for mitigating AD, PO, AC, and EU...|$|E

40|$|Amana Farms {{is using}} an {{anaerobic}} digestion, {{which is a}} two-stage digester that converts manure and other organic wastes into three valuable by-products: 1) Biogas – to fuel an engine/generator set to create electricity; 2) Biosolids - used as a livestock bedding material or as a soil amendment; 3) Liquid stream - will be applied as a low-odor fertilizer to growing crops. (see Business Plan appendix H) The methane biogas will be collected from the two stages of the anaerobic digestion vessel and used for fuel in the {{combined heat and power}} engine/generator sets. The engine/generator sets are natural gasfueled reciprocating engines modified to burn biogas. The electricity produced by the engine/generator sets will be used to offset <b>on-farm</b> power <b>consumption</b> and the excess power will be sold directly to Amana Society Service Company as a source of green power.

40|$|Depending on your farm operation, the {{following}} actions could reduce your <b>on-farm</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> Refer to the references {{at the end}} of the bulletin for more information. Ventilation 1. Install thermostats to control fans so they are on when needed and shut off when not needed. Research has indicated that cows begin to show mild heat stress at 74 ˚F and 75 % relative humidity, so thermostats should be set between 70 ˚F and 75 ˚F. 2. Clean fan blades, guards, motors, thermostats and shutters monthly. a. Dust build-up on motors increases operating temperatures and can lead to overheating. b. Dust-covered thermostats do not sense temperatures accurately. c. Dirty shutters can decrease fan efficiency by 25 %. 3. Lubricate shutter hinges with graphite—not grease or oil— every 3 months. 4. Check belt condition, tension and alignment on fans with belts. Slippage of belts can cut belt life in half and reduce air flow rates by as much as 30 % or more. Always replace guards after servicing. 5. Install efficient fans. For fan efficiency ratings refer to Agricultura...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the global warming}} impact (GWI) of ethanol produced at the Illinois River Energy ethanol plant (IRE) on a life cycle basis. IRE is located 80 miles west of Chicago. The plant currently produces 58 million gallon per year of ethanol with an expansion underway to double capacity. The life cycle assessment includes the GWI contributions from corn agriculture, corn to ethanol conversion at the IRE biorefinery, distribution to the terminal, and combustion. The analysis was performed using Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET model with customizations based on different data sets: 1. We collected detailed data on agricultural practices within the corn draw area around IRE. A survey was conducted with 29 corn growers supplying 2, 528, 850 bushels of corn to IRE or 12 % of all delivered bushels (representative of about 6. 9 million gallon of ethanol production). The survey assessed key agricultural variables including fertilizer application rates, tractor fuel use and other <b>on-farm</b> fuel <b>consumption,</b> and yields. 2.

40|$|The Australian Government is {{currently}} addressing {{the challenge of}} increasing water scarcity through significant on-farm infrastructure investment to facilitate the adoption of new water-efficient pressurized irrigation systems. However, it is highly likely that conversion to these systems will increase <b>on-farm</b> energy <b>consumption</b> and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, suggesting potential conflicts in terms of mitigation and adaptation policies. This study explored the trade-offs associated with the adoption of more water efficient but energy-intensive irrigation technologies by developing an integrated assessment framework. Integrated analysis of five case studies revealed trade-offs between water security and environmental security when conversion to pressurized irrigation systems was evaluated in terms of fuel and energy-related emissions, except in cases where older hand-shift sprinkler irrigation systems were replaced. These results suggest that priority should be given, in implementing on-farm infrastructure investment policy, to replacing inefficient and energy-intensive sprinkler irrigation systems such as hand-shift and roll-line. The results indicated that associated changes {{in the use of}} agricultural machinery and agrochemicals may also be important. The findings of this study support the use of an integrated approach to avoid possible conflicts in designing national climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, both of which are being developed in Australia. ...|$|R
40|$|Water for {{irrigation}} in the Canterbury region of New Zealand {{is becoming an}} increasingly precious commodity {{as it is in}} many other areas of the world. Adequate use of this resource will define the economical and environmental future of the region. Current irrigation systems, even under best management practices, over-apply water, as they do not account for spatial variability of crop water needs in fields. Over-application of water is wasteful and has environmental and economical repercussions. Water requirements are determined by crop evapotranspiration (ET). Key factors affecting ET in Canterbury are wind and solar radiation. Both of these are significantly affected by windbreaks, resulting in variability in ET and water requirements across a field. Understanding the variability in ET caused by windbreaks will enable for the correct application of water through precision irrigation systems. A theoretical model was developed to estimate savings in irrigation by accounting for windbreaks in the Canterbury region. Windbreaks reduce evapotranspiration and therefore crops/pasture behind windbreaks needs less water than those {{in other parts of the}} field. Results for a case study in Canterbury show that windbreaks can potentially reduce the annual <b>on-farm</b> water <b>consumption</b> by 10 to 20 %, while still maintaining ideal crop/pasture yields. In the short term, the application of precision irrigation systems in fields with windbreaks can have farm level benefits of improved water use and reduced nitrogen/phosphorus leaching. In the long term this could translate directly into cost savings because of a potential decrease in energy used {{for irrigation}} (running pumps, etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{significant}} {{concerns about the}} longer term impact of climate change and climate variability on water availability in Australia. Modern irrigation technologies {{are seen as a}} way to manage climate change impacts and improve water security. However, while modern irrigation technologies may save volumes of water, it is likely that they will result in increased <b>on-farm</b> energy <b>consumption</b> and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, suggesting potential conflicts in terms of mitigation and adaptation policies. Five irrigation technology transformation scenarios—three historical and two adoption—were developed to evaluate industry-wide tradeoffs between water savings, energy consumption (and GHG emissions), and economic returns associated with irrigation technology transformations under current Australian Government water resource policies. Three of the five scenarios tested showed tradeoffs between water savings and GHG emissions, with water savings through conversion of irrigation systems increasing both energy consumption and GHG emissions. For example, 120 GL/year of water savings achieved through drip irrigation adoption for cotton cropping would increase energy consumption by 889 TJ/year and GHG emissions by 250, 000 t CO 2 e/year. A carbon price of $ 20 /t CO 2 e would result in additional costs nationally of about $ 5 m/year. However, this study also indicated that significant benefit in terms of water savings and GHG reduction can be achieved when replacing older inefficient and energy-intensive systems, such as hand shift and roll-line sprinkler systems, especially when these are replaced with drip irrigation systems. We suggest priority should be given to replacing such systems while implementing the on-farm infrastructure investment policy. The findings of the study support the use of an integrated approach to avoid possible conflicts in designing national climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, both of which are being developed in Australia. ...|$|R
