5|$|Berkelium(III) ions shows two sharp {{fluorescence}} peaks at 652nanometers (red light) and 742nanometers (deep red – near infrared) due {{to internal}} transitions at the f-electron shell.

This emission can be <b>observed,</b> <b>for</b> example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide.|$|E

5|$|Different {{areas of}} the brain exhibit {{different}} forms of LTP. The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the age of the organism when LTP is <b>observed.</b> <b>For</b> example, the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature hippocampus differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult hippocampus. The signalling pathways used by a particular cell also contribute to the specific type of LTP present. For example, some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the NMDA receptor, others may depend upon the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), while still others depend upon another molecule altogether. The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the anatomic location in which LTP is <b>observed.</b> <b>For</b> example, LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor-dependent, whereas LTP in the mossy fiber pathway is NMDA receptor-independent.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{investigating}} the splash dispersal of peridioles {{have shown a}} maximum horizontal distance for peridiole ejection of , less than that <b>observed</b> <b>for</b> other Cyathus species. This reduced ejection distance {{may be due to}} such factors as the greater size of peridioles, the looser construction of the funiculus, or the increased flaring seen in the upper lip of the splash cup.|$|E
5|$|Nuttin {{analyzed}} {{the data to}} see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for Magyarország). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not <b>observed</b> <b>for</b> collective ownership.|$|E

Enhanced antibacterial action of fine particles compared to bulk material is not exclusive to ZnO and is <b>observed</b> <b>for</b> other materials, such as silver. This property results from the increased surface area of the fine particles.|$|E

5|$|Titania's orbit lies {{completely}} {{inside the}} Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet.

5|$|Yttrium has {{at least}} 20 {{metastable}} ("excited") isomers ranging in mass number from 78 to 102. Multiple excitation states have been <b>observed</b> <b>for</b> 80Y and 97Y.

5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were <b>observed</b> <b>for</b> 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Neil Hamilton Fairley and Major Ian Murray Mackerras visited Port Moresby in June 1942, {{and noted}} that the {{garrison}} had suffered 1,184 cases of malaria, an infection rate of 149 per thousand. They recommended that to conserve quinine, men could be taken off it during the dry season, and <b>observed</b> <b>for</b> relapses. Fortunately, the climate in the Owen Stanley Range was not favourable to mosquitoes, and most cases were relapses by men infected in Port Moresby or Syria. Potts therefore decided on 24 August that anti-malarial precautions were no longer necessary.|$|E
