5|$|The BRCA OB3 domain assumes an OB fold, which {{consists}} of a highly curved five-stranded beta-sheet that closes on itself to form a beta-barrel. OB3 has a pronounced groove formed by one face of the curved sheet and is demarcated by two loops, <b>one</b> <b>between</b> beta 1 and beta 2 and another between beta 4 and beta 5, which allows for strong ssDNA binding.|$|E
5|$|The {{mesosphere}} of Venus can {{be divided}} into two layers: the lower <b>one</b> <b>between</b> 62–73km and the upper <b>one</b> <b>between</b> 73–95km. In the first layer the temperature is nearly constant at 230K (−43°C). This layer coincides with the upper cloud deck. In the second layer temperature starts to decrease again reaching about 165K (−108°C) at the altitude of 95km, where mesopause begins. It is the coldest part of the Venusian dayside atmosphere. In the dayside mesopause, which serves as a boundary between the mesophere and thermosphere and is located between 95–120km, temperature increases to a constant—about 300–400K (27–127°C)—value prevalent in the thermosphere. In contrast, the nightside Venusian thermosphere is the coldest place on Venus with temperature as low as 100K (−173°C). It is even called a cryosphere.|$|E
5|$|A Ghost Story for Christmas is {{a strand}} of annual British short {{television}} films originally broadcast on BBC <b>One</b> <b>between</b> 1971 and 1978, and revived in 2005 on BBC Four. With one exception, the original instalments were directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark and the films were all shot on 16mm colour film.

50|$|Sarah Bartleson (1790-1838) was {{the wife}} of Dr. William Johnson (1785-1831). They were married on June 11, 1811. According to the deed, the $5,600 was paid by Israel Bartleson. In 1820, the {{household}} consisted of William, Sarah, and three children, all then under 10 years old, and <b>one</b> male aged <b>between</b> 16 and 26 years old, probably a farm hand. Ten years later, there was <b>one</b> male <b>between</b> 10 and 15 (son William), <b>one</b> male <b>between</b> 40 and 50 (Dr. Johnson), <b>one</b> male <b>between</b> 50 and 60 (identity unknown), <b>one</b> female <b>between</b> 10 and 15 (daughter Sarah), <b>one</b> female <b>between</b> 15 and 20 (daughter Mary), two females between 40 and 50 (Sarah, and an unknown woman) and <b>one</b> female <b>between</b> 60 and 70 (identity unknown).|$|R

5|$|Before Game of Thrones both Benioff and Weiss {{worked in}} film, and were {{unfamiliar}} with {{working on a}} television show. This resulted in several first-season episodes being about 10 minutes too short for HBO, forcing them to write another 100 pages of scripts in two weeks. Due to lack of budget the new scenes were designed to be inexpensive to film, such as two actors conversing in one room. Benioff and Weiss noted {{that some of their}} favorite scenes from the first season were the results of the dilemma, including <b>one</b> <b>between</b> Robert and Cersei Baratheon discussing their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Booth was not {{cleared for}} full-contact {{practice}} with the team until January 25, 2010. Six days later, {{he returned to the}} lineup for a game against the New York Islanders after being sidelined for 45 contests. During his absence, the Panthers and Flyers played each other on December 21, 2009, {{for the first time since}} Richards' hit. The game included four fights, including <b>one</b> <b>between</b> Panthers defenceman and captain Bryan McCabe and Richards. The teams met again with Booth in the lineup on March 3, 2010. After fighting Richards in the first period (one of four fights in the game and Booth's first in the NHL), Booth scored a goal and three assists (completing a Gordie Howe hat trick) to help the Panthers to a 7–4 win.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{settlement}} recognising {{his claim to}} Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly {{found it difficult to}} enforce his rights, even with his new role as a stationer. Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court handed down a settlement similar to the <b>one</b> <b>between</b> East and Barley. However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.|$|E

5|$|In another prelimary match, wrestlers {{from the}} SmackDown! brand competed in a match between four wrestlers for the WWE United States Championship: Eddie Guerrero defended the title against Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri. The buildup to the match began with two {{different}} rivalries, <b>one</b> <b>between</b> Guerrero and Tajiri, {{and the other}} between Benoit and Rhyno. On August 7, 2003 during an episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero and Benoit wrestled in a standard match. However, during the match, Rhyno and Tajiri interfered, resulting in neither wrestler winning the match. Sgt. Slaughter, a WWE official, scheduled a tag team match between the team of Guerrero and Benoit and the team of Rhyno and Tajiri, which Guerrero and Benoit won. The following week on an episode of SmackDown!, a SummerSlam advertisement announced that Guerrero would defend the WWE United States Championship against Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri.|$|E

5|$|King John enjoyed regular {{hunting in}} the Forest each November, and used St Briavels Castle as his base for such trips. The king entertained the Welsh lord Gruffyd ap Cadwallon at the castle in 1207. This royal {{interest}} resulted in further building works and substantial expenditure, with £291 being spent {{in the next four}} years. A stone curtain wall replaced an earlier wooden <b>one</b> <b>between</b> 1209–11, complete with a tower and gateway. Inside the bailey a number of buildings suitable for use by the king as a lodge were constructed. A wooden chapel was built within the castle in 1236–7. The castle expansion may have been funded by the increased taxes from iron-working across the areas, {{and by the end of}} John's reign, the castle was almost in its mature form.|$|E
5|$|Lenin {{expected}} Russia's aristocracy and bourgeoisie {{to oppose}} his government, but {{he believed that}} the numerical superiority of the lower classes, coupled with the Bolsheviks' ability to effectively organise them, guaranteed a swift victory in any conflict. In this, he failed to anticipate the intensity of the violent opposition to Bolshevik rule in Russia. The ensuing Russian Civil War pitted the pro-Bolshevik Reds against the anti-Bolshevik Whites, but also encompassed ethnic conflicts on Russia's borders and conflict between both Red and White armies and local peasant groups, the Green armies, throughout the former Empire. Accordingly, various historians have seen the civil war as representing two distinct conflicts: <b>one</b> <b>between</b> the revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries, and the other between different revolutionary factions.|$|E
5|$|Only {{five of the}} sieges {{resulted}} in a change of rule. Seven were fought between Muslims and Catholics during Muslim rule, four between Spain and Britain from the Anglo-Dutch capture in 1704 {{to the end of}} the Great Siege in 1783, two between rival Catholic factions, and <b>one</b> <b>between</b> rival Muslim powers. Four of Gibraltar's changes in rule, including three sieges, took place over a matter of days or hours, whereas several other sieges had durations of months or years and claimed the lives of thousands without resulting in any change in rule.|$|E

5|$|Originally it was {{believed}} that Lake Cahuilla formed around 900 AD and existed until 1500 but with fluctuations as the Colorado River changed its course. In 1978, Philip J. Wilke proposed that two highstands occurred, <b>one</b> <b>between</b> 900 and 1250 and another between 1300-1500. Another proposal by Waters in 1983 suggested highstands 700-900, 940-1210 and after 1250, the latter with some brief recessions to lower lake levels. Both proposals were criticized {{on the grounds that they}} came to definite conclusions with insufficient information.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford's Liberals self-identified as {{the party}} of free enterprise, in {{contrast}} to the public ownership-supporting Conservatives. Despite this, they made a limited number of large-scale forays into government operation of utilities, the most notable of which was the creation of Alberta Government Telephones. In 1906, Alberta's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies. Several, including Edmonton, did so, alongside private companies. The largest of this latter group was the Bell Telephone Company, which held a monopoly over service in Calgary. Such monopolies and the private firms' refusal to extend their services into sparsely populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market, which was effected in 1907. The government constructed a number of lines, beginning with <b>one</b> <b>between</b> Calgary and Banff, and also purchased Bell's lines for $675,000.|$|E

To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the <b>one</b> <b>between</b> Joe and Polly.

5|$|The Patent Cable Tramway Corporation {{owned the}} rights to the Hallidie {{cable-car}} system first invented and used in San Francisco in 1873; trains were attached to the cable with clamps, which would be opened and closed at stations, allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or to interfere with other trains sharing the cable. There were to be two independent endless cables, <b>one</b> <b>between</b> City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12mph. However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of the cable system.|$|E
