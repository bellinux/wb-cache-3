2500|$|An {{extensive}} underwater search using <b>oceanographic</b> <b>ship</b> [...] {{and other}} ships mounted immediately and they soon found shattered remains of Threshers hull {{located on the}} sea floor, some [...] below the surface, in six major sections. The majority of the debris had spread over an area of about [...] The bathyscaphe Trieste, then in San Diego, California, was alerted on 11 April and subsequently loaded aboard the large landing ship [...] and brought through the Panama Canal to Boston. Trieste then deployed for two series of dives on the debris field: the first series on 24–30 June, and the second series in late August/early September. It found and photographed major sections of Thresher, including the sail, sonar dome, bow section, engineering spaces section, operations spaces section, and the stern planes. One aspect of the search conducted that summer by Mizar involved the use of highly sensitive proton magnetometers furnished by the Instrument Division of Varian Associates, Palo Alto, California, and shipped aboard Mizar before her departure from Suitland, Maryland. The magnetometers were {{used in conjunction with}} underwater video cameras and suspended on the same electrical line used to tow the video cameras themselves. Sea bottom photography of the wreck site taken in summer 1963 can be seen at the official US Navy history website.|$|E
