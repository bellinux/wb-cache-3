The optical fiber is glued along four lines of the tube surface which are rotated 90 ° one from each other to capture in-plane and out-of-plane tube bending displacements. A laboratory experimental program is undertaken to validate the proposed sensor as a monitoring tool. In the laboratory, PVC tubes are subjected to controlled displacements on 4 points that represent the attachment locations of the sensor to the rock mass to simulate possible response in the rock mass during mining activities.

Lateral spectrum-splitting configurations promise further increased efficiency through relaxation of the lattice- and current-matching requirements of monolithic stacks, albeit {{at the cost}} of increased optical and electrical complexity. Consequently, in order to achieve an effective spectrum-splitting photovoltaic configuration it is essential that all optical losses and photon misallocation be characterized and subsequently minimized.
