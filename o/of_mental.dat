On the Controversy About the "Mark" <b>of</b> the <b>Mental</b> - In this paper, I want to {{show that}} the {{so-called}} intentionalist programme, according to which the qualitative aspects <b>of</b> the <b>mental</b> have to be brought back to its intentional features, is doomed to fail. For, pace Brentano, the property that constitutes the main part of such intentional features, i. e., intentionality, is not the mark <b>of</b> the <b>mental,</b> neither in the proper Brentanian sense, according to which intentionality is the both necessary and sufficient condition <b>of</b> the <b>mental,</b> nor in its ‘watered down’ counterpart recently defended by Tim Crane, according to which intentionality is just the necessary condition <b>of</b> the <b>mental.</b> However, {{this does not mean that}} being mental is a merely heterogenous category. For there may be another mark <b>of</b> the <b>mental,</b> i. e., consciousness, in the phenomenological sense of the property of being experienced...|$|R
5|$|Considering mental {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism {{makes it possible}} to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> processes.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E
5|$|In A Theory of Content and Other Essays (1990), Fodor {{takes up}} {{another of his}} central notions: the {{question}} of the reality <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> representations.

40|$|If {{the inner}} {{consciousness}} <b>of</b> a <b>mental</b> {{state is a}} part <b>of</b> the <b>mental</b> state itself, then one is forced to admit an 'inner consciousness of the inner consciousness'.

5|$|In that article, he {{attempted}} to show how mental representations, specifically sentences {{in the language of}} thought, are necessary to explain this relational nature <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness.

The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> illness, including the experience <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> illness, and the normative questions it raises.

5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
