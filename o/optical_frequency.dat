5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
25|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> comb can be {{generated}} by modulating the amplitude and/or phase of a continuous-wave laser with an external modulator driven by a radio-frequency source. In this manner, the frequency comb is centered around the <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> provided by the continuous-wave laser and the modulation frequency or repetition rate is given by the external radio-frequency source. The advantage of this method {{is that it can}} reach much higher repetition rates (>10GHz) than with mode-locked lasers and the two degrees of freedom of the comb can be set independently. The number of lines is lower than with a mode-locked laser (typically a few tens), but the bandwidth can be significantly broadened with nonlinear fibers. This type of <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> comb is usually called electrooptic frequency comb. The first schemes used a phase modulator inside an integrated Fabry–Perot cavity, but with advances in electro-optic modulators new arrangements are possible.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, a conceptually {{simple way}} to make an <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> comb is to take two {{high-power}} lasers of slightly different frequency and shine them simultaneously through a photonic-crystal fiber. This creates a frequency comb by four-wave mixing as described above.|$|E

25|$|In the <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> regime {{developing}} the superlens may allow for imaging below the diffraction limit. Other potential applications for negative-index metamaterials are optical nanolithography, nanotechnology circuitry, {{as well as}} a near field superlens (Pendry, 2000) that could be useful for biomedical imaging and subwavelength photolithography.|$|E
25|$|The main {{characteristic}} of the recent ITU CWDM standard is that the signals are not spaced appropriately for amplification by EDFAs. This therefore limits the total CWDM optical span to somewhere near 60km for a 2.5 Gbit/s signal, which is suitable for use in metropolitan applications. The relaxed <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> stabilization requirements allow the associated costs of CWDM to approach those of non-WDM optical components.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{distinct}} applications of this technique. One is the optical clock, where an <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> is overlapped {{with a single}} tooth of the comb on a photodiode, and a radio frequency is compared to the beat signal, the repetition rate, and the CEO-frequency. Applications for the frequency-comb technique include optical metrology, frequency-chain generation, optical atomic clocks, high-precision spectroscopy, and more precise GPS technology.|$|E

25|$|Polarization is best {{understood}} by initially considering only pure polarization states, {{and only a}} coherent sinusoidal wave at some <b>optical</b> <b>frequency.</b> The vector in the adjacent diagram might describe the oscillation of the electric field emitted by a single-mode laser (whose oscillation frequency would be typically 1015 times faster). The field oscillates in the x-y plane, along the page, with the wave propagating in the z direction, perpendicular to the page.|$|E
25|$|The Jones matrix due to {{passage through}} a {{transparent}} material {{is dependent on}} the propagation distance as well as the birefringence. The birefringence (as well as the average refractive index) will generally be dispersive, that is, it will vary as a function of <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> (wavelength). In the case of non-birefringent materials, however, the 2×2 Jones matrix is the identity matrix (multiplied by a scalar phase factor and attenuation factor), implying no change in polarization during propagation.|$|E
25|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> comb is a laser source whose {{spectrum}} {{consists of}} a series of discrete, equally spaced frequency lines. Frequency combs can be generated by a number of mechanisms, including periodic modulation (in amplitude and/or phase) of a continuous-wave laser, four-wave mixing in nonlinear media or stabilization of the pulse train generated by a mode-locked laser. Much work has been devoted to the latter mechanism, which was developed {{around the turn of the}} 21st century and ultimately led to one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics being shared by John L. Hall and Theodor W. Hänsch in 2005.|$|E

5000|$|Since <b>optical</b> <b>frequencies</b> are {{far beyond}} the {{manipulation}} capacity of any feasible electronic circuit, all photon detectors are inherently energy detectors not oscillating electric field detectors. However, since energy detection is inherently [...] "square-law" [...] detection, it intrinsically mixes any <b>optical</b> <b>frequencies</b> present on the detector. Thus, sensitive detection of specific <b>optical</b> <b>frequencies</b> necessitates <b>optical</b> heterodyne detection, in which two different (close-by) wavelengths of light illuminate the detector so that the oscillating electrical output corresponds {{to the difference between}} their frequencies. This allows extremely narrow band detection (much narrower than any possible color filter can achieve) as well as precision measurements of phase and frequency of a light signal relative to a reference light source, as in a laser Doppler vibrometer.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered in previous experiments, notably the Shiva laser, was that the infrared light provided by the Nd:glass lasers (at ~1054nm in vaco) couples strongly with the electrons around the target, losing {{a considerable amount of}} energy that would otherwise heat the target itself. This is typically addressed through the use of an <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> multiplier, which can double or triple the frequency of the light, into the green or ultraviolet, respectively. These higher frequencies interact less strongly with the electrons, putting more power into the target. HiPER will use frequency tripling on the drivers.|$|E
25|$|In {{frequency}} domain OCT (FD-OCT) the broadband interference is acquired with spectrally separated detectors (either by encoding the <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> {{in time with}} a spectrally scanning source or with a dispersive detector, like a grating and a linear detector array). Due to the Fourier relation (Wiener-Khintchine theorem between the auto correlation and the spectral power density) the depth scan can be immediately calculated by a Fourier-transform from the acquired spectra, without movement of the reference arm. This feature improves imaging speed dramatically, while the reduced losses during a single scan improve the {{signal to noise ratio}} proportional to the number of detection elements. The parallel detection at multiple wavelength ranges limits the scanning range, while the full spectral bandwidth sets the axial resolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{drawbacks}} of {{this technology}} are found in a strong fall-off of the SNR, which {{is proportional to the}} distance from the zero delay and a sinc-type reduction of the depth dependent sensitivity because of limited detection linewidth. (One pixel detects a quasi-rectangular portion of an <b>optical</b> <b>frequency</b> range instead of a single frequency, the Fourier-transform leads to the sinc(z) behavior). Additionally the dispersive elements in the spectroscopic detector usually do not distribute the light equally spaced in frequency on the detector, but mostly have an inverse dependence. Therefore, the signal has to be resampled before processing, which can not take care of the difference in local (pixelwise) bandwidth, which results in further reduction of the signal quality. However, the fall-off is not a serious problem with the development of new generation CCD or photodiode array with a larger number of pixels.|$|E
