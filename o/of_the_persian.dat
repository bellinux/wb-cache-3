After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars.

5|$|Meanwhile, the Allies (for {{the most}} part Peloponnesian) {{prepared}} to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolishing the single road that led through it, and building a wall across it. As at Thermopylae, to make this an effective strategy required the Allied navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> navy across the Saronic Gulf, so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese. However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Allies to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis in September, the Allied fleet was able to destroy much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet, which essentially ended {{the threat to the}} Peloponnese.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{driven by}} the will to take revenge for the {{destruction}} of Palmyrene trade centers and discourage Shapur from initiating future attacks, Odaenathus launched an invasion against the Persians. In the spring of 262, the king marched north into the occupied Roman province of Mesopotamia, driving out the Persian garrisons and freeing Edessa and Carrhae. The first onslaught was aimed at Nisibis, which Odaenathus regained but sacked since the inhabitants were sympathetic toward the Persian occupation. The Palmyrene monarch destroyed the Jewish city of Nehardea, 45km west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> capital Ctesiphon, as he deemed the Jews of Mesopotamia loyal to Shapur. By late 262 or early 263, Odaenathus stood at the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> capital.|$|E
5|$|Stalemate ensued {{for five}} days, before the Athenians (for {{reasons that are}} not {{completely}} clear) decided to attack the Persians. Despite the numerical advantage of the Persians, the hoplites proved devastatingly effective, routing the Persians wings before turning in on the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> line; the remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> army left the battle and fled to their ships. Herodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield; the Athenians lost just 192 men and the Plataeans 11.|$|E

5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} the remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, {{had decided not to}} risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from the camp but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.|$|E
5|$|According to Diodorus, the Macedonian army {{numbered}} roughly 30,000 {{infantry and}} 2,000 cavalry, a figure generally accepted by modern historians.

5|$|According to Herodotus, the Allies {{spent the}} evening heatedly debating their course of action. The Peloponnesians were {{in favour of}} evacuating, {{and at this point}} Themistocles {{attempted}} his ruse with Xerxes.

5|$|Afterwards, Alexander {{travelled}} to Ecbatana {{to retrieve}} the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> treasure. There, his closest friend and possible lover, Hephaestion, died of illness or poisoning. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander, and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in Babylon, {{as well as a}} decree for public mourning. Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, but he would not have a chance to realize them, as he died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and fled to the palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E
5|$|Around {{ten days}} later, the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis were {{informed}} by a ship, captained by Abronichus, {{which had been}} appointed to liaise between {{the army and the}} fleet. However, there was still no sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them launching an attack. The next day, the Persian fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, heading for the Gap of Skiathos (between the coast of Magnesia and Skiathos), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm) broke, driving the Persian fleet onto the mountainous coast. The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> ships. Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.|$|E
