5|$|Even liberal {{senators}} were agitated by {{the proposed}} changes, fearing their own lands would be confiscated. Senators arranged for other tribunes {{to oppose the}} reforms. Tiberius then appealed to the people, and argued that a tribune who <b>opposes</b> <b>the</b> {{will of the people}} in favour of the rich is not a true tribune. The senators were left with only one constitutional response – to threaten prosecution after Tiberius's term as a tribune ended. This necessitated Tiberius to stand for a second term.|$|E
5|$|Resistivity is {{a measure}} of how {{strongly}} a material <b>opposes</b> <b>the</b> flow of electric current. The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals. This trend continues down to 100K, below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples. Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20K due to radiation damage, with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.|$|E

5|$|Some science-fiction {{fans have}} speculated that the Quatermass serials in general, and Quatermass II in {{particular}} — with its elements including a conspiracy of silence in the government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any critic who <b>opposes</b> <b>the</b> government's plans — influenced the successful American series The X-Files (1993–2002). Kneale was invited to write for The X-Files during the 1990s, but declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly <b>opposes</b> <b>the</b> applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the FPÖ {{became more}} eurosceptic, which was {{reflected}} by its change from pan-Germanism to Austrian patriotism. The party's opposition to the European Union grew stronger in the 1990s. The FPÖ opposed Austria's joining the EU in 1994, and promoted a popular initiative against the replacement of the Austrian Schilling with the Euro in 1998, but to no avail. Owing to perceived differences between Turkish and European culture, the party <b>opposes</b> <b>the</b> accession of Turkey to the EU; it has declared that should this happen, Austria must immediately leave the EU.|$|E

In 1618, he <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> decision of Frederick V, Elector Palatine {{to accept the}} Bohemian Crown, but he also <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> Spanish occupation of the Electorate of the Palatinate. In the imperial election of 1619, he voted for Ferdinand II.|$|R
5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He <b>opposes</b> <b>the</b> teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an annoyed Kersh tells Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{that he is}} {{lifting the}} {{quarantine}} of the oil platform. Scully <b>opposes</b> <b>the</b> idea but she has no choice other than to obey. Scully then realizes that de la Cruz is immune to the black oil, and because of it, he suffered from radiation burns instead of infection. After talking to Garza, Doggett leaves to find Mulder but is attacked by Taylor. Mulder arrives and overpowers Taylor, and Mulder and Doggett barricade themselves in the communication room, and try to relay a message while the platform's crew attack the door.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the traits}} of Orochimaru's {{character}} {{were taken from}} Japanese mythology.

5|$|The Reckoning (1991) {{chronicles the}} reign of England's King Henry III in Penman's final volume of the series that began with Here Be Dragons. The {{conflict}} between the Welsh prince Llewelyn ap Gruffydd who is the grandson of Llewelyn the Great of Here Be Dragons, and England's King Henry III is one subplot. Additionally, Penman chronicles the life and character of Ellen, daughter of Simon de Montfort and niece to Henry III; her betrothal to Llewellyn (negotiated prior to de Montfort's death); and the conflict between Ellen and her cousin Edward, soon to become King Edward, who <b>opposes</b> <b>the</b> betrothal.|$|E

Angela and Duran <b>oppose</b> <b>the</b> Dragon Emperor, Hawk and Lise <b>oppose</b> <b>the</b> Dark Prince, and Kevin and Carlie <b>oppose</b> <b>the</b> Masked Mage. The main storyline {{is determined by}} the first character chosen, though there is significantly more character interaction and dialogue if the other member of the pair is also in the party.|$|R

5|$|The third book {{continues}} along {{a similar}} vein, condemning cosmetics {{on the grounds}} that it is our souls, not our bodies, that we should seek to beautify. Clement also <b>opposes</b> <b>the</b> dyeing of men's hair and male depilation as effeminacy. He advises choosing one's company carefully, to avoid being corrupted by immoral people, and while arguing that material wealth is no sin in itself, it is too likely to distract one from the infinitely more important spiritual wealth which is found in Christ. The work finishes with selections of scripture supporting Clement's argument, and following a prayer, the lyrics of a hymn.|$|E
5|$|This article poses {{two general}} limits to {{non-member}} states. First, only European states {{are eligible for}} new membership, and second, these states not only need the approval of all the existing member states, but every member state can put some criteria forward {{that have to be}} attained. In practice, NATO formulates a common set of criteria, but for instance Greece blocks the Republic of Macedonia's accession to NATO, due to the disagreement over the use of the name Macedonia. Turkey similarly <b>opposes</b> <b>the</b> participation of the Republic of Cyprus with NATO institutions as long as the Cyprus dispute is not resolved.|$|E
5|$|Tyrion {{arrives at}} King's Landing in A Clash of Kings (1998) and {{immediately}} recognizes the chaos created by Joffrey and Cersei.

Disgusted by Joffrey's behavior and Cersei's failure to control him, Tyrion openly <b>opposes</b> <b>the</b> young king and tries to keep royal captive Sansa Stark out of harm's way. Tyrion masterminds the defense of King's Landing against Stannis Baratheon, even leading a sortie that drives Stannis from the gates. Afterwards, Tyrion is attacked and is grievously injured {{by one of the}} Kingsguard on orders to kill him. Tyrion suspects Joffrey or Cersei, but is unable to get revenge on either.|$|E
