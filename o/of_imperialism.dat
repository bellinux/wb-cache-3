5|$|Congress {{balked at}} the plan, seeing in it {{an end to the}} United States policy of {{isolationism}} and the beginning <b>of</b> <b>imperialism.</b> Even some supporters of naval expansion were wary; Senator Eugene Hale feared that because the proposal was so large, the entire bill would be shot down and no money appropriated for any ships. However, in April 1890, the United States House of Representatives approved funding for three 8,000-long ton battleships. Tracy, trying to soothe tensions within Congress, remarked that these ships were so powerful that only twelve would be necessary instead of the 35 called for in the original plan. He also slashed the operating costs of the Navy by giving the remaining Civil War-era monitors—which were utterly obsolete by this time—to navy militias operated by the states. The appropriation was also approved by the Senate, and in total three coast-defense battleships (the Indiana class), a cruiser, and a torpedo boat were given official approval and funding on 30 June 1890.|$|E

5|$|During {{his early}} career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and {{dysfunctional}} the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery {{had broken down}} under the weight <b>of</b> <b>imperialism,</b> the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. Between his crossing of the Rubicon river in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, he {{wanted to create a}} strong central government in Rome. And finally, he wanted to knit together the entire empire into a single cohesive unit.|$|E

25|$|Environmental {{determinism}} {{has been}} widely criticized {{as a tool to}} legitimize colonialism, racism, and imperialism in Africa, North America, South America, and Asia.

25|$|Douglas' {{work only}} touches on race {{directly}} {{in a few}} instances, such as the short video I'm Not Gary (1991). This interpretation of race is important, as the brief narrative involves a white man mistaking a black man for a different black man named Gary, for writer Lisa Coulthard, {{this is part of}} a larger investigation of racism as part <b>of</b> <b>imperialism</b> and cultural invisibility. For Coulthard, the lack of mention of race in works that feature only white performers troubles any racial reading of Douglas' work.|$|E
25|$|Language is {{a central}} {{question}} in post-colonial studies. Many post-colonial scholars and writers detail the colonial practice of imposing the colonizer's own native languages onto the peoples they colonized, even forbidding {{the use of the}} colonized people's native tongue.

Within the context of post-colonial studies, language is a weapon and a site of intense neocolonial conflict.|$|E

25|$|The term {{comes from}} the nineteenth-century period <b>of</b> <b>imperialism,</b> when Western powersEurope and the United Stateswould intimidate other, less {{powerful}} states into granting concessions through a demonstration of their superior military capabilities, usually depicted by their naval assets. A country negotiating with a Western power would notice that a warship or fleet of ships had appeared off its coast. The mere sight of such power almost always had a considerable effect, and it was rarely necessary for such boats to use other measures, such as demonstrations of firepower.|$|E

25|$|Taiwan's {{culture and}} {{cultural}} legacy {{has been largely}} shaped by the processes <b>of</b> <b>imperialism</b> and colonization as the structural and psychological effects of successive colonial projects have been integral to developing Taiwan’s self-image {{and the evolution of}} both official and unofficial Taiwanese culture. For most of its colonized existence, Taiwan remained on the cultural margins, far from the centers of civil and cultural life of each regime, and with every regime change, Taiwan’s cultural center shifted. At various times Taiwan’s cultural center has been Indigenous Taiwan, Amsterdam, Xiamen (Amoy), Qing-era Beijing, Imperial Japan, postwar China and even, arguably, the United States.|$|E
