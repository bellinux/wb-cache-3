25|$|In the US, {{federal courts}} have {{consistently}} held that {{lump sum payments}} received from third parties {{in exchange for the}} rights to lottery annuities are not capital assets for tax purpose. Rather, the lump sum is subject to <b>ordinary</b> <b>income</b> tax treatment.|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{taxable profits}} (<b>ordinary</b> <b>income)</b> are taxed at a flat rate of 27%. The tax base {{is the sum}} of {{operating}} profit/loss, financial revenues and net capital gains minus tax depreciation. In addition, the profit is taxed on the owner's hand through dividend and capital gain taxation.|$|E
25|$|Taxable income {{includes}} capital gains. However, {{individuals are}} taxed {{at a lower}} rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below). A capital gain is the excess of the sales price over the tax basis (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally those assets not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Capital losses (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term capital losses {{is limited to the}} total capital gains for the year, plus for individuals up to $3,000 of <b>ordinary</b> <b>income</b> ($1,500 if married filing separately). An individual may exclude $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of the individual's primary residence, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Gains on depreciable property used in a business are treated as <b>ordinary</b> <b>income</b> to the extent of depreciation previously claimed.|$|E

50|$|Previous {{examples}} of a broadly levied surtax in the United States include one imposed to help finance the Vietnam War during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. It essentially consisted of calculating one's <b>ordinary</b> federal <b>income</b> tax liability and then adding another 10% to it—the amount of the surtax.|$|R
50|$|Companies {{that own}} {{substantial}} intellectual property (e.g. patents or trademarks) often provide third parties with licenses and receive royalty payments in return. In some countries <b>ordinary</b> business <b>income</b> is taxed higher than royalty income.

25|$|The {{personal}} allowance {{is a standard}} deduction from <b>ordinary</b> <b>income,</b> meaning that it is given in all income (wages, pensions, capital and business income). Single parents and married couples where one spouse has a low income may be taxed in Class 2 and thus given double {{personal allowance}}.

25|$|The {{taxation}} {{of petroleum}} activities {{is based on}} the rules governing ordinary business taxation. There is considerable excess return (resource rent) associated with the extraction of oil and gas. Therefore, a special tax of 51% on income from petroleum extraction has been introduced, in addition to the <b>ordinary</b> <b>income</b> tax of 27%. Consequently, the marginal tax rate on the excess return within the petroleum sector is 78%.|$|E
25|$|On July 22, 2014, Simons {{was subject}} to {{bipartisan}} condemnation by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations {{for the use of}} complex barrier options to shield day-to-day trading (usually subject to higher <b>ordinary</b> <b>income</b> tax rates) as long-term capital gains. “Renaissance Technologies was able to avoid paying more than $6 billion in taxes by disguising its day-to-day stock trades as long term investments,” said Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), the committee’s ranking Republican, in his opening statement. “Two banks and a handful of hedge funds developed a complex financial structure to engage in highly profitable trades while claiming an unjustified lower tax rate and avoiding limits on trading with borrowed money,” said Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) in his prepared remarks.|$|E

40|$|Passage of the Canada Income Tax Act of 1971 {{permitted}} Canadian {{corporations to}} issue {{two classes of}} equity, one paying <b>ordinary</b> cash <b>income</b> and the other paying capital gains income. The shares are known as "interconvertible" because each share is freely convertible one-for-one into {{a share of the}} other type. Premiums paid for cash shares are consistent with the relative value of the dividends paid and with the taxation of certain investor groups. However, large premiums for some cash shares are evidence that the shares have been mispriced with respect to the conversion option...|$|R
25|$|A {{capital gain}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with a dividend. Generally, a capital gain occurs where a capital asset is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is taxed at the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay a tax on capital gains (often taxed at a lower rate than <b>ordinary</b> <b>income).</b> If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the buyback, the price of the holder's shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ordinary</b> <b>income</b> is a {{net income}} concept, {{meaning that it}} will be {{deduction}} for costs incurred to acquire income. There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic allowance. There is also several other deductions from ordinary income; special allowance for disability, special tax allowance for pensioners, the tax limitation rule for the disabled, seamen’s allowance, fishermen’s allowance, special allowance for self-employed within agriculture, special allowance for high expenses linked to illness, allowance for payments to individual pension schemes, allowance for travel between home and work, allowance for donations to voluntary organisations, allowance for paid union fees, allowance for home investment savings scheme for people under 34 years, parental allowance for documented expenses for childminding and childcare, etc.|$|E
25|$|Most jurisdictions {{imposing}} {{an income}} tax treat capital gains as part of income subject to tax. Capital gain is generally a gain on sale of capital assets—that is, those assets not held {{for sale in the}} ordinary course of business. Capital assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains. Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital gains taxation based on the length of time the asset was held. Because tax rates are often much lower for capital gains than for <b>ordinary</b> <b>income,</b> there is widespread controversy and dispute about the proper definition of capital. Some tax scholars have argued that differences in the ways different kinds of capital and investment are taxed contribute to economic distortions.|$|E

Reclaiming these lands was {{extremely important to}} Henry, who used terms such as [...] "reclaiming his inheritance", [...] "restoring his rights" [...] and [...] "defending his legal claims" [...] to the territories in diplomatic correspondence. The French kings had an increasing financial, and thus military, advantage over Henry.

500|$|Prior to the 2011–2012 season, Barcelona had a {{long history}} of {{avoiding}} corporate sponsorship on the playing shirts. On 14 July 2006, the club announced a five-year agreement with UNICEF, which includes having the UNICEF logo on their shirts. The agreement had the club donate €1.5million per year to UNICEF (0.7% of its <b>ordinary</b> <b>income,</b> equal to the UN International Aid Target, cf. ODA) via the FC Barcelona Foundation. The FC Barcelona Foundation is an entity set up in 1994 on the suggestion of then-chairman of the Economical-Statutory Committee, Jaime Gil-Aluja. The idea was to set up a foundation that could attract financial sponsorships to support a non-profit sport company. In 2004, a company could become one of 25 [...] "Honorary members" [...] by contributing between £40,000–60,000 (£–) per year. There are also 48 associate memberships available for an annual fee of £14,000 (£) and an unlimited number of [...] "patronages" [...] for the cost of £4,000 per year (£). It is unclear whether the honorary members have any formal say in club policy, but according to the author Anthony King, it is [...] "unlikely that Honorary Membership would not involve at least some informal influence over the club".|$|E
500|$|Individuals {{under the}} current system who {{accumulated}} savings from <b>ordinary</b> <b>income</b> (by choosing not to spend their money when the income was earned) paid taxes on that income before it was placed in savings (such as a Roth IRA or CD). When individuals spend above the poverty level with money saved {{under the current}} system, that spending would be subject to the FairTax. People living through the transition may find both their earnings and their spending taxed. Critics have stated that the FairTax would result in unfair double taxation for savers and suggest it does not address the transition effect on some taxpayers who have accumulated significant savings from after-tax dollars, especially retirees who have finished their careers and switched to spending down their life savings. Supporters of the plan argue that the current system is no different, since compliance costs and [...] "hidden taxes" [...] embedded in the prices of goods and services cause savings to be [...] "taxed" [...] a second time already when spent. The rebate would supplement accrued savings, covering taxes up to the poverty level. The income taxes on capital gains, estates, social security and pension benefits would be eliminated under FairTax. In addition, the FairTax legislation adjusts Social Security benefits for changes in the price level, so a percentage increase in prices would result in an equal percentage increase to Social Security income. Supporters suggest these changes would offset paying the FairTax under transition conditions.|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{policies}} {{proposed that}} economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were {{low enough to}} spur investment, which would then lead to higher employment and wages. Critics labeled this [...] "trickle-down economics"—the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a [...] "trickle-down" [...] effect to the poor. Questions arose whether Reagan's policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty, and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as indifferent to their struggles. These views were exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Reagan's economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at $3.35 an hour, slashing federal assistance to local governments by 60%, cutting the budget for public housing and Section 8 rent subsidies in half, and eliminating the antipoverty Community Development Block Grant program. The widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before Reagan's economic policies took effect. Along with Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income, he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20%. Reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on <b>ordinary</b> <b>income</b> like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28%. Reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times {{over the course of his}} presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility. According to Paul Krugman, [...] "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger than Mr.Clinton's 1993 tax increase." [...] According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut.|$|E
