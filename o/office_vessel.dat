[p.27]The {{next step}} was to find out when the local steamer would start for Cairo, and {{accordingly}} I betook myself to the Transit <b>Office.</b> No <b>vessel</b> was advertised; I was directed to call every evening till satisfied. At last the fortunate event took place: a [...] "weekly departure," [...] which, by the bye, occurred once every fortnight or so, was in orders for the next day. I hurried to the office, but did not reach it till past noon-the hour of idleness. A little, dark gentleman-Mr. Green-so formed and dressed as exactly to resemble a liver-and-tan bull-terrier, who with his heels on the table was dosing, cigar in mouth, over the last [...] "Galignani," [...] positively refused, after a time,-for at first he would not speak at all,-to let me take my passage till three in the afternoon. I inquired when the boat started, upon which he referred me, as I had spoken bad Italian, to the advertisement. I pleaded inability to read or write, whereupon he testily cried Alle nove! alle nove!-at nine! at nine! Still appearing uncertain, I drove him out of his chair, when he rose with a curse and read 8 A.M. An unhappy Eastern, depending upon what he said, would have been precisely one hour too late.|$|R

The output of the SBSD approach is a list of volumes needed for the new build. Based on these volume demands combined with some experience data several key numbers and useful data like hull form and costs be derived. The list of volumes combined with a template describing their order and constraints can be utilized to create early 3 D-sketches of the new ship. A prototype for this has been developed. The SBSD approach fulfills the requirements for sketching tools by Buxton (2006) and Gross (2006) and has the potential of being an efficient sketching tool for the designer that can follow the project through the initial design process. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Initially it {{was decided}} that the normal {{civilian}} postal service to Turkey and the Black Sea was sufficient and therefore no British Post Office representative was sent to handle the Army's mails. Mail was despatched from London via the French 'overland route' and onto Constantinople (now Istanbul). There it was handed to the French Consular Postal Service who in turn, passed it to the French Army Post Office for distribution to the British Army.Mail from the British Army was despatched on the French packets from Constantinople to Malta. At Malta it was transferred via the British Post <b>Office</b> agent onto <b>vessels</b> bound for Southampton. The outbound system from Britain proved to be both expensive and inadequate. William Howard Russell, The Times correspondent reported: There is always something wrong about our letters. At present the French Post Office here is a receptacle of several hundred letters addressed to the generals, staff officers and officers of every Regiment which the French postmaster refuses to give up until some chivalrous person pays £12 (300 francs) for the whole bundle and to take the chance of being repaid by the various persons.....to whom they are addressed.|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Risk managementThe main safety {{technique}} used for Subsea 7 work activities is hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA). This process {{shows how the}} work activities are conducted, supervised and managed correctly, in accordance with approved practices. The biggest challenge is communicating the risk {{out to the people}} executing the work. Make them understand the risk tied to the work. The goals with this master thesis were comparing different uncertainty factors and evaluate the different methods used in HIRA procedure. See what type of uncertainty tied to the procedures. What methods that are best in Subsea 7 type of operations. Finally investigate the information received from the vessel. Uncertainty tied to the HIRAs The main purpose was to prove that Subsea 7 had to take uncertainty into the calculation of risk. It shows that the risk description can be split into two parts, one covering events and consequences, and another that covers uncertainty. This acknowledges that risk cannot only be described and evaluated by referring to probabilities and evaluated consequences. It needs to be evaluated together with an uncertainty factor U. If Subsea 7 implement factor U they will reduce the hazards from occurring. Methods used to identify measure and communicate risk Subsea 7 HIRA contains parts of different risk identification methods and that is important for getting a better risk picture of the operation. The different techniques that are implemented are guidewords and task analysis. But it should also implement parts from SWIFT like “what if analysis”, this will question the procedures more. Also use FMECA on critical equipment so they don’t risk the whole operation stopping. That should give them better information about where the hazards are hidden. The best way of preparing the procedures is a combination of al the method evaluated, but that is time consuming. The HIRAs are a good tool for finding the hazards and calculating the risk level, but it can be improved by more precise information about where danger is hidden. Subsea 7 can try to upgrade the HIRAs with one or two columns. One with cause (cause of hazards) and split the corrective measures in proactive measures (actions that prevent hazards from occurring) and protective measures (measures that protect people, assets and environment from the hazards). That way the evaluated risk will be easier to communicate out to the people doing the work and they will understand the risk better. The majority of employers who responded to the survey generally felt “safe” regarding offshore hazards and “satisfied” regarding safety measures on board their vessel. The respondents felt that the communication between the <b>office</b> and <b>vessel</b> could be better, and make the safety procedures user-friendlier. That could be something to focus on when management are making the new safety procedures for Subsea 7...|$|R
25|$|After {{five years}} of instability, the Crown {{appointed}} a sailor and merchant named Francisco Danío Granados as governor of Puerto Rico. It is possible that Enríquez already knew him through Gutiérrez, who purchased merchandise from his company. Like those that preceded him, Danío wanted to quickly gain a profit. As a dominant local merchant, this appointment would normally threaten Enríquez, but {{it seems likely that}} he was involved to some degree in the election process. He went on to donate 4,000 pieces of eight before Danío' was sworn into office and provided an additional sum of 300 as a gift. Two months before the new governor took <b>office,</b> the <b>vessel</b> ordered during Gutiérrez's term docked at San Juan. Danío quickly tried to recruit a crew for it, but was largely ignored by the Puerto Rican sailors, who could earn a better profit by working independently as privateers. Furthermore, Enríquez likely felt that this would affect his business and conversely sabotaged the recruitment. This convinced Danío to order it to sail to Cartagena in search of a crew, which later mutinied during the return trip forcing a change in course that ultimately lead to the vessel being lost. With this struck of luck, Enríquez's business was now secure and he quickly pursued the favor of the governor, forming a mutually beneficial alliance. Under these circumstances, Danío formed a pseudo-commercial alliance with the privateer. On occasion, they staged the capture of a vessel so that merchandise could be sold without taxes or restrictions. With mutual complicity, they then shared the profit in even halves. However, any losses would fall on Enríquez. Eventually, Danío ordered the construction of a brigantine and registered the vessel under both of their names. The ship was captured and Enríquez was forced to use his own money to recover it, once again registering it under both names. A vessel named La Aurora was registered in a similar fashion and the earnings of its three voyages were divided equally. Other of his sloops, such as San Miguel and Los Montes, served a similar purpose. Enríquez also bought a sloop in Cádiz {{for the sole purpose of}} transporting the governor' nephew, Jacome Danío. From that moment onwards, the fleet would be dispatched without question for any purpose that the governor requested. Among the missions issued by Danío, Enríquez sent ships to guard the local coasts and capture contrabandists. They also served the Crown in other assignments, such as providing transport to stranded Jesuit priests. He went as far as paying some of the governor's debts and helping members of his family. These actions costed Enríquez money and men, but for some time served their goal of earning him the favor of Danío. The privateering business continued to grow under this model. By 1710, Enríquez built a brigantine to add to the fleet in his own shipyard. This dockyard was also used to repair other vessels, especially those that belonged to the Crown. On April 6, 1710, Danío requested that one of Enríquez's ships was used to transport important documents to Spain. A sloop named La Perla was chosen for this task, carrying some loot gathered through privateering and also ferrying five prisoners that had been sentenced to death. The vessel docked and immediately received a license to sell the unregistered loot, earning a second license that allowed it to import European merchandise in its return voyage. Enríquez continued to strengthen his reputation locally, taking over the cost of repairing the fortifications and supplying the military hospitals.|$|R
