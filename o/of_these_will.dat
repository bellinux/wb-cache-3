5|$|There is {{relatively}} little parking {{elsewhere on the}} site, other than the 190-space facility at the Sainsbury's supermarket; this is partly mitigated by the retention of the London Road multi-storey car park, located between Block C and the A23 London Road itself. The residential areas in particular have very few dedicated parking spaces. Block K will have 27 spaces to be shared between the hotel and the office building; nine <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>will</b> be for disabled drivers. The master plan proposed 34 (including five on-street spaces), {{all of which were}} allocated to the office building.|$|E
5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>will</b> be used to transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in {{a great deal of}} detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong 64 is a 3D {{platforming}} adventure game {{in which}} the player, as Donkey Kong and his friends, explores an island and collects items to progress through minigames and puzzles. The game follows a traditional storyline for the series: King K. Rool and his reptilian Kremlings invade Donkey Kong's idyllic island and kidnap his friends. After a tutorial, the player embarks as Donkey Kong to rescue them from the kidnappers. While exploring the in-game world and completing puzzle minigames, the player collects bananas; enough <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>will</b> grant the player access to boss fights, which, in turn, unlock new in-game worlds. Most of the game's puzzles are simple, and involve rearranging items, manipulating switches and tiles, or matching items as in the game Concentration. Minigames include races, minecart rides, and barrels that shoot the characters as projectiles. There are five such banana-rewarding objectives for each of five playable characters across eight themed worlds—200 goals in total, {{in addition to a}} connecting overworld. Unlike in prior Donkey Kong games, the objectives can be completed in any order. The player can fast travel between sections of the level with designated warp pads, and can swap between characters in designated swap barrels. The player also collects banana coins, which unlock new weapons and abilities, and other collectibles such as weapon ammunition and blueprint puzzle pieces. As in other games by the developer, the player often encounters an impossible situation (e.g., an indestructible object or out-of-reach area) and must eventually backtrack to resolve the impasse after acquiring a new ability.|$|E

25|$|Pignut hickory {{begins to}} bear seed in {{quantity}} in 30 years, with optimum production between 75 and 200 years (16). The maximum age for seed production is about 300 years. Good seed crops occur every year or two with light crops in other years; frost can seriously hinder seed production (22). Usually {{less than half of}} the seeds are sound (2,3), but 50 to 75 percent <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>will</b> germinate. The hickory shuckworm (Laspeyresia caryana) can seriously reduce germination. Pignut seed, averaging 440/kg (200/lb), is lighter than the seed of other hickory species. The nuts are disseminated mainly by gravity, but the range of seeding is extended by squirrels and chipmunks.|$|E
25|$|The {{instrument}} {{was constructed in}} three phases. The first phase consisted of a 7-element 95nbsp&GHz array to demonstrate the technology. The second phase aims to mount a 91-element 95nbsp&GHz array (with 18nbsp&GHz bandwidth) and a 19-element 43nbsp&GHz array (with 8nbsp&GHz bandwidth) on 1.4nbsp&m cassegrain telescopes, mounted on what is currently the CBI platform. It is expected that these will start observing in 2008. The third phase aims to construct four further arrays by around 2010. Two <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>will</b> be at 43nbsp&GHz, with 91 elements each, {{and the other two}} will be at 95nbsp&GHz, with 397 elements each.

25|$|Since the 2004–05 season, {{penalties}} {{have existed}} for clubs entering financial administration during the season. If a club enters administration before 31 March {{of any given}} season, they will immediately be deducted 12 points; entering administration from 1 April onward will see the points deduction either held over {{until the end of}} the season (if the club finishes outside the relegation places), or applied the following season (if the club was relegated anyway). It is also required that a club exiting administration agree a Creditor's Voluntary Agreement, and pay in full any other footballing creditors. Failure to do either <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>will</b> result in a second, potentially unlimited (though in practise usually between 15 and 20) points deduction.|$|E
25|$|In a May 2017 patch for Rivals, the Rivals mode {{switched}} to an 8-week Seasonal system, rewarding Crews for placement {{at the end}} of the season with unique in-game gear, and eliminating demotions. The update also introduced Missions, similar to the Challenges used in Rock Band 3, that require players to meet certain goals to complete; some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>will</b> include Missions for Crews as well as single-player challenges. Completing Missions earns unique badges players can showcase on their user profile in-game. The new server architecture of Rock Band 4 allowed Harmonix to update and add Missions over time without having to patch the game. With the second Season in this new format, Harmonix will offer a Season Spotlight Pass that give the purchaser eight new songs over that Season that are featured as Spotlight songs in the Rivals challenges at a small discount over buying all eight songs individually.|$|E
25|$|The high {{symmetry}} of the double-cone topology of the linear E ⊗ e JT system directly reflects the high underlying symmetry. It {{is one of}} the earliest (if not the earliest) examples in the literature of a conical intersection of potential energy surfaces. Conical intersections have received wide attention in the literature starting in the 1990s and are now considered paradigms of nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics, with far-reaching consequences in molecular spectroscopy, photochemistry and photophysics. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>will</b> be commented upon further below. In general, conical intersections are far less symmetric than depicted in the figure. They can be tilted and elliptical in shape etc., and also peaked and sloped intersections have been distinguished in the literature. Furthermore, for more than two degrees of freedom, they are not point-like structures but instead they are seams and complicated, curved hypersurfaces, also known as intersection space. The coordinate sub-space displayed in the figure is also known as a branching plane.|$|E

25|$|On 25 January 2011, Airport Authority Hong Kong (AA) {{unveiled}} phase 1 of its midfield {{development project}} which is targeted for completion {{by the end}} of 2015. The midfield area is located to the west of Terminal 1 and between the two existing runways. It is the last piece of land on the airport island available for large-scale development. This will include 20 aircraft parking stands, three <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>will</b> be wide enough to serve the Airbus A380 and cater for an additional 10million passengers annually. Passengers will reach the concourse through an extension of the underground automated people mover. A Joint Venture of Mott MacDonald and Arup led the design of the project, supported by a range of consultants including Architecture firm Aedas. The Concourse began operations on 28 December 2015, and the first flight that used it was the HX658 operated by the Hong Kong Airlines flying from Hong Kong to Okinawa. On 31 March 2016, the Concourse was officially inaugurated in a ceremony marking its full commissioning.|$|E
25|$|There {{are eight}} {{boarding}} houses, nine {{including the one}} no longer in operation, on the campus. The houses are run by a small team of teachers. The House Master (HM) has overall responsibility and is helped by the Assistant House Master (AHM). Either or both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>will</b> be present at the daily house meeting and will oversee homework to make sure pupils are studying. The HM will organise any special house events, decide who the house captain {{will be for the}} term as well as choosing a captain to take care of other house related goings on. The HM is also the person who most pupils would talk to if they had a problem although all teachers are available for help. Both the HM and the AHM normally have residences within the houses and so are very much part of the house. Each house has a matron who helps the pupils through their daily routine as well as a tutor to help the pupils in their studies. The year a pupil is in, and the amount of rooms in the house decides which pupils are allowed a room of their own, although it is normally decided that younger years share whilst senior pupils get their own rooms. All pupils rotate rooms each term.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the rare confrontation with an adult brown bear or gray wolf pack, adult black bears are not usually subject to natural predation. However, as evidenced by scats with fur inside of them and the recently discovered carcass of an adult sow with puncture marks in the skull, black bears may occasionally have fallen and still do fall prey to jaguars in the southern parts of their range. In such scenarios, the big cat would have the advantage if it ambushed the bear, killing it with a crushing bite {{to the back of the}} skull. Black bear cubs tend to be more vulnerable to predation than adults. Known predators of bear cubs have included bobcats, coyotes, cougars, wolves, brown bears and other bears of their own species. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>will</b> stealthily snatch small cubs right from under the sleeping mother. There is a single record of a golden eagle snatching a yearling cub. Once out of hibernation, mother bears may be able to fight off most potential predators. Even cougars will be displaced by an angry mother bear if they are discovered stalking the cubs. Flooding of dens after birth may also occasionally kill newborn cubs. However, in current times, American black bear fatalities are overwhelmingly attributable to human activities. Seasonally, tens of thousands of black bears are hunted legally across North America, with many more being illegally poached or trapped. Auto collisions also may claim many black bear lives annually.|$|E
