40|$|Flame-detector-rod holder {{is easily}} {{removed from the}} wall of a {{gas-fired}} furnance for maintenance or replacement of the detector rod without requiring shutdown of the furnace. The holder consists of an externally threaded <b>outer</b> <b>bushing,</b> a sleeve which is held inside the <b>outer</b> <b>bushing</b> with a set screw, and a detector rod assembly which screws into the sleeve...|$|E
5000|$|The Stud Cattle Pavilion (70 x 9 metres) {{consists}} of a long building (45.7 metres) and a shorter building (18.3 metres) separated by an open area (6 metres) with a small parade ground outside the northern entrance which is shaded by a mature Albizia (Albizia julibrissin [...] ). Both buildings are of similar rural vernacular construction with inner and <b>outer</b> <b>bush</b> timber pole columns supporting a gable roof of corrugated galvanised steel sheeting on sawn hardwood rafters and beams and are painted white internally. The side walls are clad in painted corrugated galvanised steel on timber rails fixed to the <b>outer</b> <b>bush</b> timber poles with openings, for light and ventilation, covered in an open steel mesh spaced along their length. Bolted along the rails are various styles of forged iron and steel rings for tethering cattle. A skillion roofed storage area {{has been added to}} the southern side of the longer building.|$|R
50|$|After {{the second}} World War, architects in Australia were {{influenced}} {{by the development of}} the International style of architecture. Some regional variations developed. In Melbourne, Robin Boyd and Roy Grounds articulated a Melbourne interpretation of the modern style. Boyd's book Victorian Modern (1947) traced the history of architecture in the state of Victoria and described a style of architecture that he hoped would be a response to local surroundings as well as the popular international style. In particular he nominated the work of Roy Grounds and in some <b>outer</b> suburban <b>bush</b> houses of the 1930s as being the early stages of such a style. Grounds and Boyd later worked in partnership.|$|R
50|$|Socket fusion (SF) is {{a process}} where the outside {{diameter}} of the pipe uses a “close fit” match to the inner diameter of a fitting. Both pipe and fitting are heated on a <b>bushing</b> (<b>outer</b> and inner, respectively) for a prescribed period of time. Then the pipe is pressed into the fitting. Upon cooling the welded parts are removed from the clamp.|$|R
40|$|The rod {{component}} of the bacterial flagellum polymerizes from the inner membrane across the periplasmic space and stops at a length of 25 nm at the <b>outer</b> membrane. <b>Bushing</b> structures, the P- and L-rings, polymerize around the distal rod and form a pore in the outer membrane. The flagellar hook structure is then added to the distal rod growing outside the cell. Hook polymerization stops after the rod–hook structure reaches ∼ 80 nm in length. This study describes mutants in the distal rod protein FlgG that fail to terminate rod growth. The mutant FlgG subunits continue to polymerize close {{to the length of}} the normal rod–hook structure of 80 nm. These filamentous rod structures have multiple P-rings and fail to form the L-ring pore at the outer membrane. The flagella grow within the periplasm similar to spirochete flagella. This provides a simple method to evolve intracellular flagella as in spirochetes. The mechanism that couples rod growth termination to the ring assembly and outer membrane penetration exemplifies the importance of stopping points in the construction of a complex macromolecular machine that facilitate efficient coupling to {{the next step in the}} assembly pathway...|$|R
60|$|Coming soon to that <b>outer</b> {{fringe of}} <b>bushes,</b> beyond {{which there was}} no cover, they dropped on hands and knees and went forward in that manner until they reached a spot whence {{a good view of the}} buffalo could be obtained. The black eyes of the two Indians glittered, and the red of their bronzed faces deepened with emotion as they gazed. And truly it was a sight well {{calculated}} to stir to the very centre men whose chief business of life was the chase, and whose principal duty was to procure food for their women and children, for the whole plain away to the horizon was dotted with groups of those monarchs of the western prairies. They were grazing quietly, as though such things as the rattle of guns, the whiz of arrows, the thunder of horse-hoofs, and the yells of savages had never sounded in their ears.|$|R
50|$|As with {{standard}} roller chains, self-lubricating roller chains consist of five basic parts: inner plates, <b>outer</b> plates, pins, <b>bushes,</b> and rollers. However, the bushes for self-lubricating chains are sintered metal bushes. Sintered-metal self-lubricating bearings {{are based on}} powder-metallurgy technology. They are economical, suitable for high production rates and can be manufactured to precision tolerances.Specifically, alloyed powdered metal is mixed, then compacted to form the bushing. The initial compaction {{to a large degree}} dictates the density, shape, dimensions, and mechanical properties of the finished part.The bushings are then sintered.Sintered materials have inherent porosity and the presence of pores have both beneficial and detrimental role on the part performance. The pores act as stress concentration zones and reduce the mechanical strength and ductility. However, the presence of pores acts also contribute to the reduction in noise and vibration also serve as lubricant pockets in lubricated contacts. Sintered bearings and gears are also used in many applications where the external lubrication is not possible or not preferred.It is essential that the pores form an interconnected system of controlled size and volume, so that oil is supplied to the entire bearing surface. The rate of oil supply automatically increases with temperature and, therefore, with increasing speeds of rotation, to achieve optimum working conditions.|$|R
