40|$|In this work, the {{performances}} of the photovoltaic pumping destined to supply drinking water in remote and scattered small villages have been studied. The methodology adopted proposes various procedures based on the water consumption profiles, <b>total</b> <b>head,</b> tank capacity and photovoltaic array peak power. A method of the load losses probability (LLP) {{has been used to}} optimize sizing of the photovoltaic pumping systems with a similarity between the storage energy in batteries and water in tanks. The results were carried out using measured meteorological data for four localities in Algeria: Algiers and Oran in the north, Bechar and Tamanrasset in the south. The results show that the performance of the photovoltaic pumping system depends deeply on the <b>pumping</b> <b>total</b> <b>head</b> and the peak power of the photovoltaic array. Also, for the southern localities, the LLP method shows that the size of the photovoltaic array varies versus LLP on a small scale. On the other hand, for the northern localities, the sizing of the photovoltaic array is situated on a large scale power. Because of the current high crud-oil price, the photovoltaic pumping still to be the best adopted energy resource to supply drinking water in remote and scattered villages.

40|$|PaperPg. 189 - 194. This paper {{describes}} {{the relationships of}} inlet velocity distribution, incipient cavitation and suction performance of centrifugal pumps. It also discusses, in particular, the aspects of cavitation as related to inlet reverse flow (internal recirculation). There are many ways of improving the suction performance of centrifugal pumps. Enlarging the inlet diameter or inlet angle {{are two of the}} most commonly used methods. However, this may increase the capacity at which inlet reverse flow begins. Inlet reverse flow normally starts to occur at about half of the shock-free inlet capacity, and this has no relation to the best efficiency flow. <b>Pump</b> <b>total</b> <b>head</b> begins to drop only during advanced cavitation, especially at partial flow operation. When the impeller is designed with a large inlet angle to improve suction performance, there is a possibility of increasing the capacity where inlet reverse flow occurs, which may even be at the best efficiency point. There are still other ways of improving suction performance without increasing the capacity at which inlet reverse flow occurs, e. g. reducing the number of blades, sharpening inlet edges, etc., and these are also referred to in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Passive {{flow control}} {{techniques}} {{are used to}} improve the flow field and efficiency of centrifugal pumps and turbomachines, in general.

A passive flow control is realized using three different blade leading edge angles in order to reduce the cavitation development and enhance the pump performance.

The pressure-loss in a nozzle is lower than that in a diffuser, therefore one-way flow is realized in the nozzle direction. The frequency characteristics and the pump characteristics are measured.

Different irrigation levels were obtained by holding the application depth constant and allowing the irrigation interval to vary from 1 to 5 days. Silt loam and loamy sand soils, two root depths, two water contents at planting time, <b>total</b> <b>pumping</b> <b>heads</b> ranging from 0 to 800 m, four ratios of energy cost to commodity price and climatic data for the 1974 growing season at Davis, California were examined. The different variable combinations resulted {{in a wide range}} of crop water deficit and yield. Results indicated that, for given combinations, slight deficit (ratios of actual to potential transpiration larger than 0. 89) provided higher net benefit than full irrigation. Larger deficits were never advantageous across the diverse range of conditions examined, indicating that potential benefits are associated with only a narrow range of irrigation deficits. This result illustrates the risk involved when deficit irrigation is practiced. Large soil water holding capacity, high soil water contents at planting and deep root exploration were found important for successful implementation of deficit irrigation. <b>Total</b> <b>pumping</b> <b>head</b> and the ratio of energy cost to commodity price were important factors in determining the feasibility of deficit irrigation for the conditions examined. It was also found that the level of irrigation which maximized net benefits tended to be lower for situations where the quantity of water available for irrigation was fixed and the amount of land which could be irrigated was unlimited than when there was sufficient water to fully irrigate the entire farm. Situations where deficit irrigation is a more effective way of reducing energy cost than reducing system operating pressure were ob served. Peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel valveless {{impedance}} pump is used, for {{the first}} time, in the thermal management of high-performance electronic systems. This small pump comprises an amber latex rubber tube, connected at both ends to rigid copper tubes of different acoustic impedance, and a simple, economic, quiet, and energy-efficient actuation mechanism, which combines a small dc motor and a cam. The motor-activated cam periodically compresses the elastic tube at a position asymmetric from the tube ends. Traveling waves emitted from the compression combine with reflected waves at the impedance-mismatched positions (rubber tube/copper tube interfaces). The resulting wave interference creates a pressure gradient, {{with the potential to}} generate a net flow. Several experimental setups for performance tests, using a single impedance pump, an open system with isothermal flow, and a closed liquid cooling system are designed and implemented. The performance of the impedance pump is affected significantly by the actuation frequency (input voltage) and position. The pump flow rate varies nonlinearly with the actuation frequency.
