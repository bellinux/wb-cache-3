5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the restructuring, in 2006 the LCR consortium consisted of engineering consultants and construction firms Arup, Bechtel, Halcrow and Systra (which form Rail Link Engineering (RLE)); transport operators National Express and SNCF (which operates the Eurostar (UK) share of the Eurostar service with the National Railway Company of Belgium and British Airways); electricity company EDF; and UBS Investment Bank. On completion of section 1 by RLE, the line was handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Union Railways (South), which then handed it <b>over</b> <b>to</b> London & Continental Stations and Property (LCSP), the long-term owners of the line. Once section 2 of the line had been completed it was handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Union Railways (North), which handed it <b>over</b> <b>to</b> LCSP. The entire line, including St Pancras, is managed, operated and maintained by Network Rail (CTRL).|$|E
5|$|A non-supercharged {{version of}} the Merlin using a larger {{proportion}} of steel and iron components was produced for use in tanks. This engine, the Rolls-Royce Meteor, in turn led to the smaller Rolls-Royce Meteorite.

5|$|An {{original}} typescript of {{the laws}} signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps in 1945. It {{ended up in the}} possession of General George S.

During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Huntington Library, where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault.

2500|$|Bedfordshire batted {{first at}} Luton. They progressed slowly, making their first 50 in the 23rd over. Whilst they {{improved}} to 143 for 9 in their 50 overs, {{it was never}} going to be enough. By way of comparison, it took Sussex six <b>overs</b> <b>to</b> reach their first 50, with Ian Ward (65 off 44) scoring most of the early runs, although admittedly batting was easier on the drying pitch. Sussex overhauled their modest target with 31.3 <b>overs</b> <b>to</b> go - almost two thirds of their allotted quota.|$|R

25|$|The Netherlands' {{target was}} {{therefore}} 198 to win (in 36 <b>overs),</b> or 197 <b>to</b> tie. It is fair that their target was increased, {{even though they}} had the same number of <b>overs</b> <b>to</b> bat as Australia, as Australia would have batted less conservatively in their first 28 overs, and scored more runs at the expense of more wickets, if they had known that their innings would only be 36 overs long. Increasing the Netherlands' target score neutralizes the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the <b>overs</b> <b>to</b> bat they thought they would get. The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 minus& 122 = 75 runs.|$|R

5|$|Dismantling {{the sets}} cost $125,000. Almost all the filmmaking {{equipment}} was turned <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Italian government, which sold and exported it.

The chariots were also returned to the U.S., where they were used as promotional props. The life-size galleys and pirate ships were dismantled to prevent them from being used by competing studios. Some of the horses were adopted by the men who trained them, while others were sold. Many of the camels, donkeys, and other exotic animals were sold to circuses and zoos in Europe.|$|E

Eventually century-maker Kallicharran was dismissed, then Holder given out caught behind with 6.2 <b>overs</b> <b>to</b> go. Holder showed dissent at the decision, leaving Australia one wicket to get – but the crowd reacted badly to Holder's response and a riot ensued, forcing both teams to leave the field. It was eventually decided not to continue the game into a sixth day and the game as ruled a draw.|$|R
