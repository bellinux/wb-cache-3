5|$|In {{addition}} to her column, Michelena wrote occasional articles intended for a wider readership. She wrote in October 1916 about the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> picture industry in a multiple-article series, beginning her account with a retelling of Eadweard Muybridge's action photograph of Governor Leland Stanford's racehorse named Occident. She defined this high-speed image as essential {{to the development of}} moving pictures.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{viscosity}} <b>of</b> gases is <b>the</b> {{result in}} <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> each molecule of gas {{as they pass}} each other from layer to layer. As gases tend to pass one another, the velocity, in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> momentum, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faster <b>moving</b> molecule speeds up <b>the</b> slower <b>moving</b> molecule. As <b>the</b> slower <b>moving</b> molecule passes <b>the</b> faster <b>moving</b> molecule, <b>the</b> momentum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slower <b>moving</b> particle slows down <b>the</b> faster <b>moving</b> particle. <b>The</b> molecules continue to enact until frictional drag causes both molecules to equalize their velocities.|$|R

Precision also helps to determine <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> nonmoving edge pixels detected as <b>moving</b> edges whereas <b>the</b> second parameter, recall, provides <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> edges missed during the detection process.|$|R
5|$|She wrote popular {{articles}} for newspapers, including an advice column for girls, describing {{what it was}} like to be an actress, and answering questions from readers. For adult readers, Michelena wrote other pieces such as a history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> picture industry. In 1920 when she stopped making films, she returned to her career as a singer.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on January 31, 1911 and was met with generally favorable reviews. Walton <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Picture News was critical, noting the similarities to a film released four days prior by the Gaumont Film Company. The film survives in the Library of Congress.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 4:57pm EDT (20:57 UTC) on Monday, June 22, 2009, Washington Metro Train 112, bound from Glenmont for Shady Grove, {{left the}} Takoma station. Minutes later at 5:02pm, Train 112 rear-ended Train 214, which was stopped between the Takoma and Fort Totten stations {{while waiting for}} another train to leave the Fort Totten station. Nine people were killed, including the operator in the lead car <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> train, Jeanice McMillan, 42, of Springfield, Virginia; at least 80 people were injured. The death toll makes the crash the deadliest in Metro history.|$|E

(A practical Fourier transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> mirror.

Meanwhile, Mulder enters the train and finds that the secret railcar is quarantined and protected by a security system. He searches for Zama, enlisting the train conductor for help. In Zama's compartment, they find hand-written journals in Japanese. However, elsewhere on the train, the Red-Haired Man intercepts and strangles Zama.|$|E

Later in April 2014, during the Museum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moving</b> Image's salute to Kevin Spacey, Bennett told a reporter that the album would be released during September. On July 29, 2014, Bennett and Gaga appeared on The Today Show to formally announce their collaboration and confirmed the final release date in the US as September 23, 2014.

5|$|The film debuted at the Broadway Theater on June 15, 1917. After its debut, {{the film}} {{received}} many bids from buyers for the film. The original film had seven reels, but the June 30 edition <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Picture World {{stated that it}} was six reels for unknown reasons. Shortly after the film's completion, S. Rankin Drew sailed for France to join the American Ambulance Corps. He was killed in action when his plane was shot down over France during the First World War on May 19, 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} at Miami International Airport {{was partly}} {{shot at the}} Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, which is known from British car show Top Gear, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports. In filming the scene in which the engine thrust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards {{at the moment of}} full extension away from the plane.|$|E

5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 11, the Hassayampa Freeway, is a {{proposed}} Interstate Highway in the United States {{to run from}} Casa Grande, Arizona Northwest to Las Vegas, Nevada by way of Kingman, Arizona. The highway will parallel and/or upgrade existing U.S. 93 north of Wickenburg, Arizona; south of Wickenburg, it will follow a new freeway near the Hassayampa River, turning Southeast near southern Goodyear, through Casa Grande and Interstate 10, and to its terminus with intersection of the proposed Pinal North-South Freeway near Coolidge, AZ. Interstate 11 {{is part of a}} long-range vision for the Valley's future transportation needs, as defined by the Maricopa Association of Governments and ADOT. Interstate 11 was approved June 30, 2012 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moving</b> Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act. In June 2013, a joint draft study commissioned by the respective DOTs of Arizona and Nevada concluded that the freeway was justified, citing benefits in travel, tourism, trade, and economic growth. The conclusion of the study further clears the way for Interstate 11's funding and implementation.|$|E
5|$|Khonsari first {{discussed}} {{the game in}} February 2011, announcing it as 1979: The Game. It was initially intended to be episodic, consisting of three or nine episodes, but was later reduced to one game. A crowdfunding campaign for the game was launched on Kickstarter in 2013 with a goal of US$395,000, but failed to reach its goal, {{with a total of}} US$304,741 raised. Additional fundraising was set up on the game's website. Following the failed campaign, the team partnered with the New Frontier Story Lab at Sundance in 2014 and 2015, the Museum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moving</b> Image in New York, and the Doris Duke Foundation. 1979 Revolution was approved through Steam Greenlight in July 2015, and was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X on April 5, 2016, for iOS devices on June 10, 2016, and for Android devices on December 14, 2016; console versions are also in development. The game is also planned to have Oculus Rift support; the team rewrote one of the interrogation scenes to fit with the experience. 1979 Revolution runs on the Unity game engine. Khonsari has expressed interest in a sequel, stating that it depends on the commercial success of the first game. He is also interested in developing additional games about other historical events.|$|E

5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown Cork and Seal Co. to cork and seal soda water bottles. Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, the neck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> bottles became {{stuck in the}} machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.|$|E
5|$|The Government of India honoured Mani with Padma Shri in 2002. He has won several National Film Awards, Filmfare Awards, Filmfare Awards South {{and state}} awards. Apart from these awards, {{many of his}} films have been {{screened}} at various film festivals and have won numerous accolades. Geethanjali, directed by him won the Golden Lotus Award for Best Popular Film at the 37th National Film Awards. Other films like Mouna Ragam, Anjali, and Kannathil Muthamittal have won the Best Regional Film awards at the National Film Awards. Two of his films, Roja and Bombay have won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration. The former was also nominated for Best Film category at the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. In 2010, Mani was honoured with Jaeger-Lecoultre Glory to the Filmmaker at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. In July 2015, he was honoured with the Sun Mark Lifetime Achievement Award at the Bagri Foundation London Indian Film Festival for his esteemed contribution to international cinema. Around the same time, the Museum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moving</b> Image, New York City, paid a special tribute to Mani. His films Roja, Bombay, and Dil Se were screened at the museum as a retrospective.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on February 21, 1911. The film was originally set to be released under the title The Patriot Maid of '76. The reason for the title change {{was due to the}} release by the Rex Motion Picture Company's A Heroine of '76 on February 16, 1911. Though the film bears similarity in title and character, the plots were entirely different. Rex's film was also the first release by the new company. For the release of this patriotic film, Thanhouser made additional efforts for promoting the film in trade publications. A film still was used as the cover illustration on the February 11, 1911 issue <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Picture News and a full-page still would be included in the The Moving Picture Worlds February 11 issue.|$|E
