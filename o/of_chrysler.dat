5|$|The {{vehicles}} in the show were provided by the Chrysler Corporation, {{as opposed to the}} parent series' vehicles that came from the Ford Motor Company. Although Jeeps are also prominent in the show, the brand itself would not become a part <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> until the AMC buyout that occurred in 1987.|$|E
5|$|During the {{development}} of the C9, the management of the bankruptcy-threatened Chrysler Corporation decided to divest itself of its debt-ridden European operations. The buyer was the French PSA Group, formed in 1976 after Peugeot took over Citroën. The deal was finalised in 1978, in which the buyer paid US$1.00 for the entirety <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Europe and its obligations. The take-over was effective as of 1 January 1979.|$|E

5|$|I-75 {{has five}} named {{segments}} in Michigan. The southernmost section {{from the state}} line north to the Detroit area is the Detroit–Toledo Expressway. The segment through southern and central Detroit {{is known as the}} Fisher Freeway. It was dedicated on September 17, 1970, to the Fisher Brothers, who founded Fisher Body, later a part of General Motors. After the curve in downtown Detroit, I-75 follows the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway northward. That segment is named for Walter P. Chrysler, founder <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler.</b> The name was chosen by the Detroit Common Council on November 6, 1957, and codified in state law in 1990; the state definition for the name places the northern end of the designation at the Oakland–Genesee county line.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, {{essentially}} all <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler’s</b> {{facilities were}} devoted to building military vehicles. Chrysler ranked eighth among United States corporations {{in the value of}} wartime production contracts. One <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler’s</b> most significant contributions to the war effort, however, was not in the field of vehicles but in the radar field. Chrysler made the converters for the Manhattan Project's K-25 gaseous diffusion plant in their Lynch Road plant in Detroit, after Dr Carl Heussner <b>of</b> the <b>Chrysler</b> plating laboratory solved the nickel plating problem.|$|R

25|$|A {{derivative}} of the 104 coupé {{with a slightly}} longer rear section, the Talbot Samba was launched in 1981, following Peugeot's acquisition <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Europe (and its Talbot marque) in 1978. A cabriolet version of the Samba was developed. Production lasted until 1986.|$|E
25|$|Fiat {{would not}} have to pay any money for its 20% <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler.</b> On 7 June 2009, the Indiana State Police Pension Fund, the Indiana Teacher's Retirement Fund, and the state's Major Moves Construction Fund asked the US Supreme Court to delay the sale <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> to Fiat while they {{challenge}} the deal. The funds argued that the sale went against US bankruptcy law because it unlawfully rewarded unsecured creditors ahead of secured creditors. On 9 June 2009, the Supreme Court lifted the temporary hold, clearing the way for Fiat to acquire Chrysler. See Indiana State Police Pension Trust v. Chrysler for more information. On 10 June, the Supreme Court announced that Fiat was now an owner of the new Chrysler a.k.a. Chrysler Group LLC.|$|E

25|$|The group {{then took}} over the European {{division}} <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> (which were formerly Rootes and Simca), in 1978 as the American auto manufacturer struggled to survive. Soon, the whole Chrysler/Simca range was sold under the revived Talbot badge until production of Talbot-branded passenger cars was shelved in 1987 and on commercial vehicles in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The early 1990s saw {{a revival}} of the Imperial as a {{high-end}} sedan in Chrysler’s lineup. Unlike the 1955–1983 Imperial, this car was a model <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler,</b> not its own marque. Based on the Y platform, it represented the top full-size model in Chrysler's lineup; below it was the similar New Yorker Fifth Avenue, and below that was the New Yorker.|$|E
25|$|Because of the Chrysler bankruptcy, Iacocca {{may lose}} {{part of his}} pension from a {{supplemental}} executive retirement plan, and a guaranteed company car during his lifetime. The losses were due to take place once the bankruptcy court approves the sale <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> to Chrysler Group LLC, with ownership of the new company by the United Auto Workers, the Italian carmaker Fiat and {{the governments of the}} United States and Canada.|$|E
50|$|The Acclaim was {{a version}} <b>of</b> the <b>Chrysler</b> Corporation's AA-body 4-door sedan, {{which was an}} {{evolutionary}} development <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler's</b> extended K-car platform.

25|$|Over the years, Fiat has {{acquired}} numerous other automakers: it acquired Lancia in 1968, became a shareholder of Ferrari in 1969, {{took control of}} Alfa Romeo from the Italian government in 1986, purchased Maserati in 1993, and became the full owner <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Group LLC in 2014. Fiat Group currently produces vehicles under twelve brands: Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Ferrari, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Ram Trucks, and SRT.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{intervened in}} the troubled {{automotive}} industry between 2008 and 2010 in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months, the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> to Italian automaker Fiat and a reorganization of General Motors giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity {{stake in the}} company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{in a deal}} {{brokered}} by the Obama administration, Italian automaker Fiat {{initiated a}} white knight takeover <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> to save the struggling automaker from liquidation. The deal was immediately compared to the AMC-Renault deal; Some commentators noted the irony in that Chrysler now faced the same fate that AMC faced 30 years earlier, while others expressed skepticism of whether the Italian firm could save Chrysler, given how the Renault deal failed. However, there have been key differences between the two; Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne became CEO <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> {{as part of the}} deal and immediately began globally integrating Fiat and Chrysler's assets and product lines; The Fiat-Chrysler merger doesn't face the political opposition the AMC-Renault deal did since Fiat is entirely private and independent and the US Government supported the merger; Most importantly, while AMC proved to be a continuous money-loser for Renault, Chrysler returned to profitability fairly quickly and has since become an important source of revenue and profits for Fiat, which has been struggling to maintain volume and profitability amid the European debt crisis. The two firms would later fully merge to create Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2014.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the other}} GM divisions, Buick {{completely}} restyled its B- and C-body cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than before and also ever after. The styling featured curved bodysides, long hoods and wide expanses of glass, {{similar to that}} <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Corporation's 1969 full-sized cars, but with a lower beltline than the Chrysler products. Semi-fastback rooflines were utilized on two-door hardtop coupes and convertibles had a new top design to permit a full-width rear seat.|$|E
25|$|Bieber also {{pressed for}} {{adoption}} of a national industrial policy. He began pressing for a national industrial policy in June 1983, shortly after his election as UAW president. His efforts reached a high point in 1993, when Bieber the chief executive officers <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler,</b> Ford, and General Motors met with President-elect Bill Clinton—winning Clinton's support for the domestic auto industry. But {{less than a year}} later, Clinton won passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement over Bieber's strenuous objections.|$|E
25|$|Initially Diamond-Star Motors was a 50-50 {{joint venture}} between Chrysler and Mitsubishi. However, in 1991 the Japanese company {{purchased}} its partner's interest, and thereafter the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>Chrysler</b> vehicles was on a contractual basis. Chrysler sold its equity stake to Mitsubishi in 1993, and Diamond-Star Motors was renamed to Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA) on July 1, 1995. Despite the departure, the two companies have maintained various co-operative manufacturing agreements since and considered all vehicle produced until 1995 as Diamond Star Motors.|$|E
