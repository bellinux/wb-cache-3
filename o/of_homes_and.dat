5|$|Outside of Castorland, {{the road}} runs across a half-mile (0.8km) stretch of undeveloped land prior to {{crossing}} the Black River, {{which serves as}} {{the boundary between the}} towns of Denmark and Croghan. On the opposite riverbank, NY410 continues across another open stretch to reach the small hamlet of Naumburg. Here, the route passes a handful <b>of</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> intersects the north end of CR33 (Van Amber Road) before ending at an intersection with NY126 on the northeastern fringe of the hamlet. While NY410 terminates at this junction, its right-of-way continues past NY126 as Cross Road, a local highway connecting Naumburg to CR8 (Second Road).|$|E
5|$|September 13–September 14, 1944– The 1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane {{parallels}} the coastline as a Category2 hurricane, {{with a minimum}} pressure of 965mbar occurring in Cape May. The hurricane causes severe flooding, a storm surge of up to 9.6feet (2.9m), and intense waves of up to 40feet (12m) in height. Along the entire coastline, strong winds gusting to 125mph (201km/h) destroys hundreds <b>of</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> damages thousands, while the ferocious waves wash away fishing piers and boardwalks along the coastline. In all, the hurricane causes $25million (1944USD, $306million 2008USD) in damage and 9deaths in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} homes {{along the route}} begins to {{increase}} as NY38 approaches the village of Newark Valley. Just south of the village limits, NY38 intersects NY38B, a spur leading to NY26 in Maine. The route continues into the small village as South Main Street and passes by several blocks <b>of</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> commercial buildings. At Water Street, NY38 becomes North Main Street; however, from this point north, most of the village is situated on the opposite bank of Owego Creek. As a result, NY38 continues through the village limits but passes very few buildings before seamlessly exiting the community and entering another rural area.|$|E

5|$|The freeway east of Santo Road {{encountered}} delays from environmentalists {{over the}} endangered least Bell's vireo, a songbird which faced habitat destruction, {{as well as}} those concerned with the destruction <b>of</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> businesses for the freeway right-of-way. The extension to Mission Gorge Road opened in 1993, and SR52 was completed to SR125 in 1998. Funding issues delayed the completion of the entire route until 2011, more than fiftyyears after construction began; until then, the city of Santee faced traffic snarls. A widening project was completed in 2007 between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard; further expansion has been put on hold due to state budget concerns.|$|E
