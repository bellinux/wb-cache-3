5|$|The Cormier {{brothers}} were {{the sons of}} Edmond Cormier and Bernadette Doucette. They {{grew up on a}} farm in what is now Memramcook, New Brunswick. Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brothers</b> had long careers as professional wrestlers, while a fifth, Malcolm Cormier, competed briefly before becoming a referee. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brothers</b> wrestled under the family surname, however, as they all adopted ring names. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brothers</b> explained that the brothers' real names were too hard to pronounce, so they adopted other names that were easier for international fans. Yvon Cormier was given the name The Beast, Jean-Louis was known as Rudy Kay, Leonce took the name Leo Burke, and Romeo competed as Bobby Kay. Malcolm, the oldest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brothers</b> involved in wrestling, used the name Mel Turnbow while working as a referee.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine troops {{occupied}} {{large portions}} of Bulgaria, including modern Dobruja, under Emperor John I Tzimiskes (969976). After his death an anti-Byzantine uprising led by four brothers broke out. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brothers,</b> David, was killed by Vlachs in the present-day border region between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia. In 1018, the Byzantines conquered the whole territory of the Bulgarian Empire and the Archbishop of Ohrid acquired ecclesiastic jurisdiction in 1020 over the Vlachs living there.|$|E

The images are made of neem wood in an {{unfinished}} form. The stumps of wood which form the images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brothers</b> have human arms, while that of Subhadra {{does not have any}} arms. The heads are large, painted and non-carved. The faces are marked with distinctive large circular eyes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> name <b>The</b> <b>Brother</b> Moves On is a {{grammatical}} misconfiguration <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Brother</b> Mouzone, {{a fictional}} {{character in the}} American television drama series The Wire. The name arose when both Mthembu <b>brothers</b> were watching <b>the</b> episode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wire entitled [...] "The Brother Moves On" [...] which is <b>the</b> entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hitman <b>The</b> <b>Brother</b> Mouzone. In their emerging stages, the movement interrogated the notion that members were each an impermanent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process. Hence <b>the</b> derivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name <b>The</b> <b>Brother</b> Moves On.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with their}} better-known brothers, Mick and Ray played {{first-class}} cricket for Victoria, although the former moved to Queensland after one season for his native state {{due to a}} lack of opportunities. Neither approached the level of success of Neil or Merv and often found themselves dropped, although Ray was a consistent player for Victoria for two seasons in the 1950s and came close to national selection. Mick's daughter, Pauline Harvey-Short, represented Australia in softball and her daughter, Kirby Short, plays for the Queensland women's cricket team. After his playing career ended, Mick became a Test cricket umpire, officiating in two matches. The two other brothers, Brian and Harold, played for Fitzroy in district cricket. Apart from Harold, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brothers</b> represented Victoria at baseball.|$|E
5|$|Before {{arriving}} in the WWF, Jeff and Matt formed their own wrestling promotion, the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA) with Thomas Simpson. The promotion was a more successful version of the original TWF and included talent such as both Hardy brothers, Shannon Moore, Gregory Helms, Joey Matthews, and Steve Corino, among others. In OMEGA, each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brothers</b> portrayed several different characters; Hardy portrayed such characters as Willow the Wisp, Iceman, Mean Jimmy Jack Tomkins, and The Masked Mountain. While there, Hardy held the New Frontier Championship as a singles competitor and the Tag Team Championship with Matt. The promotion folded in April 1998 when they signed contracts with the WWF.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{commitments}} {{during the}} war, the fourth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brothers,</b> Harold Lindsay Harvey {{was unable to}} pursue a cricket career. He played mainly Second XI cricket at Fitzroy, but did play in the First XI during the war. A fitter and turner, Harold Harvey enlisted on 19 April 1945 and was discharged on 20 January 1947 with the rank of sergeant. He served with the Second Australian Imperial Force in Bougainville in New Guinea and played 15 First XI matches for Fitzroy from 1942-43 to 1949-50, as a wicketkeeper-batsman, scoring 237 runs {{at an average of}} 14.81.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Edward the Confessor a lady called Elviva (probably a Latin {{rendering}} of the Old English name Ælfgifu), held the manor of Ambrosden. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 she {{had been replaced by}} Hugh d'Ivry, butler of William the Conqueror and brother of Roger d'Ivry, who owned several manors in Oxfordshire. Hugh's nephew Roger II d'Ivry inherited Ambrosden and by 1194 {{it was part of the}} Honour of St. Valery. Ambrosden thus passed to Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, who in 1288 gave the manor to Ashridge Priory of the Augustinian order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brothers</b> of Penitence. Ashridge Priory retained Ambrosden until the priory was dissolved in 1539 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1985 {{death of}} Roger Gambill, Kingston Trio {{personnel}} changed several times, though Shane and Grove remained constants. Bob Haworth, a veteran folk performer {{who had worked}} as a member <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Brothers</b> Four for many years, initially replaced Gambill from 1985 through 1988 and again from 1999 through 2005. In 1988, original member Nick Reynolds rejoined the band until his final retirement in 1999. When heart disease forced Bob Shane's retirement from touring in March 2004, he was replaced by former New Kingston Trio member Bill Zorn. A year later, following Haworth's departure, Grove and Zorn were joined by Rick Dougherty, who had performed for a time with Zorn as second-generation members of another popular folk group from the 1960s, The Limeliters.|$|E
5|$|Hunter Gordon Walker (Brown), who {{believes}} that Sam Winchester (Padalecki) will one day turn evil and become involved in a demonic war against humanity, escapes from prison. He tracks down Bela Talbot (Cohan)—a thief and frequent thorn in the Winchesters' sides—and threatens to kill her unless she reveals the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brothers.</b> She refuses at first, but eventually acquiesces {{in exchange for a}} priceless mojo bag. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean (Ackles) capture the vampire Lucy (McNab), who has previously taken two victims. They interrogate her, and discover that another vampire named Dixon spiked her drink with his own blood at a club, transforming her. Dixon had taken her back to his home, but she escaped to feed. Lucy, still believing that she has only been drugged, is then killed by Dean, as there is no known cure for vampirism.|$|E

5|$|In 1955-56, Ray was {{overlooked}} {{and spent}} four years out of first-class cricket, and he never played alongside Neil again at first-class level. Neil played in all of Victoria's matches, and Mick played in Queensland’s first six matches before being dropped for the second and final match against Victoria. In 1956-57, Mick played in two matches for Queensland {{earlier in the season}} before being dropped and retiring; neither were against Victoria, so none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brothers</b> played together in one match. Ray was recalled to the Victorian team {{in the latter half of}} the 1958-59 season. By this time, Neil had moved to New South Wales for employment reasons, and played each other late in the season. The Harvey brothers never played together or against one another again at first-class level. In 1959-60, Neil was in the Indian subcontinent representing Australia as Ray played his final first-class season before retiring.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Treaty of Kraków of 1525, Albrecht (Albert) of Hohenzollern planned a Polish–Lithuanian fief in Livonia, seeking a {{dominant}} position {{for his brother}} Wilhelm, the Archbishop of Riga. What happened instead was {{the establishment of a}} Livonian pro-Polish–Lithuanian party or faction. Internal fighting in Livonia took place when the Grand Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brothers</b> concluded a treaty with Moscow in 1554, declaring his state's neutrality regarding the Russian–Lithuanian conflict. Supported by Albrecht and the magnates, Sigismund II declared a war on the Order. Grand Master Wilhelm von Fürstenberg accepted the Polish–Lithuanian conditions without a fight, and according to the 1557 Treaty of Pozvol, a military alliance obliged the Livonian state to support Lithuania against Moscow.|$|E
