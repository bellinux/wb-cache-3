After the death of Melvil Dewey in 1931, administration of the classification was under the Decimal Classification Committee of the Lake Placid Club Education Foundation, and the editorial body was the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee with participation of the American Library Association (ALA), Library of Congress, and Forest Press. By the 14th edition in 1942, the Dewey Decimal Classification index was over 1,900 pages in length and was published in two volumes.|$|E
5|$|Clark Gregg reprises {{his role}} as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. The episode draws {{comparisons}} {{to the plight of}} first responders to the September 11 attacks by showing firefighters (with guest star Vincent Laresca playing one) dying as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> to the Battle of New York, as seen in Marvel's The Avengers. The episode also features a major skydiving sequence, realized by combining live footage with CGI, as part of the development of the characters Fitz and Simmons, who received their own musical theme for the episode. It also sees Titus Welliver reprise his S.H.I.E.L.D. agent role from the Marvel One-Shot short films.|$|E
5|$|I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 {{autobiography}} {{about the}} early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> to prejudice.|$|E

Most of the drugs analyzed for rate-dependent effects increased low rates of both punished and unpunished responding, while increasing higher rates less, or decreasing them; however, low rates <b>of</b> punished <b>responding</b> sometimes were increased more by pentobarbital, diazepam, and chlordiazepoxide than were matched rates <b>of</b> unpunished <b>responding.</b> In contrast, d-amphetamine and chlorpromazine usually increased low rates <b>of</b> unpunished <b>responding</b> more than matched rates <b>of</b> punished <b>responding.</b> These two drugs also decreased high rates <b>of</b> unpunished <b>responding</b> less than they decreased high rates <b>of</b> punished <b>responding.</b> Thus, the effects of drugs on punished responding depend on the control rate of punished responding; however, the rate-dependent effects of drugs on punished responding are not always {{the same as they}} are for unpunished responding...|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{marriage}} and children, Walter Jones reportedly had a wandering eye. On April 18, he met Sharon Kinne when {{she bought a}} Ford Thunderbird from his dealership {{using some of the}} insurance payout from her husband's death, and the two began an affair shortly thereafter. Kinne viewed him as a prospect for a second husband, but Jones was uninterested in leaving his wife despite the rockiness of their relationship. When he declined to go on a trip to Washington with her in May, Kinne reluctantly went with her brother instead. Although the couple reunited on May 25, shortly after Kinne returned to Missouri, the relationship was quickly set on the rocks when Kinne told Jones that she was pregnant and he was the father of the baby. Jones, instead <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> with what Kinne expected to be an agreement to divorce his wife, ended the affair.|$|E

40|$|The key pecking of two pigeons was {{reinforced}} on a variable-interval schedule of reinforcement during {{the presentation of}} each of two stimuli. In various phases of the experiment, punishment followed every response emitted {{in the presence of}} one of the stimuli. In general, when the rate <b>of</b> punished <b>responding</b> changed during the presentation of one stimulus, the rate <b>of</b> unpunished <b>responding</b> during the other stimulus changed in the opposite direction. This sort of change in rate is an example of behavioral contrast. When punishment was introduced, the rate <b>of</b> punished <b>responding</b> decreased and the rate <b>of</b> unpunished <b>responding</b> increased as functions of shock intensity. When the rate <b>of</b> previously punished <b>responding</b> increased after the termination of the shock, the rate of the always unpunished responding decreased. When the procedure correlated with a red key was changed from variable-interval reinforcement and punishment for each response to extinction and no punishment, the rate <b>of</b> reinforced <b>responding</b> during presentations <b>of</b> a green key decreased and then increased while the rate of the previously punished responding during red first increased and then decreased during extinction...|$|R

40|$|Random {{responding}} to psychological inventories is a long-standing concern among clinical practitioners and researchers interested in interpreting idiographic data, {{but it is}} typically viewed as having only a minor impact on the statistical inferences drawn from nomothetic data. This article explores the impact <b>of</b> random <b>responding</b> on the size and direction of correlations observed between multi-item inventory scores. Random responses to individual items result in nonrandomly distributed inventory-level scores. Therefore, even low base rates <b>of</b> random <b>responding</b> can sig-nificantly affect the statistical inferences made from inventory-level data. Study 1 uses simulations to show that even low base rates <b>of</b> random <b>responding</b> can significantly affect observed correlations, especially when the inventories in question assess low or high base rate phenomena. Study 2 uses archival data to illustrate the moderating effect <b>of</b> random <b>responding</b> on observed correlations in two samples...|$|R

Descartes fails to consider the possibility that future automata might be able to overcome such insufficiency, and so does not propose the Turing Test as such, even if he prefigures its conceptual framework and criterion.|$|E
