2500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, London had grown greatly and the {{development}} of a commuting population arriving by train each day led to traffic congestion with carts, cabs and omnibuses filling the roads. By 1850 there were seven railway termini located around the urban centre of London and the concept of an underground railway linking the City of London with these stations was first proposed in the 1830s. Charles Pearson, Solicitor to the City of London, was a leading promoter of several schemes, and he contributed to the creation of the City Terminus Company to build such a railway from Farringdon to King's Cross in 1852 [...] Although the plan was supported by the City of London, the railway companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed. In 1854 the Metropolitan Railway (also known as the Met) was granted permission to build an underground line at an estimated cost of Â£1million. [...] With the Crimean War under way, the Met found it hard to raise the capital, and construction did not start until March 1860. The railway was mostly built using the [...] "cut-and-cover" [...] method from Paddington to King's Cross; east of King's Cross it was built by tunnelling and then followed the culverted River Fleet in an <b>open</b> <b>cutting</b> to the new meat market at Smithfield. The [...] railway opened to the public on 10 January 1863, using steam locomotives hauling wooden carriages. It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service. In the first twelve months 9.5million passengers were carried and in the second twelve months this increased to 12million.|$|E

60|$|A new race of {{intimate}} friends has sprung up at Veneering's since {{he went into}} Parliament for the public good, to whom Mrs Veneering is very attentive. These friends, like astronomical distances, are only to be spoken of in the very largest figures. Boots says {{that one of them}} is a Contractor who (it has been calculated) gives employment, directly and indirectly, to five hundred thousand men. Brewer says that another of them is a Chairman, in such request at so many Boards, so far apart, that he never travels less by railway than three thousand miles a week. Buffer says that another of them hadn't a sixpence eighteen months ago, and, through the brilliancy of his genius in getting those shares issued at eighty-five, and buying them all up with no money and selling them at par for cash, has now three hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds--Buffer particularly insisting on the odd seventy-five, and declining to take a farthing less. With Buffer, Boots, and Brewer, Lady Tippins is eminently facetious on the subject of these Fathers of the Scrip-Church: surveying them through her eyeglass, and inquiring whether Boots and Brewer and Buffer think they will make her fortune if she makes love to them? with other pleasantries of that nature. Veneering, in his different way, is much occupied with the Fathers too, piously retiring with them into the conservatory, from which retreat the word 'Committee' is occasionally heard, and where the Fathers instruct Veneering how he must leave the valley of the piano on his left, take the level of the mantelpiece, cross by an <b>open</b> <b>cutting</b> at the candelabra, seize the carrying-traffic at the console, and cut up the opposition root and branch at the window curtains.|$|E
60|$|The {{mine was}} a large <b>open</b> <b>cutting,</b> and the prisoners were {{employed}} in digging the sand and carrying it on hand-barrows {{to the place where}} it was to be washed. The work was not entirely performed by prisoners, as there were many free labourers also employed. Godfrey was given a shovel, and his work consisted in loading the sand and gravel, as the pickmen got it down, on to the barrows. Being unaccustomed to work, his back ached and his hands were blistered {{by the end of the}} day; but he knew, from his experience in rowing, that this would pass off before long. At any rate the labour was far easier than he had anticipated. He had expected to see overseers with whips, but there was nothing of the sort. A few men directed the labour, and spoke sharply enough if they saw any of the prisoners shirking, but there was nothing to distinguish it from any other work of the kind, save the Cossack guards here and there leaning upon their muskets, and certainly the men worked no harder than ordinary labourers would do. Indeed, when the time was up and the prisoners started on their return towards the prison, the free labourers continued their work, and would do so, he afterwards learned, for some hours, as it would take a considerable time for all the sand obtained during the day to be thoroughly washed up and the gold extracted. Godfrey had at first looked narrowly at the sand as he shovelled it, for specks of gold, but had seen none; and indeed the proportion of gold at the mines of Kara was so small that they would not have paid if worked by free labour; but the produce served to lessen the expenses of the prisons, and the mines afforded work to the convicts. The prisoners were not forbidden to talk, and Godfrey, who had happened to be placed next to a young fellow of the better class, learned a good many particulars as to the mines. He had seen no women at them, and asked if they were not employed at that labour.|$|E

50|$|It {{was built}} (1875-6) over the Great Western Railway line cutting at the London end of Snow Hill station. The cutting {{was covered in}} 1874. Originally the broad gauge Paddington line ran through a tunnel which stopped at Temple Row and then an <b>open</b> <b>cutting</b> to Snow Hill station. The cutting was roofed over in 1874 and the Great Western Arcade built on top, {{the line of the}} new 'tunnel' being offset {{slightly}} {{to the north of the}} centre of the arcade.

50|$|Originally {{built as}} an <b>open</b> <b>cutting,</b> {{construction}} began in May 1844, and opened {{for use on}} December 3, 1844, but was not completely finished until late Spring 1845.

The construction of the cutting also lowered the LIRR's grade through Cobble Hill. Around five years after opening the cutting was roofed over, converting it into a tunnel.|$|E
