It is crucial to discover time-evolving communities in dynamic networks. In this paper, we study the problem of finding time-evolving communities such that each community freely forms, evolves, and dissolves for any time period. Although the previous t-partite graph based methods are quite effective for discovering such communities from large-scale dynamic networks, they have some weak points such as finding only stable <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> single <b>path</b> type and not being scalable w. r. t. the time period. We propose CHRONICLE, an efficient clustering algorithm that discovers not only <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> single <b>path</b> type but also <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>path</b> group type. In order to find <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> both types and also control the dynamicity <b>of</b> <b>clusters,</b> CHRONICLE performs the two-stage density-based clustering, which performs the 2 nd-stage density-based clustering for the t-partite graph constructed from the 1 st-stage density-based clustering result for each timestamp network. For a given data set, CHRONICLE finds all clusters in a fixed time by using a fixed amount of memory, regardless of the number <b>of</b> <b>clusters</b> and the length <b>of</b> <b>clusters.</b> Experimental results using real data sets show that CHRONICLE finds a wider range <b>of</b> <b>clusters</b> in a shorter time with a much smaller amount of memory than the previous method. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Internet paths {{sharing the}} same {{bottleneck}} can be identified using several shared congestion detection techniques. However, all of these techniques {{have been designed to}} detect shared congestion between a pair <b>of</b> <b>paths.</b> To <b>cluster</b> N <b>paths</b> by shared congestion, a straightforward approach of using pairwise tests would require O(N 2) time complexity. In this paper, we present a scalable approach to <b>cluster</b> Internet <b>paths</b> based on DCW (Delay Correlation with Wavelet denoising) which does not require a common end point between paths. We present a function to map each path’s measurement data into a point in a multidimensional space such that points are close to each other if and only if the corresponding paths share congestion. Because points in the space are indexed using a tree-like structure, the computational complexity <b>of</b> <b>clustering</b> N <b>paths</b> can be reduced to O(N log N). The indexing overhead can be further improved by reducing dimensionality of the space through wavelet transform.

To overcome this limitation, we develop a general modeling framework to shed light on the relative importance of these two mechanisms. We test our model against a comprehensive dataset, listing cross-country and cross-sectoral R&D alliances from 1984 to 2009.

40|$|Although typical digital {{circuits}} are {{designed so that}} the clock period satisfies worst-case path delay constraints, the average input excitation often completes computation {{in less than a}} clock cycle. Variable latency units (VLUs) allow for improved throughput by allowing one clock cycle for some computations, and two clock cycles for others, using hold logic to differentiate between the two cases. However, they may experience significant throughput losses due to the effects of process variations. We develop a combined presilicon-postsilicon technique for variation-aware VLU design that ensures high throughputs across all manufactured chips. We achieve this by identifying <b>path</b> <b>clusters</b> at the presilicon stage, such that each element <b>of</b> a <b>path</b> <b>cluster</b> is likely to be similarly critical in a manufactured part. We use sensors to determine which <b>path</b> <b>clusters</b> is critical at the postsilicon stage and then activate the appropriate hold logics. Practically, for a small number <b>of</b> <b>path</b> <b>clusters,</b> significant improvements in throughput are achievable. On a set of 32 nm PTM-based ISCAS 89 circuits, our scheme offers 15. 1 % throughput enhancements with only 3. 3 % area overhead. The idea can be illustrated through the example of a 6 -bit ripple carry adder (RCA) shown in Fig. 1 [5]. With unit gate delays, the conventional single-cycle fixed-latency circuit has a cycle time, Tclk = 13 units, equal to the delay of its longest path, corresponding to a throughput, η 1 = 1 / 13. The VLU implementation of this adder operates at a reduced cycle time, Tclk < 13. For Tclk = 9, assuming that all primary input signals are mutually independent and have signal probabilities of 50 %, 18. 75 % of the input patterns violate Tclk, and the VLU allows these to complete execution in two cycles. Under the 50 % assumption above, since each pattern is equiprobable, the average VLU delay is 0. 8125 × 9 + 0. 1875 × 18 = 10. 69 units, and the throughput η 2 = 1 / 10. 69 is 21. 6 % better...|$|R

Endogenous mechanisms depend on the previous history of the network, i. e. they take into account existing alliance patterns. Exogenous mechanisms do not depend on the properties of the network but on those of newcomers, i. e. they include the exploratory search for firms that {{are not part of the}} network yet. Despite the observation of these two mechanisms, research has focused only on either of the two. To overcome this limitation, we develop a general modeling framework that includes both mechanisms and allows to tune their relative importance in the formation of links. The model contains additional ingredients derived from empirical observations, such as the heterogeneous propensity to form alliances and the presence of circles of influence, i. e. <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> firms in the network.

The synchronization of the whole system is relatively poor, and the synchronous judgment with value r has been in a relatively large fluctuation. This is because the amount of network individuals is too large, which makes the network receive too much information from others to view the event, and further makes judgment and adjustment to the surrounding situation, resulting in the instability of the overall synchronization, thus showing the continuous fluctuation of r value.
