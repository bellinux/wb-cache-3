5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are a type <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> eruption, {{named after}} the Hawaiian volcanoes with which this eruptive type is hallmark. Hawaiian eruptions are the calmest types <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> events, {{characterized}} by the effusive eruption of very fluid basalt-type lavas with low gaseous content. The volume of ejected material from Hawaiian eruptions {{is less than half}} of that found in other eruptive types. Steady production of small amounts of lava builds up the large, broad form of a shield volcano. Eruptions are not centralized at the main summit as with other volcanic types, and often occur at vents around the summit and from fissure vents radiating out of the center.|$|E

5|$|In April 2010 {{airspace}} {{all over}} Europe was affected, with many flights cancelled-which was unprecedented-due {{to the presence}} <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> ash in the upper atmosphere from the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull.

5|$|The crystalline-solid {{structure}} of the salts act more as an insulator than a conductor. However, once the salts are dissolved into a solution by a source of moisture (e.g., fog, mist, light rain, etc.), the ash may become corrosive and electrically conductive. A recent study {{has shown that the}} electrical conductivity <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> ash increases with (1) increasing moisture content, (2) increasing soluble salt content, and (3) increasing compaction (bulk density). The ability <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> ash to conduct electric current has significant implications for electric power supply systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{density of}} {{individual}} particles varies with different eruptions. The density <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> ash varies between 700–1200kg/m3 for pumice, 2350–2450kg/m3 for glass shards, 2700–3300kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200kg/m3 for lithic particles. Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations. The high density and hardness (~5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale) {{together with a}} high degree of angularity, make some types <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive.|$|E

5|$|Laguna del Maule is a {{volcanic}} {{field in the}} Andes mountain range of Chile, close to, and partly overlapping, the Chile-Argentina frontier. The bulk <b>of</b> the <b>volcanic</b> field is in the Talca province of Chile's Maule Region. It is a segment <b>of</b> the Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, part <b>of</b> the Andean <b>Volcanic</b> Belt. Many <b>of</b> the <b>volcanic</b> centres in the Laguna del Maule volcanic field formed during postglacial times, after glaciers had retreated from the area. This activity has generated cones, lava domes, lava coulees and lava flows which surround Laguna del Maule lake. The field gets {{its name from the}} lake which is also the source of the Maule river. Some <b>of</b> the <b>volcanic</b> centres were active during and before the last glaciation; at least three caldera formation events are associated with the system.|$|R

5|$|Although it {{may have}} once been a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} hot springs exist in valleys near Mount Cayley, {{providing}} more evidence for magmatic activity. This includes springs found at Shovelnose Creek and Turbid Creek {{on the southern}} flank of Mount Cayley and Brandywine Creek on the eastern flank of the volcanic field. They are generally found in areas <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> activity that are geologically young. As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field, it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir. Here, the water is heated, becomes less dense and rises {{back to the surface}} along fissures or cracks. These features are sometimes referred to as dying volcanoes because they seem to represent the last stage <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> activity as the magma at depth cools and hardens.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{extensive}} volcanism that gives Io its distinctive appearance, nearly all its mountains are tectonic structures, {{and are not}} produced by volcanoes. Instead, most Ionian mountains form {{as the result of}} compressive stresses on the base of the lithosphere, which uplift and often tilt chunks of Io's crust through thrust faulting. The compressive stresses leading to mountain formation are the result of subsidence from the continuous burial <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> materials. The global distribution of mountains appears to be opposite that <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> structures; mountains dominate areas with fewer volcanoes and vice versa. This suggests large-scale regions in Io's lithosphere where compression (supportive of mountain formation) and extension (supportive of patera formation) dominate. Locally, however, mountains and paterae often abut one another, suggesting that magma often exploits faults formed during mountain formation to reach the surface.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} volcano spends {{less time}} actively {{attached to the}} plume. The large difference between the youngest and oldest lavas between Emperor and Hawaiian volcanoes indicates that the hotspot's velocity is increasing. For example, Kohala, the oldest volcano on Hawaii island, is one million years old and last erupted 120,000 years ago, a period of just under 900,000 years; whereas one of the oldest, Detroit Seamount, experienced 18 million or more years <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> activity.|$|E
5|$|Features on Io {{are named}} after {{characters}} and places from the Io myth, {{as well as}} deities of fire, volcanoes, the Sun, and thunder from various myths, and characters and places from Dante's Inferno: names appropriate to the volcanic nature of the surface. Since the surface was first seen up close by Voyager 1, the International Astronomical Union has approved 225 names for Io's volcanoes, mountains, plateaus, and large albedo features. The approved feature categories used for Io for different types <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> features include patera ("saucer"; volcanic depression), fluctus ("flow"; lava flow), vallis ("valley"; lava channel), and active eruptive center (location where plume activity was the first sign <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> activity at a particular volcano).
