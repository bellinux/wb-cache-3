40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} calixarate <b>overbased</b> detergent oil additives, used to neutralise acidic by-products of engine combustion. Aspects {{of interest in this}} study include experimental synthesis of calixarenes and <b>overbased</b> detergents, physical and structural characterisation and monitoring of the synthesis process. Two types of calixarenes were prepared (6 and 8 phenolic units). A synthesis procedure of the calixarate <b>overbased</b> detergent was set up, based on adaptation of existing procedures used for other classes of <b>overbased</b> detergents. The procedure was also modified to suit a lab-scale. " 1 " 3 C NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy have provided strong evidence for a precursor of the <b>overbased</b> detergent. The ionisation of the surfactants (stearic acid carboxylic group, and phenolic units) was clearly established. The synthesis process was monitored at the molecular and macroscopic level. The use of " 1 " 3 C-labelled compounds enabled a semi-quantitative study of the concentration evolution of each chemical during the synthesis. Langmuir- trough measurements and dynamic light scattering showed a decrease of particle size during the synthesis of the <b>overbased</b> detergent. The final calixarate <b>overbased</b> detergent was then fully characterised by these two methods. Based on the various information gathered (starting and final material characterisation, monitoring of the process), a mechanism was suggested. This involved a progressive solvation of calcium hydroxide, and breakdown of mixed calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate.

40|$|Antagonistic {{effect on}} {{lubricity}} of <b>overbased</b> calcium sulfonate by zine dialkyldithiophosphate(ZnDTP) and polybutenyl succinimide (PBSI) was investigated under boundary lubrication conditions {{by using a}} block-on-ring type tribo-tester. It was found that <b>overbased</b> calcium sulfonate reduced friction and wear of steel-steel contacts with its single use whereas they increased with multi-additives. Surface analyses of boundary films by means of TOF-SIMS (Time Of Fright Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy) revealed that the major component of film derived from calcium sulfonate in single use was calcium oxide， whereas it decreased in multi-additives. Especially in the combination with PBSI. the major component of the film was alkylbenzen sulfonate derived from <b>overbased</b> calcium sulfonate. It suggests that the boundary film composed of calcium oxide play significant role to reduce friction and wear. On the other hand in combination with PBSI, the adsorption of carbonate micelle was blocked by the adsorbed layer of alkylbenzene sulfonate...|$|E
40|$|The {{marketing}} of table eggs, broiler hatching eggs, chickens, and turkeys in Canada {{is limited by}} federal and provincial supply management (SM) legislation through production quotas. The respective national regulatory agencies {{in each of these}} industries allocate, among the provinces, growth in national quotas called "overbase. " Federal legislation stipulates that the allocation of <b>overbase</b> among provinces must take into account the principle of comparative advantage (CA) of production. None of the agencies pertaining to the feather industry has ever identified and applied CA in national quota allocation decisions. To fill this void, we modify the "revealed comparative advantage" approach developed by Balassa and Bowen to identify CA and develop a provincial agricultural CA index to assign <b>overbase</b> allocations among provinces. <b>Overbase</b> quota allocations should shift toward the agriculturally intensive Prairie provinces that have a CA in the Canadian feather industry and away from the nonagricultural industry-intensive provinces. Our method of SM <b>overbase</b> quota allocation is consistent with the objectives of Canadian SM legislation. " Copyright (c) 2008 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society. ...|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticles have {{important}} applications in ceramics, metal catalysts, semiconductors etc. They are normally {{required to be}} of small size (~ nm) and monodisperse. The aim of the present work is to model the formation of nanoparticles, obtained by precipitation in reverse micellar microreactors. These are dispersions of tiny water drops in a surfactant laden oil medium. Two systems were investigated: (i) Reverse micelles, having nanometer sized spherical water droplets in the micellar core and (ii) Water-in-oil emulsions, having micron-sized aqueous drops. Two modes of precipitation, namely, gas-liquid (g- 1) and liquid-liquid (1 - 1) were studied. In each case, the models could predict the number, average size and size distribution of the particles reported in literature. Two groups have obtained widely divergent number and size of CaCO 3 nanoparticles, formed by g- 1 precipitation in reverse micelles. These particles are used as a fine suspension in lube-oil additives, where they serve to neutralize acid produced during combustion in engines. Kandori et al. (J. Colloid Interface Sci, 122, 1988, 78) obtained particles of about 100 nm size, by passing CO 2 through a reverse micellar solution, containing dissolved Ca(OH) 2 in the micellar core. Roman et al. (J. Colloid Interface Sci., 144, 1991, 324), instead of using lime solution; added micron-sized solid lime particles in the oil and generated the reverse micelles by in situ reaction. This is a commercial process known as <b>overbasing.</b> It led to a higher amount of lime in the micelles as well as unreacted lime particles in oil, {{at the beginning of}} the experiment Upon passing CO 2, they got particles of only 6 nm in size, compared to 100 nm reported by Kandori et al [...] Furthermore, while Kandori et al. found that one particle formed from 108 micelles, Roman et al. got one particle out of only ten micelles. We have modelled the two processes in a common framework to explain the reported disparity in particle characteristics. A time scale analysis of CO 2 mass transfer, reaction, collision-fusion of micelles, nucleation, and growth of particles was carried out It showed that, in the experiments of Kandori et al., the rate limiting steps are nucleation and fusion. The analysis also indicates that the contents of a particular micelle are well mixed and reaction of lime and incoming CO 2 can be treated as instantaneous. In the process of Kandori et al., the amount of lime taken initially being very small, the average number of product molecules in a micelle is well below one. Rapid Brownian coalescence and exchange of micellar contents leads to Poisson distribution of CaCO 3 (l) molecules formed by reaction. The low occupancy therefore suggests that most of the micelles are empty. Nucleation in a particular micelle is much slow and occurs when it has a critical number of molecules. Thus only very few micelles can nucleate. Comparison of nucleation and growth time scales - both intrinsic growth in a micelle and growth during fusion of nucleated and non-nucleated micelles - show that growth is much faster than both nucleation and collision. Hence a micelle can have only one nucleus, with subsequent growth during collisions. A population balance equation (PBE) is written involving the above steps. Solution of the moments of the distribution yields the number of CaCO 3 particles, its size, coefficient of variance (COV) etc. The model not only predicts the ratio of number of micelles to particles, obtained experimentally as 108, but also captures the maxima in this quantity with increasing micellar size. The increase in average particle size with micellar size is also predicted well. The process of of Roman et ai, in addition, involves the time scale of solubilization of solid lime into micelles. Its comparison with other time scales demarcates their experiments into two distinct phases. Phase I consists of reaction of lime initially present in micelles. Time scale analysis also suggests that, as the lime content in the micelles is large, a high degree of supersaturation is rapidly generated. This results in a burst of nuclei. The other conclusions, like, well-mixed micelle, Poisson distribution of CaCO 3 (l) molecules, instantaneous growth and mono-nucleated micelles are found to hold good. Once the pre-existing lime is finished, relative time scales indicate that, further precipitation is controlled entirely by fresh solubilization of lime. This marks the beginning of phase II. However, solubilization being the slowest step, CaCO 3 (l) in micelles never builds up for any further nucleation. Phase II thus consists of pure growth of the particles formed in phase I. On developing more general PBEs and with solution of resulting moment equations - written separately for the two phases - the experimental data on number of particles and temporal evolution to the final particle size of 6 nm could be predicted very well. The model also captures the qualitative trend in COV of particle radius with time. Thus within the same framework we could successfully predict both the results, differing by seven orders of magnitude. The above analysis indicates that relative rates of nucleation, fusion-growth and mass transfer of gas controls the carbonation process. We further simplify the process and obtain an analytical solution in the limit of instantaneous mass transfer. The solution gives close first estimates for both the experiments and also indicates the smallest panicle size that could be obtained for a given experimental condition. In contrast to g- 1 mode, precipitation in 1 - 1 mode - using two reverse micellar solutions having two reactants- occurs only on coalescence of two micelles. To obviate the solution of multivariate PBEs, we have developed a general Monte Carlo (MC) simulation scheme for nanoparticle formation, using the interval of quiescence technique (IQ). Starting with a fixed number of micelles, we conduct each coalescence-redispersion and nucleation events in this population, in the ratio of their relative frequencies. Our simulation code is much more general and realistic than the scheme of Li and Park (Langmuir, 15, 1999, 952). Poisson distribution with realistic micellar occupancies of reactants, binomial redispersion of solutes after fission, a nucleation rate with critical number of molecules and Brownian collision-fusion rates were used. These considerations are based on our earlier findings in g- 1 precipitation and those known in the literature too. The simulation of Li and Park then becomes a special case of our code. Our simulation code was then used to predict experimental data on two systems. The results of Lianos and Thomas (Chem. Phys. Lett. 125, 1986, 299 and /. Colloid Interface 5 c/., 117, 1987, 505), on number of molecules per CdS particle, as a function of micelle size and reactant concentrations have been predicted very well. For the Fe(OH) 3 nanoparticles, our simulation provides a better prediction of the experimental particle size range, than that of Li and Park. Finally, 1 - 1 precipitation on mixing two emulsions, having respectively the two reactants, has been simulated. Here, large reactant amount leads to multiple nucleation in a single drop and renders growth rate to be finite. This requires solving a PBE for particle population in each drop. Moreover, emulsions have a drop size distribution due to independent coalescence and breakage. The IQ technique was used for handling these events. Thus a composite model of PBE and MC for a drop population was developed. Simulation of particle size distribution in MgCO 3 precipitation shows that nearly monodisperse nanoparticles can be produced in emulsions. Furthermore, average particle size can be controlled by changing reactant concentration in a drop. The findings of the thesis have provided new issues to be addressed in modelling nanoparticle formation. It points out the importance of finding models for coalescence efficiency and critical nuclear size in micelles. Extension of our model and simulation to precipitation in other organized surfactant assemblies can be done by starting from appropriate time scale analysis...|$|R
40|$|An area of {{industry}} that exploits zeolites for separation purposes {{is that of}} the petroleum industry where zeolites are used in catalytic conversions as well as chromatographic separations of hydrocarbons. The development of large pore sized materials such as MCM- 41 enables larger molecules to be separated by the process of size exclusion than by traditional zeolites. In this work, mesoporous materials were synthesised and characterised using powder x-ray diffraction and nitrogen surface studies and shown to have different pore sizes in the region of 2 nm to 6 nm. They were then compared to traditional size exclusion gels and zeolites for their ability to sorb <b>overbased</b> and neutral sulphonate and phenate detergents, which were Soxhlet extracted from base oil, characterised by infrared spectroscopy and the results used to predict possible separations of binary detergent mixtures. The sorption properties of the mesoporous and silica gel materials were determined as follows: - (i) batch slurry sorption uptake to determine the maximum amount of detergent adsorbed within the pores of the material which showed an uptake of neutral sulphonate in the range of 0. 12 to 0. 37 g/g of mesoporous material and neutral phenate in the range of 0. 11 to 0. 30 g/g of mesoporous material with the uptake apparently increasing with pore diameter and aluminium content. Only surface adsorption occurred on the silica gel materials in the range of 0. 3 to 0. 6 gig of silica gel. (ii) The materials were prepared as liquid chromatography columns which showed that the neutral detergents were retained by the mesoporous materials and not the silica gels whereas the <b>overbased</b> detergents were not retained within the pores of either type of material. (iii) Using the mesoporous materials as the packing in gas chromatography columns to determine the heats of adsorption of molecules which were constituents of the detergent molecules investigated. It was found that the heat of adsorption of alkyl chains were twice as large for the MCM than for the silica gel materials for example, dodecane with a heat of adsorption in the range of 101 to 111 KJ/mol on the mesoporous materials and in the range of 44 to 47 KJ/mol on the silica gel materials. The data also showed that very polar compounds such as phenol were completely retained by the columns suggesting strong interaction with the silicate material. The sorption data was then applied to the column separation of a series of <b>overbased</b> and neutral detergent mixtures where {{it was found that the}} neutral detergents entered and adsorbed in the iii bstract mesoporous materials whereas the <b>overbased</b> sulphonate was completely excluded from all the mesoporous materials and the <b>overbased</b> phenate adsorbed on the external surfaces of the 4 nm and 6 nm materials. The mesoporous materials were therefore able to separate the detergent mixtures whereas the silica gel materials failed to separate any of the detergent mixtures. The detergents were characterised primarily by infrared spectroscopy and the equilibrium established between the neutral detergent monomer and the <b>overbased</b> micelle was investigated by radiochemical labelling of the neutral sulphonate and measured using liquid scintillation techniques. The results of the equilibrium studies using radioactive neutral sulphonate suggested that exchange had occurred. The sorption uptake of radioactive neutral sulphonate determined using the liquid scintillation technique was found to be in agreement with the uptake value determined by infrared spectroscopy of 0. 21 grams per gram of material...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} {{mechanism of}} boundary film obtained with the <b>overbased</b> calcium sulfonates was investigated.;Firstly a physico-chemical {{analysis of the}} <b>overbased</b> calcium sulfonates was achieved. The structure, the size and the polydispersity of the micelles formed by the additive in oil, {{and the nature of}} the interactions existing between them were studied using Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS). Different parameters which can influence the micellar structure such as pressure, temperature and water, were also studied.;Secondly, the formation of the boundary film was studied using an alternating tribometer. The Infrared Reflexion Absorption Spectroscopy by Polarization Modulation (PM IRRAS), the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were used to investigate the boundary film.;The <b>overbased</b> calcium sulfonates form in oil micelles consisting of a calcium carbonate core of 2. 0 nm surrounded by a calcium sulfonate layer of between 0. 9 and 2. 2 nm in thickness depending on the concentration. In concentrated solutions, the micelles are subjected to steric repulsions caused by the cluttering of the sulfonate chains. In diluted solutions, an attractive energy of the order of 1 kT exists between the micelles leading to their aggregation. When water is added, this attractive energy is increased by a factor of 10. When the additive is submitted to friction constraints, its micellar structure is modified. The film formation is related to the adsorption of the calcium carbonate on the surface and to the expulsion of the sulfonate chains surrounding the micelle cores.;The film formation is achieved during the first seconds of friction and it grows by agglomeration and crystallization of calcium carbonate cores bared of their calcium sulfonate layer. The boundary film partially recovers the friction surface and its thickness increases during the first hour of friction. The maximum local film thickness may reach 1 micron. The crystallization phenomenon carries out principally on the prominent parts of the film and leads to the formation of calcite particles with very polydispersed sizes, of between few ten and few hundred nanometers. In presence of water, the film formation kinetics is slower and the calcium carbonate partially crystallizes...|$|E

They found that branched chain olefins, which contain branched alkyl groups, show superior ironing performance to straight chain olefins, provided that their carbon numbers are relatively low. When the sulfurized olefins were used in combination with <b>overbased</b> detergents (calcium sulfonate or salicylate), they showed a higher performance in ironing than with sulfurized olefins alone. It was also found that lubricating films consisting of both iron sulfide and calcium carbonate seem to improve ironing performance...|$|E
40|$|A custom tribometer was {{developed}} to investigate the production of nano-scale films from the anti-wear additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP). The tribometer was designed to operate in various conditions of lubrication severity, from boundary to hydrodynamic lubrication regimes. A cylinder-on-plate layout, in which a cylinder rotates and rubs against a plate in a line contact, was employed for this purpose. ZDDP, a wear preventative additive universally used in engine and gear oil formulations, was studied in detail with respect to tribofilm production. As typical oil formulations contain an assortment of additives, {{the development of these}} films in the presence of other additives was studied. Of these, <b>overbased</b> detergents have recently been under scrutiny with mixed findings of synergetic and antagonistic effects. This project investigates the effects of <b>overbased</b> calcium sulfonate, a basic detergent used to neutralize acids and solubilize contaminants in oil, using electrical contact resistance (ECR), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and 31 -phosphorous nuclear magnetic resonance (P₃₁NMR). Oil blends of 2. 4 % (mass) ZDDP with varying concentrations of calcium sulfonate were mixed for rubbing and heating tests. ECR was used to monitor the development of the tribofilm in-situ of the tribometer and AES was used in postmortem analysis to measure the film thickness. Analysis with P₃₁ NMR was employed for a series of heating experiments to characterize the chemical interactions between the two additives.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) simulations {{are reported}} of model <b>overbased</b> detergent nanoparticles on a model water surface which mimic their behavior on a Langmuir trough or large water droplet in engine oil. The simulations {{predict that the}} structure of the nanoparticle on a water surface is different to when it is immersed in a bulk hydrophobic solvent. The surfactant tails are partly directed out of the water, while the carbonate core maximizes its extent of contact with the water. Umbrella sampling calculations of the potential of mean force between two particles showed that they are associated with varying degrees with a maximum binding free energy of ca. 10 kBT for the salicylate stabilized particle, ca. 8 kBT for a sulfurized alkyl phenate stabilized particle, and ca. 5 kBT for a sulfonate stabilized particle. The differences in the strength of attraction depend on the proximity of nearest approach and the energy penalty associated with the disruption of the hydration shell of water molecules around the calcium carbonate core when the two particles approach. This is greatest for the sulfonate particle, which partially loses the surfactant ions to the solution, and least for the salicylate, which forms the weakest water “cage”. The particles are separated by a water hydration layer, even at the point of closest approach...|$|E
40|$|Nanoparticles can be {{considered}} as potential lubricant additives. They present several major advantages compared to organic molecules currently used as lubricant additives, for example: Their nanometre size allows them to enter the contact area easily. They are often efficient at ambient temperature. Thus, no induction period is necessary to obtain interesting tribological properties. Several types of nanoparticles can be envisaged as lubricant additives. The chapters of this book describe different possible nanolubricants: nested nanoparticles (fullerenes, onions and nanotubes) made on metal dichalcogenides or carbon, reverse <b>overbased</b> micelles, metallic nanoparticles and boron-based nanolubricants. In some cases, the authors chose to study these particles because their structure is close to well-known lamellar structures in tribology (for example inorganic fullerenes of MoS 2). However, dispersion of nanopar-ticles in oil is not always simple. Thus, in a first part, some rules will be shown about the dispersion of solid nanoparticles in a liquid. Another way to use nanoparticles in tribology is by embedding them inside a coating. Nanoparticles can improve the tribological of the coating itself, but nanoparticles can also be released by the coating during wear and can thus lubricate {{in the same way as}} if they were in the oil. 1. 1 Stability of Colloids Dispersed in a Base Oil A colloidal sol is generally a substance (liquid or gel) containing dispersed solid particles. To obtain a homogeneous and stable system, the size of the nanoparticles has to be small, say below 100 nm...|$|E
40|$|Le mécanisme du procédé de suralcalinisation des huiles lubrifiantes est étudié. L'analyse du contrôle {{physique}} et (ou) chimique est effectué dans ce procédé polyphasique, où une base solide (chaux, magnésie) en suspension dans une solution, constituée d'une microémulsion, est carbonatée. Le carbonate non colloïdal est formé dans le milieu par une réaction successive à celle de {{la formation}} de carbonate colloïdal. La réaction, en présence (et en absence) de détergent alkylarylsulfonique, n'est pas limitée par la cinétique chimique, mais par la diffusion des réactifs. Le méthanol, utilisé comme cotensioactif, influe sur la quantité de carbonate colloïdal sans augmenter la vitesse de surbasage. Les essais en milieu anhydre montrent que la présence d'une quantité très faible d'eau est indispensable. L'importance de la dilution par le solvant (xylène) et la réactivité comparée MgO/Ca(OH) 2 sont discutées. <b>Overbased</b> (overalcalinized) detergent additives are applied in lubrication of modern combustion engines : they neutralize the acidic products coming from combustion and fight corrosive wear. <b>Overbased</b> calcium sulfonates, {{the most widely}} used are made by carbonating CaO or Ca(OH) 2 in an hydrocarbon mixture (alkane + xylene) containing a detergent (mostly alkylaryl-sulfonate) and reaction promoters (water, alcohol, amine). The process is operated by several companies and a large amount of patent literature is reported on the subject [2]; however if the geometrical and physical nature of the colloidal carbonare particles formed in the process has been studied, very little is known on the fundamental aspects and on the mechanism of the overbasing process; this is what is described and discussed in this paper. Following previous kinetic results on experimental parameters associated to carbonatation, [4], further data are obtained applying kinetic graphs used in reactor analysis of complex reactions (Fig. 1). Plotting YA/B (colloidal carbonate/initial Ca(OH) 2) versus P (yield of non colloïdal carbonate) shows clearly (Fig. 2) that the non-colloidal CaCO 3, eliminated by contrifugation at several extends of the reaction progress, comes from a consecutive and not from a parallel reaction. A pseudoternary, phase diagram of (detergent + oil; water; MeOH) indicates a very narrow monophasic area (Fig. 3) which implies the need of small amounts of water. The assignement of the chemical or physical nature of the reaction is made from the equations related to the chemical engineering model of the shrinking spherical particle (Fig. 5). The results show clearly that the overbasing process is under diffusion control (Fig. 9), and that the chemical reaction is not the determining factor. A detailed analysis of the process is made by varying the chemical parameters involved. A minimum amount of methanol is necessary for the carbonatation to give a significant value of TBN (total base number) but an excess of methanol makes the final product not fluid enough and even solid. There is a linear relation between the volume of methanol and the volume (TBN 2 / 3) of micellar carbonate (Fig. 11). However the maximum of TBN is independant of the amount of methanol. This is consistent with a multiparametric role of MeOH involved in wettingthe colloids and in changing the physical nature of the micelles [8 - 10]. A minimum amount of water is also necessary, in agreement with recent observations on the mechanism of solid-liquid Phase Transfer Catalysis [11]. Increasing the amount of xylene increases the rate of carbonatation, probably by reducing the viscosity of the reaction medium, without changing the final value of TBN. In addition, there is a large difference of carbonatation rate when comparing MgO and Ca(OH) 2. In summary {{the results of this study}} show that diffusion is determinant in the reaction. The promoters are necessary and play a multiparametric role. The mass transfer of Ca(OH) 2 does not occur through formation of organosoluble species as in the alcoholate process [2]. The overbasing mechanism is in agreement with the dynamic behavior [13 - 16] and the theorical concepts [17 - 18] of micellar systems...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis has been directed at {{the development of a}} novel synthetic route to alkylsalicylic acids. Associated reactions have also been studied. The primary aim has been the synthesising of alkylsalicylic acids possessing an alkyl chain containing more than eight carbon atoms. In addition, a limited study has also been carried out into the sulfurisation of alkylphenols. Both the alkylsalicylic acids and the sulfurised aJkylphenols are used as oil additives. They both act as detergents, keeping an engine clean and neutralising any acids formed in the engine as a result of oxidation processes. Chapter Icontains a general introduction to oil additives, principally the <b>overbased</b> detergents, and an introduction to Friedel-Crafts chemistry, which is the basic reaction employed in the alkylation of salicylic acid. Chapter 2 introduces the alkylation of salicylic acid employing concentrated sulfuric acid as the catalyst, and using simple model compounds to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. The effect of varying the alkylating substrate to produce an alkylsalicylic acid with an alkyl chain containing at least eight carbon atoms is explored in Chapter 3. Optimization of the alkylation reaction and the effect of altering a number of the reaction parameters (e. g. temperature, catalyst and reaction duration) on the yield and product distribution for a range of alkylating substrates is set out in Chapter 4. The work contained in Chapter 5 concentrates on the synthesis and rearrangement of the esters of salicylic acid and investigates the possibility that the esters are intermediates in the alkylation reaction. Chapter 6 is concerned with the industrial implications of the alkylation of salicylic acid. It concentrates in particular on the synthesis using industrially available alkenes and the scale-up of the reaction. An insight into the sulfurisation of alkylphenols, and the attempted identification of products formed in the industrial process, can be found in Chapter 7.
