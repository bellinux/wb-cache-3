50|$|The maxillary sinus {{is known}} for its thin floor walls and close {{proximity}} to the posterior maxillary teeth. Dental procedures such as extraction of these teeth sometimes cause OAC. The posterior maxillary molars and maxillary sinus are innervated by the same branch of nerves which is the maxillary division of trigeminal nerve. This innervation complicates the situation as the pain from maxillary sinus might be indistinguishable from a posterior maxillary toothache. Other known causes of OAC are fracture across the antral floor typically Le Fort I, displacement of posterior maxillary molar roots into antrum, and direct trauma. Extraction of primary teeth are not considered a risk of OAC due to the presence of developing permanent teeth and the small size of a developing maxillary sinus. OAC can happen for many other reasons, such as acute or chronic inflammatory lesions around the apex of tooth root present in close proximity with the maxillary antrum, necrotic lesions of the maxilla, failure of sublabial incision to heal after Caldwell-luc antrostomy, multiple and extensive fractures of the facial region, Osteomyelitis of the maxilla, injudicious use of instruments during <b>oral</b> <b>procedures,</b> malignancy of the maxillary sinus, Syphilis, malignant granuloma, radiotherapy, implant denture, removal of a large cyst or resection of large tumour involving maxilla, development of tumour causing bone destruction and loosening of teeth.|$|E

Objectives: To search the literature for randomised controlled trials involving the use of platelet-rich fibrin in adults in <b>oral</b> surgical <b>procedures.</b> To perform a screening process of the literature and to analyse the included studies. Methods: An electronic search was conducted on PubMed MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database to identify randomised controlled trials published between March 2012 and March 2017. The keywords used during the search were “platelet rich fibrin”. A manual search was performed in bibliographies of included articles, and in relevant journals. Results: The electronic search yielded 1369 articles, nine articles matched the inclusion criteria. The articles included 197 patients and 394 treatment sites, involving four <b>oral</b> surgical <b>procedure</b> types.

40|$|ABSTRACTBisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the maxillae {{may be an}} {{important}} complication of long-term osteoporosis treatment. The possibility of osteonecrosis of the maxillae in patients exposed to nitrogenated bisphosphonates was first described in 2003.

Although this complication may be spontaneous, invasive <b>oral</b> <b>procedures</b> have a role as risk factors associated with dental procedures such as tooth extractions and other bone operations. In addition, tooth infections and periodontal disease have been reported to be the main risk factors for development of bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the maxillae.

40|$|Chlorhexidine {{gluconate}} (CHG) is {{an effective}} bactericidal agent commonly used in periodontics and oral and maxillofacial procedures. Upon the application of CHG in these procedures, an implant or prosthesis can {{come in contact with}} CHG which might alter the electrochemistry at the metal-body fluid interface. The effect of 0. 01 % CHG addition to normal saline (NS) on the corrosion behavior of Ti 1 implant alloy has been investigated using various electrochemical techniques to simulate the use of CHG in the oral environment. Electrochemical testing was performed at 298 K under naturally aerated conditions using techniques such as open circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic and potentiostatic measurements. On addition of CHG to normal saline, the corrosion rate of Ti 1 alloy increases, more so with increasing exposure time. EIS analysis reveals the presence of two time constants in the presence of CHG in contrast to a one time constant in pure normal saline. It is recommended to use CHG {{in the presence of a}} corrosion inhibitor for its safe use in various <b>oral</b> <b>procedures</b> on patients with titanium implants/prostheses...|$|E

These lesions are most frequently diagnosed during childhood, are most commonly located {{in the head and}} neck region, and are extremely rare in the oral cavity. Oral lymphangiomas are of complex treatment due to the difficulty in performing a complete excision. CO 2 laser is the most often used laser in the oral cavity due to its affinity with water and high absorption by the oral mucosa. Several benefits of the use of CO 2 laser have been reported for surgical <b>oral</b> <b>procedures.</b> The cases reported herein were biopsy-proven lymphangiomas of the oral cavity. The surgical procedures were carried out under local anesthesia and a focused CO 2 laser beam (l 10. 600 nm, f ~ 2 mm, CW/RSP) was used. At the end of the surgery, the laser beam was used on a defocused mode to promote better hemostasis. Neither sutures nor dressings were used after surgery. No medication and only mouthwashes were prescribed to all patients on the postoperative period. There were no postsurgical complaints from the patients and no relapses of the conditions were observed after follow-up periods of 12 and 18 months.
