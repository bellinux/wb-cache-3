25|$|Sravana {{literally}} means hearing, and broadly {{refers to}} perception and observations typically {{aided by a}} counsellor <b>or</b> <b>teacher</b> (guru), wherein the Advaitin listens and discusses the ideas, concepts, questions and answers. Manana refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on svadhyaya and sravana. Nididhyāsana refers to meditation, realization and consequent conviction of the truths, non-duality and a state {{where there is a}} fusion of thought and action, knowing and being. Bilimoria states that these three stages of Advaita practice can be viewed as sadhana practice that unifies Yoga and Karma ideas, and was most likely derived from these older traditions.|$|E

25|$|Plagiarism is not {{the same}} as {{copyright}} infringement. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic credit, that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience (for example, a reader, listener, <b>or</b> <b>teacher).</b>|$|E
25|$|Actors form {{schools or}} are {{associated}} with a particular theatre. Every actor has a stage name, which is different from the name they were born with. These stagenames, most often those of the actor's father, grandfather, <b>or</b> <b>teacher,</b> are passed down between generations of actors' lineages, and hold great honor and importance. Many names {{are associated with}} certain roles or acting styles, and the new possessor of each name must live up to these expectations; there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name, but embodying the spirit, style, or skill of each actor to previously hold that name. Many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career.|$|E
25|$|The Abbey had a {{favorable}} position {{because of its}} international fame and because of its strong ties with the Swedish nobility, due to its foundress. Many of the monks and nuns were from the nobility, including the King's own sister, Anna. It {{also served as a}} burial ground for many noble families. The nuns and monks of Vadstena Abbey were, however, allowed to leave the abbey if they wished. Among the most notable who did leave was Abbess Birgitta Botolfsdotter, who left the abbey to marry. In 1544 the King, reportedly after having been asked by some of the monks and nuns, issued an instruction which specifically allowed the nuns and monks to leave the Vadstena Abbey to marry if they wished to, and specifically forbade the Abbess and {{the other members of the}} abbey from stopping them. The younger nuns were reportedly more willing to leave than the older, but the nuns in general stayed more often than the monks. In large part, this may be due to the fact that the monks, after having converted to Lutheranism, were provided with the professions of medical doctor, pastor <b>or</b> <b>teacher,</b> while the nuns seldom had a choice other than marriage. As a result, far more of them remained in the abbey than did the monks.|$|E

500|$|One longstanding {{suggestion}} of a social role for Sappho is that of [...] "Sappho as schoolmistress". At {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century, the German classicist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff posited that Sappho was a sort of schoolteacher, in order to [...] "explain away Sappho's passion for her 'girls'" [...] and defend her from accusations of homosexuality. [...] The view continues to be influential, both among scholars and the general public, though more recently the idea has been criticised by historians as anachronistic and has been rejected by several prominent classicists as unjustified by the evidence. In 1959, Denys Page, for example, stated that Sappho's extant fragments portray [...] "the loves and jealousies, the pleasures and pains, of Sappho and her companions;" [...] and he adds, [...] "We have found, and shall find, no trace of any formal or official or professional relationship between them, ... no trace of Sappho the principal of an academy." [...] David [...] A. Campbell in 1967 judged that Sappho may have [...] "presided over a literary coterie," [...] but that [...] "evidence for a formal appointment as priestess <b>or</b> <b>teacher</b> is hard to find." [...] None of Sappho's own poetry mentions her teaching, and the earliest testimonium to support the idea of Sappho as a teacher comes from Ovid, six centuries after Sappho's lifetime. Despite these problems, many newer interpretations of Sappho's social role are still based on this idea. [...] In these interpretations, Sappho was involved in the ritual education of girls, for instance as a trainer of choruses of girls.|$|E
