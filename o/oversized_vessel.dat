500|$|Triton is {{referenced}} {{briefly in}} three popular Cold War novels. In The Last Mayday by Keith Wheeler (1968), Triton {{is depicted as}} participating in a submarine training exercise {{at the beginning of}} the novel, with special notice made of her large, rectangular sail. [...] In the 1978 novel Cold is the Sea by Edward L. Beach, the second sequel to his 1955 best-seller Run Silent, Run Deep, Triton is mentioned several times. Also, the under-ice towing capability that was considered for Triton served as a key plot point for the novel. [...] Finally, in The Hunt for Red October by Tom Clancy, the biographical background for Marko Ramius mentions that, while commanding a Charlie-class submarine, Ramius had [...] "hounded [...] mercilessly for twelve hours" [...] in the Norwegian Sea. Subsequently, Ramius [...] "would note with no small satisfaction that the Triton was soon thereafter retired, because, it was said, the <b>oversized</b> <b>vessel</b> had proven unable to deal with the newer Soviet designs." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{our initial}} {{experience with the}} "Big Skinny" angioplasty catheter, currently only available as an investigational device and in sizes of 4. 5, 5, and 6 mm. Six patients with severe angina pectoris were successfully dilated with this angioplasty catheter and have remained asymptomatic up until a mean follow-up period of 6 months. However, {{because of the large}} profile of the catheter, sufficient back-up with an adequate guiding catheter should be obtained and predilation with a smaller angioplasty catheter should be performed. The use of this catheter may be a more simple alternative for the treatment of <b>oversized</b> <b>vessel</b> stenosis than the "hugging balloon" technique or directional atherectomy. Otherwise, it may be considered as an adjunct technique in order to optimize the angiographic result after stenting or directional arthrectomy in this particular indication...|$|E
25|$|Within {{many of the}} site's {{structures}} are impressive gateways; the ones of monumental scale are placed on artificial mounds, platforms, or sunken courts. Many gateways show iconography of the Staff God. This iconography also is used on some <b>oversized</b> <b>vessels,</b> indicating an importance to the culture. This iconography is most present on the Gateway of the Sun.|$|R
50|$|Shelter Island {{is known}} as a {{destination}} for superyachts because it contains one of the few marinas in San Diego Bay with a deep enough harbor for these <b>oversized</b> <b>vessels.</b> The annual YachtFest, spotlighting superyachts, is held at Shelter Island Marina every September. The event also features mock gunbattles between two replicas of 19th century tall ships from the collection of the San Diego Maritime Museum.|$|R
40|$|Alterations in {{vessel wall}} {{reactivity}} (VR) at or {{adjacent to the}} dilation site after balloon angioplasty (BA) may {{vary according to the}} inflation protocol and the time after angioplasty and may influence outcome. In 64 atherosclerotic rabbit femoral arteries, we evaluated VR after BA with intravenous ergonovine (ERGO) (40,ug/min for 5 minutes) and intra-arterial nitroglycerin (NTG) (2, 500,ug single bolus) 24 - 72 hours and 28 days after BA. Comparisons were made with atherosclerotic, nonangioplastied, age-matched controls. BA was standardized to three 1 -minute inflations, each 1 minute apart. For each balloon size, 2. 5 - (appropriate size) or 3. 0 -mm (<b>oversized)</b> <b>vessels</b> were allocated to either 5 or 10 atm inflation pressure. For the analysis, four groups were compared: Group 1, 3. 0 / 5; group 2, 3. 0 / 10; group 3, 2. 5 / 5, and group 4, 2. 5 mm/ 10 atm. Angiographic diameters were measured at, proximal, and distal to the lesion at baseline, 10 minutes after ERGO, and 5 minutes after NTG. Angiograms were measured with electronic calipers by two blinded observers. All segments of control vessels vasoconstricted to ERGO and vasodilated to NTG (p< 0. 05 versus baseline), indicating a normal response. At 24 - 72 hours after dilatation, the angioplasty sites for all inflation pressure/balloon size combinations were not responsive to either ERGO or NTG. All segments distal to the dilatatio...|$|R
40|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{may lead}} to stroke. Medical therapy is usually {{the first line of}} treatment. The endovascular approach of medically refractory vertebral artery dissection may include numerous techniques, including coil occlusion of the parent vessel. Two cases are presented of medically refractory symptomatic vertebral artery dissections in which vessel coil occlusion was successfully achieved with a single long oversized coil. There were no periprocedural complications and both patients had excellent clinical and angiographic outcome and remained asymptomatic on follow-up. The use of a single long <b>oversized</b> coil in <b>vessel</b> sacrifice has not been described previously. It represents a safe, rapid and cost effective alternative to the current existing techniques for vessel sacrifice...|$|R
