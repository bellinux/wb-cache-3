When Baker claimed Houston had given him an <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, Houston denied it. Houston's account was that the residents burned their own property {{to keep it out}} of the hands of the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east.|$|E
5|$|Five Vulcans were {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} operation. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, each aircraft had to receive various last-minute adaptations; including modifications to the bomb bay, the reinstatement of the long out-of-use in-flight refuelling system, the installation of a new navigational system derived from the Vickers VC10, and the updating of several onboard electronics. Underneath the wings, new pylons were fitted to carry an ECM pod and Shrike anti-radar missiles at wing hardpoint locations; these hardpoints had originally been installed for the purpose of carrying the cancelled Skybolt nuclear missile. Engineering work to retrofit these Vulcans had begun on 9 April.|$|E

At the next owners' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, they had to agree in a vote that required a super-majority. Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the owners to permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players. However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.|$|E
5|$|In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{justice to}} the {{recording}} of Quadrophenia, the group decided {{to build their own}} studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later still lacked an adequate mixing desk that could handle recording Quadrophenia. Instead, Townshend's friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for The Faces, loaned his mobile studio for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally lacked discipline. By mid 1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who's services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Townshend's associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.|$|E

5|$|Marcel Pagnol's 1953 film Manon des Sources {{was four}} hours long, and {{subsequently}} cut by its distributor. The end result left Pagnol dissatisfied, {{and led him}} to retell the story as a novel. The {{first part of the}} novel, titled Jean de Florette, was an exploration of the background for the film; a prequel of sorts. Together the two volumes made up the work Pagnol called L'Eau des collines (The Water of the Hills). Berri came across Pagnol's book by chance in a hotel room, and was captivated by it. He decided that in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the story justice it had to be made in two parts.|$|E
5|$|The Thorne Moors Improvement Company {{was set up}} in 1848, {{authorised}} by the Thorne Moor Drainage and Improvement Act. They {{were charged}} with improving parts of the bog. Their activities increased in the 1880s, when they began to lease areas to companies who extracted the peat commercially for use as animal bedding. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, ditches had to be cut {{to begin the process of}} drainage. As the extent of the workings increased, a Dutch company cut canals in the peat. Horses pulled barges from canal paths alongside in order to remove the peat from the moors. Subsequently, a network of small railways were constructed along the canals to transport the peat.|$|E
5|$|A near-contemporary {{account of}} Æthelwig's life, or Vita, is {{included}} in the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, the monastic chronicle for Evesham Abbey. This was a 13th-century work by Thomas of Marlborough, which was written to bolster the Evesham's case for exemption from the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Worcester, in whose diocese Evensham was. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, Thomas incorporated earlier works dealing with Evesham's history, including the work on Æthelwig. However, because of Thomas' purpose in composing the Chronicon, he probably altered some of the texts he included, and it appears that the life of Æthelwig was first incorporated into a complete history of the abbey and then that composit work was adapted by Thomas into his Chronicon. The main evidence for this is internal stylistic evidence, where the Æthelwig material is stylistic uniform with other material dating to prior to 1077, with information after 1077 forming a separate writing style.|$|E

5|$|According to the plan, {{the main}} forces of Army Group Narwa had to {{withdraw}} mainly through Viljandi and Pärnu to Riga. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, II Army Corps at the Emajõgi front and XXVIII Army Corps at the Väike Emajõgi {{had to keep}} the front line stable until the Army Detachment had passed behind them. Officially, {{the beginning of the}} operation was supposed to be September 19. The retreat was to be gradual, over several lines of resistance. The withdrawal was to be backed mainly by the units consisting of Estonians, who, by the estimates of the German army command, would not have wanted to leave Estonia anyway. A naval force under Vice-Admiral Theodor Burchardi began evacuating elements of the German formations along with some civilians on 17 September. The headquarters prepared a detailed plan to leave their positions at the Narva front on the night of 18–19 September.|$|E
5|$|Faust {{began to}} work out concept sketches, several of which {{appeared}} on her DeviantArt page, including ponies from the original series (Twilight, Applejack, Firefly, Surprise, Posey and Sparkler), which later provided the core for the main cast of the show. Hasbro approved the show with Faust as Executive Producer {{and asked her to}} complete the pitch bible. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, Faust brought in Martin Ansolabehere and Paul Rudish, who had worked on other animated shows with her. Faust credits Rudish for the inspiration of the pegasus ponies controlling the weather in Equestria, as well as the character of Nightmare Moon during this period. Faust also consulted Craig McCracken, her husband and also an animator and creator of The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. After seeing the initial version of the pitch bible, Hasbro requested more character designs from Faust's team; subsequently, Faust brought aboard Dave Dunnet and Lynne Naylor to further refine the background and character styles.|$|E
5|$|For his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{turned to}} a question that was to shape his lifetime research. He sought exact solutions of Einstein's equations: model universes consistent with the laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit description in terms of basic mathematical expressions. These exact solutions {{play a key role}} when it comes to building general-relativistic models of physical situations. However, general relativity is a fully covariant theory – its laws are the same, independent of which coordinates are chosen to describe a given situation. One direct consequence is that two apparently different exact solutions could correspond to the same model universe, and differ only in their coordinates. Ehlers began to look for serviceable ways of characterizing exact solutions invariantly, that is, in ways that do not depend on coordinate choice. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, he examined ways of describing the intrinsic geometric properties of the known exact solutions.|$|E

5|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to prove their}} clients' innocence. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, they cross-examine witnesses; during these cross-examinations, the player aims to find lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies. They are {{able to go back}} and forth between the different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement. In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands, and in the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence by swinging the Wii Remote. At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Phoenix's claims. On the screen, a number of exclamation marks are shown; if the player presents an incorrect piece of evidence, one of the exclamation marks disappear. If all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart. When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.|$|E
5|$|The AGM-129 was fielded in 1987 as a {{stealthy}} {{cruise missile}} platform {{to deliver the}} W80-1 variable yield nuclear warhead. Although originally designed to equip the B-1B Lancer bomber, the AGM-129 was redesignated {{so that it would}} only be carried by the B-52H, mounted on external pylons on the wings or internally in the bomb bay. In March 2007, the USAF decided to retire its AGM-129 complement in order to help comply with international arms-control treaties and to replace them with AGM-86 missiles. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, the USAF began to transport its AGM-129s stored at Minot to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana by B-52s for ultimate disposal. According to The Washington Post, by 29 August 2007, more than 200 AGM-129s had been shipped from Minot to Barksdale in this manner.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of Celestial Master {{belief is that}} there is an energy source known as qi, that is born from the Dao and is the source of life all things. The human body contains spirits that need to be nourished by the proper balance of qi. There are three types of qi: yin qi, yang qi and blended qi, which is mixed yin/yang qi. The goal of a Daoist is to achieve transcendence to a higher plane. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, they must preserve and harmonize their internal spirits. Only through meditation that guides qi correctly throughout the body, can the spirits be harmonized correctly. While it is known that the Celestial Masters meditated in order to obtain qi, there is no surviving evidence that describes their meditation practices.|$|E

5|$|The use of data loggers at {{sea that}} record {{ingestion}} of water against time (providing a likely time of feeding) suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of the squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses {{has shown that}} many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross, suggesting that, for some species (like the wandering albatross), scavenged squid may be {{an important part of the}} diet. The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate; some certainly comes from squid fisheries, but in nature it primarily comes from the die-off that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of squid-eating whales (sperm whales, pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales). The diet of other species, like the black-browed albatross or the grey-headed albatross, is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet. The waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism, harassing boobies to steal their food, making it the only member of its <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so regularly.|$|E
5|$|Unternehmen Paula (Undertaking or Operation Paula) is the German codename {{given for}} the Second World War Luftwaffe {{offensive}} operation to destroy the remaining units of the Armée de l'Air (ALA), or French Air Force during the Battle of France in 1940. On 10 May the German armed forces (Wehrmacht) began their invasion of Western Europe. By 3 June, the British Army had withdrawn from Dunkirk and the continent in Operation Dynamo, the Netherlands and Belgium had surrendered {{and most of the}} formations of the French Army were disbanded or destroyed. To complete the defeat of France, the Germans undertook a second phase operation, Fall Rot (Case Red), to conquer the remaining regions.

5|$|Bede {{synthesised}} and transmitted {{the learning}} from his predecessors, {{as well as}} made careful, judicious innovation in knowledge (such as recalculating {{the age of the}} earth—for which he was censured before surviving the heresy accusations and eventually having his views championed by Archbishop Ussher in the sixteenth century—see below) that had theological implications. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, he learned Greek, and attempted to learn Hebrew. He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments. He mentions that he studied from a text of Jerome's Vulgate, which itself was from the Hebrew text. He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church. In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians, including works by Basil, Cassian, John Chrysostom, Isidore of Seville, Origen, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine of Hippo, Jerome, Pope Gregory I, Ambrose of Milan, Cassiodorus, and Cyprian. He used these, in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves, to write his commentaries and other theological works. He had a Latin translation by Evagrius of Athanasius's Life of Antony, and a copy of Sulpicius Severus' Life of St. Martin. He also used lesser known writers, such as Fulgentius, Julian of Eclanum, Tyconius, and Prosper of Aquitaine. Bede was the first to refer to Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin Fathers of the Church. It is clear from Bede's own comments that he felt his calling was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers.|$|E
