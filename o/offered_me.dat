Munnerlyn stated, [...] "I had other visits set up but the number that Minnesota <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> was the number I was looking for.

[...] There are, however, significant differences between author and character. Haley is both an academic and a writer of fiction, while McEwan has been a professional author for his entire career. The intelligence agency plot is also completely fictional; there was never a scheme such as the one described in the book run by MI5.

Wise had started making compositions for the game when he was still a freelance musician. He has said that he originally assumed the music he composed for the game would later be replaced with compositions by a Japanese composer, since he understood how important the Donkey Kong license was to Nintendo. But he was later asked by Rare to record three jungle demo tunes, which were connected together to become the [...] "DK Swing": [...] "I guess someone thought the music was suitable, as they <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> a full time position at Rare." ...|$|E

I banged the phone down not believing a word of what he said". However, after meeting Bhradwaj and hearing a script reading, he loved the story and accepted the offer. The actors Chandan Roy Sanyal, Shiv Subramnayam, Hrishikesh Joshi, Rajatava Dutta and Deb Mukherjee were cast in supporting roles.

Benn's contact with leading politicians of the day, {{dates back to}} his earliest years. He met Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald when he was five years old, whom he described as: [...] "A kindly old gentleman [...] leaned over me and <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> a chocolate biscuit. I've looked at Labour leaders {{in a funny way}} ever since." [...] Benn also met former Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George when he was twelve, and later recalled that, while still a boy, he once shook hands with Mahatma Gandhi; in 1931, while his father was Secretary of State for India.|$|E

[...] She acknowledged to the Herald Sun that it was helpful to have Gibson's production company assist with her music career, [...] "If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful. You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing. It's not like I've changed my goals at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Townsend {{was proud}} {{of what he had}} {{accomplished}} so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. [...] "I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality," [...] he later reflected. [...] "This combination was appalling." [...] He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai's offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend's music. [...] "I have a hunch they only <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> a deal to get me to sing with Steve," [...] he mused. While touring with the Wildhearts, Townsend {{received a phone call from}} an A representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as [...] "just noise".|$|E

500|$|Troutman, {{seeing the}} disarray that was {{surrounding}} Clinton at the time, accepted Warner Bros. offer of {{more money for}} the demo recordings of his album. The move resulted in a bitter severing of partnerships between Clinton and Troutman, and with Clinton's departure, Troutman was left to exercise virtually full creative control over the band's later work. In Clinton's biography George Clinton: For the Record, Troutman was quoted commenting on the situation with a blasé attitude, [...] "... Heck gee-willickers, Warner Bros. <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> mo' money". In response, Clinton remarked, [...] "CBS paid for it, I paid for it. I don't like {{to go into it}} on the negative side, but it cost about 5 million , and a lot of people's jobs and what we consider as the empire falling". [...] The loss of money that resulted from the actions of Troutman, is credited as one of the factors that disassembled both Clinton's and Funkadelic's musical careers. [...] The Many Facets of Roger was eventually released in August 1981 on Warner Bros.|$|E

When met with a lawsuit in 1951 for the plagiarization, ahbez first proclaimed his innocence, and telephoned Yablokoff to explain that he [...] "had heard the melody as if angels were singing it... in the California mountains. He <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> $10,000 to withdraw the suit. I said that the money was not important, but I wanted him {{to admit that the}} song was geganvet and if he heard angels, they must have bought a copy of my song." [...] Eventually ahbez's lawyers offered to have an out-of-court settlement, offering $25,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to Yablokoff, which he accepted. Freidwald remarked that [...] "it struck no one as ironic that a song with message of love and peace should come to symbolize how cutthroat the pop music business was becoming".|$|E

After three disappointing Test appearances, this was my second chance, {{and the opportunity to}} set the record straight... the telephone finally rang. 'Got some bad news, I'm afraid,' David began. 'I couldn't persuade Ted Dexter or Mickey Stewart, so you're not in any more. They've gone for Alan Igglesden. Know anything about him?' With that, David must have known his influence as England captain was over – and indeed Graham Gooch succeeded him after that Test. I felt utterly devastated, and knew I would never play for England again, which had been my main motivating force. So when the Today newspaper <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> the post of cricket correspondent the following summer, it was an easy decision to make. I might have been only thirty, which was no age to retire from professional cricket, and I could easily have played for another five years. But it was definitely time to move on." ...|$|E

Actress Joan Van Ark was contacted by series creator David Jacobs about joining the show. Her husband, John Marshall, convinced her to take the opportunity. In an interview for an episode of Celebrity Weddings, Van Ark said: [...] "At the time Dallas came up, I was doing two different jobs. They <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> to join Dallas, which would be shot in Dallas, Texas at Southfork. I read the script and it was buzzed about already...they were saying this was the hot new show.

500|$|In special {{elections}} in June, pro-Union candidates captured 9 of 10 seats in Kentucky's House delegation. Returning to the Senate {{for a special}} session in July, Breckinridge {{was regarded as a}} traitor by most of his fellow legislators because of his Confederate sympathies. He condemned as unconstitutional Lincoln's enlistment and arming of men for a war Congress had not officially declared, his expending funds for the war that had not been allocated by Congress, and his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. He was the only senator to vote against a resolution authorizing Lincoln to use [...] "the entire resources of the government" [...] for the war. Asked what he would do if he were president, he replied, [...] "I would prefer to see these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> in life... But I infinitely prefer to see a peaceful separation of these States than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, {{at the end of which}} I see the grave of public liberty and of personal freedom." [...] On August 1, he declared that, if Kentucky sided with the federal government against the Confederacy, [...] "she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Senate convened for {{a special}} session on July 4, 1861, Breckinridge stood almost alone in {{opposition}} to the war. Labeled a traitor, he was removed from the Committee on Military Affairs. He demanded to know what authority Lincoln had to blockade Southern ports or suspend the writ of habeas corpus. He reminded his fellow senators that Congress had not approved a declaration of war and maintained that Lincoln's enlistment of men and expenditure of funds for the war effort were unconstitutional. If the Union could be persuaded not to attack the Confederacy, he predicted that [...] "all those sentiments of common interest and feeling... might lead to a political reunion founded upon consent". On August 1, he declared that if Kentucky supported Lincoln's prosecution of the war, [...] "she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate." [...] Asked by Oregon's Edward Dickinson Baker how he would handle the secession crisis, he responded, [...] "I would prefer to see these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be <b>offered</b> <b>me</b> in life... But I infinitely prefer to see a peaceful separation of these States, than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, {{at the end of which}} I see the grave of public liberty and of personal freedom." ...|$|E
