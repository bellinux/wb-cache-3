5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the <b>osteotomy</b> is created or the implant placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of the removed wedge of bone depends on where osteoarthritis has damaged the knee cartilage.

40|$|Mandibular setback <b>osteotomies</b> {{potentially}} lead to {{narrowing of}} the pharyngeal airways, subsequently resulting in post-surgical {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA). To summarize current evidence from systematic reviews that has evaluated pharyngeal airway changes after mandibular setback with or without concomitant upper jaw <b>osteotomies.</b> PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched with no restriction of language or date. Systematic reviews studying changes in pharyngeal airway dimensions and respiratory parameters after mandibular setback with or without concomitant upper jaw <b>osteotomies</b> have been identified, screened for eligibility, included and analyzed in this study. Six systematic reviews have been included. While isolated mandibular setback <b>osteotomies</b> result in reduced oropharyngeal airway dimensions, the reduction is lesser in cases with concomitant upper jaw <b>osteotomies.</b> Only scarce evidence exists currently to what happens to naso- and hypo-pharyngeal airways. There is no evidence for post-surgical OSA, even though some studies reported reduced respiratory parameters after single-jaw mandibular setback with or without concomitant upper jaw <b>osteotomies.</b> Although mandibular setback <b>osteotomies</b> reduce pharyngeal airway dimensions, evidence confirming post-surgical OSA was not found. Nevertheless, potential post-surgical OSA {{should be taken into}} serious consideration during the treatment planning of particular orthognathic cases. As moderate evidence exists that double-jaw surgeries lead to less compromised post-surgical pharyngeal airways, they should be considered as the method of choice especially in cases with severe dentoskeletal Class III deformity.

25|$|During a high tibial <b>osteotomy,</b> {{surgeons}} {{remove a}} wedge of bone from {{the outside of the}} knee, which causes the leg to bend slightly inward. This resembles the realigning of a bowlegged knee to a knock-kneed position.

25|$|An <b>osteotomy</b> is a {{surgical}} operation whereby a bone is cut to shorten or lengthen it or {{to change its}} alignment. It is sometimes performed to correct a hallux valgus, or to straighten a bone that has healed crookedly following a fracture. It {{is also used to}} correct a coxa vara, genu valgum, and genu varum. The operation is done under a general anaesthetic.|$|E
25|$|Knee <b>osteotomy</b> is {{commonly}} used to realign arthritic damage {{on one side of}} the knee. The goal is to shift the patient's body weight off the damaged area to the other side of the knee, where the cartilage is still healthy. Surgeons remove a wedge of the tibia from underneath the healthy side of the knee, which allows the tibia and femur to bend away from the damaged cartilage.|$|E
30|$|All of the {{patients}} in the hip group underwent soft tissue lengthening with adductor longus and gracilis tenotomy with a fractional lengthening of adductor brevis, and varus derotational <b>osteotomies</b> (VDRO). The VDROs were performed through a standard lateral approach with a supine position and all had a 2 -cm femoral shortening performed as a standard portion of the hip reconstruction to decrease soft-tissue tension. Patients older than 7  years of age underwent concomitant pelvic <b>osteotomies</b> with the VDRO {{if there were any}} signs of acetabular dysplasia. All pelvic <b>osteotomies</b> were performed with an anterior approach, elevating the gluteal muscles off the outer table of the pelvis; the inner table was not violated.

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive in <b>osteotomies</b> and bone grafts, with regard to macroscopic and radiographic characteristics. Methods: Forty-eight rabbits were used, randomly divided into four groups of 12 animals, with observation periods of two, four, eight and 16 weeks. Both thoracic limbs were operated in each animal and two <b>osteotomies</b> were performed {{in each of the}} radii, withdrawing a bone fragment (bone graft) of 1 cm in length. On one side, the bone graft was then replaced and a drop of adhesive was applied to each of the <b>osteotomies.</b> On the other side, the same procedure was performed without applying the adhesive. The rejection level for the nullity hypothesis was set at 0. 05 % or 5 %. Results: Blue marks were present in all the surgical specimens in which adhesive was applied. From the fourth week onwards, there was absence of movement of the bone grafts with adhesive and control. In group A, in the proximal <b>osteotomies</b> with adhesive, there was less deviation of the bone graft (p = 0. 02). In group C, the union (p = 0. 03) and the integration of the bone graft (p = 0. 02) were better in the proximal <b>osteotomies</b> with adhesive. Conclusions: The adhesive was not completely metabolized within 16 weeks. There was clinical consolidation of the <b>osteotomies</b> within four weeks. The adhesive stabilized the bone graft within the first weeks and did not interfere with the consolidation of the <b>osteotomies,</b> or the integration of the bone graft in radiographic observations...|$|R

25|$|Arthroplasty is an {{orthopedic}} surgery where the articular {{surface of a}} musculoskeletal joint is replaced, remodeled, or realigned by <b>osteotomy</b> or some other procedure. It is an elective procedure that is done to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis (rheumasurgery) or some other type of trauma. As well as the standard total knee replacement surgery, the uni-compartmental knee replacement, in which only one weight-bearing surface of an arthritic knee is replaced, is a popular alternative.|$|E
25|$|Hip {{modification}} surgeries include excision arthroplasty, {{in which}} {{the head of the}} femur is removed and reshaped or replaced, and pelvic rotation (also known as triple pelvic <b>osteotomy,</b> or pubic symphodesis) {{in which the}} hip socket is realigned, may be appropriate if done early enough. These treatments can be very effective, but as a rule tend to become less effective for heavier animals - their ability to treat the problem becomes reduced if the joint has to handle more pressure in daily life. Pelvic rotation is also not as effective if arthritis has developed {{to the point of being}} visible on X-rays.|$|E
25|$|The lateral {{approach}} is also commonly used for hip replacement. The approach requires {{elevation of the}} hip abductors (gluteus medius and gluteus minimus) to access the joint. The abductors may be lifted up by <b>osteotomy</b> of the greater trochanter and reapplying it afterwards using wires (as per Charnley), or may be divided at their tendinous portion, or through the functional tendon (as per Hardinge) and repaired using sutures. Although this approach has a lower dislocation risk than the posterior approach, critics note that occasionally the abductor muscles do not heal back on, leading to pain and weakness which is often very difficult to treat.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{proximal}} femoral <b>osteotomies</b> (PFO) {{in children}} is to restore normal anatomy and optimal joint congruency to prevent medium and long-terms degenerative {{deterioration of the}} hip. They {{play an important role}} in the treatment of neurological subluxations or dislocations of the hip. Advances in modern imaging and surgical techniques have improved understanding of the anatomical factors associated with a number of disorders of the growing hip and their sequelae. The indications for isolated PFO or associated with other intra- or extraarticular procedures have become more rational and better adapted to the various architectural defects and the femoroacetabular impingements. Two types of <b>osteotomies</b> are described: intertrochanteric <b>osteotomies</b> (varus and valgus correction, valgisation, flexion, extension), and <b>osteotomies</b> of the greater trochanter, either simple or double with lengthening of the femoral neck. Primary stability of the osteosynthesis is the major problem, as it is often affected by osteopenia. The development of new implants (LCP plate) avoids this inconvenience, resulting in geometrically precise <b>osteotomies</b> and a more stable fixation. Even when it is correctly performed, articular congruence is not always managed by PFO alone, it is sometimes necessary to associate acetabular procedures. PublishedN/...|$|R
