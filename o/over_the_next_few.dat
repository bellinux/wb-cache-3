50|$|Napoleon III visualized three {{distinct}} Algerias: a French colony, an Arab country, {{and a military}} camp, each with a distinct form of local government. The second decree, issued in 1865, was designed to recognize the differences in cultural background of the French and the Muslims. As French nationals, Muslims could serve on equal terms in the French armed forces and civil service and could migrate to France proper. They were also granted the protection of French law while retaining the right to adhere to Islamic law in litigation concerning their personal status. But if Muslims wished to become full citizens, they had to accept the full jurisdiction of the French legal code, including laws affecting marriage and inheritance, and reject {{the authority of the}} religious courts. In effect, this meant that a Muslim had to renounce some of the mores of his religion in order to become a French citizen. This condition was bitterly resented by Muslims, for whom the only road to political equality was perceived to be apostasy. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> century, <b>fewer</b> than 3,000 Muslims chose to cross the barrier and become French citizens. A similar status applied to the Jewish natives.|$|R

Within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> years <b>the</b> role and operation of DNA in genetic inheritance were discovered, leading to what is now known as the [...] "Central Dogma" [...] of molecular biology. In the 1960s molecular phylogenetics, the investigation of evolutionary [...] "family trees" [...] by techniques derived from biochemistry, began to make an impact, particularly when it was proposed that the human lineage had diverged from apes much more recently than was generally thought at the time. Although this early study compared proteins from apes and humans, most molecular phylogenetics research is now based on comparisons of RNA and DNA.|$|R
