In 2001 a grass-roots initiative was started within IABC's membership that eventually developed into the Gift of Communication program, whereby members donated their professional services to local charities. Membership grew 79 percent {{each year in}} the 2000s due to an increasing number <b>of</b> <b>practitioners</b> in the field of internal communications. IABC hosted its first annual world conference in 2005 and grew to more than 16,000 members by 2008.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two distinct}} forms <b>of</b> <b>practitioner</b> research and makes tentative suggestions around what may constitute good practice in their conduct and reporting, {{and for the}} genre <b>of</b> <b>practitioner</b> research as a whole. We also explore their potential benefits and limitations within the wider set of research approaches. Discussion is informed primarily by an earlier review <b>of</b> <b>practitioner</b> research in adult social care and supplemented by knowledge and experience of wider activities related to practitioner research. Discussion is organised in three parts. First, we explore what are generic good practices around all forms <b>of</b> <b>practitioner</b> research. Second, we move to identify particular forms of good practice within what we call Type 1 and Type 2 practitioner research, situating them alongside a <b>practitioner</b> research matrix <b>of</b> stakeholder benefits. Third, we consider the implications of such discussion for how we best stimulate these types <b>of</b> <b>practitioner</b> research...|$|R

5|$|On 25 April 1999, {{more than}} ten {{thousand}} practitioners congregated outside Communist Party of China headquarters in Zhongnanhai to request legal recognition. That evening, then-Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin issued a decision to eradicate Falun Gong. At Jiang's direction, on 7 June 1999 a special leading group was established within the party's Central Committee to manage the persecution. The resulting organisation, called the 6-10 Office, {{assumed the role of}} coordinating the anti-Falun Gong media coverage in the state-run press, as well influencing other party and state entities such as the courts and security agencies. On 19 July, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a document effectively banning the practice of Falun Gong. The following day, hundreds <b>of</b> <b>practitioners</b> were detained by security forces.|$|E
5|$|Ownby {{confirms}} {{estimates that}} Falun Gong is practiced {{by hundreds of}} thousands of people outside China, with the largest communities found in Taiwan and in North American cities with large Chinese populations, such as New York City, San Francisco, Vancouver, and Toronto. Demographic surveys by sociologist Susan Palmer and David Ownby in North American communities found that 90% <b>of</b> <b>practitioners</b> were ethnic Chinese (in Europe, there are proportionally more Caucasians). The average age was approximately 42. Among survey respondents, 56% were female and 44% male; 80% were married. The surveys found the respondents to be highly educated: 9% held PhDs, 34% had master's degrees, and 24% had a bachelor's degree.|$|E
5|$|The religion's origins {{lie in the}} 19th- {{and early}} 20th-century Romanticist {{movement}} which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Germanic societies. In this period organised groups venerating the Germanic gods developed in Germany and Austria; these {{were part of the}} Völkisch movement and typically exhibited a racialist interpretation of the religion, resulting in the movement largely dissolving following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. In the 1970s, new Heathen groups emerged in Europe and North America, developing into formalized organizations in order to promote their faith. In recent decades, the Heathen movement {{has been the subject of}} academic study by scholars active in the field of Pagan studies.
