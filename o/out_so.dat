5|$|Although each race {{is unique}} in its composition, no race has an innate {{advantage}} over the other.

5|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{immigration}} from New England and New York—regions where most major towns had originated as trading centers rather than political or manufacturing centers—many new settlements in Minnesota were laid <b>out</b> <b>so</b> as to heavily favor the business districts rather than the city halls or courthouses. This plan and the philosophy behind it spurred the growth of economic links between the communities and with {{other parts of the}} U.S.|$|E

5|$|The Shield nickel {{series has}} yielded {{a large number}} of varieties. Howard Spindel, a leading expert on Shield nickels, notes that Shield nickel dies {{produced}} far fewer coins than other coin dies, as the dies wore <b>out</b> <b>so</b> fast that the Mint was continually under great pressure to produce new ones. According to Spindel, many dies were hastily and carelessly produced, producing numerous minor varieties.|$|E
5|$|The {{automobile}} {{is by far}} {{the dominant}} form of transport in Canberra. The city is laid <b>out</b> <b>so</b> that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density; this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space.|$|E
5|$|At a music festival, Sunny is embarrassed when Ringo and Declan Napier (James Sorensen) {{interrupt}} a kiss {{between her}} and Zeke. She runs off into the bush, falls down a cliff and injures her ankle. Zeke also falls down the cliff, they are eventually rescued by Declan and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Karl and Susan call Sunny's parents and learn that they know nothing about the festival or Zeke. Sunny's parents demand that she {{is placed on the}} next flight home. However, Zeke moves <b>out,</b> <b>so</b> Sunny's parents will not worry about them having a relationship. Zeke later moves back home and Karl asks Sunny to call her father and translate for him. Sunny lies to her father {{about the nature of the}} conversation and tells him that her father said everything is fine.|$|E

5|$|Because of its poor flying ability, {{large size}} and {{possible}} island tameness, the broad-billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius, and their nests {{would have been}} extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced crab-eating macaques and rats. Various sources indicate the bird was aggressive, {{which may explain why}} it held <b>out</b> <b>so</b> long against introduced animals after all. The bird is believed to have become extinct by the 1680s, when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale. Unlike other parrot species, which were often taken as pets by sailors, there are no records of broad-billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead, perhaps because of the stigma associated with ravens. The birds would not in any case have survived such a journey if they refused to eat anything but seeds.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel assumed {{command of}} the newly formed Anzac Mounted Division on 16 March 1916, the day after it {{relieved}} the 1st Division on the Suez Canal defences. Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches {{for his part in}} the defence of the Canal. His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences, {{the northern part of the}} Canal, under Major General H. A. Lawrence. Arrangements were far from ideal. The mounted troops were parcelled <b>out</b> <b>so</b> that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel's command. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir Archibald Murray GHQ Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). Lawrence was too far away to control the battle, especially once the telephone lines were cut. Murray, in Ismailia, was even further back.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s the Japanese {{government}} {{adopted an}} ultranationalist militancy {{with a view}} to greatly expand the Japanese Empire. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934, renouncing its treaty obligations. After withdrawing from the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new Yamato class of heavy battleships. Their planners recognized Japan would be unable to compete with the output of U.S. naval shipyards should war break <b>out,</b> <b>so</b> the 70,000ton vessels of the Yamato class were designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy battleships at the same time.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, Graham also {{saved the}} life of Captain Wyndham– {{one of those who}} had shut the gate– by {{shooting}} a sniper whose musket was trained on the officer. Mid-afternoon, a fire broke out in one of the farm buildings following a bombardment of incendiary shells. Graham's brother Joseph was lying wounded within, and Graham requested permission to fall <b>out,</b> <b>so</b> he might rescue his brother; given permission, he retrieved his brother and returned to his post. Joseph Graham died of wounds five days later.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mating}} season, the male moults its brown {{feathers}} and displays a fiery red plumage. It may fluff its red back and shoulder feathers <b>out</b> <b>so</b> they cover {{part of the}} wings in a puffball-display. It will fly about and confront another male to repel it, or to assert dominance over a female. It also picks red petals and sometimes red seeds and presents them to other birds. 90% of the time, the male presents to a female in {{what appears to be}} a courtship ritual. The other 10% of the time, it presents to another male in an act of apparent aggression.|$|E
5|$|Eddy copyrighted her book, {{then called}} The Science of Life, in July 1874. Three of her students, George Barry, Elizabeth Newhall and Daniel Spofford, paid a Boston printer, W. F. Brown and Company, $2,200 {{to produce the}} first edition. The printer began work in September 1874, but stopped {{whenever}} the advance payment ran <b>out,</b> <b>so</b> progress was slow. The book—Science and Health by Mary Baker Glover, with eight chapters and 456 pages—finally appeared on October 30, 1875, published {{in the name of}} the Christian Science Publishing Company.|$|E

Jennifer {{believes}} Kenneth is black, but Kenneth reveals he is white and expresses his feeling for her, and admits to her that Tracy was doing all the talking.

5|$|In 1997, 20th Century Fox optioned {{the rights}} from Marvel Enterprises, and Chris Columbus {{was chosen to}} direct the film. In 1998, Marvel was facing bankruptcy. During this time 20th Century Fox allowed the option to expire, so Disney began {{negotiations}} in order to acquire the rights. In 1999, the negotiations failed to work <b>out</b> <b>so</b> Marvel set the project up with Columbia Pictures. During this time, Chris Columbus and Carlo Carlei co-wrote a script together, before Mark Steven Johnson got signed to write the screenplay. By 2000, Sony decided to cancel the project, as the two companies reportedly could not {{come to an agreement}} over Internet rights.|$|E
5|$|In 662, Maximus {{was placed}} on trial once more, and was once more convicted of heresy. Following the trial Maximus was tortured, having his tongue cut <b>out,</b> <b>so</b> {{he could no longer}} speak his rebellion, and his right hand cut off, so that he could no longer write letters. Maximus was then exiled to the Lazica or Colchis region of modern-day Georgia and was cast in the {{fortress}} of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of Tsageri. He died soon thereafter, on 13 August 662. The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by Anastasius Bibliothecarius.|$|E
