5|$|After {{joining the}} Jesuits Soegija spent another year in Mariëndaal in juniorate. Beginning in 1923 he studied {{philosophy}} at Berchmann College in Oudenbosch; {{during this time}} he examined the teachings of Thomas Aquinas and began writing on Christianity. In a letter dated 11August 1923, he wrote that the Javanese were so far unable to discern between Catholics and Protestants, and {{that the best way}} to convert the Javanese was by deeds, not words. He also translated some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 27th International Eucharistic Congress, held in Amsterdam in 1924, for the Javanese-language magazine Swaratama, which circulated mainly among Xaverius alumni. Several of Soegija's other writings were published in St. Claverbond, Berichten uit Java. He graduated from Berchmann in 1926, then began preparations to return to the Indies.|$|E
5|$|At age 11, {{he came to}} the {{attention}} to the prefect of Grenoble, Joseph Fourier, who had accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on the Egyptian expedition which had discovered the Rosetta Stone. An accomplished scholar in addition to a well known mathematical physicist, Fourier had been entrusted by Napoleon with the publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expedition in the monumental series of publications titled Description de l'Égypte. One biographer has stated that Fourier invited the 11-year-old Champollion to his home and showed him his collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts and documents. Champollion was enthralled, and upon seeing the hieroglyphs and hearing that they were unintelligible, he declared that he would be the one to succeed in reading them. Whether or not the report of this visit is true, Fourier did go on to become one of Champollion's most important allies and supporters, and surely had an important role in instilling his interest in Ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has explained}} that Vincent's character shifted {{from that of}} horror researcher, to detective, to chemist, and finally to {{the figure of a}} former Turk with a tragic past. Director Yoshinori Kitase {{was in charge of the}} cutscene in which Vincent joins the party, while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote his backstory. Nojima had a great deal of trouble with Vincent's dialogue, as he very rarely speaks. In the original script of the game, Vincent was introduced in a similar fashion, but was a handsome, sarcastic personality. He would join Cloud's group after learning they were in pursuit of Hojo, but he had no knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimentation to which he was subjected. Additionally, he would be also privy to more information regarding Shinra's involvement with the creation of Sephiroth, and it is he who would explain to Cloud the story of Sephiroth's origins. When the game was still in development, Nomura and his staff considering removing Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi altogether, as they did not have enough time to work them into the story properly. As a result, Vincent and Yuffie ultimately appeared as optional characters in the game.|$|E

Some of these people voluntarily sailed to the American Colonies specifically for this purpose.
