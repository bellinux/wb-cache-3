5|$|After winning Miss India World, Chopra {{was cast}} as the female lead in Abbas-Mustan's romantic thriller Humraaz (2002), {{in which she was}} to make her film debut. However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the {{production}} conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they re-cast because Chopra took on various <b>other</b> <b>commitments.</b> Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 Tamil film Thamizhan as the love interest of the protagonist, played by Vijay. A review published in The Hindu was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue, however it felt that Chopra's role was limited from an acting viewpoint.|$|E
40|$|The author {{argues that}} inequality, {{combined}} with only modest growth, can have grave moral consequences.

40|$|In PODC 2003, Micali {{presented}} a fair electronic exchange protocol for contract signing with an invisible trusted party [17]. The protocol was filed as a US patent No 5666420 in 1997 [16]. In the protocol, two mutually distrusted parties exchange their commitments {{to a contract}} in a fair way such that either each of them can obtain the <b>other's</b> <b>commitment,</b> or neither of them does. The protocol is optimistic {{in the sense that}} the trusted party need not be involved in the protocol unless a dispute occurs. In this paper, we show that Micali's protocol cannot achieve the claimed fairness. In resolving a dispute, the trusted party may face a dilemma situation that no matter what it does, one of the exchanging parties can succeed in cheating. In other words, there is always a party who can get the <b>other's</b> <b>commitment</b> without the <b>other</b> party obtaining his. We further propose a revised version of contract signing protocol that preserves fairness while remaining optimistic...|$|R

The number of full-time contracts was expanded to six in January 2010 with support for a further nine players; the contracts were split into three categories. In January 2012 the number of contracts was increased to 23, and coach Phil Simmons highlighted the process of becoming professional as an important factor in the team's success.|$|E

5|$|Around this time, and {{particularly}} after the fourth Test defeat, critics suggested that Walter Robins, {{one of the}} selectors, should captain England to bring a more attacking approach to the job. However, Robins' age counted against him; the selectors were satisfied with Yardley's captaincy in what were difficult circumstances, and retained him for the final Test. In that match, he failed twice with the bat, scoring 7 and 9 as England were humiliated, bowled out for 52 and 188 to lose by an innings. England lost the series 4–0. Yardley managed 150 runs {{at an average of}} 16.66, not passing fifty in a single innings. However, he once again topped the England bowling averages, taking nine wickets at an average of 22.66. Bowes believed that the pressure of captaincy had affected Yardley's batting. Bowes also cast doubt on Yardley's future, stating that <b>other</b> <b>commitments</b> may have prevented his continuing to play cricket much longer.|$|E

When Kalabhavan Mani was hesitant in accepting the film due to <b>other</b> <b>commitments</b> in Malayalam, shooting was re-scheduled to film his scenes first. Saran persuaded Mani to allot dates for twelve days to complete his scenes. Since Mani was a mimicry artist, Saran asked him to exhibit his talents; Mani aped the behaviour of a few animals and Saran chose among them, which were added to the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{final weeks}} were a frantic rush to finish, {{with the band}} and {{production}} crew all suffering from exhaustion.

His eleventh-hour presence and changes caused discontent among the production crew, including Eno and Lanois. Lillywhite mixed four songs with engineer Mark Wallis on an SSL desk at Windmill Lane Studios. At the same time, Lanois, McCarthy, and Meegan mixed seven songs at Melbeach on a 24-track AMEK 2500 mixing desk; all three were required to operate the console {{due to the lack}} of mix automation.|$|E

5|$|Various incarnations of a Doctor Strange film {{had been}} in {{development}} since the mid-1980s, until Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights in April 2005, on behalf of Marvel Studios. Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer were brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson and Spaihts were hired to direct and re-write the film, respectively. Cumberbatch was chosen for the eponymous role in December 2014, necessitating a schedule change to work around his <b>other</b> <b>commitments.</b> This gave Derrickson {{time to work on}} the script himself, for which he brought Cargill on to help.

In December 2012, Lindelof {{had decided not to}} work on a sequel, citing <b>other</b> <b>commitments.</b> In June 2013, Jack Paglen was in negotiations to write the sequel. In October 2013, Scott confirmed that the script was complete, but in March 2014, Michael Green was hired to rewrite Paglen's script. In August 2015, it was announced that production for the film would begin in January 2016 with Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace reprising their roles, and Scott directing. While at the Toronto International Film Festival to promote his film The Martian, Scott stated that production on the film will begin in February 2016. In September 2015, Scott said that the title of the sequel will be Alien: Paradise Lost, an allusion to John Milton's epic poem which may also suggest a deeper connection with the Alien franchise. In an interview with Empire, Scott said that the title change did not affect the film's story and the film will have a connection to the character of Ellen Ripley.|$|E
5|$|Pierce Brosnan {{had signed}} a deal for four films when he was cast {{in the role of}} James Bond. This was {{fulfilled}} with the production of Die Another Day in 2002. At this stage, Brosnan was approaching his 50th birthday. Brosnan kept in mind fans and critics were not happy with Roger Moore playing Bond until he was 58 and speculation began the producers were seeking to replace Brosnan with a younger actor. Brosnan officially announced he was stepping down in February 2004. At one point, producer Michael G. Wilson claimed there was a list of over 200 names being considered for his replacement. Croatian actor Goran Višnjić auditioned for the role the same day as Craig, but was reportedly unable to master a British accent. New Zealander Karl Urban was considered, but was unable to make the screen test due to filming commitments. According to Martin Campbell, Henry Cavill was the only other actor in serious contention for the role, but at 22 years old was considered too young. Australian actor Sam Worthington and Scottish actor Dougray Scott were also considered. Hugh Jackman was approached to play the character just before Craig was chosen to play Bond but turned it down due to <b>other</b> <b>commitments.</b>|$|E
