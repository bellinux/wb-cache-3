5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E

50|$|In {{the three}} decades {{prior to the}} passing of the Fair Sentencing Act, those who were arrested for {{possessing}} crack cocaine faced much more severe penalties than those in possession <b>of</b> powder <b>cocaine.</b> While a person found with five grams <b>of</b> crack <b>cocaine</b> faced a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence, a person holding powder cocaine could receive the same sentence only if he or she held five hundred grams. Similarly, those carrying ten grams <b>of</b> crack <b>cocaine</b> faced a ten-year mandatory sentence, while possession of one thousand grams <b>of</b> powder <b>cocaine</b> was required for the same sentence to be imposed.|$|R

5|$|A 1980 US {{indictment}} {{said that}} Francisco Rafael was {{under investigation by}} the DEA for alleged cocaine and heroin distribution in the San Diego area. The DEA had identified him as one of the cocaine suppliers and set up an undercover operation to arrest him and his associates by purchasing multi-ton shipments <b>of</b> <b>cocaine.</b> He admitted to have worked with drug distributor Ramón Torresillos-Rendón, and that he used him as a mediator for a drug transaction with an undercover federal agent. In court, Francisco Rafael admitted having sent Torresillos-Rendón and four other individuals to sell nine ounces <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> to the agent. He was arrested in California on 7 August 1980 and remained under custody until or around 8 September 1980 after paying a US$150,000 bond and promising to appear at every court session. Nonetheless, he fled to Mexico shortly afterwards and did not appear in court on 8 October 1980.|$|E

5|$|On 2 June 2003 U.S. {{authorities}} {{requested the}} Mexican government to extradite Francisco Rafael. A Mexican federal judge approved the request the following year, but the drug lord was extradited to the United States on 16 September 2006. He was flown from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, via helicopter {{and handed over}} to U.S. authorities in a prison in Brownsville, Texas, after a 10-year sentence in Mexico. He was then transferred {{to the state of}} California pending federal charges on drug trafficking. On 18 June 2007, he pleaded guilty to the possession and distribution <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> before U.S. District Judge Irma E. Gonzalez in a San Diego federal court. In his testimony, he admitted to selling about 250 grams <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> to a supplier who negotiated with an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in an unnamed motel in San Diego in 1980. In October 2007, Francisco Rafael was sentenced to six years in prison and with possibility to parole in four months given the time he had already served in prison.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We have {{performed}} {{a series of}} first-principles electronic structure calculations to examine the reaction pathways and the corresponding free energy barriers for the ester hydrolysis <b>of</b> protonated <b>cocaine</b> in its chair and boat conformations. The calculated free energy barriers for the benzoyl ester hydrolysis <b>of</b> protonated chair <b>cocaine</b> {{are close to the}} corresponding barriers calculated for the benzoyl ester hydrolysis <b>of</b> neutral <b>cocaine.</b> However, the free energy barrier calculated for the methyl ester hydrolysis <b>of</b> protonated <b>cocaine</b> in its chair conformation is significantly lower than for the methyl ester hydrolysis <b>of</b> neutral <b>cocaine</b> and for the dominant pathway of the benzoyl ester hydrolysis <b>of</b> protonated <b>cocaine.</b> The significant decrease of the free energy barrier, 4 kcal/mol, is attributed to the intramolecular acid catalysis of the methyl ester hydrolysis <b>of</b> protonated <b>cocaine,</b> because the transition state structure is stabilized by the strong hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of the methyl ester moiety and the protonated tropane N. The relative magnitudes of the free energy barriers calculated for different pathways of the ester hydrolysis <b>of</b> protonated chair <b>cocaine</b> are consistent with the experimental kinetic data for cocaine hydrolysis under physiologic conditions. Similar intramolecular acid catalysis also occurs for the benzoyl ester hydrolysis <b>of</b> (protonated) boat <b>cocaine</b> in the physiologic condition, although the contribution of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding to transition state stabilization is negligible. Nonetheless, the predictability of the intramo-lecular hydrogen bonding could be useful in generating antibody-based catalysts that recruit cocaine to the boat conformatio...|$|R
50|$|The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 {{established}} a 100:1 sentencing disparity for {{the possession of}} crack vs. powder <b>cocaine.</b> Whereas possession <b>of</b> 500 grams <b>of</b> powder <b>cocaine</b> triggered a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence, possession of 5 grams <b>of</b> crack <b>cocaine</b> triggered the same mandatory minimum penalty. In addition, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 {{established a}} 1-year mandatory minimum penalty for simple possession <b>of</b> crack <b>cocaine,</b> making crack cocaine the only controlled substance for which a first possession offense triggered a mandatory minimum penalty.|$|R
5000|$|The use <b>of</b> crack <b>cocaine</b> {{increased}} {{rapidly in}} the 1980s, accompanied {{by an increase in}} violence in urban areas. [...] In response, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 included a provision that created the disparity between federal penalties for crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses, imposing the same penalties for the possession of an amount <b>of</b> crack <b>cocaine</b> as for 100 times the same amount <b>of</b> powder <b>cocaine.</b> The law also contained minimum sentences and other disparities between the two forms of the drug.|$|R

Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> and Valium. Despite the fact that, if convicted, he could face a prison sentence of up to four years and eight months, he signed on to appear in at least eight more Ally McBeal episodes.|$|E

5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs {{in those who}} already have diabetes, {{but it may also}} be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic.

The Potomac Stakes was previously held at Freestate Raceway and generated one-million-dollar-plus handles on several occasions. On a September 1990 night, $1,195,681 was wagered by bettors, becoming the then-largest handle in Rosecroft's history. This record was broken on May 3, 2003 when $1,564,150 was wagered.

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, civil wars {{broke out in}} Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. U.S. arms {{shipments}} to the area increased dramatically as a result, as did drug smuggling to the U.S., particularly <b>of</b> <b>cocaine.</b> In the 1980s Noriega's involvement with drug smuggling grew as well. Dinges wrote that Noriega frequently received large payments, sometimes as high as $100,000 per shipment, {{in return for the}} smugglers receiving immunity from prosecution. A report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency stated that Noriega held firm control over drug-related activities and money laundering through a group of close associates within the military. On June 12, 1986, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an article in The New York Times describing Noriega's involvement in drug smuggling and money laundering. Hersh recorded a U.S. White House official as saying that reducing Noriega's activities could greatly reduce international drug trafficking.|$|E
