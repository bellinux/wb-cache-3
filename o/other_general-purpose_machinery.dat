40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to increase}} the academic debate on which indicators and approaches capture more appropriately the phenomenon of economic clustering (see, for instance, Arbia & Piras, 2007). A composite measure is proposed combining discrete and continuous space indicators {{in order to identify}} spatial localization more effectively as proposed by several authors such as Arbia (2001), Guillain and Le Gallo (2007), and Sohn (2004). The paper is devoted to unfolding the localization patterns of employment within three-digit manufacturing industries by Italian provinces in 2007 employing the location quotient, the locational Gini, the global Moran’s I, and the local indicator of spatial associations since they provide complementary information (see, for instance, Guillain & Le Gallo, 2007). Evidence shows that the manufacture of military fighting vehicles has the highest localization with almost full concentration; whereas the industry of <b>other</b> <b>general-purpose</b> <b>machinery</b> holds the highest global Moran’s I. Moreover, the five three-digit industries within the two-digit manufacture of machinery and equipment n. e. c. show a relatively high global autocorrelation and concentration. It emerged that these five three-digit medium-high technology intensity industries showed numerous hot-spots clusters in the North of Italy, whereas the South of Italy and Islands were characterized by low-low values associationsa mong Italian provinces in 2007...|$|E

40|$|Transaction delegation, as {{introduced}} in ACTA, allows a transaction to transfer {{responsibility for the}} operations that it has performed on an object to another transaction. Delegation {{can be used to}} broaden the visibility of the delegatee, and to tailor the recovery properties of a transaction model. Delegation {{has been shown to be}} useful in synthesizing Advanced Transaction Models. Withan efficient implementationof delegation it becomes practicable to realize various Advanced Transaction Models whose requirements are specified at a high level language instead of the current expensive practice of building them from scratch. In this paper we identify the issues in efficiently supporting delegation and hence advanced transaction models, and illustrate this with our solution in ARIES, an industrial-quality system that uses UNDO/REDO recovery. Since delegation is tantamount to rewriting history, a naïve implementationcan entail frequent, costly log accesses, and can result in complicated recovery protocols. Our algorithm achieves the effect of rewriting history without rewriting the log, resulting in an implementation that realizes the semantics of delegation at minimal additionaloverhead and incurs no overhead when delegation is not used. Our work indicates that it is feasible to build efficient and robust, <b>general-purpose</b> <b>machinery</b> for Advanced Transaction Models. It also leads toward making recovery a firstclass concept within Advanced Transaction Models. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{transaction}} delegation, as introduced in ACTA, {{has been shown}} to be useful in synthesizing Extended Transaction Models. Delegation allows a transaction to transfer responsibilityover an object, and its operations, to another transaction. Delegation can be used to broaden the visibilityofthe delegatee, and to tailor the recovery properties of a transaction model. The broadening of visibilityisuseful in allowing a delegator to selectively maketentative and partial results, as well as hints suchascoordination information, accessible to other transactions. The control of the recovery makes it possible to decouple the fate of an update from that of the transaction that made the updates# for instance, a transaction may delegate some operations that will remain uncommitted but valid after the delegator transaction aborted. In this paper, weshowhowtoimplementdelegation in the context of ARIES, arobust recovery algorithm for industrial-strength transaction management systems. The resulting version of ARIES is called ARIES/RH since delegation is tantamounttoRewriting History. The modifications to ARIES are non trivial but small enough to efficiently support delegation. Although a naiveimplementation of delegation would entail frequentand costly log accesses, our careful design has minimal cost during normal processing and involves only constant-time operations, and some stable storage access overhead, during recovery.

Scarce-resources Wireless Sensor Networks (SWSN) are {{composed}} {{by a large}} number of sensor nodes with minimum processing capacity, short distance wireless communication and the ability to sense the environment.

This approach is applied to several residual-evaluation (or change-detection) algorithms on classical test-cases. Simulation results show the interest, practicability and performance of this methodology, which should facilitate the automatic tuning of the hyperparameters of a method and allow a fair comparison of a collection of methods on a given set of test-cases.
