40|$|Cytochemical {{techniques}} employing lead-precipitation of enzymically released {{inorganic phosphate}} {{have been widely}} used in attempts to localize the plasma membrane proton pump (H+-ATPase) in electron micrographs. Using Avena sativa root tissue we have performed a side-by-side comparison of ATPase activity observed in electron micrographs with that observed in in vitro assays using ATPases found in the soluble and plasma membrane fractions of homogenates. Cytochemical analysis of <b>oat</b> <b>roots,</b> which had been fixed in glutaraldehyde in order to preserve subcellular structures, identifies an ATPase located at or near the plasma membrane. However, the substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity of the in situ localized ATPase appear identical to those of an in vitro ATPase activity found in the soluble fraction, and are completely unlike those of the plasma membrane proton pump. Further studies demonstrated that the plasma membrane H+-ATPase is particularly sensitive to inactivation by the fixatives glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde and by lead. In contrast, the predominant soluble ATPase activity in <b>oat</b> <b>root</b> homogenates is less sensitive to fixation and is completely insensitive to lead. Based on these results, we propose a set of criteria for evaluating whether a cytochemically localized ATPase activity is, in fact, due to the plasma membrane proton pump...|$|R
40|$|HEf is a {{water-soluble}} humic constitutent {{of molecular}} size compatible with uptake by plant roots. In naturally-occurring humic material, HEf is usually encased in macrostructured, high-molecular-weight, humic constituents (HSp) without biological activity. One prerequisite for any direct biological action by humic substances is therefore dissociation of the HEf-HSp structure. In order {{to investigate the}} above interaction, the effects of HEf and HSp on nitrate uptake and microsomal (Mg 2 +K+) ATPase activity in <b>oat</b> <b>roots</b> were studied. HEf stimulated nitrate uptake with a peak value at 1. 0 mg C l- 1, K+-stimulated ATPase activity of <b>oat</b> <b>root</b> microsomes, and H+ extrusion from roots, but it decreased ATP concentrations and did not influence O 2 consumption. In contrast, HSp inhibited NO 3 - transport at concentrations higher than 0. 5 mg C l- 1, and showed only negligible effects on the considered variables. These results suggest that HEf stimulates NO 3 - transport by activating K+-stimulated ATPase, whose activity lowered the ATP content of the cell. These effects are probably due both to the surfactant behaviour of humic substances (critical micelle concentration is 0. 25 mg C ml- 1 for HEf and 0. 36 mg C ml- 1 for HSp) and to their biological activity...|$|R

The chloroform soluble preparation was purified by Sephadex G- 200 and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The purified F 1 preparation contained major polypeptides corresponding to α, β, γ, δ, and ε of apparent molecular mass 58, 55, 35, 22, and 14 kilodaltons, respectively. The purified F 1 -ATPase, like the native enzyme, was inhibited by azide (I 50 = 10 micromolar), nitrate (I 50 = 7 - 10 millimolar), 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyano- 2, 2 ′-stilbene disulfonic acid (I 50 = 1 - 3 micromolar), and 7 -chloro- 4 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole (I 50 = 3 micromolar). F 1 -ATPase activity was stimulated by bicarbonate but not by chloride. In both the native and the F 1 -form of the ATPase, ATP was hydrolyzed in preference to GTP. The results indicate that these {{properties of}} the native membrane-bound mitochondrial ATPase have been conserved in the purified F 1. In contrast to the membrane-bound enzyme, the F 1 -ATPase was not inhibited by oligomycin or by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a low {{molecular}} weight (5 kDa, HMW) humic fractions on surface redox activities of <b>oat</b> <b>roots</b> was studied. Oxidation of the electron donor NADH and reduction of the artificial electron acceptor ferricyanide [K 3 Fe(CN) 6] exogenously supplied to the roots both alone of in combination, was measured in {{the presence or absence}} of soil humic substances. HMW humic fraction inhibited NADH oxidation either in {{the presence or absence of}} ferricyanide, while LMW humic fraction inhibited NADH:ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity due to the contemporary addition of the two redox compounds to the solution bathing the roots. NADH:ferricyanide oxido-reduction was partially due to the release of substances from the roots. However, the presence of soil humic fractions (LMW or HMW) did not significantly modify this behaviour. Rather, the inhibitory effect of soil humic substances was even more evident when the oxidoreduction solely due to the root activity was considered. The results confirm the presence of multiple types of oxidoreductase activities at the surface of <b>oat</b> <b>roots</b> and show that the two humic fractions HMW and LMW may differently affect these activities. Partial inhibition of NADH oxidase activity is interpreted as a possible way of interference of humic substances with metabolic processes involved in cell wall formation.

40|$|Phosphate is an {{essential}} nutrient. In most soils it is limiting, which has resulted in that phosphate is supplied as fertilizer to increase crop yield. Through evolution, plants have adapted several mechanisms to increase phosphate uptake from the soil and to household with acquired phosphate. A recent discovered house-holding mechanism is that plants utilize the phosphate bound in the headgroups of phospholipids: under phosphate-limiting conditions, phospholipids can {{be replaced by the}} non-phosphate containing lipid digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), previously assumed to reside in plastid membranes. The extra-plastidial phospholipid-to-DGDG replacement occurs in plasma membrane, tonoplast and mitochondria and has led to discoveries of new enzymes and metabolic pathways in plants. This thesis reports that phosphate limitation-induced biochemical and lipid compositional changes in <b>oat</b> <b>root</b> plasma membranes occur prior to any morphological changes in the oat. The phospholipase kinetics suggests that the plasma membrane is continuously supplied with phospholipids and that the products of plasma membrane lipase activities, phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol, both are removed from the membrane. Furthermore, the phospholipid-to-DGDG replacement is reversible and when phosphate is resupplied the proportion of phospholipids increases and DGDG decreases in the <b>oat</b> <b>root</b> plasma membrane. Membrane lipids are more than a two dimensional liquid where membrane proteins reside. The specific lipid composition and distribution enables the membrane to function as a barrier to solutes and the interactions between lipids and proteins are important for the correct function. The lateral and transversal lipid distribution in <b>oat</b> <b>root</b> plasma membranes shows that DGDG does not replace phospholipids molecule for molecule; whereas phospholipids occur in both leaflets of the plasma membrane, DGDG is almost exclusively localized in the cytosolic leaflet. Model membrane studies suggests {{that one of the reasons}} that DGDG is absent in the apoplastic leaflet is its incompatibility to properly interact with the high sterol content of this leaflet. The oat seed contains enough phosphate to complete an entire generation without any exogenously supplied phosphate. The overall seed yield is much lower in phosphate-limited oat compared to fully fertilized oat, but the seed quality (starch, [beta]-glucan, lipid, soluble protein) is very similar, including that the phospholipids-to-DGDG replacement is absent from the mature oat seeds, here membrane lipid composition is conserved. Oat thus produce a few seeds of acceptable quality rather than more seeds of poor quality...|$|R

Treatment of the oat antigen with periodate, or with recombinant N-glycanase, affects the F 8 IVE 9 binding to the antigen, suggesting that the specific epitope for this monoclonal antibody involves a carbohydrate determinant. Levels of p 62 present in cells of the <b>oat</b> <b>root</b> increase approximately twofold as the root tissue matures during the first 11 days postgermination.

40|$|The vacuolar H+-translocating ATPase (H+-ATPase), {{originally}} {{reported to}} consist of three major subunits, has been further purified from <b>oat</b> <b>roots</b> (Avena sativa var Lang) to determine the complete subunit composition. Triton-solubilized ATPase activity was purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S 400 and ion-exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose). ATP hydrolysis activity of purified preparations was inhibited by 100 nanomolar bafilomycin A 1, a specific vacuolar-type ATPase inhibitor. The purified oat H+-ATPase (relative molecular weight = 650, 000) was composed of polypeptides of 70, 60, 44, 42, 36, 32, 29, 16, 13, and 12 kilodaltons. To analyze {{the organization of the}} H+-ATPase subunits, native vacuolar membranes were treated with KI and MgATP to dissociate peripheral proteins. Release of 70, 60, 44, 42, 36, and 29 kilodalton polypeptides from the membrane was accompanied by a loss of ATP hydrolysis and ATP-dependent H+-pumping activities. Five of the peripheral subunits were released from the membrane as a large complex of 540 kilodaltons. Vesicles that had lost the peripheral sector of the ATPase could hold a pH gradient generated by the proton-translocating pyrophosphatase, suggesting that the integral sector of the ATPase did not form a H+-conducting pathway. Negative staining of native vesicles revealed knob-like structures of 10 to 12 nanometers in dense patches on the surface of vacuolar membranes. These structures were removed by MgATP and KI, which suggested that they were the peripheral sectors of the H+-ATPase. These results demonstrate that the vacuolar H+-ATPase from <b>oat</b> <b>roots</b> has 10 different subunits. The oat vacuolar ATPase is organized as a large peripheral sector and an integral sector with a subunit composition similar, although not identical to, other eukaryotic vacuolar ATPases.

The filtrates extraction is time consuming and a difficult process, and the possibility of using a synthetic product to simulate its action of inhibiting the cell electron transport chain would be useful. The Methomyl insecticide is an efficient product to simulate the effects of the fungus that causes spot blotch in corn. The objective {{of this study was to}} check its efficiency in <b>oat.</b> <b>Oat</b> <b>roots</b> and callus growth were evaluated in the insecticide presence. Growth values that were less inhibited by the insecticide were used to correlate with spot blotch resistance. The results indicate that Methomyl reduces the growth of <b>oat</b> <b>root</b> and calli and may be used to differentiate genotypes more and less resistant to Spot Blotch. Therefore, UFRGS 14, which was the most affected genotype in the presence of the fungus toxic filtrates, had also the most reduced root and calli growth in the presence of Methomyl...|$|R
40|$|Many plants {{synthesize}} antimicrobial secondary metabolites as part {{of their}} normal program of growth and development, often sequestering them in tissues where they may protect against microbial attack. These include glycosylated triterpenoids (saponins), natural products that are exploited by man for a variety of purposes including use as drugs [Hostettmann, K. & Marston, A. (1995) Saponins (Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, U. K.) ]. Very {{little is known about the}} genes required for the synthesis of this important family of secondary metabolites in plants. Here we show the novel oxidosqualene cyclase AsbAS 1 catalyzes the first committed step in the synthesis of antifungal triterpenoid saponins that accumulate in <b>oat</b> <b>roots.</b> We also demonstrate that two sodium azide-generated saponin-deficient mutants of oat, which define the Sad 1 genetic complementation group, are defective in the gene encoding this enzyme and provide molecular genetic evidence indicating a direct link between AsbAS 1, triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis, and disease resistance. Orthologs of AsbAS 1 are absent from modern cereals and may have been lost during selection, raising the possibility that this gene could be exploited to enhance disease resistance in crop plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{tonoplast}} H+-ATPase of Acer pseudoplatanus {{has been}} purified from isolated vacuoles. After solubilization, the purification procedure included size-exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography. The H+-ATPase consists {{of at least}} eight subunits, of 95, 66, 56, 54, 40, 38, 31, and 16 kD, that did not cross-react with polyclonal antibodies raised to the plasmalemma ATPase of Arabidopsis thaliana. The 66 -kD polypeptide cross-reacted with monoclonal antibodies raised to the 70 -kD subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase of <b>oat</b> <b>roots.</b> The functional molecular size of the tonoplast H+-ATPase, analyzed in situ by radiation inactivation, {{was found to be}} around 400 kD. The 66 -kD subunit of the tonoplast H+-ATPase was rapidly phosphorylated by [[gamma]- 32 P]ATP in vitro. The complete loss of radio-activity in the 66 -kD subunit after a short pulse-chase experiment with unlabeled ATP reflected a rapid turnover, which characterizes a phosphorylated intermediate. Phosphoenzyme formed from ATP is an acylphosphate-type compound as shown by its sensitivity to hydroxylamine and alkaline pH. These results lead us to suggest that the tonoplast H+-ATPase of A. pseudoplatanus is a vacuolar-type ATPase that could operate with a plasmalemma-type ATPase catalytic mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{responses}} of the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) proton-pumping inorganic pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) from oat (Avena sativa L.) roots to changes in Mg 2 + and pyrophosphate (PPi) concentrations have been characterized. The kinetics were complex, and reaction kinetic models {{were used to determine}} which of the various PPi complexes were responsible for the observed responses. The results indicate that the substrate for the <b>oat</b> <b>root</b> vacuolar H+-PPase is Mg 2 PPi and that this complex is also a non-competitive inhibitor. In addition, the enzyme is activated by free Mg 2 + and competitively inhibited by free PPi. This conclusion differs from that reached in previous studies, in which it was proposed that MgPPi is the substrate for plant vacuolar H+-PPases. However, models incorporating MgPPi as a substrate were unable to describe the kinetics of the oat H+-PPase. It is demonstrated that models incorporating Mg 2 PPi as the substrate can describe some of the published kinetics of the Kalanchoë daigremontiana vacuolar H+-PPase. Calculations of the likely concentrations of Mg 2 PPi in plant cytoplasm suggest that the substrate binding site of the oat vacuolar H+-PPase would be about 70 % saturated in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} that plant membrane-bound MgATPases may act as electrogenic proton pumps has been investigated. Using an oat (Avena sativa L. cv. Victory) root membrane preparation which is partially enriched in tightly sealed vesicles, {{we have shown}} that MgATP stimulates the uptake of the membrane-permeable anion [14 C]SCN− by the vesicles; this indicates that an electrical potential (interior positive) is generated across the membrane. Both Cl− ions and the proton ionophore trifluoromethoxy(carbonyl-cyanide) phenylhydrazone inhibit the MgATP-driven [14 C]SCN− uptake, presumably by collapsing the MgATP-generated membrane potential. The uptake of the pH gradient probe [14 C]imidazole into the vesicles is also greatly stimulated by MgATP, indicating {{the presence of a}} transmembrane proton gradient (interior acid). MgATP-driven [14 C]imidazole uptake is temperature sensitive, Cl−-stimulated, substrate specific for MgATP, sensitive to the MgATPase inhibitors vanadate and N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and completely eliminated by trifluoromethoxy(carboxyl-cyanide) phenylhydrazone. The mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor oligomycin has little effect on the MgATPase activity and on the MgATP-dependent [14 C]SCN− and [14 C]imidazole uptake. These data indicate that a class of <b>oat</b> <b>root</b> membrane-bound MgATPases, stimulated primarily by Cl ions, is capable of using the free energy of ATP-hydrolysis to generate an apparent electrochemical proton gradient in vitro...|$|R
40|$|The binding protein for the {{phytotoxin}} fusicoccin {{belongs to}} the class of highly conserved 14 - 3 - 3 proteins. A general principle for the mode of action of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins is that they serve as docking clamps {{in order to facilitate}} protein interactions. This implies that 14 - 3 - 3 proteins may behave according to the proteins they interact with. Plasma membrane (PM) 14 - 3 - 3 proteins from <b>oat</b> <b>roots</b> indeed exhibited different properties, for example with respect to detergent solubility. The most abundant 14 - 3 - 3 's with apparent molecular masses of 30 and 31 kDa, could be largely solubilized from the plasma membrane in high detergent buffer. However, part of these solubilized 14 - 3 - 3 's precipitated when the detergent concentration was reduced. Moreover, a minor 35 kDa 14 - 3 - 3 protein was soluble in high detergent buffer but also completely precipitated at low detergent buffer. We present evidence that this 35 kDa 14 - 3 - 3 protein is phosphorylated and that the lower mobility in SDS-PAGE is likely to be due to binding of C...|$|R
