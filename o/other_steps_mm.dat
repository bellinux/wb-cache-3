MM does not state that surrender or spirituality is needed to end or control the habit. MM literature makes a similar distinction to Alcoholics Anonymous literature that there are problem drinkers who can return to controlled drinking and alcoholics who can not.|$|R
40|$|Two {{backward}} facing <b>step</b> (2 <b>mm</b> and 3 <b>mm</b> <b>step</b> height) {{models are}} selected for surface heat transfer measurements. The platinum thin film gauges are deposited on the Macor inserts using both hand paint and vacuum sputtering technique. Using the Eckert reference temperature method the heating rates has been theoretically calculated along the flat plate {{portion of the}} model and the theoretical estimates are compared with experimentally determined surface heat transfer rate. Theoretical analysis of heat flux distribution down stream of the backward facing step model {{has been carried out}} using Gai’s non-dimensional analysis. Based on the measured surface heating rates on the backward facing step, the reattachment distance is estimated for 2 and 3 <b>mm</b> <b>step</b> height at nominal Mach number of 7. 6. It has been found from the present study that for 2 and 3 <b>mm</b> <b>step</b> height, it approximately takes about 10 and 8 step heights downstream of the model respectively for the flow to re-attach...|$|R
