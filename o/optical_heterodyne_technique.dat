50|$|Detection in the {{microwave}} region has numerous advantages over optical detection. Using homodyne or heterodyne technology, the electric field rather than the power can be detected, so much better noise rejection can be achieved. In contrast to <b>optical</b> <b>heterodyne</b> <b>techniques,</b> no alignment or mode matching of the reference is necessary. The long wavelength of {{the microwave}}s leads to effective point coherent scattering from the plasma in the laser focal volume, so phase matching is unimportant and scattering in the backward direction is strong. Many microwave photons can be scattered from a single electron, so the amplitude of the scattering can be increased by increasing {{the power of the}} microwave transmitter. The low energy of the microwave photons corresponds to thousands of more photons per unit energy than in the visible region, so shot noise is drastically reduced. For weak ionization characteristic of trace species diagnostics, the measured electric field is a linear function of the number of electrons which is directly proportional to the trace species concentration. Furthermore, there is very little solar or other natural background radiation {{in the microwave}} spectral region.|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a <b>technique</b> based on <b>optical</b> <b>heterodyne</b> detection to measure Rydberg population in thermal atomic vapour. The technique used a probe beam far off resonant to the D 2 line of rubidium {{along with a}} reference beam with frequency offset by 800 MHz {{in the presence of}} a coupling laser that couples to Rydberg state via two-photon resonance. The polarizations of the probe, reference and coupling beams are suitably chosen such that only the probe beam goes through a non-linear phase shift due to two-photon process which is measured relative to the phase shift of the reference beam using <b>optical</b> <b>heterodyne</b> detection <b>technique.</b> We show that the technique has a sensitivity to measure the minimum phase shift of the order of few μrad. We have used a suitable model of two-photon excitation of a 3 -level atom to show that the minimum phase shift measured in our experiment corresponds to Rydberg population of the order of 10 ^- 5. The corresponding probe absorption for the given laser parameters is of the order of 10 ^- 7. Direct measurement of such a small probe absorption can't be reliable since it will be obscured due to the effect of small polarization impurities in the probe and the coupling beams. We demonstrate that this technique is insensitive to such polarization impurity or fluctuations in the beams and hence, provides a reliable measurement of the Rydberg population. The technique is particularly useful in measuring Rydberg excitation in thermal vapour where multi channel plates (MCP) can't be used due to presence of surface charges. It can also be used in ultra-cold atomic sample with suitable laser parameters. Comment: 6 pages and 5 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1605. 0660...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{theoretically}} and experimentally the effect of fluctuations in the instantaneous frequency of a pulsed laser on the shape and position of two-photon transition spectra. The usual procedure of characterizing a pulsed laser by its frequency energy spectrum is insufficient for precision measurements. The nonlinear nature of the two-photon transition produces a systematic shift of the atomic spectrum {{with respect to the}} laser frequency spectrum that is dependent on the phase evolution of the laser pulse. In fact, any nonlinear process (e. g., second-harmonic generation) may result in displaced or distorted spectra. We also find that Fabry-Pérot filtering a laser pulse can result in large frequency chirps. We use an <b>optical</b> <b>heterodyne</b> <b>technique</b> to measure the instantaneous frequency of our excimer-pumped dye-laser system to an uncertainty of 1. 3 MHz and determine the effect of the inherent frequency chirps of this system on a two-photon transition.

In a typical Michelson interferometer set up, the crystal is illuminated by a Zeeman laser with frequency omega(sub 1) and the reference beam with frequency omega(sub 2).

This technique is demonstrated with two examples: (1) by measuring the copper tip expansion/shrinkage rate and (2) by measuring the crystal growth rate of L-Arginine Phosphate (LAP). The first test shows that the expansion/shrinkage rate of copper tip was fast in the beginning, and gets slower as the expansion begins to stabilize with time. In crystal growth, the phase change due the crystal growth is measured using a phase meter and a strip chart recorder.

The coherence properties of the modulated beams from lightwave sources with different spectral widths and the modes of Fabry-Wrot (FP) laser are investigated.

The measured linewidth of the beat signal is narrow and almost identical no matter how wide the spectral width of the beam is. The frequency spacing of the adjacent FP modes is beyond the operation frequency range of the measurement instruments. In our experiment, <b>optical</b> <b>heterodyne</b> <b>technique</b> is used to investigate the frequency coherence of the modes of FP laser {{by means of the}} frequency shift induced by the optical intensity modulation.
