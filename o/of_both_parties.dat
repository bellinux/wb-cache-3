5|$|The Nixon {{administration}} tacitly supported Keating's legal efforts, and Counsellor to the President John Ehrlichman assigned White House speechwriter Pat Buchanan to help {{draft the}} dissenting report. The commission's majority report was denounced by congressional leaders <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> {{as well as}} by the administration.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{supporters}} immediately {{claimed that}} the election had been dishonest. The Democrats, the Brindle Tails, and all non-Republican newspapers openly and vocally denounced the election as fraudulent, and insisted that Brooks had in fact received the most votes. The general citizenry <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties,</b> however, accepted the results. The Brooks supporters were in the minority in believing that the election had been fraudulent.|$|E
50|$|German-speaking territories {{annexed to}} Germany from 1938 were {{generally}} organised into Reichsgaue. Unlike the pre-existing Gaue, the new Reichsgaue formally combined the spheres <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>party</b> and state administration.|$|R

5|$|Lim {{once again}} ran for mayor and {{defeated}} Atienza's son Ali in the 2007 city election and immediately reversed all of Atienza's projects claiming Atienza's projects made little {{contribution to the}} improvements of the city. The relationship <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> turned bitter, with the two pitting again during the 2010 city elections in which Lim won against Atienza.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October 2009, UN Human Rights Council {{voted in}} support of the Goldstone Report where twenty-five member nations voted in favour of the {{resolution}} endorsing the report, six voted against endorsement while another eleven remained impartial. Goldstone has criticised the United Nations Human Rights Council's selective endorsement of the report his commission compiled, since the resolution adopted chastises Israel only, when the report itself is critical <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 2008, Kennedy {{suffered}} a seizure, {{and then another}} one as he was rushed from the Kennedy Compound to Cape Cod Hospital and then by helicopter to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Within days, doctors announced that Kennedy had a malignant glioma, a type of cancerous brain tumor. The grim diagnosis brought reactions of shock and prayer from many senators <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> and from President Bush.|$|E

50|$|After the Anschluss a {{new type}} of {{administrative}} unit was introduced called a Reichsgau. In these territories the Gauleiters also held the position of Reichsstatthalter, thereby formally combining the spheres <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>party</b> and state offices. The establishment of this type of district was subsequently carried out for any further territorial annexations <b>of</b> Germany <b>both</b> before and during World War II.|$|R
5|$|On May 18, 2017, {{the leaders}} of the Wildrose and Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta {{announced}} a merger, which was ratified with 95% support of the membership <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> in July 2017. The combined United Conservative Party will hold a leadership election on October 28, 2017.|$|E
5|$|After the {{violence}} of November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association and other business leaders petitioned Governor Ralston to call out the Indiana National Guard. Members <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> accused the union leaders of trying to prevent their voters from reaching the polls. The riots made national news and public leaders began to consider them an embarrassment to the state. Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E
5|$|Four years earlier, in the {{election}} of 1876, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of the}} most hotly contested presidential elections in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were disputed until just a few days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes.|$|E
5000|$|The TRT's {{landslide}} victory {{cast doubt}} {{over the future}} <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>party</b> leaders, and Banyat resigned as Democrat Party leader immediately after the election.

5000|$|As of November 2013, the ACD {{no longer}} {{functions}} as the constituent parties consensually decided to de facto break their respective union citing technical irregularities in the territorial organizations and opposing stands <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>party</b> leaders regarding current governmental and political affairs. However, PNL and PC remain {{part of the}} larger USL alliance, together with the ACS member parties, PSD and UNPR.|$|R
5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president. Instead of giving federal jobs to political supporters, Hayes wished to award them by merit according to an examination that all applicants would take. Immediately, Hayes's call for reform brought him into conflict with the Stalwart, or pro-spoils, branch of the Republican party. Senators <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> were accustomed to being consulted about political appointments and turned against Hayes. Foremost among his enemies was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, who fought Hayes's reform efforts at every turn.|$|E
5|$|In 1814 {{under the}} new and ambitious Governor-General Francis Edward Rawdon-Hastings, the Earl of Moira, the long-standing {{diplomatic}} disputes between British India and the Kingdom of Nepal, caused by expansionist policies <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties,</b> descended into open hostility. The British East India Company sought to invade Nepal not just to secure the border and to force the Nepali government to open trading routes to Tibet, but also for what Hastings saw as a geo-political necessity to secure the foothold of the Company in the Indian sub-continent.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015 {{the team}} {{confirmed}} that Riis {{had been removed}} from active duty due to differences between Riis and Tinkov. Media reports had initially indicated that Riis had been suspended when he did not appear at the 2015 Milanâ€“San Remo as planned, and that this was due to a disappointing start to the season for the team. Later that month it was announced that Riis' contract had been terminated with the agreement <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties.</b> Subsequently the team revealed its new management structure, with Riis' former duties being carried out by new general manager Stefano Feltrin and Steven de Jongh, who was promoted to the role of head sport director.|$|E

5|$|Lame duck {{incumbent}} president Bill Clinton was a Democrat, {{and the field}} for nomination for President <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> was wide open. Bush was governor of Texas in June 1999 when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States. He entered a large field of hopefuls for the Republican Party presidential nomination that included John McCain, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, Lamar Alexander, John Kasich, and Bob Smith.|$|E
5|$|Members <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> were {{concerned}} {{with the growth of}} the power of trusts and monopolies, {{and one of the first}} acts of the 51st Congress was to pass the Sherman Antitrust Act, sponsored by Senator John Sherman of Ohio. The Act passed by wide margins in both houses, and Harrison signed it into law. The Sherman Act was the first Federal act of its kind, and marked a new use of federal government power. While Harrison approved of the law and its intent, his administration was not particularly vigorous in enforcing it. However, the government successfully concluded a case during Harrison's time in office (against a Tennessee coal company), and had initiated several other cases against trusts.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September, {{however, the}} Indonesians {{proposed}} a way out: an alternative route through the Lombok Strait. The British took {{them up on}} this offer, to the relief <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties,</b> and the Victorious made a peaceful return through Indonesian territory. War was averted, and the climax of tensions during the Confrontation had been passed. Never again was the threat of all-out war a realistic possibility, despite some large land battles in northern Borneo the following spring, and the Confrontation wound down by late fall of 1965. It had never escalated into a major conflict, and a peace deal was signed the following year.|$|E

5|$|The Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested was {{instructed}} by Frederick III {{to negotiate with}} the Swedes, and the resulting peace treaty can largely be credited to him. Without any direct involvement by foreign powers, the Danes and Swedes managed to negotiate the Treaty of Copenhagen within weeks, much to the surprise <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties.</b> A bone of contention was the islands of Hven and Bornholm, the latter having received the Danish king's personal promise of protection. In the end, Bornholm remained under Danish control in exchange for a number of estates in the south of present-day Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Canada {{should call}} on the United Nations Security Council to seriously engage itself in the {{resolution}} of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and to investigate the conduct <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> during the conflict with respect to international law. The Government of Canada should also initiate a dialogue with the Government of Sri Lanka, in conjunction with the international community, aimed at laying the groundwork for a political reconciliation between the communities. If these efforts fail, the Government of Canada should consider financial and diplomatic sanctions, including, but not limited to, advocating for Sri Lankaâ€™s suspension from the Commonwealth, as well as incentives.|$|E
5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties,</b> this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} that the confirmation and disavowal exchanges are not transferable. They achieve this by having the property <b>of</b> zero-knowledge; <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> can create transcripts <b>of</b> <b>both</b> confirmation and disavowal that are indistinguishable, to a third-party, of correct exchanges.|$|R
