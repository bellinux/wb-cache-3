40|$|In {{a typical}} {{experiment}} on decision making, {{one out of}} two possible stimuli is displayed and observers decide which one was presented. Recently, Stanford and colleagues (2010) introduced a new variant of this classical one-stimulus presentation paradigm to investigate the speed of decision making. They found evidence for "perceptual decision making in less than 30 ms". Here, we extended this one-stimulus compelled-response paradigm to a two-stimulus compelled-response paradigm in which a vernier was followed immediately by a second vernier with opposite <b>offset</b> <b>direction.</b> The two verniers and their offsets fuse. Only one vernier is perceived. When observers are asked to indicate the <b>offset</b> <b>direction</b> of the fused vernier, the offset of the second vernier dominates perception. Even for long vernier durations, the second vernier dominates decisions indicating that decision making can take substantial time. In accordance with previous studies, we suggest that our results are best explained with a two-stage model of decision making where a leaky evidence integration stage precedes a race-to-threshold process...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHow {{features}} {{of an object}} are bound into a unique percept {{is one of the}} puzzling problems in the cognitive and neuro-sciences. In order to investigate the spatio-temporal mechanisms of feature binding, we serially present two verniers with opposite <b>offset</b> <b>directions</b> for very short durations. Only one vernier is perceived with its offset dominated by the vernier presented second. This dominance reverses if the two verniers are followed by masking gratings, i. e. the first presented vernier dominates performance. Therefore, feature fusion can neither be explained completely by spatially local mechanisms nor by the temporal order of appearance of elements...|$|R

From stepping directions of EERTS and the <b>offset</b> <b>directions</b> of the lineaments in which they occur, we infer that some EERTS form as a result of compressional stress and others form as a result of tensional stress.

40|$|Human {{perception}} of a stimulus varies {{depending on the context}} in which the stimulus is presented. Such contextual modulation has often been explained by two basic neural mechanisms: lateral inhibition and spatial pooling. In the present study, we presented observers with a vernier stimulus flanked by single lines; observers' ability to discriminate the <b>offset</b> <b>direction</b> of the vernier stimulus deteriorated in accordance with both explanations. However, when the flanking lines were part of a geometric shape (i. e., a good Gestalt), this deterioration strongly diminished. These findings cannot be explained by lateral inhibition or spatial pooling. It seems that Gestalt factors play an important role in contextual modulation. We propose that contextual modulation can be used as a quantitative measure to investigate the rules governing the grouping of elements into meaningful wholes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new transform of offset-domain Common Image Gathers (CIGs) obtained by wavefield-continuation migration methods. This transformation {{can be applied to}} either horizontal-offset CIGs or vertical-offset CIGs.

The result of our transformation is an image cube that is equivalent to the image cube that would have been computed if the <b>offset</b> <b>direction</b> were aligned along the apparent geological dip of each event. The proposed transformation applies a non-uniform dip-dependent stretching of the offset axis and can be efficiently performed in the Fourier domain. Because it is dependent on the image’s apparent dip, the offset stretching automatically corrects for the image-point dispersal. Tests on a synthetic data set confirm the potential advantages of the transformation for migration velocity analysis of data containing steeply dipping reflectors...|$|E

These effects, compounded with the asymmetric raypath of PS converted waves, will further increase the difficulties and costs in processing PS converted-wave data. One common method {{to solve this problem}} is to separate a data set into two volumes with different shooting directions (e. g., negative or positive <b>offset</b> <b>directions).</b> Different values of the PS converted-wave velocities are used to process the two data sets separately and the two results are combined in the final stage. The problem with this method is that sometimes it is difficult to correlate the data sets and the final combined result may be degraded. In this paper, we propose a method to overcome this problem and apply this method to a 2 D data set for improving the PS converted-wave imaging. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a digital wavelet-like transform, which is tailored specifically for representing seismic data. The transform provides a multiscale orthogonal basis with basis functions aligned along seismic {{events in the}} input data. It is defined {{with the help of}} the wavelet lifting scheme combined with local planewave destruction. In the 1 -D case, the seislet transform is designed to follow locally sinusoidal components. In the 2 -D case, it is designed to follow local plane wave components with smoothly variable slopes. If more than one component is present, the transform turns into an overcomplete representation or a tight frame. In these terms, the classic digital wavelet transform is simply a seislet transform for a zero frequency (in 1 -D) or zero slope (in 2 -D). The main objective of the new transform is an effective seismic data compression for designing efficient data analysis algorithms. Traditional signal processing tasks such as noise attenuation and trace interpolation become simply defined in the seislet domain. When applied in the <b>offset</b> <b>direction</b> on common midpoint or common image point gathers, the seislet transform finds an additional application in optimal stacking of seismic records...|$|E

40|$|Responses to {{a target}} can be sped up or slowed {{down by a}} {{congruent}} or incongruent prime, respectively. Even though presentations are rapid, the prime and the target are thought to activate motor responses in strict sequence, with prime activation preceding target activation. In feature fusion, the opposite {{seems to be the}} case. For example, a vernier offset to the left is immediately followed by a vernier offset to the right at the same location. The two verniers are not perceived as two elements in sequence but as a single, aligned vernier. Here, we ask the question as to how features are integrated: before or after motor activation? We presented two vernier primes with opposite <b>offset</b> <b>directions</b> preceding a single vernier target. No priming effect occurred when the vernier primes were presented at the same location, indicating that verniers integrate before motor activation. There was also no priming effect when the primes were presented simultaneously at different locations, indicating that there is an integration stage different from the perceptual fusion stage. When the second prime is delayed, it determines priming, even for very long delays. To explain these long integration times, we argue that there is a buffer preceding motor activation...|$|R

We presented a Vernier (i. e., two vertical bars slightly offset {{to the left or}} right) and asked observers to indicate the <b>offset</b> <b>direction.</b> Vernier stimuli are visually similar to letters and are strongly affected by crowding, even in the fovea. To increase task difficulty, Verniers are often followed by a mask (i. e., backward masking). We measured Vernier offset discrimination thresholds for the basic Vernier task, under crowding, and under backward masking, in students with dyslexia (n 19) and age and intelligence matched students (n 27). We found no group differences in any of these conditions. Controls with fast visual processing (good backward masking performance), were faster readers. By contrast, no such correlation was found among the students with dyslexia, suggesting that backward masking does not limit their reading efficiency. These findings indicate that neither elevated crowding nor elevated backward masking pose a bottleneck to reading skills of people with dyslexia...|$|E

40|$|We {{interpret}} the recent {{discovery of a}} preferable VLBI/Gaia <b>offset</b> <b>direction</b> for radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) along the parsec-scale radio jets {{as a manifestation of}} their optical structure on scales of 1 to 100 milliarcseconds. The extended jet structure affects the Gaia position stronger than the VLBI position due to the difference in observing techniques. Gaia detects total power while VLBI measures the correlated quantity, visibility, and therefore, sensitive to compact structures. The synergy of VLBI that is sensitive to the position of the most compact source component, usually associated with the opaque radio core, and Gaia that is sensitive to the centroid of optical emission, opens a window of opportunity to study optical jets at milliarcsecond resolution, two orders of magnitude finer than the resolution of most existing optical instruments. We demonstrate that strong variability of optical jets is able to cause a jitter comparable to the VLBI/Gaia offsets at a quiet state, i. e. several milliarcseconds. We show that the VLBI/Gaia position jitter correlation with the AGN optical light curve may help to locate the region where the flare occurred, estimate its distance from the super-massive black hole and the ratio of the flux density in the flaring region to the total flux density.

40|$|In media {{technology}} {{video and audio}} coding are often applied together. The quality of experience (QoE) in such audio-visual systems is influenced by several factors. Besides the dominant factors pure audio and video quality, the temporal coherence of the auditory and visual events plays a role.

More sophisticated {{media technology}} systems enable the reproduction of 3 D audio and video. In such systems the spatial audiovisual coherence is of significant interest. While spatial coherence is well understood when audio and video are on fixed positions, hardly no studies exist for moving objects.

First, thirty-three older (M = 65. 3 years) and ten younger adults (M = 24. 3 years) had to indicate the <b>offset</b> <b>direction</b> of a vernier that was masked by a 5 - or 25 -element grating.

Interestingly, stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) between target and mask were significantly longer in older adults with individually determined vernier durations above 30 msec, compared to older adults with vernier durations similar to younger adults. Second, we used two different masks with either a spatial or a temporal inhomogeneity. Older adults with vernier durations that were similar to young controls were sensitive to temporal and spatial inhomogeneities in the mask indicating fast and spatially intact processing. However, older adults whose individually determined vernier durations were significantly longer than those of younger adults were not as sensitive to temporal and spatial inhomogeneities in the mask, indicating that small spatiotemporal details are filtered out, which is highly likely due to low-pass filtered vision...|$|E
40|$|Background: Schizophrenic {{patients}} show strong deficits over a {{broad range}} including "higher" cognitive and executive functions and "lower", basic sensory information processing. The latter deficits might cause deficits on higher, cognitive levels. Using a new backward masking paradigm, shine-through, we could show that target processing is strongly impaired in adult schizophrenic patients whereas basic visual functions, such as figure-ground-segmentation and feature binding, are spared. Methods: To evaluate whether the shine-through paradigm is also suitable to show visual information processing deficits in adolescents with psychotic disorders. We presented a vernier target {{that was followed by}} a grating mask. A vertical vernier consists of two bars that are slightly offset in the horizontal direction randomly either to the left or to the right. Observers have to indicate this <b>offset</b> <b>direction.</b> We determined the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the vernier and the grating onset for 42 adolescents (mean age= 15. 7) : 12 with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 9 adolescents at high risk of psychosis, and a control group of 16 healthy adolescents and 5 with non psychotic disorders. Results: Our preliminary data show that adolescents with psychotic disorders need SOAs of 111 ms to reach a comparable performance level whereas adolescents at high risk for psychosis need SOAs of only 57 ms, and controls of 21 ms. Conclusions: Our results suggest that backward masking is a promising tool to detect vulnerability to schizophrenia spectrum disorders with early deficits possibly affecting later cognitive or executive functions...|$|E

40|$|The Common-Reflection-Surface (CRS) stack {{method is}} a {{powerful}} tool to produce high-quality stacked images of multicoverage seismic data. As {{a result of the}} CRS stack, not only a stacked section, but also a number of attributes defined at each point of that section, are produced. In this way, one can think of the CRS stack method as a transformation from data space to attribute space. Being a purely kinematic method, the CRS stack lacks amplitude information that can be useful for many purposes. Here we propose to fill this gap by means of a combined use of a zero-offset section (that could be a short-offset or amplitude-corrected stacked section) and common midpoint gather. We present an algorithm for an inverse CRS transformation, namely one that (approximately) transforms the CRS attributes back to data space.

40|$|Abstract Background Collision {{geocoding}} is {{the process}} of assigning geographic descriptors, usually latitude and longitude coordinates, to a traffic collision record. On California police reports, relative collision location is recorded using a highway postmile marker or a street intersection. The objective {{of this study was to}} create a geocoded database of all police-reported, fatal and severe injury collisions in the California Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS) for years 1997 - 2006 for use by public agencies. Results Geocoding was completed with a multi-step process. First, pre-processing was performed using a scripting language to clean and standardize street name information. A state highway network with postmile values was then created using a custom tool written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in ArcGIS software. Custom VBA functionality was also used to incorporate the <b>offset</b> <b>direction</b> and distance. Intersection and address geocoding was performed using ArcGIS, StreetMap Pro 2003 digital street network, and Google Earth Pro. A total of 142, 007 fatal and severe injury collisions were identified in SWITRS. The geocoding match rate was 99. 8 % for postmile-coded collisions and 86 % for intersection-coded collisions. The overall match rate was 91 %. Conclusions The availability of geocoded collision data will be beneficial to clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in the fields of traffic safety and public health. Potential uses of the data include studies of collision clustering on the highway system, examinations of the associations between collision occurrence and a variety of variables on environmental and social characteristics, including housing and personal demographics, alcohol outlets, schools, and parks. The ability to build maps may be useful in research planning and conduct and in the delivery of information to both technical and non-technical audiences. </p...|$|E
40|$|When two similar visual stimuli are {{presented}} in rapid succession, only their fused image is perceived, without having conscious access to the single stimuli. Such feature fusion occurs both for color (eg, Efron 1973) and form (eg, Scharnowski et al 2007). For verniers, the fusion process lasts for more than 400 ms, {{as has been shown}} using TMS (Scharnowski et al 2009). In three experiments, we used light masks to investigate the time course of feature fusion for color, form, and motion. In experiment one, two verniers were presented in rapid succession with opposite offset directions. Subjects had to indicate the <b>offset</b> <b>direction</b> of the vernier. In a second experiment, a red and a green disk were presented in rapid succession, and subjects had to indicate whether the fused, yellow disk appeared rather than red or green. In a third experiment, three frames of random dots were presented successively. The first two frames created a percept of apparent motion to the upper right; and the last two frames, one to the upper left or vice versa. Subjects had to indicate the direction of motion. All stimuli were presented foveally. In all three experiments, we first balanced performance so that neither the first nor the second stimulus dominated the fused percept. In a second step, a light mask was presented either before, during, or after stimulus presentation. Depending on presentation time, the light masks modulated the fusion process so that either the first or the second stimulus dominated the percept. Our results show that unconscious feature fusion lasts more than five times longer than the actual stimulus duration, which indicates that individual features are stored for a substantial amount of time before they are integrated...|$|E

After correcting for systematics, we found fourteen systems with significant detections {{in each of the}} phase curve components: planet's phase function, secondary eclipse, Doppler boosting and ellipsoidal variations. We model the full phase curve simultaneously, including primary and secondary transits, and derive albedos, day- and night-side temperatures and planet masses. Most planets manifest low optical geometric albedos (< 0. 25), with the exception of Kepler- 10 b, Kepler- 91 b and KOI- 13 b. We find that KOI- 13 b, with a small eccentricity of 0. 0006 + 0. 0001, is the only planet for which an eccentric orbit is favored. We detect a third harmonic with an amplitude of 1. 9 + 0. 2 ppm for HAT-P- 7 b for the first time, and confirm the third harmonic for KOI- 13 b reported in Esteves et al. : both could be due to their spin-orbit misalignments. For six planets, we report a planetary brightness peak offset from the substellar point: of those, the hottest two (Kepler- 76 b and HAT-P- 7 b) exhibit pre-eclipse shifts or to the evening-side, while the cooler four (Kepler- 7 b, Kepler- 8 b, Kepler- 12 b and Kepler- 41 b) peak post-eclipse or on the morning-side. Our findings dramatically increase the number of Kepler planets with detected planetary light offsets, and provide the first evidence in the Kepler data for a correlation between the peak <b>offset</b> <b>direction</b> and the planet's temperature. Such a correlation could arise if thermal emission dominates light from hotter planets that harbor hot spots shifted toward the evening-side, as theoretically predicted, while reflected light dominates cooler planets with clouds on the planet's morning-side.

30|$|As {{a result}} of a time offset, a moving object edge will be {{spatially}} offset. Since the spatial offsets vary across tiles due to the synchronization mismatches, the edges of moving objects will suffer spatial offsets across the tiles. This is analogous to vernier acuity psychophysical experiments, where a line is presented with a break due to an orthogonal spatial offset. The distortions in our application are more general, where the <b>offset</b> break <b>direction</b> depends on the motion direction relative to the edge orientation. Further, in our application, the offset disappears with a nonmoving image, since the tiles are then essentially synchronized.

A {{detailed description of}} the observations and the data reduction as well as a preliminary analysis of the K-band data can be found in Tamura et al. (2006). Hereafter, we focus on our data analyses to find observational evidence of multiple planetesimal rings in our data set. Signals of planetesimal rings would appear as brightness peaks in both northeast and southwest directions as well as both H- and K-bands. We compare the excess emission in both bands after subtracting their continuum levels (see Section 3). A weak correlation with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.3 is indeed found between the clumps in H- and K-bands. We assess the statistical significance of brightness peaks by testing the null hypothesis that the observed brightness distribution is merely random noise superimposed on a smooth curve of radiation scattered by circumstellar dust. Therefore, the random noise is smoothed out by averaging over both wavelengths and <b>offset</b> <b>directions,</b> resulting in a smooth declining curve of the average surface intensity. On the one hand, we admit that fake features might appear in the average brightness, if the random noise was not completely smoothed out by the averaging procedure. On the other hand, even real enhancements in the K-band brightness might be diluted with the H-band brightness, because the latter had a lower signal-to-noise ratio than the former. In such an analysis, only strong peaks, which we attribute to nearly circular, coplanar rings, will remain in the residuals after subtraction of a smooth brightness component. Therefore, we derive the residuals from the mean of the surface intensities to trace possible resonant structures of multiple planetesimal rings associated with Planet N.|$|R
