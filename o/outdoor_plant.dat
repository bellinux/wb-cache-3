50|$|P. capensis is a {{very easy}} plant to grow and take care of. The plant grows well in most fertile soils but may require some winter {{protection}} in colder areas. Because the plant {{can take care of}} itself, it is an easy plant for beginner gardeners to grow. It requires full sunlight and thus is generally only an <b>outdoor</b> <b>plant.</b> The plant is extremely versatile because it can survive in almost any kind of soil; normal, sandy or clay with a pH level of neutral, alkaline, or acid, however it prefers a rich, well-draining soil with regular watering. Cape fuchsias are easily grown from seeds collected the previous year. The plants form a woody base and should be pruned back to 6 inches or so each spring. Once established and actively growing, they should be fed monthly with a good all-purpose fertilizer. Other than this, {{for the most part the}} plant will take care of itself. In warm climates, P. capensis grows as a perennial plant, however in colder regions, it is grown as an annual.|$|E
50|$|The flora of Gillies Hill is {{intricately}} {{entwined with}} its history. The Murray family who built Polmaise Castle in 1865, created landscaped gardens incorporating {{many of the}} exotic coniferous trees that still grace the woodland. Like much of 19th Century British aristocracy, the Murrays were enamored with planting landscape gardens filled with newly discovered plants from around the world. Often these <b>outdoor</b> <b>plant</b> collections included tall conifers imported from North America. A fine {{example of this is}} the grove of Sierra Redwoods (or Wellingtonia), Sequoiadendron giganteum, growing at the apex of Gillies Hill. These five Redwoods were planted in the 1860s by the Murray family along the walk from the castle to the large natural loch that was once on the upper portion of Gillies Hill, but was lost to quarrying. If left undisturbed, these giants could well live over 3000 years and attain a mass of over 1400 cubic meters potentially becoming the most massive trees in Scotland. Along with others of that era, these trees may have been grown from some of the first Sequoiadendron seeds brought to Scotland by John D. Matthew in 1853 and given to his noted horticulturist father Patrick Matthew of Gourdiehill near Errol in Perth Shire who then gave many of the seedlings away to friends and family as living gifts.|$|E

40|$|Winter {{cold and}} high {{irradiance}} represent natural constraints in Mediterranean-type ecosystems that may limit plant growth and productivity, resulting often in photoinhibition of photosynthetic apparatus. However, evergreen species of Mediterranean maquis {{are able to}} adapt successfully to low temperatures adopting both physiological strategies and anatomical modifications. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate in Cistus incanus L. subsp. incanus, a shrub widely diffused in Mediterranean maquis of Southern Italy, the role of photochemical and non-photochemical strategies in reducing the excess of light energy to reaction centres, as well as the leaf structural modifications related to cold acclimation. To this purpose, chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements were conducted on fully expanded leaves at midday, under saturating light intensity, on plants grown indoor at 20 - 25 °C and outdoor during the winter. Anatomical and cytological features of leaves were also determined on both plant groups through light and fluorescence microscopy. Data obtained showed that leaf photochemical behaviour and structure change significantly in response to different growth temperatures: in <b>outdoor</b> <b>plants</b> we observed a significant decrease of electron transport rate (ETR), photochemical quenching (qP), photochemical efficiency of open PSII reaction centres (Fv’/Fm’) and an increase of non-photochemical quenching (qN) and total chlorophyll and carotenoids content, accompanied by changes in tissue density. Conversely indoor plants exhibited a better capacity in photochemistry. However, the decrease of photochemical processes under cold did not lead to photodamage risks in <b>outdoor</b> <b>plants,</b> because no difference in maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) was detected as compared to indoor plants. The overall analysis of data suggests that in <b>outdoor</b> <b>plants</b> the photoprotection at low winter temperatures is obtained by means of a combination of thermal dissipation processes and alteration of leaf structural characteristic...|$|R

40|$|People {{spend most}} of their time inside {{buildings}} and the indoor microbiome is a major part of our everyday environment. It affects humans' wellbeing and therefore its composition is important for use in inferring human health impacts. It is still not well understood how environmental conditions affect indoor microbial communities. Existing studies have mostly focussed on the local (e. g., building units) or continental scale and rarely on the regional scale, e. g. a specific metropolitan area. Therefore, we wanted to identify key environmental determinants for the house dust microbiome from an existing collection of spatially (area of Munich, Germany) and temporally (301 days) distributed samples and to determine changes in the community as a function of time. To that end, dust samples that had been collected once from the living room floors of 286 individual households, were profiled for fungal and bacterial community variation and diversity using microbial fingerprinting techniques. The profiles were tested for their association with occupant behaviour, building characteristics, outdoor pollution, vegetation, and urbanization. Our results showed that more environmental and particularly outdoor factors (vegetation, urbanization, airborne particulate matter) affected the community composition of indoor fungi than of bacteria. The passage of time affected fungi and, surprisingly, also strongly affected bacteria. We inferred that fungal communities in indoor dust changed semi-annually, whereas bacterial communities paralleled <b>outdoor</b> <b>plant</b> phenological periods. These differences in temporal dynamics cannot be fully explained and should be further investigated in future studies on indoor microbiomes...|$|E
