5|$|At {{the end of}} the race's {{first week}} and {{beginning}} of its second were three hilly medium-mountain stages. These stages took the Giro through Austria and Switzerland before returning to Italy. Each of these stages took more than five hours to complete, and the rain that fell each day combined with the difficulties presented by the numerous ascents and descents made the courses potentially unsafe in the riders' opinion. This opinion was perhaps validated by the life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo in the eighth stage after he crashed while descending a mountain. While the ninth stage {{was meant to be a}} showy criterium in celebration of this being the 100th anniversary of the Giro d'Italia, the riders collectively protested the safety conditions of that stage and the ones before it. This meant it would be neutralized, with every rider receiving the same finishing time as the stage winner regardless <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> finished.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{relatively}} {{certain that}} the Persian fleet was sent out to block the exit from the Straits the evening before the battle. Herodotus clearly believed that the Persian fleet actually entered the Straits at nightfall, planning to catch the Allies as they fled. However, modern historians have greatly debated this point, with some pointing out the difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night, and others accepting Herodotus's version. There are thus two possibilities; that during the night the Persians simply blocked the exit to the Straits, and then entered the straits in daylight; or that they entered the straits and positioned themselves for battle during the night. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> attempted it, {{it seems likely that}} the Persians pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari, so that from an initial east-west alignment (blocking the exit), they came round to a north-south alignment (see diagram). The Persian fleet seems to have been formed into three ranks of ships (according to Aeschylus); with the powerful Phoenician fleet on the right flank next to Mount Aigaleo, the Ionian contingent on the left flank and the other contingents in the centre.|$|E

The governor and legislature failed to pass a state budget by the constitutional deadline of midnight on June 30, 2005 and therefore had no authority to pay thousands of the state’s employees for work performed. The politicians further attempted to divide state employees by deeming some “essential,” and sending the rest home. The “make half” settlement allowed those workers sent home, through no fault of their own to receive half of the pay or vacation hours lost ten months after the fact.|$|E

The novels showed a largely unchanging world, regardless <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were written, and only rarely—and mistakenly in McCrum's view—did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude, as he did in the 1966 story [...] "Bingo Bans the Bomb".|$|E
500|$|At the hospital, two men forced Feng {{to apply}} her {{thumbprint}} to {{a consent form}} and sign a document authorizing the abortion.

Feng later told All Girls Allowed, an American group campaigning against the one-child policy, [...] "I could feel the baby jumping around inside me all the time, but then she went still." [...] She had been seven months pregnant at the time, so the abortion, voluntary or not, was illegal under Chinese law. No family members were allowed to be present for the procedure. After the child died of hypoxia, Feng underwent induced labor and delivered a stillborn girl on June 4. Feng later told All Girls Allowed: [...] "It was much more painful than my first childbirth. The baby was lifeless, and she was all purple and blue." [...] The corpse was then placed next to Feng on her bed for her family to dispose <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> arrived.|$|E
500|$|The protest {{at first}} only {{involved}} the criterium being neutralized– that is, the race director agreed that each rider would {{receive the same}} finishing time as the stage winner regardless <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> actually crossed the line. After the riders rode a lap of the course, they decided instead not to contest the stage at all, riding the first six circuits [...] slower than previous stages. After four laps, they stopped altogether as race leader Di Luca addressed the unhappy crowd to explain their actions. The times for the stage did not count, {{and there was no}} aggressive riding until a final sprint finish. Along with Di Luca, Lance Armstrong was considered the principal voice speaking for the peloton on this day. Although the protest was referred to by some as [...] "unanimous," [...] cyclists such as Filippo Pozzato, who was himself bearing injuries sustained in a crash that would later force him to leave the race, said the riders had been too hasty in their decision, and that it should have been made conclusively before the stage began. Armstrong apologized to the fans for the effect the protest had on {{what was supposed to be}} a grand spectacle, but also contended that it was the correct decision for the peloton to make.|$|E

500|$|Historians {{agree that}} at some point in history the order of words in this {{construction}} shifted, putting the noun at the end rather than beginning, like in the present-day construction Number–Classifier–Noun. According to historical linguist Alain Peyraube, the earliest occurrences of this construction (albeit with mass-classifiers, rather than count-classifiers) appear in the late portion of Old Chinese (500BCE to 200BCE). At this time, the Number–Mass-classifier portion of the Noun–Number–Mass-classifier construction was sometimes shifted in front of the noun. Peyraube speculates that this may have occurred because it was gradually reanalyzed as a modifier (like an adjective) for the head noun, as opposed to a simple repetition as it originally was. Since Chinese generally places modifiers before modified, as does English, [...] the shift may have been prompted by this reanalysis. By {{the early part of the}} Common Era, the nouns appearing in [...] "classifier position" [...] were beginning to lose their meaning and become true classifiers. Estimates of when classifiers underwent the most development vary: Wang Li claims their period of major development was during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), whereas Liu Shiru estimates that it was the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420 – 589 CE), and Peyraube chooses the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907 CE). Regardless <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> developed, Wang Lianqing claims that they did not become grammatically mandatory until sometime around the 11th century.|$|E
500|$|Regular series {{composer}} Nobuo Uematsu {{wrote the}} soundtrack for Final Fantasy VIII. He tried to base the songs {{off of the}} emotional content <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> would be played, asserting that expressing the emotions he desires {{is more important than}} improving skills: [...] "I {{think it will be a}} shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game". He could not determine a character's emotions solely based on the plot, instead using images of appearance and attire—"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game". The absence of character themes found in the previous two games was due to Uematsu finding those of Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a [...] "highlight" [...] in the game, but he found Final Fantasy VIII only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the [...] "Eyes on Me" [...] theme.|$|E
500|$|Sánchez' overall hopes took an {{immediate}} hit. Near {{the end of}} stage 1, two crashes greatly {{reduced the number of}} riders who contested the finish at the Mont des Alouettes. Despite this finish being slightly uphill, the stage was classified flat, meaning any riders who crashed within the final [...] would receive the same finishing time as those they were with upon crashing, regardless <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> actually finished. The second of the two crashes occurred inside , but the first did not, and it was behind that first crash that Sánchez, as well as two-time defending champion Alberto Contador, was caught. As a result of little more than bad luck, Sánchez was immediately a minute and 20 seconds down, in 79th place. The next day, despite extra team time trial training prior to the Tour, the squad finished still finished last of the 22 teams, losing a minute and 22 seconds to the day's winners [...] This dropped Sánchez to 104th place. Sánchez began to climb back up the standings in stage 4, similar in profile to stage 1 as it was largely flat but with an uphill finish. Sánchez took eighth atop the Mûr-de-Bretagne, gaining 47 places in the standings as he took time out of {{the vast majority of the}} field. Sánchez finished close to the front of the race on stage 8 on Super Besse. 's Rui Costa took the victory alone a few seconds ahead of the field, but Sánchez finished fourth, in the first large group, improving his position to 29th. Sánchez' time gap to the race leader grew as a result of stage 9, when Thomas Voeckler took the yellow jersey from a breakaway, but his position improved, to 20th, since riders who had begun the day ahead of him lost more time than he did.|$|E
