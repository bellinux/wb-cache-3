5|$|In {{his later}} years, White {{and his wife}} resided in St. Petersburg, Florida during the winter season. White died of heart failure on June 2, 1944 at 1 p.m. {{at the age of}} 75 at his summer camp near Rupert, Greenbrier County, West Virginia. The medical {{certification}} of White's death stated the cause of his heart failure was due to age and <b>overexertion.</b> White's funeral was held in Charleston, and he was interred in the White family burial plot at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. At the time of his death, White was residing at 610½ Capitol Street in Charleston.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team {{was responsible for}} casting, but Microsoft maintained a final say. The decision to use Alex Puccinelli instead of Steve Downes, the previous voice artist of Master Chief, was approved by Microsoft. The actors playing the cadets attended a boot camp before shooting to raise their fitness and accustom them to assault courses and rifle drills in their armour costumes. Cast members drove themselves to <b>overexertion</b> in the training, causing some to vomit, which they saw as a bonding experience.|$|E

25|$|Truck drivers often {{spend their}} nights parked at a truck stop, rest area, {{or on the}} {{shoulder}} of a freeway ramp. Sometimes these are in secluded areas or dangerous neighborhoods, which account for a number of deaths due to drivers being targeted by thieves for their valuable cargo, money, and property, or for the truck and trailer themselves. Drivers of trucks towing flatbed trailers are responsible for securing and strapping down their cargo (which often involves climbing onto the cargo itself), and if the load requires tarping necessitates climbing on the load to spread out tarps. Tarps can weigh up to 200lbs each and the cargo can require up to 3 tarps per load which account for a number of deaths and injuries from falling. Drivers spend long hours behind the wheel, which can cause strain on the back muscles. Some drivers are responsible for unloading their cargo, which can lead to many back strains and sprains due to <b>overexertion</b> and improper lifting techniques. If the cab of the truck is not appropriate for the driver's size, the driver can lose visibility and easy access to the controls and be at higher risk for accidents.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{workload}} {{ensured that}} he was rushing to finish Dark Horse in October 1974 before beginning his North American tour with Shankar on 2 November. Described by Leng as [...] "growled", Harrison's rough-sounding singing on [...] "Ding Dong" [...] shows {{the effects of a}} long-standing throat problem. Due to a combination of <b>overexertion</b> and abuse, this condition worsened, leading to him contracting laryngitis as he simultaneously completed his vocals for the album in Los Angeles and rehearsed for the tour. The female backing singers on the track remain uncredited.|$|E
500|$|The female drills several holes {{through the}} bark {{down to the}} xylem to place one egg in each. At the same time, she inserts spores of Amylostereum areolatum and a {{phytotoxic}} secretion. The holes branch out into several tubes, which lead away radially. The eggs are white, sausage-shaped, and [...] by [...] in size. Small females may lay 20 eggs, while the largest can lay up to 500. Sometimes, eggs are not placed in every tube. In the last tube, the female injects only the secretion and the fungal spores. The females often die after just three or four days, sometimes even during oviposition (egg-laying), through <b>overexertion.</b>|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{commitment}} to his other projects – such as starting {{up a new}} record label, Dark Horse Records, and organising Shankar's European revue, the Music Festival from India – affected progress on the album. According to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, Harrison had to overdub much of his vocals while in Los Angeles for tour rehearsals, in October. Combined with his having to sing during the rehearsals, the <b>overexertion</b> damaged Harrison's voice, compromising his performance on songs such as [...] "Far East Man". His throat condition worsened during the subsequent tour, earning Harrison highly unfavourable concert reviews {{from a number of}} critics, who objected also to the substantial stage-time afforded Shankar's ensemble.|$|E
500|$|Cernan was {{originally}} selected as backup pilot for Gemini 9 with Thomas Stafford. When the prime crew {{was killed in}} the crash of NASA T-38A [...] "901" [...] (USAF serial 63-8181) at Lambert Field on February 28, 1966, the backup crew became the prime crew. This {{was the first time the}} backup crew had become the flight crew. Gemini 9A encountered a number of problems; the original target vehicle exploded during launch, and the planned docking with a substitute target vehicle was made impossible by a protective shroud failing to separate after launch. However, the crew performed a rendezvous that simulated procedures that would be used in Apollo 10: the first optical rendezvous; and a lunar orbit abort rendezvous. Cernan performed the second American EVA (the third ever), but <b>overexertion</b> due to lack of limb restraints prevented testing of the AMU and forced the early termination of the spacewalk.|$|E
2500|$|Avulsion injury – McWhinney and {{the other}} {{researchers}} considered an avulsion injury caused by [...] "repetitive <b>overexertion</b> of the muscles" [...] {{to be the most}} likely source for the lesion on the humerus. The researchers believed the lesion to have originated with the avulsion of the M. brachialis causing the formation of [...] "a downward sloping elliptical mass". The bone spur was caused by an osteoblastic response following a tear {{at the base of the}} M. brachioradialis caused by its flexor motion.|$|E
2500|$|In {{stroke play}} {{competitions}} played according to strict rules, each player plays {{his or her}} ball until it is holed {{no matter how many}} strokes that may take. In match play it is acceptable to simply pick up one's ball and [...] "surrender the hole" [...] after enough strokes have been made by a player that it is mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole. It is also acceptable in informal stroke play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the [...] "par" [...] rating of the hole (a [...] "triple bogey" [...] - see below); while technically a violation of Rule 3-2, this practice speeds play as a courtesy to others, and avoids [...] "runaway scores", excessive frustration and injuries caused by <b>overexertion.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{causes of}} hip {{dysplasia}} are considered heritable, but new research conclusively suggests that environment {{also plays a}} role. To what degree the causality is genetic and what portion environmental is a topic of current debate. Neutering a dog, especially before the dog has reached an age of full developmental maturity, has been proven to almost double the chance {{he or she will}} develop hip dysplasia versus intact dogs or dogs that were neutered after reaching adulthood [...] Other environmental influences include overweight condition, injury at a young age, <b>overexertion</b> on the hip joint at a young age, ligament tear at a young age, repetitive motion on forming joint (i.e. jogging with puppy under the age of 1 year). As current studies progress, greater information may help provide procedures to effectively reduce the occurrence of this condition.|$|E
2500|$|... "Magical Girl Mii" [...] {{was used}} in the anime, though its origins were changed. In the anime it was a {{specialized}} cosplay costume she had created to mimic a magical girl television show which cost a lot of money, but Ai seemed easily able to pay for it. That episode she met a chronically ill girl named Miyuki and attempted to cheer up. After this, she wears it around and pretends to help stop evil and believes she has superpowers. Later during the episode, Miyuki collapsed from <b>overexertion</b> playing with Mii. Mii tried to use powers she thought she had to heal her. The attempt was successful, and Ai revealed to the viewers that Mii's special power was healing. However, Mii remains unaware of this for {{a good portion of the}} season, and continues to believe that she has other powers as well. After the episode, Mii continues to cosplay in the outfit with the same type of antics. Mii is voiced by Toromi in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Momoi Haruko and in English by Jocelyne Loewen.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Asha went globe-trotting, staging {{concerts in}} Canada, Dubai, UK, US {{and many other}} countries. In 1989, during a world tour, she {{performed}} in 13 US cities in 20 days. Immediately after this, she had an already sold-out concert scheduled in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to the stressful schedule, Asha suffered a massive attack of colitis, together with fever, cough and weakness. In Stockholm, a pre-concert crisis meeting was called, attended by Asha's son (and manager) Anand and the sponsors. It was decided that the orchestra will play many instrumental tracks, the accompanying singers like Suresh Wadkar would shoulder the load, and Asha will make a small appearance. But Asha rejected all such proposals and sang at the concert with great difficulty, in a not-so-good voice. Her first set of six Bollywood songs did not receive any response from the audience, which consisted mostly of Indian and Pakistani expats. Before {{the start of the}} second set of songs, a fan in the crowd requested her to sing a Marathi song. Asha obliged and sang [...] "Naach-naachuni ati mi damale" [...] ("I'm very tired of this endless dancing"). When the song ended, the auditorium erupted with claps and the encores started. After the concert, Asha was in bed for a month, recuperating from <b>overexertion.</b> In October 2002, she did a concert with Sudesh Bhosle and others, in London, for [...] "Help the Aged" [...] to help raise funds for the elderly in India. In 2007 she toured the US, Canada, and West Indies in a tour called [...] "The Incredibles". In this tour, she was accompanied by singers Sonu Nigam, Kunal Ganjawala and Kailash Kher. This tour, originally scheduled for only 12 concerts, went on to run more than 20.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Adams {{then told}} the story of his {{acquaintance}} with Frank; how, when all seemed dark, when he was lying prostrate with fever brought on by <b>overexertion</b> and insufficient food, Frank had come to his son and had insisted on helping him; how he had helped to nurse him, and how, finally, Frank and his companions had worked the claim and realised a fortune for him. He told how popular Frank was among his companions, how ready he was to do a kindly action to any one needing it, and finally repeated the conversation they had had together the last evening, and Frank's determination not to return to England until he had gained such a fortune that he could not be suspected of desiring to gain anything but his uncle's esteem when he presented himself before him and declared he was innocent.|$|E
60|$|All these {{instances}} are {{summed up in}} the following statement: “That when the degree of muscular irritability {{at the time of}} death is considerable, either in consequence of a good state of nutrition, as in persons who die in full health from an accidental cause, or in consequence of rest, as in cases of paralysis, or on account of the influence of cold, cadaveric rigidity in all these cases sets in late and lasts long, and putrefaction appears late, and progresses slowly;” but “that when the degree of muscular irritability at the time of death is slight, either in consequence of a bad state of nutrition, or of exhaustion from <b>overexertion,</b> or from convulsions caused by disease or poison, cadaveric rigidity sets in and ceases soon, and putrefaction appears and progresses quickly.” These facts present, in all their completeness, the conditions of the Joint Method of Agreement and Difference. Early and brief rigidity takes place in cases which agree only in the circumstance of a low state of muscular irritability. Rigidity begins late and lasts long in cases which agree only in the contrary circumstance, of a muscular irritability high and unusually prolonged. It follows that there is a connection through causation between the degree of muscular irritability after death, and the tardiness and prolongation of the cadaveric rigidity.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{example of}} the {{benefits}} of using casters is {{to reduce the risk of}} workplace injuries for its users, particularly <b>overexertion.</b> <b>Overexertion</b> occurs when the caster being used is not suited for the application, mainly due to the wrong wheel material or rig, causing injury to the user.|$|E

50|$|Lethargy is a {{state of}} tiredness, weariness, fatigue, or lack of energy. It can be {{accompanied}} by depression, decreased motivation, or apathy. Lethargy can be a normal response to boredom, inadequate sleep, <b>overexertion,</b> overworking, stress, lack of exercise, or a symptom of a disorder. When part of a normal response, lethargy often resolves with rest, adequate sleep, decreased stress, and good nutrition.|$|E

50|$|The {{physiological}} responses {{involved in the}} stress response are widely considered adaptive as they are effective at responding to acute threats to survival across many species. However, in environments of chronic or frequent activation of the stress response, such as exposure to violence or trauma, poverty, war, hypoxia, or low rank in a social hierarchy, the stress response constantly disrupts homeostasis resulting in <b>overexertion</b> of physiological systems.|$|E
