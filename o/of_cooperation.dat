5|$|Author Timothy White {{has called}} Paramount's efforts to launch its own {{television}} service, which directly competed with the DuMont Television Network, an unwise decision – Paramount in effect was competing with itself.

According to White, by 1953, even the public pretense <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> between Paramount and DuMont was gone.|$|E

5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side of}} the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E

5|$|As {{the period}} of Sovietization and Stalinism began, the PZPR was {{anything}} but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomułka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction. The PZPR had become divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While the official ideology, the Russian version of Marxism, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, {{including those of the}} Sanation, the National Democracy, and the 19th century traditions <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> with the partitioning powers.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of PedroI the Chamber of Deputies was never {{dissolved}} and legislative sessions were never extended or postponed. Under PedroII, the Chamber of Deputies was only ever dissolved {{at the request of}} the President of the Council of Ministers (Prime minister). There were eleven dissolutions during PedroII's reign and, of these, ten occurred after consultation with the Council of State, which was beyond what was required by the Constitution. A Constitutional balance of power existed between the General Assembly and the executive branch under the Emperor. The legislature could not operate alone and the monarch could not force his will upon the Assembly. The system functioned smoothly only when both Assembly and Emperor acted in a spirit <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> for the national good.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more complex}} {{morphological}} changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, Myxobacteria detect surrounding cells {{in a process}} known as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> is a simple type of multicellular organisation. For example, about one in ten cells migrate {{to the top of a}} fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Gugelmin {{signed with}} Dick Simon Racing {{to take part}} in the North American Champ Car racing series for the last three races of 1993. Although races at Mid Ohio and Nazareth {{resulted}} in non-finishes, Gugelmin finished 13th at Laguna Seca although this was not high enough to receive any points. Despite this, Gugelmin demonstrated promise. In 1994, Gugelmin signed with Chip Ganassi Racing to partner Michael Andretti who returned to the series after a season in Formula One. Andretti was more successful than Gugelmin, and took two wins, including Reynard's first win in Champ Car at Surfers Paradise. Gugelmin was hindered by a lack <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> between his and Andretti's crews, and his first full-time year in the Champ Car World Series resulted in seven points finishes and 16th in the points standings.|$|E

5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{had offered}} to give the United States access to its {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft, {{as part of the}} Tizard Mission, briefed American scientists on British developments.

British officials did not reply to an August 1941 American offer to create a combined project. In November 1941, Frederick L.
