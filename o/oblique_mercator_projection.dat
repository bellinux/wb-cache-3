40|$|Several {{problems}} arise {{when attempting to}} register LANDSAT thematic mapper data to U. S. B Geological Survey digital elevation models (DEMs). The TM data are currently available only in a rotated variant of the Space <b>Oblique</b> <b>Mercator</b> (SOM) map <b>projection.</b> Geometric transforms are thus; required to access TM data in the geodetic coordinates used by the DEMs. Due to positional errors in the TM data, these transforms require some sort of external control. The spatial resolution of TM data exceeds that {{of the most commonly}} DEM data. Oversampling DEM data to TM resolution introduces systematic noise. Common terrain processing algorithms (e. g., close computation) compound this problem by acting as high-pass filters...|$|R
40|$|Precise {{geometric}} rectification {{of satellite}} imagery normally requires knowing the geodetic location of features identifiable in the image, called ground control points (GCPs). In many cases, however, {{it is difficult}} to compute a precise geometric rectification because too few GCPs are available {{due to the lack of}} ground data or the nature of the terrain (lakes or oceans, deserts, continuous forest, etc). When too few GCPs are available, Space <b>Oblique</b> <b>Mercator</b> (SOM) <b>projection</b> theory can be applied to provide continuous precise geometric rectification of image tiles or scenes. We use GCPs from adjacent, prim; or subsequent image tiles to create the projection geometry for the intermediate tiles. Ir. this paper, we report on the development of a procedure to implement the use of ancillary GCPs in georectifying under-controlled imagery. To validate our method, a test example was computed using 1999 data obtained by a panchromatic camera on board the Indian Remote Sensing satellite IRS- 1 C with a spatial resolution of 5. 8 m. The testing showed that the precision of geometric rectification in a tile without GCPs is within three pixels (about 17. 4 m), and the speed of computation is faster than with traditional methods...|$|R
40|$|Landsat- 4 Thematic Mapper data of Washington, DC, Harrisburg, PA, and Salton Sea, CA were {{analyzed}} to determine geometric integrity and conformity {{of the data}} to known earth surface geometry. Several tests were performed. Intraband correlation and interband registration were investigated. No problems were observed in the intraband analysis, and aside from indications of slight misregistration between bands of the primary versus bands of the secondary focal planes, interband registration was well within the specified tolerances. A substantial number of ground control points were found and used to check the images' conformity to the Space <b>Oblique</b> <b>Mercator</b> (SOM) <b>projection</b> of their respective areas. The means of the residual offsets, which included nonprocessing related measurement errors, were close to the one pixel level in the two scenes examined. The Harrisburg scene residual mean was 28. 38 m (0. 95 pixels) {{with a standard deviation}} of 19. 82 m (0. 66 pixels), while the mean and standard deviation for the Salton Sea scene were 40. 46 (1. 35 pixels) and 30. 57 m (1. 02 pixels), respectively. Overall, the data were judged to be a high geometric quality with errors close to those targeted by the TM sensor design specifications...|$|R
5000|$|Col. Alden Partridge Colvocoresses, USA (Ret.), (1918-2007) and {{great-grandson}} of George M. Colvocoresses, {{received the}} Purple Heart {{as well as}} two Silver Stars, the second awarded under the command of Major General Ernest N. Harmon. His career spanned World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. After leaving the army, Alden was a pioneer in satellite mapping techniques, including the Space <b>Oblique</b> <b>Mercator</b> <b>projection</b> that maps images from Landsat satellites, which he used to develop the first satellite map of the United States.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} years of the Space Age, {{geodetic}} investigations by the USACE determined the earth's size and shape, and included precise geodetic and astronomic surveys in many remote areas of the Pacific, the Arctic, Asia and South America. Work by Dr. Irene Fischer helped determine the parallax of the moon, and her geoid studies helped in investigation the lingering effects of the last Ice Age. The Corps of Engineers participated in the VANGUARD artificial satellite program with the US Army Signal Corps and US Navy to obtain astronomic, geodetic and gravimetric observations to determine the size and shape of the earth, intercontinental relationships and gravity fields. Continuing this work, Dr. Alden Colvocoresses (1923-2007) developed the Space <b>Oblique</b> <b>Mercator</b> <b>projection,</b> which was used with the Landsat satellite to make the first satellite produced map of the US.|$|E
50|$|Most state plane {{zones are}} based on either a {{transverse}} Mercator projection or a Lambert conformal conic projection. The choice between the two map projections {{is based on the}} shape of the state and its zones. States that are long in the east-west direction are typically divided into zones that are also long east-west. These zones use the Lambert conformal conic projection, because it is good at maintaining accuracy along an east-west axis, due to the projection cone intersecting the earth's surface along two lines of latitude. Zones that are long in the north-south direction use the Transverse Mercator projection because it is better at maintaining accuracy along a north-south axis, due to the circumference of the projection cylinder being oriented along a meridian of longitude. The panhandle of Alaska, whose maximum dimension is on a diagonal, uses an <b>Oblique</b> <b>Mercator</b> <b>projection,</b> which minimizes the combined error in the X and Y directions.|$|E

40|$|Map {{projection}} is {{an important}} component of modern cartography, and involves many fussy mathematical analysis processes, such as the power series expansions of elliptical functions, differential of complex and implicit functions, elliptical integral and the operation of complex numbers. The derivation of these problems by hand not only consumes much time and energy but also makes mistake easily, and sometimes can not be realized at all because of the impossible complexity. The research achievements in mathematical analysis of map projection by computer algebra are systematically reviewed in five aspects, i. e., the symbolic expressions of forward and inverse solution of ellipsoidal latitudes, the direct transformations between map projections with different distortion properties, expressions of Gauss projection by complex function, mathematical analysis of <b>oblique</b> <b>Mercator</b> <b>projection,</b> polar chart projection with its transformation. Main problems that need to be further solved in this research field are analyzed. It will be helpful to promote the development of map projection...|$|E

40|$|Graphics are {{presented}} which show HCMM mapped water-surface temperature in Lake Anna, a 13, 000 dendrically-shaped lake which provides cooling {{for a nuclear}} power plant in Virginia. The HCMM digital data, produced by NASA were processed by NOAA/NESS into image and line-printer form. A LANDSAT image of the lake illustrates the relationship between MSS band 7 data and the HCMM data as processed by the NASA image processing facility which transforms the data to the same distortion-free hotline <b>oblique</b> <b>Mercator</b> <b>projection.</b> Spatial correlation of the two images is relatively simple by either digital or analog means and the HCMM image has a potential accuracy approaching the 80 m of the original LANDSAT data. While it is difficult to get readings that are not diluted by radiation from cooler adjacent land areas in narrow portions of the lake, digital data indicated by the line-printer display five different temperatures for open-water areas. Where the water surface response was not diluted by land areas, the temperature difference recorded by HCMM corresponds to in situ readings with rsme on the order of 1 C...|$|E
40|$|The Department of the Interior (DOI) has the {{responsibility}} to preserve and to distribute most Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data that have been acquired by the five Landsat satellites operational since July 1972. Data that are still covered by exclusive marketing rights, which were granted by the U. S. Government to the commercial Landsat operator, cannot be distributed by the DOI. As the designated national archive for Landsat data, the U. S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center (EDC) has initiated two new programs to protect and make available any of the 625, 000 MSS scenes currently archived and the 200, 000 TM scenes to be archived at EDC by 1995. A specially configured system has begun converting Landsat MSS data from obsolete high density tapes (HDT's) to more dense digital cassette tapes. After transcription, continuous satellite swaths are (1) divided into standard scenes defined by a world reference system, (2) geographically located by latitude and longitude, and (3) assessed for overall quality. Digital browse images are created by subsampling the full-resolution swaths. Conversion of the TM HDT's will begin {{in the fourth quarter}} of 1992 and will be conducted concurrently with MSS conversion. Although the TM archive is three times larger than the entire MSS archive, conversion of data from both sensor systems and consolidation of the entire Landsat archive at EDC will be completed by the end of 1994. Some MSS HDT's have deteriorated, primarily as a result of hydrolysis of the pigment binder. Based on a small sample of the 11 terabytes of post- 1978 MSS data and the 41 terabytes of TM data to be converted, it appears that to date, less than 2 percent of the data have been lost. The data loss occurs within small portions of some scenes; few scenes are lost entirely. Approximately 10, 000 pre- 1979 MSS HDT's have deteriorated to such an extent, as a result of hydrolysis, that the data cannot be recovered without special treatment of the tapes. An independent consulting division of a major tape manufacturer has analyzed affected tapes and is confident that restorative procedures can be applied to the HDT's to permit one pass to reproduce the data on another recording media. A system to distribute minimally processed Landsat data will be procured in 1992 and will be operational by mid- 1994. Any TM or MSS data in the national archive that are not restricted by exclusive marketing rights will be reproduced directly from the archive media onto user specified computer-compatible media. TM data will be produced either at a raw level (radiometrically and geometrically uncorrected) or at an intermediate level (radiometrically corrected and geometrically indexed). MSS data will be produced to an intermediate level or to a fully corrected level (radiometrically corrected and geometrically transformed to an <b>Oblique</b> <b>Mercator</b> <b>projection).</b> The system will be capable of providing ordered scenes within 48 hours of receipt of order...|$|E
