The purpose of these was to engage CAA members in set, <b>organised</b> <b>procedures</b> that ultimately produced Core Values of chiropractic, Core Purposes of the CAA and a Vision Statement to guide the organisation in its future strategic planning and activities. This paper documents those consensus activities, lists the outcomes and notes proposed efforts to review them...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{revolves around}} three main elements: 'male infertility'; existing {{social science research}} on infertility; and ethno methodology. The substantive topic 'male infertility' is enclosed in quotation marks for two reasons. First, following the overall form of ethno methodological inquiry, {{the aim is to}} explicate how the sense and order of 'male infertility' is constituted through available socially organised procedures; hence, the quotation marks are used to 'bracket' the phenomenon and focus on the methods that make it available. Second, 'male infertility' is a convenient shorthand topic label, a general organising concept, as opposed to a precise label for a tightly defined phenomenon. While this study's approach makes it very different to existing sociological studies of infertility, the difference is not to the extent of isolation - a strong attempt is made to engage with prior studies. Often this engagement takes a critical form, the general argument being that sociological studies which approach phenomena for the way they 'bear the marks' of societal structures, will ignore the incarnate orderliness of social action - that is, the way social action is readily explicable to members, in and as it occurs, using the resources at-hand, with 'no time-out'. Ethno methodology suggests that this ready explicability is based upon taken-for-granted, socially organised sense-assembly practices - thus, this study's argument that the content, the intelligibility of 'male infertility is interdependent with the social scenes and embedded socially <b>organised</b> <b>procedures,</b> with and within which 'male infertility' is found. Form and content stand or fall together. Consistent with this viewpoint, four empirical analyses of the social organisation of 'male infertility' are offered. The specific topics discussed are: the conversational disclosure of infertility; the language of reproduction; humour and infertility; and high rates of non-response by men in studies of infertility. In general, the empirical analyses are 'indifferent' to the topic of study, that is, there is no overriding aim of offering practical correctives or broader socio-political critique. However, in at least one empirical chapter a more critical stand is taken, and, in the concluding chapter, it is argued that an ethno methodological descriptivist approach can have socio-political implications. Overall, the study supports the growing trend for ethno methodological insights to be utilised in the study of substantive topics; and, since the dissertation is a form of writing 'anew', it can be considered to minimally change 'male infertility' as a form of life...|$|E

40|$|In the {{healthcare}} environment, quality systems have already provided significant results in <b>organising</b> <b>procedures</b> and human resources. However, {{the lack of}} managerial methodologies and knowledge sharing regarding best practices has limited the positive effects from new research and limited achievements. The lean approach can change healthcare organisations that adopt continuous improvement logics and can create substantial business results. This paper focuses on the development and application of lean principles in an oncology unit to increase the service performance levels while following and reducing waste, time, and non-value added activities. The study aims at improving healthcare processes within an oncology department, dealing with four types of cancer: breast, lung, head and neck, and gastric. The five principles of lean thinking were applied to identify the value from a patient's perspective and to follow the value stream. To achieve these ambitious goals, both basic lean tools and advanced techniques were implemented...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of the concept of}} sustainability in public policies changes the methods of policy evaluation drastically. Sustainability appears as a general reference that transcends policy subsystems and operates through a discursive mode requiring rather voluntary behavioural changes. The sustainable development strategies developed in Europe are mainly procedural. They do not rely on command-and-control designs that prescribe compulsory changes to well-identified target groups. Rather they <b>organise</b> deliberative <b>procedures</b> between stakeholders. This lack of clear-cut objectives challenges policy evaluation because it jeopardizes the ability to measure and assess policy outcomes. A way to address this challenge consists in going back to the epistemological foundations of the sustainability strategies, related to social constructivism. This article suggests two evolutionary paths for evaluation designs, based on the literatures on policy learning and policy narratives that provide tools to assess the diffusion of discourse towards individuals and policy networks. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Within {{the setting}} of the Swiss school system, this paper {{presents}} school quality dimensions as requirements for building, emphasising its normative character, which is {{due to the nature of}} education and architecture, and reinforced by legal prescriptions. The paper then discusses how assessment criteria could be used to mirror educational requirements for design, and how current research on the relationship between education and architecture could lead to the development of criteria in Switzerland. It also discusses pragmatic solutions to <b>organising</b> new <b>procedures</b> of design and assessment involving the relevant persons as agents, with normative concepts of education and building. Evaluating school buildings should begin – in my view – with a concept of school quality. But this is already a difficult thing to deal with, and I will return to this problem later on. First of all, I should state, that I am not an expert in evaluating school facilities. I have been involved in the planning of school buildings and establishing dimensions of school quality. My contribution to the meeting is intended to introduce the various principles of school quality and how they relate to facility design and assessment. It is based on my experience of the Swiss school system, very diverse one, with particular reference to the cantonal school system of Zürich...|$|R

40|$|From {{the filing}} of an {{application}} to evict to the final execution of an eviction order is a long and complicated process. This raises questions about how the actors involved experience and act during this process. The general aim {{of the study was}} to describe and analyse this process from the respective perspectives of the landlords, the social services and the individuals (families) facing eviction in three municipalities in the county of Stockholm. The issues discussed are how the landlords and the social welfare offices are <b>organised,</b> their work <b>procedures,</b> respective scopes of action and resources, and how individuals facing eviction cope with their life situation. The material for the study consists of qualitative interviews with nine handling officers at six landlord offices, fifteen social workers at three social welfare offices, twelve individuals who were facing eviction and fifteen observations of conversations between social workers and individuals who were facing eviction. The analytic framework used consists of perspectives and concepts derived from organisation theory – Human Service Organizations and street-level bureaucrats – and theories on coping. A main result of the study is that the work procedures of the professionals are standardised in many ways and are characterised by similar procedures for classifying and categorising the individuals facing eviction, irrespective of how the three municipalities have organised their work. Another main result is that the primarily interests of the individuals facing eviction are to meet what they experience to be their children’s needs, and to avoid eviction. Further, the individuals experience as stressful their life situation marked by the threat of eviction in combination with reduced financial resources that make it difficult for them to meet their children’s needs. The study has identified two types of strategies that individuals facing eviction use in order to cope with their life situation and to achieve their interests. These are emotion-focused strategies and problem-focused strategies, which are described and discussed...|$|R
40|$|This PhD {{research}} aims to identify, analyse {{and evaluate}} a decision model for an e-procurement Decision Support System (DSS) {{for the public}} sector in Maldives, especially focusing on the Education Sector. The DSS uses Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to evaluate procurement alternatives. The features and characteristics of public sector procurement are based on major public sector principles, such as non-discrimination, equality, transparency and proportionality. This results in an <b>organised</b> step-by-step <b>procedure</b> for public sector procurement. However, this research focuses only on decisions {{that are based on}} the performances of the suppliers against a pre-set list of criteria where MCDA is applied to the evaluation. This research studied the applicability of a comprehensive set of published MCDA methods identified in the literature to the problem context. The MCDA methods used in this research involves linear weighting methods, single synthesising criterion or utility theory, outranking methods, fuzzy methods and mixed methods. This research adopted the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, which is intended to design an artefact. The artefact in this case is the decision model. The methodology provides the artefact, explains how to use it, and how to evaluate the artefact. As these three components are of prime importance for the research project, DSR is chosen. The methodology follows a set of specific guidelines provided by Information Systems (IS) research scholars for such IS research projects. To support the process steps of the research project, literature reviews of public sector procurement and MCDA were undertaken, field research of focus groups was carried out, and selected documented data on procurement evaluations were collected for performance analysis of the MCDA methods in context. The first part of the literature review provided the requirements and constraints of the public sector procurement in general and specifically in relation to Maldivian public sector. The second part of the literature review identified MCDA methods and their procedures and characteristics. The focus group discussions were conducted with public sector procurement evaluation officials of selected education institutions, to identify operational constraints and requirements of the procurement. Criteria-based evaluation was conducted on the characteristics of MCDA methods compared to the public sector requirements gathered through literature review and focus groups. This analysis was to identify the applicable MCDA methods based on public sector requirements. The analysis filtered only two applicable methods namely, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) and COPRAS (COmplex PRoportional ASsessment). Finally, performance analysis was done on the two methods by applying real life procurement data collected from selected public sector institutions. Congruence/incongruence analysis, variance analysis, stability analysis and MCDA were performed {{based on the results of}} the two methods, with real life data. The performance analysis shows TOPSIS having higher variance and stability over COPRAS. However, congruence/incongruence analysis was inconclusive. Based on the results of criteria-based evaluation and performance analysis, MCDA was applied on TOPSIS and COPRAS. The current public sector procurement evaluation method, weighted sum and the two filtered methods are used for MCDA on TOPSIS and COPRAS. The MCDA also resulted in favour of TOPSIS. Therefore, based on this research, the recommended decision model for the public sector e-procurement DSS for the Maldivian context is TOPSIS. The major research outputs are the identification of public sector requirements in context, the characteristics of the majority of MCDA methods in context, and strengths of performance of TOPSIS and COPRAS. In addition, the research identified the suitable decision model for the context, a theory of use of it in the context of the Public Sector of the Maldives and a framework to identify and evaluate the decision model. ...|$|R
40|$|Archaeological sites, {{perceived}} as open museums, are particularly complicated to study {{because of the}} extensive number of environmental stressors affecting their conservation state. Diagnostic methodologies can easily omit some of them, causing irreparable and inestimable damages to these sites. In this sense, multidisciplinary studies seem to constitute the most suitable approach to understand the decaying processes that occur. Up until now, these types of studies have been applied within local programmes, leading to loss of strategic output, risk of duplication and reduction in the international competitiveness of the research. Therefore, in this Joint Doctoral Thesis, a new protocol for the preservation and accessibility of the archaeological sites, based on the synergic combination of physical, geological and analytical chemistry methodologies, is presented, {{in order to understand}} the sites as a whole. The project was born in 2012 within a multidisciplinary study on Ostia Antica Mithraea, as the result of my master degree. Successively, thanks to an international cooperation (Italy-Spain) and institutional effort (National and International Research centers and Departments) it was possible to combine different disciplines developing a new analytical approach. The final aim of this approach was assess the conservation state of the building under study, pointing out the areas most at risk, resolving important issues emerged during the investigation, and identifying the origin of the decay, suggesting also possible repair tools. The diagnostic protocol consists in a dynamic model, developed as a pyramid that includes three steps or levels that can be summarised into anamnesis (the state of art, the macroscopic observation on both environment and materials), analysis (the development of a protocol that includes the investigation actions that lead to the identification of damage’s sources) and a conservation step (the real state of conservation of the site under study). This last action also considers some suggestions for a future and global conservation and lays the “ad-hoc designing” to create a whole conservation plan. The final goal is the conservation, safeguard and “usability” of open museums or cultural sites in general, thanks to the protocol flexibility, <b>organised</b> in steps <b>procedures.</b> The base of the pyramid is built on an initial hypothesis based on the “content and container” axiom, the relationship between the environment and the materials. In order to validate the proposed diagnostic protocol, the model has been implemented in a complex building, the “Casa di Diana” Mithraeum, a Roman masonry dated 130 CE, found in Ostia Antica (Italy), the port of the old city of Rome, obtaining a well-developed pyramid. The rising damp represents the key between all the actions successively developed, both geophysical and chemical surveys, and is the result of a synergic interaction. Thanks to the well-planned multi-analytical procedure, the results obtained point out towards the rising damp and acids gases as the main environmental stressors. It was possible to associate the rising damp to the presence of freshwater at shallow depth, which causes the preliminary hydration phase on bricks, and the attack of the wall-building materials by the atmospheric acid gases through dry deposition mechanism. Furthermore, the results obtained by non-destructive spectroscopic analyses have led to the hypothesis that the observed yellow bricks could date back to a different historic period, for instance Byzantine, which corresponds to the last period of utilization of this house, while the red bricks derive from the Roman period. In addition to the new protocol, each methodology is characterised by several novelty keys, obtaining in this sense, 12 research articles published/reviewed on important international journals. Some processes of this multidisciplinary study involve an important economic effort, but the present method allows making an objective decision, through a solid analytical protocol, which has an important value in the management of Cultural Heritage...|$|R
