5|$|The {{possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>installing</b> a {{rail link}} {{from what was}} originally known as the Broadmeadows line (now the Craigieburn line) to the airport was debated in the 1960s under the Bolte State Government, but with not enough support shown in parliament, the rail project was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|After {{successful}} athletics {{events at}} the Commonwealth Games, conversion into a football venue was criticised by athletics figures such as Jonathan Edwards and Sebastian Coe as, at the time, the United Kingdom still lacked plans for a large athletics venue due to the capability <b>of</b> <b>installing</b> an athletics track having been dropped from the designs for a rebuilt Wembley Stadium. Had {{either of the two}} larger stadium proposals developed by Arup been agreed for funding, then Manchester would have ended up with a venue capable of being adapted to hosting large-scale athletics events through the use of movable seating.|$|E

In this paper, we give an overview <b>of</b> <b>installed</b> based information and provide several ways in which installed base forecasting can be used. We discuss cases <b>of</b> <b>installed</b> based forecasting at four companies and list the issues involved. Moreover, we provide some models to assess the value <b>of</b> <b>installed</b> base information and conclude that forecasts of spare parts demand and return can be made considerably more timely and accurate by using installed base information...|$|R

5|$|The Board of Transport Commissioners {{issued its}} report on January 18, 1951. It avoided {{assigning}} individual {{responsibility for the}} deaths and urged the CNR to install block signals on the section of line where the accident took place. The Board noted that the CNR already had a policy <b>of</b> <b>installing</b> such signals, though they were expensive and difficult to obtain from the United States, and that the CNR had deemed other sections of the line more dangerous. It also urged additional training, to ensure that messages were transmitted accurately, and safety checks to catch instances where messages were transmitted incorrectly.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry and}} {{subsequent}} compensation cases found that Rangers had been inept in their administration and complacent after the {{incidents in the}} 1960s. The disaster also highlighted, however, {{the fact that there}} were no established safety standards that should be adhered to, let alone any means of enforcing such standards. This had been first recommended nearly 50 years earlier, after the 1923 FA Cup Final. The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973, and legislation was enacted with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. This law cut the capacity of Ibrox to 65,000. In the short term, Rangers took the stopgap measure <b>of</b> <b>installing</b> benches in the North Stand, which was renamed the Centenary Stand.|$|E
5|$|Fantasia, an {{experimental}} film produced to an accompanying orchestral arrangement conducted by Leopold Stokowski, {{was released in}} November 1940 by Disney itself {{in a series of}} limited-seating roadshow engagements. The film cost $2 million to produce, and although the film earned $1.4 million in its roadshow engagements, the high cost ($85,000 per theater) <b>of</b> <b>installing</b> Fantasound placed Fantasia at an even greater loss than Pinocchio. RKO assumed distribution of Fantasia in 1941, later reissuing it in severely edited versions over the years. Despite its financial failure, Fantasia was the subject of two Academy Honorary Awards on February 26, 1942– one {{for the development of the}} innovative Fantasound system used to create the film's stereoscopic soundtrack, and the other for Stokowski and his contributions to the film.|$|E

5|$|In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla {{another job}} in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working {{in what was}} then a brand new industry, {{installing}} indoor incandescent lighting citywide {{in the form of an}} electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge <b>of</b> <b>installing</b> the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{handrail}} was removed, Massimino {{went to work}} attaching the capture plate, but ran into additional problems when the battery {{in one of his}} power tools failed. Massimino was instructed to return to the orbiter's airlock to retrieve a spare tool and to recharge his suit's oxygen reserves, to allow for completion of the STIS repair. The rest of the STIS repair work was completed without any problems, but the spacewalkers were nearly two hours behind the scheduled timeline, so managers on the ground decided to postpone the task <b>of</b> <b>installing</b> a New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) onto the telescope's outer shell. The spacewalk, originally scheduled to last six hours and thirty minutes, ended at 21:02 UTC, for a time of eight hours and two minutes. At the time, it became the sixth longest spacewalk in history. It was the twenty-second spacewalk devoted to servicing the Hubble telescope, and Massimino's fourth spacewalk, bringing his total EVA time to thirty hours, forty-four minutes.|$|E
5|$|When {{a member}} of the family died there were varying degrees of prostration and display of piety amongst family members, each one {{behaving}} differently according to the custom of kinship association with the deceased. There was to be no flashy or colorful attire while in the period of mourning, and proper funerary rituals were observed such as cleansing and clothing the deceased to rid him or her of impurities. This was one of the necessary steps in the observance of the deceased as one of the worshipped ancestors, which in turn raised the prestige of the family. Funerals were often expensive. A geomancer had to be consulted on where to bury the dead, caterers were hired to furnish the funeral banquet, and there was always the purchase of the coffin, which was burned along with paper images of horses, carriages, and servants in order for them to accompany the deceased into the next life. Due to the high cost of burial, most families opted for the cheaper practice of cremation. This was frowned upon by Confucian officials due to beliefs in the ancestral cult. They sought to ban the practice with prohibitions in 963 and 972; despite this, cremation amongst the poor and middle classes persisted. By the 12th century, the government came up with the solution <b>of</b> <b>installing</b> public cemeteries where a family's deceased could be buried on state owned property.|$|E

40|$|AALTO UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS ABSTRACT Department of Information and Service Economy 29. 12. 2011 Master’s thesis John Westwood ABSTRACT Objectives of the Study The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the current use <b>of</b> <b>installed</b> base information and the resultant benefits through its use in industrial capital equipment manufacturing companies in their after sales service operations. The results of this exploration are the identification and characterization <b>of</b> benefits <b>of</b> <b>installed</b> base information use in after-sales service operations, and the mechanisms which drive or hinder these benefits. Academic background and methodology This study was carried out as a qualitative multiple case study with five manufacturing companies, analyzing their current installed base information systems, the resulting benefits, and the mechanisms related to benefit realization. This study utilized existent literature on the use <b>of</b> <b>installed</b> base information in after-sales field services and industrial field services in capital equipment manufacturer’s service operations. Findings and conclusions It was found that there are common benefits realized through the use <b>of</b> <b>installed</b> base information across the case companies involved in this study. Increased reliability and faster service provisioning are mentioned by all case companies as realized or expected benefits <b>of</b> <b>installed</b> base information use. However, it was also found that the utilization <b>of</b> <b>installed</b> base information is still in its infancy and will take time to develop into successful systems and realized benefits...|$|R
