500|$|During promotional {{interviews}} about [...] "Used to Love You", Stefani {{confirmed the}} album was {{to be released in}} 2016. Since the release of [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] and [...] "Spark the Fire", her then-untitled album was among many magazine's lists of The Most Anticipated Albums, for both 2015 and 2016. On February 9, 2016, she posted the album's track list through her Twitter account with the caption [...] "This Is What the Truth Feels Like...", which was later confirmed as the album's title. A day later, the album's art cover was released, along with four bonus tracks exclusive to the Target edition. The release date was scheduled for March 18, 2016. The cover features a close-up shot of Stefani with [...] "hand drawn hearts, tears and flowers", which according to Carolyn Menyes of Music Times, [...] "giv the record a sense of femininity and raw emotion". Using Stefani's official website, fans were able to create their own album cover with the same doodles on it by uploading a picture of their face to the site. Regarding the deluxe edition cover of the album, Christina Marfice from SheKnows Media speculated that it [...] "includes a secret dis aimed at" [...] her ex-husband; she stated: [...] "And, in the corner, a ring drawn on her finger with a frowny face [...] connected to it by an arrow." [...] However, the drawing was ultimately covered up by a sticker <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition.</b> Prior to the release of Shelton's tenth studio album, If I'm Honest (2016), several publications compared the cover to Stefani's, with Maeve McDermott of USA Today calling them [...] "eerily similar".|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's Raymond Padulla {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 3 out of 5. He praised the {{differentiation}} {{in the fighting}} style of the playable characters, writing, [...] "the additional variety in Dark Alliance II {{is one of the}} few cases where more translates to better." [...] However, he felt that when compared with the original game, [...] "while it is superior in a few ways, it's inferior in others." [...] He was critical of the graphics, writing [...] "there are a smattering of areas and effects that are cooler than the original, but for the most part the visuals look dated and uncreative [...] That isn't to say that the graphics are offensive, but compared to the original -- whose graphics were a strong point -- it's definitely a step down." [...] He concluded [...] "I was convinced that more of a great thing would be an even greater thing. I thought Black Isle would do as fine a job with the series as Snowblind did. I was wrong on both counts. While Dark Alliance II is a good game, it has barely progressed the series." [...] Writing later in 2004, Allen Raucsh said much the same; [...] "Black Isle Studios took over the development chores <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition,</b> and essentially delivered the same game again. Unfortunately, gamers had moved on [...] In short, while Dark Alliance II was by no means a bad game, it badly needed updating before it could become relevant again.".|$|E
