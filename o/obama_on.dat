5|$|On December 18, 2008, {{sources close}} to the Obama {{transition}} team identified Solis as the President-elect's choice for U.S. Secretary of Labor, the last cabinet position yet to be filled. The selection earned praise from the AFL-CIO and other labor organizations, but was not well received by business groups and the anti-union group Center for Union Facts. The official announcement was made by <b>Obama</b> <b>on</b> December 19. Solis's successor was chosen in a special election in California's 32nd congressional district; she declined to endorse a candidate in the primary (from which her past mentee Judy Chu emerged on top and eventually won the general election).|$|E

The bill was signed into law by President Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>on</b> January 4, 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{is working}} on {{improvements}} to MD 404 {{in order to provide}} relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts, notably by widening the remainder of the route into a four-lane divided highway. The primary motive behind the widening is the high accident rate that plagues the two-lane road, brought on by beach traffic. The divided highway portion of MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route. The section between south of Legion Road and Double Hills Road was widened in 2005 while the section between Double Hills Road and Sennett Road was widened in 2007. This project received $3 million from the federal government in 2001. As part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>on</b> February 17, 2009, $7.7 million went to widening a portion of MD 404 east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County, creating 221 jobs. The widening of this section was completed in 2012. On May 21, 2014, groundbreaking took place to widen MD 404 between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road. The project to widen this section of will cost a total of $39 million. On June 25, 2015, Governor Larry Hogan announced that state funding would be allocated to finish widening MD 404 between US 50 and Denton, among other projects across the state. A total of $160 million in funds would go to widening MD 404. The work on this is nearing completion in early 2017. Widening of the section between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road is expected to be completed by summer 2017 while widening of the remaining sections of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton is planned to be completed by late 2017.|$|E
