Scientific studies dating back to the 1970s have identified Dawn, a brand owned by Procter & Gamble, as the most effective detergent for removing petrochemicals from bird feathers, replacing earlier methods using solvents and products such as mascara remover, powdered chalk, and mineral oil. Additional research in 1995 confirmed that Dawn was the best available cleaning detergent for oiled wildlife because it easily removed oil without damaging a bird's plumage, irritating its skin, or posing additional health problems to the animals or the people involved in rehabilitation efforts.|$|E

5000|$|While {{documented}} rehabilitation {{efforts of}} oiled seabirds in California {{dates back to}} the 1940s, the 1971 San Francisco Bay Arizona & Oregon Standard Spill, and the 1969 Santa Barbara/Union Platform A Spill that preceded it, spurred new efforts to create permanent rehabilitation facilities and programs, as well as to monitor seabird mortality resulting from spills. Alice Berkner, a retired nurse and animal lover who assisted in <b>oiled</b> <b>bird</b> rehabilitation following the Standard Oil accident, founded International Bird Rescue — originally called International Bird Rescue Research Center — in April 1971. [...] The fledgling organization was housed in a small space above the Berkeley Humane Society, and in 1975 moved to Berkeley's Aquatic Park on a $5-per-year lease from the city.|$|E
5000|$|On January 19, 1971, two Standard Oil tankers, the Arizona Standard and the Oregon Standard, {{collided}} near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, {{resulting in}} a spill that covered 50 miles of coastline with 2,700 cubic tons of crude oil. [...] About 7,000 birds were oiled by the spill. Volunteers collected nearly 4,300 of them, mainly western grebes and scoters, and brought them to makeshift rehabilitation centers.

5000|$|International Bird Rescue saw {{perhaps the}} most {{extensive}} international attention of its near-40-year existence in 2010 following the explosion of Deepwater Horizon, a semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling unit {{owned and operated by}} Transocean and leased by BP on the Macondo Prospect oil field in the Gulf of Mexico. The explosion and resulting fire on April 20, 2010 killed 11 workers and caused a sea-floor oil gusher that spewed 4.9 million barrels of crude oil before the wellhead was capped on July 15, 2010. The disaster remains the largest accidental marine oil spill in petroleum industry history. [...] International Bird Rescue teamed up with Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research, the lead oiled wildlife organization on the ground, to co-manage <b>oiled</b> <b>bird</b> rehabilitation centers in Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida as part of a large-scale response to the incident that involved federal and state agencies, industry, and non-governmental organizations.

40|$|Oil {{contamination}} of waterfowl and seabirds {{has been documented}} as a significant cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in birds for more than 50 years. Each year more than one million birds may die from oil contamination in North Atlantic waters alone; worldwide mortality is unknown. Of special concern {{is that many of the}} seabirds commonly affected are not prolific breeders, and assessment of each species’ status is handicapped by the difficulty of accurately monitoring trends in marine bird populations. <b>Oiled</b> <b>bird</b> rehabilitation is an intensive, crisis-oriented response, requiring an experienced management agency, specialized medical expertise, stockpiles of specially designed equipment, and a tremendous investment of human resources. Nevertheless, after a major oil spill, the public demands that the affected wildlife species be treated, and the Fish and Wildlife Service, as the mandated response agency for the United States, will be called in to respond to the situation. Unfortunately, very few organizations have the expertise required to rehabilitate oiled birds. Public interest and involvement in the plight of oiled wildlife have resulted in some disastrous rehabilitation efforts. Oiled birds have been rolled in kitty litter, dipped in melted butter, covered with cornmeal, and plucked, all with tragic consequences. When overseen by an experienced agency, however, successful <b>oiled</b> <b>bird</b> rehabilitation has occurred. Particular rehabilitation success is seen in swans, geese, and ducks, with average release rates exceeding 90 %. In this chapter we attempt to provide the wildlife professional with a basic understanding of the internal and external effects of oil on birds, and the key components of an effective oil spill response. We emphasize the handling of waterfowl and seabirds. This chapter does not provide the detailed information needed to manage a major oil spill response...|$|E

40|$|This {{is written}} {{primarily}} as a step-by-step guide for the person(s) responsible for organizing searches of oiled birds and/or for training volunteers to handle oiled birds. It also gives details that can be useful to anyone that catches or handles birds, whether oiled or not. This monograph {{is based on the}} author's field experience after an oil spill along the Oregon Coast. But its findings are also applicable elsewhere, if the appropriate governmental agencies are substituted as necessary for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service or Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Perhaps the most significant point made is that a bird's legs should be fully supported when it is picked up. If supported, the bird remains calmer, and the bird won't be able to use its feet to scratch a volunteer.

40|$|AbstractAccidental {{spillage}} of oil in to the sea from shipping {{transport and}} drilling rigs results in spills that cause significant unsustainable mortality of wildlife and destroys marine ecosystem services. External oiling of seabirds causes large scale mortality within days following a spill, while survivors suffercauses long term chronic effects from the exposure to toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in ingested oil. Survival rates for rehabilitated <b>oiled</b> <b>birds</b> are very low despite investment of significant resources. PAHs disturb thyroid homeostasis which plays {{a vital role in}} the control of energy metabolism. In this study, plasma PAH and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were quantified as biomarkers of exposure and endocrine disruption in oiled guillemots (Uria aalge). Mean plasma PAH and TSH concentrations, were 98. 1  ±  8. 3  ng/ml and 0. 13  ±  0. 02  ng/ml and these parameters were found to be negatively correlated (p <  0. 01) indicative of PAH-associated thyroid hormone suppression in more heavily <b>oiled</b> <b>birds.</b> Body condition and weight were also lower in birds that died compared with birds that were released. The data also show the value of measuring plasma TSH and PAH to monitor metabolic status and progress of decontamination of <b>oiled</b> <b>birds</b> in a rehabilitation setting...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} {{a model to}} estimate the number of bird carcasses that were likely deposited on the beaches of St. Paul Island, Alaska following the M:V Citrus oil spill in February 1996. Most of the islands beaches were searched on an irregular schedule, resulting in the recovery of 876 King Eider carcasses. A sub-sample of beaches were intensively studied to estimate daily persistence rate and detection probability [Fowler, A. C., Flint, P. L., 1997. Marine Pollution Bulletin]. Using these data, our model predicted that an additional 733970 King Eider carcasses were not detected during our searches. Therefore, we estimate that at least 1609970 King Eider carcasses occurred on beaches {{as a result of}} the spill. We lacked sufficient sample size to model losses for other species, thus we applied the estimated recovery rate for King Eiders (54 %) to other species and estimate a total combined loss of 1765 birds. In addition, 165 birds were captured alive making the total estimated number of birds impacted by the M:V Citrus spill 1930. Given that <b>oiled</b> <b>birds</b> occurred in places on the island which could not be systematically searched combined with the fact that it was unlikely that <b>oiled</b> <b>birds</b> that died at sea would have been recovered during our searches [Flint, P. L., Fowler, A. C., 1998. Marine Pollution Bulletin], our estimate of total mortality associated with the spill should be considered a minimum. © 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Studv History: This study {{originated}} from {{a need to}} develop a better estimate of the number of seabirds killed {{as a result of the}} oil spill to support the federal government’s claim for damages against Exxon and to provide data for developing and implementing a restoration strategy. Federal and State scientists and experts ranked this study as the most significant of the bird studies in 1990. The study was performed under a contract awarded by the U. S. Department of Justice, but the Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service reimbursed the Department of Justice for the contract and was responsible for its supervision. The study was highly controversial because it involved killing 219 seabirds, immersing them in oil, and placing them in Prince William Sound to track their drift patterns. The study findings, along with other data, were used to extrapolate the likely bird death toll attributable to the Exxon Vuldez oil spill. This study was not finalized until 1996 when it was published by the American Fisheries Society. Abstract: An estimate of total mortality of seabirds from the Exxon Vuldez oil spill was derived from numbers of carcasses collected on shore.
