40|$|Evaluating {{groupware}} usability can be {{a difficult}} problem. Many researchers believe that groupware can only be evaluated by studying real collaborators in their real contexts, a process which tends to be expensive and timeconsuming. Others {{believe that it is}} more practical to evaluate groupware through usability inspection methods. Deciding between these two approaches is difficult, because it is unclear how they compare in a real evaluation situation. To address this problem, we carried out a dual evaluation of a groupware system, with one evaluation applying userbased techniques, and the <b>other</b> using <b>inspection</b> methods. We compared the results from the two evaluations and conclude that although user-based techniques do provide some information that cannot be found through <b>other</b> <b>means,</b> <b>inspection</b> techniques are an inexpensive and effective way of finding usability problems in groupware.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} {{detection}} of damage for simply supported beams to ensure their safety. Based on the analysis of possible kinds of damage may occur, this paper presents a new approach which relies {{on the fact that}} any change in local stiffness caused by damage can be reflected by the change of mid-span displacement between the intact and damaged beams. Direct relationship between the change in local stiffness and the measured mid-span displacement values is developed. This approach can identify the geometric locations of damage and then <b>inspection</b> <b>means</b> are used as a complement to find the real damage phenomena within the obtained small region. A numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the approach.
