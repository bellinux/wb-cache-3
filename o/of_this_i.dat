25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>I</b> try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>I</b> knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. <b>Of</b> <b>this</b> <b>I</b> am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E

25|$|At a {{later time}} Drolma said, 'I have knowingly taken birth into samsara {{in order to fulfill}} my {{aspirations}} to protect the teachings of the Buddha and for the welfare of all sentient beings. Because <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>I</b> will grant the ordinary and supreme siddhis to my followers. She led her followers to a huge cave called Tingring. The cave was very sacred, containing many precious termas and many self-created statues of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, Yidams, Dakinis, and Dharma Protectors on the rocks inside the cave. A human corpse was brought and she transformed that corpse into a great tsog offering. Those who could partake of that tsog were granted the ordinary and supreme siddhis. Then she composed a text containing a sadhana of herself and promised to look after the teachings of the Buddha in general and to protect the essence of the Buddha's teaching that will appear in the future.|$|E

Nevertheless, he came to define this position as [...] "a bad solution", and, as Maiorescu and Ionescu formed an alliance, he successfully requested appointment from Bădărău, eventually obtaining it through the means of a decree signed by King Carol I. Caragiale later commented: [...] " [...] entrusted me with this golden key, which I had wanted for so long, and which, for all <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>I</b> had not been desperate to obtain." [...] This contradicted another one of his accounts, in which he confessed that, initially received with indifference by Bădărău, he had claimed that him joining the Conservative-Democrats had been Ion Luca's dying request. Șerban Cioculescu would comment: [...] "There {{could not have been}} a more complete distortion of a parent's last wish!" ...|$|E
500|$|On 25 October 2011, it was {{announced}} Bower would be leaving Neighbours in December 2011 {{to move into a}} new international role with FremantleMedia. Of her departure, Bower told Colin Vickery of the Herald Sun, [...] "I love Neighbours, it is a wonderful show and because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>I</b> felt it was important that fresh eyes and brains take over to keep this Australian icon contemporary. Having said that, I'm really excited about the new role and thank FremantleMedia for this wonderful opportunity." [...] Former City Homicide producer, Richard Jasek, took over Bower's role, while Alan Hardy took over the role of producer. On 4 December 2013, it was confirmed that Jasek would be leaving Neighbours and Jason Herbison had been promoted to series producer. FremantleMedia's head of drama Jo Porter became executive producer, while Laurence Wilson became the associate producer. The show celebrated its 7000th episode on 24 October 2014. In March 2015, Neighbours celebrated its 30th anniversary and twelve former cast members returned for the anniversary episodes that revolved around an Erinsborough Festival. Network Ten and Channel 5 aired a documentary special titled Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite, which featured interviews with current and former cast members, including Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan and Guy Pearce, reflecting on their time on the show. Natalie Lynch succeeded Wilson as producer in early 2016.|$|E

500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>I</b> have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E

2500|$|From 1951 to 1955, Murrow was {{the host}} <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>I</b> Believe, which offered {{ordinary}} people {{the opportunity to}} speak for five minutes on radio.

He also recorded a series of narrated [...] "historical albums" [...] for Columbia Records called I Can Hear It Now, which inaugurated his partnership with producer Fred W. Friendly.

2500|$|For {{three and}} a half years I dodged the war as much as I could - and I regret not having had the courage shown by the great Karl Liebknecht to say No and refuse to serve in the military. <b>Of</b> <b>this</b> <b>I</b> am ashamed.

2500|$|Many {{colleagues and}} critics have {{concluded}} that Parry's music {{is that of a}} conventional and not strongly creative Englishman.

2500|$|Writing to {{a friend}} in May 1795, Burke {{surveyed}} the causes of discontent: [...] "I think I can hardly overrate the malignity {{of the principles of}} Protestant ascendency, as they affect Ireland; or of Indianism , as they affect these countries, and as they affect Asia; or of Jacobinism, as they affect all Europe, and the state of human society itself. The last is the greatest evil". By March 1796, however Burke had changed his mind: [...] "Our Government and our Laws are beset by two different Enemies, which are sapping its foundations, Indianism, and Jacobinism. In some Cases they act separately, in some they act in conjunction: But <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>I</b> am sure; that the first is the worst by far, and the hardest to deal with; and for this amongst other reasons, that it weakens discredits, and ruins that force, which ought to be employed with the greatest Credit and Energy against the other; and that it furnishes Jacobinism with its strongest arms against all formal Government".|$|E
2500|$|The Indians {{always insisted}} that they took no prisoners. If they did—a thing I firmly believe—they were {{tortured}} and killed {{the night of the}} 25th. As an evidence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>I</b> recall the three charred and burned heads we picked up in the village near the scene of the big war dance, when we visited the village with Capt. Benteen and Lieut. Wallace {{on the morning of the}} 27th... I'm sorely afraid, Tony, that we will have to class Hayward's story, like that of so many others, as pure, unadulterated B. S. As a clerk at headquarters I had occasion to look over the morning reports of at least the six troops at Lincoln almost daily, and never saw his name there, or among the list of scouts employed from time to time...I am hoping that some day all of these damned fakirs will die and it will be safe for actual participants in the battle to admit and insist that they were there, without being branded and looked upon as a lot of damned liars. Actually, there have been times when I have been tempted to deny that I ever heard of the 7th Cavalry, much less participated with it in that engagement...My Medal of Honor and its inscription have served me as proof positive that I was at least in the vicinity at the time in question, otherwise I should be tempted to deny all knowledge of the event.|$|E
