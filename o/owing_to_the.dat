5|$|Annual {{rainfall}} is {{the third}} lowest of the capital cities (after Adelaide and Hobart) but is spread fairly evenly over the seasons, with late spring bringing the highest rainfall.

5|$|Babb {{worked in}} various {{areas of the}} {{entertainment}} industry, in both traditional and exploitation genres. He claimed to have made twenty films, and produced for television, radio, and even the stage. This is an incomplete collection of works <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nature of the exploitation genre. The titles are as they were finally presented by Babb, with earlier titles noted in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} filming, {{more than}} a million feet of {{negative}} had been used, necessitating significant editing.

5|$|Capitalization {{during this}} time was not standardized. It {{depended}} on the authors and their background. Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gothic or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible. This typeface was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin typeface (often antiqua).|$|E
5|$|Chromium is {{a member}} of Group 6, of the {{transition}} metals. Chromium(0) has an electronic configuration of 3d54s1, <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower energy of the high spin configuration. Chromium exhibits a wide range of oxidation states, with +3 the most stable; the +3 and +6 states are the most common in chromium compounds, while +1, +4 and +5 are rare.|$|E
5|$|Distance {{from the}} sea is another {{important}} geographic factor. <b>Owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shape of the country, the {{close proximity to the}} ocean means that most of the country, excluding the north is moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The two main currents that impact the climate of Argentina are the Brazil Current from the north and the Malvinas Current from the south (a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current). The Brazil Current transports warm subtropical waters southwards while the Malvinas Current transports cold, subantarctic waters northwards. The Malvinas Current cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the current is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period <b>owing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cold Malvinas Current. As well, it is the main factor in making Tierra del Fuego colder than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since it is influenced by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhich wrongs {{are done}} <b>to</b> company? <b>The</b> most {{important}} wrongs done <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company {{are probably the}} breach of duty of care and the breach of fiduciary duty. According to common law principles, a director owes a duty of care and a fiduciary duty <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company {{of which he is}} a director. <b>The</b> duties are <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company as a whole and not <b>to</b> individual shareholders. <b>The</b> meaning of this idea is nevertheless flexible. It has been recognised that a duty <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company is in effect <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corporators as a general body including the long-term interests of present members and the interests of future members. Under exceptional circumtancies, the duties of directors can be <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shareholders as distinct <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company. The fact that <b>the</b> duties are <b>owed</b> <b>to</b> company as a whole does not exclude <b>the</b> duty <b>to</b> take accounts of the interests of outsiders where to do so is {{in the best interests of}} the company.

Asunción del Paraguay rejected the Junta and swore loyalty to the Council of Regency. The Banda Oriental, under Francisco Javier de Elío, remained a royalist stronghold.|$|E
