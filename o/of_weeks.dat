5|$|Berkelium forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk metallocene complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene (Be(C5H5)2) at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period <b>of</b> <b>weeks).</b> One cyclopentadienyl ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield 2. The optical absorption spectra of this compound {{are very similar to}} those of (η5–C5H5)3Bk.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short {{libretto}} on commission from producer-conductor Carl Rosa, {{whose wife}} would {{have played the}} leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project. Not long afterwards, Richard D'Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's La Périchole. Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; Trial by Jury was composed and staged in a matter <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Meat ants play an {{important}} role in both the environment and for humans. A single nest is capable of dispersing over 300,000 plant seeds; moreover, meat ants have formed symbiotic relationships with many insects. This ant may be used as a form of pest control to kill the cane toad, an invasive species. They can also help farmers to remove animal carcases by consuming and reducing them to bones in a matter <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b> Despite this, meat ants are sometimes pests around urban areas and eradicating them is difficult.|$|E

5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen).

This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b> Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E

5|$|Permanent brachytherapy, {{also known}} as seed implantation, {{involves}} placing small LDR radioactive seeds or pellets (about {{the size of a}} grain of rice) in the tumour or treatment site and leaving them there permanently to gradually decay. Over a period <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> or months, the level of radiation emitted by the sources will decline to almost zero. The inactive seeds then remain in the treatment site with no lasting effect. Permanent brachytherapy is most commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer.|$|E
