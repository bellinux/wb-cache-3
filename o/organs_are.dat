5|$|Deterioration stage – Various <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> damaged due to {{long-term}} drinking. Medical treatment in a rehabilitation center will be required; otherwise, the pathological changes will cause death.|$|E
5|$|Paley {{considers}} the bilateral symmetry of animals, and how well-packaged all the delicate <b>organs</b> <b>are,</b> resulting in both beauty and utility.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they are}} {{sometimes}} included {{in the category of}} electronic organs, the majority of Hammond <b>organs</b> <b>are,</b> strictly speaking, electric or electromechanical rather than electronic organs, because the sound is produced by moving parts rather than electronic oscillators.|$|E
50|$|The Hook & Hastings <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> built {{some time}} ago. This Hook & Hastings <b>organ</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} only ones in the area. The <b>organ</b> <b>is</b> located in the main hall.|$|R
50|$|In 1843, a Bätz <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> installed. The <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} in 1985.|$|R
50|$|The War Memorial <b>Organ</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} {{based on}} plans {{drawn by the}} church's organist Harold Organ in 1915. <b>Organ</b> <b>was</b> killed in action in 1917 but the plans were continued by Cyril Church. The <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> built by Harrison and Harrison of Durham, and first used in 1921. The <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> restored {{and put in a}} new case in 2001.|$|R
5|$|Cytotoxic drugs {{inhibit the}} immune {{response}} by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> affected, which causes toxic side effects. Immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} cyclosporin prevent T cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways.|$|E
5|$|In the jawless fish (lampreys and hagfish), true lymphoid <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> absent. These fish rely on {{regions of}} lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are {{produced}} in the anterior kidney (or pronephros) and {{some areas of the}} gut (where granulocytes mature.) They resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish.|$|E
5|$|A {{primitive}} nervous system, without centralization, coordinates {{the processes}} involved in maintaining homeostasis, as well as biochemical and physical responses to various stimuli. There are two nerve nets, one in the epidermis {{and one in the}} gastrodermis; these unite at the pharynx, the junctions of the septa with the oral disc and the pedal disc, and across the mesogloea. No specialized sense <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> present but sensory cells include nematocytes and chemoreceptors.|$|E
50|$|Later, the <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> {{showing signs}} of {{unreliability}} and eventually was replaced in 1877. The new <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> again built by E. and G.G. Hook & Hastings of Boston. The older Hook <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> traded in {{as part of the}} payment towards the new organ, {{as well as some of}} the pipe work used in the new organ. The second Hook <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> larger, with 51 stops.|$|R
50|$|The {{first pipe}} <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} by T.C. Lewis in London {{and shipped to}} Nelson in 1871. The <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> then rebuilt in 1932. After 30 years of use the <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> overhauled and now consists of 2500 pipes. The <b>organ</b> <b>is</b> spread over three manuals and pedals and has a detached electric-action console situated on a gallery opposite the pipes in the chancel.|$|R
50|$|On {{the west}} balcony, a main <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} in 1963 by Detlef Kleuker with three manuals and 38 stops. In 2010, the <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> beyond repair and was sold. A new main <b>organ</b> <b>is</b> planned. A temporary movable organ serves in the church.|$|R
5|$|Alligator and {{crocodile}} farming began {{because of}} demand for their hides, but now nearly {{all parts of the}} animal are put to use. The side and belly skin make the best leather, the meat is eaten, the gall bladders are valued in East Asia, and the heads are sometimes made into ornaments. In traditional Chinese medicine, alligator meat is said to cure the common cold and prevent cancer, while various internal <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> believed to have medicinal properties.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} for such small animals, {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one {{on either side of}} the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> {{destroyed}} {{in a fire}} in 1946. A new <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> acquired from Tockington Manor in 1948 and was installed by Roger Yates. This <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> sold to St. Peter and St. Paul's Church, Shelford in 2003, when the church closed.|$|R
50|$|The first musical {{instrument}} {{in the church}} was a melodeon. After that, a reed <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> used until 1885 when the current <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> purchased from the Winona Congregational Church for $700. The <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> built in 1867 by the Steere and Turner Company. For many years the <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> pumped by hand. A complete record of the boys who pumped is carried in the initials carved during dull moments. Payment for this task was $6/year for many years, but was later raised to twenty-five cents per Sunday. The <b>organ</b> <b>is</b> {{believed to be the}} oldest pipe organ in Minnesota in regular use.|$|R
50|$|In 1695, an <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} in the cathedral. In the 19th century, the <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> restored and then renewed.|$|R
5|$|In mammals, sexual {{differentiation}} {{is determined}} by the sperm that carries either an X or a Y (male) chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a transcription factor for the protein tdf (testis determining factor) and triggers the creation of testosterone and Anti-Müllerian hormone for the embryo's development into a male. This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception. Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week, while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> fully developed by the sixteenth week.|$|E
5|$|In {{many animals}} {{of the deep}} sea, {{including}} several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below. In these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match {{the brightness of the}} background. These light <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal's light organ.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} what human <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> {{affected}} by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the bone tissues. Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous {{to the environment and}} humans. If radioactive contamination is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.|$|E
50|$|The two-manual <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> {{built by}} Young in 1899. The <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} by Roger Mallinson of Windermere in 2014/2015.|$|R
50|$|An <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> {{provided}} by Mr Ward of York in 1824 and improved {{by the same}} builder in 1845. A new <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> installed by Harrison and Harrison in 1914. A specification of the <b>organ</b> can <b>be</b> found on the National Pipe Organ Register. In 1952 this <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> transferred to St Stephen’s Church, Acomb, where it was subsequently destroyed by fire.|$|R
50|$|The pipe <b>organ</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the largest}} in Connecticut {{containing}} more than 8,000 pipes. The <b>organ</b> <b>is</b> designed by the Austin <b>Organ</b> Company, which <b>is</b> based in Hartford. It has four manuals and includes 137 ranks. The <b>organ</b> has <b>been</b> used for many concerts.|$|R
5|$|Like other amphibians, {{the life}} cycle of a frog {{normally}} starts in water with an egg that hatches into a limbless larva with gills, commonly known as a tadpole. After further growth, during which it develops limbs and lungs, the tadpole undergoes metamorphosis in which its appearance and internal <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> rearranged. After this it is able to leave the water as a miniature, air-breathing frog.|$|E
5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> known as tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea {{and almost all}} Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located {{on the underside of}} the metathorax, the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes breathe {{through two}} pairs of spiracles located ventrally on each segment near {{the base of the}} legs. Each opens into an {{internal}} pouch, and connects to a system of tracheae. The heart runs {{the entire length of the}} body, with an aorta stretching into the head. The excretory <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> {{two pairs of}} malpighian tubules, located near the mid-part of the gut. The digestive tract is a simple tube with two pairs of salivary glands to help digest the food.|$|E
50|$|An <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} in 1806 by John Avery. The current <b>organ</b> <b>is</b> largely built by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd. A specification of the <b>organ</b> can <b>be</b> {{found on the}} National Pipe Organ Register.|$|R
50|$|Details of the {{installation}} of the original <b>organ</b> <b>are</b> not known, but it was repaired at a cost of £45 by Hopkins of Heworth in 1884. A new <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> obtained in 1892 by Abbott & Co. A specification of the <b>organ</b> can <b>be</b> found on the National Pipe Organ Register. When the church was declared redundant, the <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> moved to St Thomas’ Church, Heigham, Norfolk.|$|R
50|$|The <b>organ</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} {{in a poor}} state of repair, although {{as a result of}} its neglect, the instrument is probably the last and largest example of a Harrison tubular-pneumatic action (most other large <b>organs</b> <b>were</b> converted to electro-pneumatic action after World War II). The <b>organ</b> <b>is</b> also unusual in that it is unaltered, as most comparable <b>organs</b> have <b>been</b> modified, added-to or revoiced.|$|R
5|$|Pipe <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> {{installed}} in churches, synagogues, concert halls, schools, other public buildings and in private properties. They {{are used in}} the performance of classical music, sacred music, secular music, and popular music. In the early 20th century, pipe organs were {{installed in}} theaters to accompany the screening of films during the silent movie era; in municipal auditoria, where orchestral transcriptions were popular; and in the homes of the wealthy. The beginning of the 21st century has seen a resurgence in installations in concert halls. The organ boasts a substantial repertoire, which spans over 500years.|$|E
5|$|Termites have a ten-segmented abdomen {{with two}} plates, the tergites and the sternites. The tenth {{abdominal}} segment has {{a pair of}} short cerci. There are ten tergites, of which nine are wide and one is elongated. The reproductive <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to those in}} cockroaches but are more simplified. For example, the intromittent organ is not present in male alates, and the sperm is either immotile or aflagellate. However, Mastotermitidae termites have multiflagellate sperm with limited motility. The genitals in females are also simplified. Unlike in other termites, Mastotermitidae females have an ovipositor, a feature strikingly similar to that in female cockroaches.|$|E
5|$|The main {{development}} of organ repertoire has progressed {{along with that}} of the organ itself, leading to distinctive national styles of composition. Because <b>organs</b> <b>are</b> commonly found in churches and synagogues, the organ repertoire includes a large amount of sacred music, which is accompanimental (choral anthems, congregational hymns, liturgical elements, etc.) as well as solo in nature (chorale preludes, hymn versets designed for alternatim use, etc.). The organ's secular repertoire includes preludes, fugues, sonatas, organ symphonies, suites, and transcriptions of orchestral works.|$|E
50|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>organ</b> <b>is</b> an <b>organ</b> that <b>is</b> self-playing, {{rather than}} {{played by a}} musician. For example, the Barrel <b>Organ</b> <b>is</b> activated either by a person turning a crank, or by clockwork driven by weights or springs.|$|R
50|$|During the {{restoration}} of the church, the <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> packed in a wooden case. The <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> last played in 1961. For half a century the <b>organ</b> could not <b>be</b> played nor seen.|$|R
50|$|A pipe <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} in 1841 by Booth. A specification of the <b>organ</b> can <b>be</b> {{found on the}} National Pipe Organ Register. When the church closed, the <b>organ</b> <b>was</b> moved to Queen’s Hall Methodist Mission in Wigan.|$|R
