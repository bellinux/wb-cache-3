40|$|Problem statement: Inefficient use of {{inorganic}} fertilizer such as urea {{is caused}} by substantial losses of ammonia when urea is surface-applied. Ammonia losses can be controlled by adding acidic material such as TSP, HA or FA. In order to reduce ammonia loss and retain soil exchangeable ammonium and available nitrate as well as producing <b>complete</b> <b>organic</b> based <b>fertilizer,</b> {{this study was conducted}} to compare the effects of urea-TSP-MOP, urea-TSP-MOP-HA, urea-TSP-MOP-FA, urea-TSP-MOP-acidified (HA + FA) mixtures on ammonia loss, soil pH, soil exchangeable ammonium and available nitrate accumulation compared to urea alone. Approach: The effects of urea amended with or without TSP, MOP, HA and FA were evaluated in a laboratory condition using a closed-dynamic air flow system. Ammonia loss, soil pH, soil exchangeable ammonium and available nitrate were determined using standard procedures. Results: Urea-TSP-MOP-HA, Urea-TSP-MOP, Urea-TSP-MOP-FA and Urea-TSP-MOP-Acidified (HA + FA) mixtures significantly reduces ammonia loss by 12. 92, 20. 12, 29. 54 up to 100 % compared to urea alone. The same observation was made for soil exchangeable ammonium. From all the treatments, only Urea-TSP-MOP-FA and Urea-TSP-MOP-Acidified (HA + FA) significantly retained soil available nitrate accumulation and the findings were consistent with pH found in the study. It must be stressed that results obtained in the incubation experiment using an acidic (pH water 6. 32) soil of Typic Paleudults (Bekenu series) might only be applicable to similar acid soils. Conclusion: Urea, TSP and MOP amended with HA or HA and FA significantly reduced ammonia loss.

In the second year, N rate was increased from 150 to 180 kg ha- 1, adding the existing extra nutrients in <b>complete</b> macro and <b>fertilizers</b> to other treatments and N split-application was increased up to four times. After harvesting, grain yield, NUE and NARF were measured. The results of first year revealed that the yield, NUE and NARF for T 2 (5145 kg ha- 1, 13. 8 kg kg- 1, 41. 2 %, respectively) and T 6 (5067 kg ha- 1, 13. 2 kg kg- 1, 38. 2. 2 %, respectively) were increased significantly at 1 % level. In the second year, the maximum grain yield (6335 kg ha- 1), NUE (16. 2 kg kg- 1) and NARF (50 %) were obtained again from T 6 treatment. Higher yield, NUE and NARF in the second year were mainly due to higher N rates and more N split applications.
