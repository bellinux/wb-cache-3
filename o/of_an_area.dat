The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is its conceptual models and related data for identifying appropriate performance measures <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area’s</b> infrastructure and using these measures, cognizant of their shortcomings, to estimate the value of this infrastructure in positioning the area for global competition. By focusing on the exports <b>of</b> <b>a</b> metropolitan <b>area’s</b> industries, we identify the sources and facilitators <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area’s</b> economic growth and development. These include the institutions of higher education for sharpening the area’s intellectual resources as inputs for producing the unique outputs of its productive resources, and the air transportation communication facilities and services for moving these outputs to their highest and most worthwhile uses. 1...|$|R

On the field maps, various skits between the characters can be viewed. They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. The battle screen is a 3D representation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area,</b> in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E

50|$|The {{percentage}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area's</b> footprint supported {{from its}} renewable resources shows its overall resource dependence within or above its areas' regeneration rate. A percentage over 100 percent indicates local overuse or net dependence on ecosystems elsewhere. Similarly, the percentage <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area’s</b> population supported from its renewable resources is its sustainable population at current consumption levels with current technology; the remaining percentage is its overshoot population.

5|$|A four-lane divided bypass of Urbana was {{constructed}} for MD 355 in the 2000s. The {{primary reason for}} constructing the bypass was to relieve traffic heading through the community {{brought on by the}} construction of numerous shopping centers in the area, and the costs for constructing the bypass were entirely paid for by the developers <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> shopping center. The proposal for the bypass called for two roundabouts to control traffic. The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. On October 30, 2008, construction began to build the connection of the bypass to MD 355 south of MD 80. The bypass was completed by January 2009, at which point MD355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD355 Bus. In 2013, maintenance of the bypass of MD355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state.|$|E

5|$|An upper-level trough and a {{decaying}} {{cold front}} persisted across the western Atlantic Ocean in early October. The {{interaction between the}} two {{led to the formation}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure on October 8 to the southwest of Bermuda. The system lacked a single well-defined circulation, though it possessed gale-force winds as it moved northwestward. The system gradually became better organized, and though there were no signs of tropical development on October 9, computer models suggested a subtropical storm could form. On October 10, a well-defined low-level circulation developed as a band of clouds formed in the northern portion of the system. Shortly thereafter, curved bands developed in the northwestern portion of the center, while the strongest winds associated with the storm occurred more than 115miles (185km) from the center. Based on the broad wind field and the cloud signature, it is estimated the system organized into Subtropical Storm Nicole on October 10 while located about 140miles (225km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|As Josephine {{continued}} east-northeastward, it had weakened {{back into}} a tropical storm. Under the influence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of high pressure {{to the north and}} a nearby area of low pressure, Josephine began executing a cyclonic loop to the north while approaching Atlantic Canada. During the cyclonic loop, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October18. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Josephine merged with a broad mid-latitude trough. The remnants of Josephine tracked southward and completed the cyclonic loop on October19. The system eventually curved to the east-northeastward and moved in that direction until it became unidentifiable on October21.|$|E

5|$|Banksia robur and B.oblongifolia hybrids {{have been}} {{recorded}} at several locations along the eastern coastline. Field workers for The Banksia Atlas recorded 20 populations between Wollongong and Pialba in central Queensland. Locales include Calga north of Sydney, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and Cordeaux Dam near Wollongong. A study <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of extensive hybridization between the two near Darkes Forest on the Woronora Plateau south of Sydney revealed extensive hybridisation in mixed species stands but almost none in pure stands of either species there. Genetic analysis showed generations of crossing and complex ancestry. Morphology generally correlated with genetic profile, but occasionally plants that resembled one parent had some degree of genetic hybridisation. Furthermore, {{there were a few}} plants with morphology suggestive of a third species, B.paludosa, in their parentage, and requiring further investigation. A possible hybrid between B.oblongifolia and B.integrifolia was recorded near Caloundra by Banksia Atlas volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Nancy (RSMC Nadi designation:09F, JTWC designation:18P) was {{the second}} {{in a series of}} four severe {{tropical}} cyclones to impact the Cook Islands during February 2005. Forming out <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure on February10, Nancy quickly organized into a small, but intense, cyclone. By February14, the storm explosively intensified into a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds peaking at 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935hPa (mbar). Over the following day, increasing wind shear rapidly weakened the cyclone and by February17, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly before being absorbed by Cyclone Olaf.|$|E

The system gradually intensified and was declared Tropical Storm Bonnie {{the next day}} as it moved generally towards the west-northwest. On June25, Bonnie was upgraded to a hurricane. Bonnie strengthened further and on the following day, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h).

Florence developed out <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure associated with a stalled frontal system located 1,150mi (1,850km) east-southeast of Bermuda in late October.

5|$|In 1872, the Sultanate of Sulu granted use <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> {{of land in}} the Sandakan Bay to William Frederick Schuck, {{a former}} agent of the German {{consular}} service who had lived on the Sulu island of Jolo since 1864. The arrival of German warship Nymph at the Sulu Sea in 1872 to investigate the Sulu-Spanish conflict made the Sultanate believe Schuck was connected with the German government. The Sultanate authorised Schuck to establish a trading port to monopolise the rattan trade in the northeast coast, where Schuck could operate freely, without the Spanish blockade. He continued this operation until this land also was ceded to Overbeck, with the Sultan receiving an annual payment of $5,000, by a treaty signed in 1878.|$|E
