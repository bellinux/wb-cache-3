500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>other</b> records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
500|$|Evanescence {{began their}} tour {{to promote the}} album with a concert at War Memorial Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, on August 17, 2011. This was {{followed}} by performances at Rock on the Range in Winnipeg on August 20, Rock in Rio on October 2 and at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in Puerto Rico on October 6. The band began the first US leg of their tour on October 10 in Oakland, California, and finished it in New York City. Evanescence then played several concerts in the United Kingdom, beginning at London's Hammersmith Apollo on November 4 and finishing the leg on November 13 at the O2 Academy Birmingham. Supported by The Pretty Reckless, Fair to Midland and Rival Sons, the tour's set list included songs from Evanescence's three albums. Lee said, [...] "We're definitely focusing mainly on the new material. We're really excited about that music the most – obviously it's the newest – but of course we'll be playing some from both <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>other</b> albums too. I guess I'd say in general, our show's on the heavy-energy side, so we'll be running around singing a lot of fast songs." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{casting process}} {{continued}} into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Clark Gregg. Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back. [...] "We {{have made the}} decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers," [...] stated Feige. [...] "Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>other</b> talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks." [...] In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it [...] "purposefully misleading" [...] and an [...] "inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be associated with only one character.|$|E

2500|$|Although it bore an {{unlikely}} title (picked {{up from a}} radio talk show), the jaunty single [...] "Life Is a Minestrone" [...] (1975) was another UK Top 10 placing, peaking at No.7. Their biggest success came with the dreamy [...] "I'm Not in Love", which gave the band their second UK No.1 in June 1975. The song also provided them with their first US chart success when the song reached No.2. A collaborative effort built around a title by Stewart, [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] is notable for its innovative production, especially its richly overdubbed choral backing. Godley stated:If I was to pick one track from everything we've done, [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] would be my favourite.

[...] Gunn also stated that he wanted to make sure [...] "Yondu's place in everything made sense" [...] in regards to his relationship to Quill and his father, and also revealed Quill's father would not be J'son as in the comics. Gunn [...] "was less confident [...] was going to buy in on Baby Groot than" [...] including Ego the Living Planet, since [...] "adult Groot was the most popular character from the first film and I didn't think they'd want to risk a good thing." [...] However, by changing Groot, Gunn felt it [...] "opened the film up" [...] creatively, allowing Gunn to bring out [...] "new aspects <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>other</b> characters." [...] Gunn said Thanos would only appear in the sequel [...] "if he helps our story and he will not show up at all if not. Thanos is not the most important thing in Guardians 2, that's for damn sure. There's the Guardians themselves and other threats the Guardians are going to be facing that are not Thanos." [...] Feige later confirmed that Thanos would not appear in the sequel, as he was being saved for a [...] "grander" [...] return. When asked about how the film would connect with the other Phase Three films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Gunn said, [...] "I don't feel beholden to that stuff at all.

2500|$|On July 19, 2002, Sierra {{announced}} {{the game was}} also being released for Game Boy Advance, developed by Saffire Corporation. Sierra also revealed the GBA version would feature more stealth and less combat than the GameCube version, and would follow {{the plot of the}} novel a little more closely. On February 24, 2003, they {{announced the}} game would also be released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows, with Inevitable Entertainment handling the PlayStation and Xbox versions, and The Fizz Factor developing the Windows version. Ken Embery, Sierra's executive producer on the game, stated [...] "the plan all along was to be multiplatform. But we were starting out with GameCube as the lead and were just holding our cards close to our chest before announcing all <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>other</b> titles. The PS2 is, of course, the most problematic of all the platforms for developers to deal with and {{we wanted to make sure}} that we had solid prototypes and running proof of concept versions before we made it public. Embery explained the art style of the game was influenced by the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda games, and in that sense, was aimed at a slightly younger audience than the Lord of the Rings films. Tory Skinner, of Vivendi Universal Games, further stated [...] "The Hobbit was written for a younger audience, so it made sense to create a game that would be enjoyable for younger kids, as well as adults. We looked at the different types of game we could do, and an action-adventure game with a heavy emphasis on the action seemed like the best way to go. We didn't want to make the game inaccessible by loading down gamers with hard-core RPG gameplay." ...|$|E
