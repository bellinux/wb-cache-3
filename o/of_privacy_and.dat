5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages <b>of</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach <b>of</b> <b>privacy,</b> <b>and</b> this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E
25|$|On March 10, 2006, WBC picketed {{the funeral}} of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew A. Snyder, who died in combat in Iraq on March 3, 2006.

On October 31, 2007, WBC, Fred Phelps and his two daughters, Shirley Phelps-Roper and Rebekah Phelps-Davis, were found liable for invasion <b>of</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> intentional infliction of emotional distress. A federal jury awarded Snyder's father $2.9 million in compensatory damages, then later added a decision to award $6 million in punitive damages for invasion <b>of</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> an additional $2 million for causing emotional distress (a total of $10.9 million).

40|$|The {{key point}} {{for the success of}} {{clouding}} computing technology in terms of application is whether such operation can produce the sense of trustworthiness to its users. Technical measurement has always been the fundamental preventive precaution, {{no matter what kind of}} aspect in dealing with producing the sense of trustworthiness.   Except technical measurement, there are two developing issues surrounding the central idea worth notice, which are the protection <b>of</b> information <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> the jurisdictional issue. The main purpose of this article is to focus on the issue <b>of</b> protecting information <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> jurisdictional problem through the newly developed cloud computing technology. This article will first introduce the characteristics of cloud computing technology in order to pave the way for further discussion. Then the issue <b>of</b> protecting information <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> jurisdictional problem will be discussed through disparity of legal protection <b>of</b> information <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> principles for asserting jurisdiction within Internet. The personal observation and suggestion will be made at the end of this article for a future possible adjustment of infrastructure for the protection <b>of</b> information <b>privacy</b> <b>and</b> jurisdictional decision within cyberspace in order to promote the sense of trustworthiness of the cloud computing technology user. </p...|$|R

40|$|The major {{challenges}} facing electronic commerce remain {{the lack of}} security, the lack <b>of</b> <b>privacy</b> protection, <b>and</b> the lack of trust depending on the <b>privacy</b> statement <b>of</b> the Website visited.

This article is a review <b>of</b> Internet <b>privacy</b> policies <b>and</b> trust seals of Chinese Websites in Taiwan. This study involves two phases. In the first phase, content analysis was performed on 422 Chinese Websites in Taiwan about the presence <b>and</b> scope <b>of</b> the <b>privacy</b> policy <b>and</b> trust seals. In the second phase, a quantitative survey was conducted to explore Internet users’ recognition <b>of</b> Internet <b>privacy</b> policies <b>and</b> trust seals, and to examine the influence <b>of</b> Internet <b>privacy</b> policies <b>and</b> trust seals on consumer online purchase decisions. The findings reveal that (1) 50 % of the Websites have provided Internet <b>privacy</b> policy statements, <b>and</b> 70 % of them have adopted Internet trust seals; (2) Internet users would trust a Website that {{has at least one}} trust seal, and suggest that the best place to show trust seals is on the Website’s homepage; and (3) the Internet <b>privacy</b> policies <b>and</b> trust seals would positively influence consumer online purchase decisions...|$|R
