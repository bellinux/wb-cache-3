These vertical bar patterns form the feature vector <b>of</b> a <b>document.</b> The pair-wise similarity <b>of</b> <b>document</b> images is measured by calculating the scalar product <b>of</b> two <b>document</b> feature vectors.

Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street.

Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E
