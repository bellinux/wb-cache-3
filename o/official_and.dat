40|$|The Finance Industry is an {{important}} aspect of the economy including banking, credit, securities and insurance activities. It offers many well-paying jobs, and is expected to see growth in the coming years. This report examines the Finance Industry with respect to the employment of women, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians and American Indians /Alaskan Natives. Of particular interest is the status of these groups in management positions. EEO- 1 data is utilized to examine the subsectors of the Finance Industry. • The percentage of women <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> managers is highest in the Banking/Credit subsector (48. 6 percent) and their lowest percentage is in the Securities subsector (33. 8 percent). The percentage of women <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> managers in each of the subsectors falls below the percentage of women employed as professionals, which might be considered a source for management jobs. • Similar disparities between the percentage of African American <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> managers and the percentage of African American professionals are also observed. Among the Financial Industry subsectors, the percentage of African American <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> managers is highest in the Banking/Credit subsector (7. 0 percent) and lowest in the Securities subsector (4. 4 percent). • The percentage of Hispanic <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> managers is highest in the Central Banking subsector (5. 1 percent) and lowest in the Securities subsector (2. 9 percent). In all subsectors, the percentage of Hispanic <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> managers is less that the percentage of Hispanic professionals. • The highest percentage of Asian <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> managers is in the Securities subsector (6. 4 percent) and the lowest percentage of Asian <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> managers is in Central Banking and Insurance (2. 8 percent). Like the other groups examined, the percentage of Asian <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> managers falls below the percentage of Asian professionals in each subsector. • Employment as <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> managers is examined in more detail for each of these groups by determining their chance of being <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> managers in contrast to professionals and sales workers. This shows that each subsector has a large portion of establishments where such chances are unfavorable to women, African Americans, Hispanics and Asians when compared to white males. Entry into management may be a particular concern for Asians. • While the relative chance of being an official or manager is better in the Securities subsector for each of the groups analyzed, the low proportion of women and African American professionals in this subsector may be partly responsible for these results...|$|R

While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and person involved, assuming his readers would have the same intimate knowledge of Florence as he did.|$|E
