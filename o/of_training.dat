In order {{to prove the}} effect of longitudinal profile shape <b>of</b> <b>train</b> head on aerodynamic performance, using CFD method, a two dimension model is developed to investigate outer flow field <b>of</b> high speed <b>train</b> head. Three types <b>of</b> <b>train</b> head profile schemes are calculated. The effects of longitudinal profile shape <b>of</b> high speed <b>train</b> head on aerodynamic performance are analyzed. The results show that different head profile curves cause different surface pressure distributions of body, different airflow velocities of outer flow field and different turbulent distributions. If the longitudinal profile shape <b>of</b> <b>train</b> head is spindle and streamline length <b>of</b> <b>train</b> head is 8 m, aerodynamic drag <b>of</b> the <b>train</b> will well reduce...|$|R
