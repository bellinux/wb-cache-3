25|$|Although Lewis {{originally}} conceived {{what would}} become The Chronicles of Narnia in 1939, he did not finish writing the first book The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe until 1949.

500|$|As {{scientific}} knowledge expanded {{quickly in the}} second half of the nineteenth century, the need for reorganizing the system of names used to describe North American birds grew commensurately. [...] For example, certain names assigned by William Bartram in his catalog of 1791 were now deemed unusable. [...] Robert Ridgway addressed this need with two publications in 1880 and 1881, while Elliott Coues published a competing checklist in 1882. [...] Ridgway and Coues, along with Joel Asaph Allen, William Brewster, and Henry W. Henshaw, came together as a committee on nomenclature and classification, serving the newly founded AOU, to reconcile the various systems and catalogs. [...] In 1886, the committee released The Code of Nomenclature and Check-List of North American Birds, both a consistent checklist and a set of rules for the naming of birds to be described in the future. [...] The Code settled the disagreement about capitalization of species names and established today's <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>presentation,</b> with waterbirds first and passerines last. [...] Several of the handbook's innovations were adopted by other branches of zoology, and were incorporated into the 1905 version of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at {{investigating}} the relationship between sex-role orientation, {{as defined by the}} BSRI, and heart-rate response to stress. After being administered both the BSRI and JAS, 35 female undergraduate volunteers were randomly assigned to one <b>of</b> two <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>presentation,</b> <b>of</b> moderately stressful verbal and spatial tasks. Heart-rate was measured throughout the experimental situation, and subjects rated each task for perceived pleasantness. A significant (p=. 032) interaction was found between masculinity and femininity, with the androgynous and undifferentiated groups showing lower heart-rate increases to both tasks. Neither the BSRI nor the JAS Type A scales were found to be significantly related with subjects' performance on either task, although a trend did emerge with higher masculinity scores being linked with somewhat better performance. Furthermore, masculinity was significantly associated with reports of greater perceived pleasantness for both tasks. While the Type A variable was positively correlated with masculinity, and negatively correlated with femininity, it did not account for any of the above relationships...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A field {{experiment}} explored {{the effect of}} feedback and goal-setting interventions on residential electricity use in households in Northern Ireland. Alternating <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> feedback and no feedback conditions were used to explore the longer-term effect of feedback on conservation performance. Group 1 received 5 months of feedback followed by 5 months of no feedback, Group 2 underwent 5 months of no feedback followed by 5 months of feedback, and Group 3 experienced alternating 2 -month periods of feedback and no feedback over 10 months, using a reversal design. Group 1 saved a mean 9. 54 % of electricity during the feedback condition, but Group 2 increased their use by a mean 14. 24 %. Group 3 showed a pattern of cumulative reductions over successive feedback periods, with a mean reduction in electricity use of 33 %. Participants in Group 3 did not show a return to baseline levels of electricity use during the no feedback condition. The importance of exploring different reactions to feedback is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a psychophysical {{experiment}} targeted at exploring relative distance discrimination thresholds with binaurally rendered virtual sound {{sources in the}} near field is described. Pairs of virtual sources are spatialized around 6 different spatial locations (2 directions × 3 reference distances) {{through a set of}} generic far-field Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) coupled with a near-field correction model proposed in the literature, known as DVF (Distance Variation Function). Individual discrimination thresholds for each spatial location and for each <b>of</b> the two <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> stimuli (approaching or receding) are calculated on 20 subjects through an adaptive procedure. Results show that thresholds are higher than those reported in the literature for real sound sources, and that approaching and receding stimuli behave differently. In particular, when the virtual source is close (< 25 cm) thresholds for the approaching condition are significantly lower compared to thresholds for the receding condition, while the opposite behaviour appears for greater distances (~ 1 m). We hypothesize such an asymmetric bias to be due to variations in the absolute stimulus level...|$|R
