5|$|Building on his progress, Champollion now {{began to}} study <b>other</b> <b>texts</b> in {{addition}} to the Rosetta stone, studying a series of much older inscriptions from Abu Simbel. During 1823, he succeeded in identifying the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches in these ancient texts. With the help of a new acquaintance the Duke de Blacas in 1824, Champollion finally published the Précis du système hiéroglyphique des anciens Égyptiens dedicated to and funded by King Louis XVIII. Here he presented the first correct translation of the hieroglyphs and the key to the Egyptian grammatical system.|$|E
5|$|He claimed similar phallic {{triplets}} {{for several}} <b>other</b> <b>texts.</b> However, {{in the majority}} of texts glyph 76 is not common, and Fischer proposed that these were a later, more developed stage of the script, where the creation chants had been abbreviated to X Y Z and omit the phallus. He concluded that 85% of the rongorongo corpus consisted of such creation chants, and that {{it was only a matter}} of time before rongorongo would be fully deciphered.|$|E

5|$|Many Puranas tell Krishna's {{life story}} or some {{highlights}} from it. Two Puranas, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana, contain {{the most elaborate}} telling of Krishna's story, but the life stories of Krishna in these and <b>other</b> <b>texts</b> vary, and contain significant inconsistencies. The Bhagavata Purana consists of twelve books subdivided into 332chapters, with a cumulative total of between 16,000 and 18,000 verses depending on the version. The tenth book of the text, which contains about 4,000 verses (~25%) and is dedicated to legends about Krishna, {{has been the most}} popular and widely studied part of this text.|$|E
5|$|Modular {{system of}} architecture, eight {{standard}} grades: Although <b>other</b> <b>texts</b> preceded it, {{such as the}} 'National Building Law' of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) which was partially preserved in <b>other</b> <b>texts,</b> the Yingzao Fashi published in 1103 by the Song Dynasty (960–1279) scholar-official Li Jie (1065–1110) is the oldest known Chinese architectural treatise that has survived fully intact. It contains descriptions and illustrations detailing the cai fen system (材份制) of eight standard dimensions for module components of timber architecture and structural carpentry. The eight standard grades of module timber components in the Yingzao Fashi, with grade I being the largest and grade VIII the smallest, {{were used to determine}} the ultimate proportions and scale of a building as a whole, as all timber hall types—palaces, mansions, ordinary houses, and pavilions—were hierarchically categorized along the lines of which cai fen grade was employed. For example, palace type buildings used only grades I through V, while mansion type buildings never used components larger than grade III and no less than grade VI. In this system of structural carpentry, the smallest grade of VIII is represented by one cai; one cai is equal to the modern equivalent of 15cm (5.9in), while one cai is also divided into fifteen fen (hence the title of this modular system).|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>texts</b> {{that include}} Krishna {{such as the}} Bhagavad Gita have {{attracted}} numerous bhasya (commentaries) in the Hindu traditions. Though {{only a part of}} the Hindu epic Mahabharata, it has functioned as an independent spiritual guide. It allegorically raises through Krishna and Arjuna the ethical and moral dilemmas of human life, then presents a spectrum of answers, weighing in on the ideological questions on human freedoms, choices, and responsibilities towards self and towards others. This Krishna dialogue has attracted numerous interpretations, from being a metaphor of inner human struggle teaching non-violence, to being a metaphor of outer human struggle teaching a rejection of quietism to persecution.|$|E

He is estimated to have lived in around the 8th century BCE, and is associated with several other major ancient texts in Sanskrit, namely the Shukla Yajurveda, the Shatapatha Brahmana, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Dharmasastra named Yājñavalkya Smṛti, Vriddha Yajnavalkya, and Brihad Yajnavalkya. He is also mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Puranas, {{as well as in}} ancient Jainism texts such as the Isibhasiyaim.

5|$|Hanging scroll: Hanging scrolls {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and <b>other</b> <b>texts</b> written on bamboo strips and silk banners in ancient China. The earliest hanging scrolls {{are related to}} and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the scrolls became well suited to the art styles of the artists, consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E
5|$|Ra's {{enemies are}} {{the forces of}} chaos, which {{threaten}} maat, the cosmic order that he creates. They include both humans who spread disorder and cosmic powers like Apep, the embodiment of chaos, whom Ra and the gods who accompany him in his barque are said to combat every night. The malevolent gaze of Apep's own Eye is a potent weapon against Ra, and Ra's Eye {{is one of the}} few powers that can counteract it. Some unclear passages in the Coffin Texts suggest that Apep was thought capable of injuring or stealing the Eye of Ra from its master during the combat. In <b>other</b> <b>texts,</b> the Eye's fiery breath assists in Apep's destruction. This apotropaic function of the Eye of Ra is another point of overlap with the Eye of Horus, which was similarly believed to ward off evil.|$|E

5|$|A legend narrates {{that the}} {{sacrificial}} cow Kamadhenu resided with sage Jamadagni. The earliest {{version of the}} legend, which appears in the epic Mahabharata, narrates that the thousand-armed Haihaya king, Kartavirya Arjuna, destroyed Jamadagni's hermitage and captured the calf of Kamadhenu. To retrieve the calf, Jamadagni's son Parashurama slew the king, whose sons in turn killed Jamadagni. Parashurama then destroyed the kshatriya ("warrior") race 21 times and his father is resurrected by divine grace. Similar accounts of the abduction of the celestial cow or her calf, the killing of Jamadagni by Kartavirya Arjuna, and the revenge of Parashurama resulting {{in the death of}} Kartavirya Arjuna, exist in <b>other</b> <b>texts.</b> The Bhagavata Purana mentions that the king abducted Kamadhenu as well as her calf and Parashurama defeated the king and returned the kine to his father. The Padma Purana mentions that when Kartavirya Arjuna tried to capture her, Kamadhenu, by her own power, defeated him and his army and flew off to heaven; the enraged king then killed Jamadagni.|$|E
