The present study deals with pharamcognostical evaluation of one such plant namely Kedrostis foetidissima(Jacq.) Cogn. called as Appakovai in Tamil. Methods: Pharmacognostic evaluationswere carried out by <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> anatomical studies and powder microscopy of leaves, roots and root tubers.

30|$|Again, this {{disagreement}} {{of sensory}} evaluation {{can be related}} to some borderline value in the chemical parameters. It {{is interesting to note that}} the only two samples, Ou 6 and Ou 8, judged EVOOs by the chemical analysis, with a slightly less FAEE content than the threshold value were classified as EVOOs or virgin olive oils by the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> A similar case is also represented by the sample Ou 1 which, through chemical analyses, was judged EVOO in three cases out of five with a borderline FAEE content, whereas, through <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> it was classified as EVOO, virgin olive oil or even lampante olive oil.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, all the {{obtained}} results seem {{to suggest}} that only in the case of olive oils with extremely “good” chemical analyses, including a low FAEE content (neither borderline nor higher than the threshold value), the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> can be reproducible.|$|E

30|$|ICB data {{included}} {{chemical analyses}} namely free acidity, peroxide index, spectrophotometric UV evaluation, fatty acid ethyl esters and stigmadiens content and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations</b> {{carried out by}} nine official International Olive Council labs according to EEC Regulation 2568 / 91.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a pilot {{analysis}} of data supplied by International Certificated Body, relative to 16 olive oils produced in the Mediterranean area, was carried out to verify reproducibility and consistency of chemical analyses and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations</b> and therefore to highlight possible problems relative to quality grade classification. ICB data, including chemical analyses and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations,</b> were produced by nine official IOC labs according to EEC Regulation 2568 / 91. The recent scandals involving Italian olive oils, {{such as the one}} revealed in the ‘New York Times’ [7], prompted us to include data from olive oils purchased not only in Italy, the largest consumer of EVOOs, but also in non-Mediterranean countries such as USA.|$|R

30|$|According to the {{official}} method (EEC Regulation 2568 / 91, Annex XII), in each IOC lab, <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations</b> were carried out {{by a group of}} 8 – 12 professional tasters trained to recognize, describe and quantify basic taste and odour properties. Olive oils were described through positive (“fruity”, “bitter” and “pungent”) and negative (for instance “rancid”, “fusty”, “musty” and “winey”) attributes.|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} the {{chemical}} analyses, except the {{fatty acid ethyl ester}} content, obtained from the nine labs were consistent giving rise to the same quality grade. In nearly all samples, the fatty acid ethyl ester content was close to the threshold established for extra virgin olive oils indicating a non-excellent quality of the olive oils. <b>Organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations,</b> commonly called panel test, given by the nine labs were not consistent.|$|R

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{preparation}} and assessment of physico-chemical, microbiological and organoleptic properties of pork nuggets was carried out using liquid whey {{as a replacement for}} added water at three different levels viz., 20, 30 and 40 %. Based on the physico-chemical and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> 20 % liquid whey as a water replacer was selected and shelf life studies was carried out. A significant (p< 0. 01) difference was evident in terms of pH, TBARS value, tyrosine value and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> during storage period. Also total viable count, staphylococcal count and yeast and mould count revealed a highly significant (p< 0. 01) difference during storage period. Further, the pork nuggets were well acceptable upto 14 days of storage at refrigerated temperature (4 ± 1 °C) by the panelists.

30|$|EEC Regulation 2568 / 91 [1] and International Olive Council (IOC) [2] have {{established}} both analytical and organoleptic criteria {{to define the}} quality grade of an olive oil. According {{to the results of}} chemical and sensory analyses, an olive oil can be classified as extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), virgin olive oil or lampante olive oil. Each category has a completely different commercial and nutritional value. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a natural fruit juice with peculiar nutritional, healthy [3] and sensory [4] qualities as well as it represents a fundamental component of Mediterranean diet which is very rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids [5] and polyphenols [6]. On the contrary, lampante olive oils have a distinctly unpleasant smell, are not edible and are used for the production of refined olive oils. It is well known that selling virgin olive oils or lampante olive oils as EVOOs is a fraud. However, another important aspect to consider is that the downgrading of an EVOO to a lower category implies a big economic loss for the producers. So, it is fundamental that both the chemical analyses and the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations</b> used to define quality grade are “sufficiently” objective and reproducible.|$|R
40|$|The study {{assessed}} the anatomical weight, proximate, mineral and in vitro digestibility compositions. The economic and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations</b> were conducted using standard methods. Protein and ash contents were high {{in all the}} samples, fat and fibre were low. Anatomical values showed that life weights of giant rat and grasscutter were the highest, 1161. 2 and 3164 g, respectively. The abundant mineral values (mg 100 g- 1 ) were K, Na, Ca and Mg having mean values of 529. 8, 622. 6, 477. 3 and 514. 5, respectively. The trace elements were present in amounts that could contribute to the RDA. The lead levels were low, {{but it would be}} advisable not to consume meats that are high in this element due to its carcinogenic effect. The digestibility values were between 59. 96 (pigeon bird) and 68. 25 % (giant rat). Biological Value (BV), Net Protein Utilization (NPU) and Net Protein Value (NPV) were high. Economically, the cheaper sources of protein were found to be bat, cattle egret and cuban boa. From the results, it was observed that nutritional qualities of the bush meats were comparable to conventional meats...|$|R
40|$|A {{technology}} of puffed-salted rice processing has been studied. Five rice varieties (IR 64, IR 42, IR 48, Cisadane and Gemar) were used. Salt solution was sprayed onto the rice prior to puffing, at level of 10 % of rice weight. Puffed salted rice {{were compared to}} puffed unsalted-rice. The results showed that either rice varieties or salting affected the puffed rice characteristics. Puffed rice of Gemar variety had the highest whiteness and volume expansion, and lowest hardness. Protein quality decreased in the puffed rice, indicated by decreasing in amino acids composition. Aromatics and S-amino acid were more susceptible to degradation during puffing than the others. Salt spraying before puffing resulted in puffed rice with lower whiteness and volume expansion, and higher water solubility and gel consistency. Salting also increased amino acids susceptibility to degradation during puffing. Salting, however, decreased {{in the ability to}} absorb water and increased hardness, therefore the treatment would keep puffed rice crispy for longer lime rather than puffed, unsalted-rice. <b>Organoleptics</b> <b>evaluation</b> also showed that puffed rice of Gemar variety had the high score of color, appearance, taste and crispiness, though poor in flavor. Rice salting decreased in the panelist acceptability of color and appearance, but increased in the crispiness, taste and flavor acceptability...|$|R

30|$|<b>Organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{carried out}} from the {{different}} labs were extremely controversial. For instance, all the olive oils were judged as EVOOs according {{to the results of}} the Sicilian lab, whereas no sample was judged as EVOO according to the results of the Greek lab. These results clearly show that the same olive oil can be judged EVOO, virgin olive oil or lampante olive oil according to the the lab. This is the case of samples Oi 2, Oi 3, Oi 4, Oi 5, whereas samples Oi 1, Oi 6, Oi 7, Oi 8 were judged virgin olive oils or EVOOs. Only sample Oi 6 was judged EVOO according to the results of all the labs except the Greek one. It {{is important to note that}} this olive oil has a FAEE concentration < 15  mg/kg well below the threshold of 35  mg/kg, whereas the other olive oils exhibit a FAEE content which is slightly less or higher than the threshold value. The strict connection between FAEE content and the positive attributes by <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of an olive oil has been previously reported [10, 14].|$|E
40|$|Many {{objective}} {{chemical tests}} {{have attempted to}} correlate with <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of oxidative rancidity. Major chemical tests used to detect oxidative rancidity of lipids measure nonvolatile high molecular weight carbonylic substances which make no considerable contribution to rancid flavors. High molecular weight carbonyls are present at much greater concentrations than volatile low molecular weight carbonyls. Peroxides and other unknown substances also react in these chemical tests to give at best an empirical evaluation. A 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone chemical test is proposed which corrected some deficiencies of earlier procedures, and was correlated with <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of rancid turkey samples. The proposed test measures oxidative rancidity in terms of milligrams of acetaldehyde per kilogram of sample. A comparison of the 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone method with a widely used chemical test was conducted. The thiobarbituric acid test was selected because it is used most often {{as an indicator of}} rancidity. The thiobarbituric acid test values increased followed by a definite leveling off as formation of malonaldehyde reached a maximum even though rancid flavor continued to increase. The 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone test measured a continuing increase of volatile aliphatic aldehydes as rancid flavor increased...|$|E

Methods: In pharmacognostic studies {{different types of}} evaluations were carried out that focus on microscopic, macroscopic, fluorescence analysis and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Results: The distinguishing characters of stem were the presence of parenchyma, cork cells, irregular shape calcium oxalate crystals, simple and compound starch granules and fusiform fibers with pits. Root microscopic characters were presence of simple and spherical starch granules with rounded or slit hilum, groups of lignified xylem fibers, reticulate vessels, and sieve tissues. Leaves microscopy indicated the presence of paracytic stomata, lignified fibers having pits, spiral and annular vessels, numerous sclereids while in fruit microscopy epicarp, thin walled cells endocarp, thin walled parenchyma and collenchyma of mesocarp and abundant thick walled endospermic cells containing aleurone grains and micro rosette crystals. Macroscopic study of leaves showed, 5 - 7 lobed reniform-shape, glabrous-surface, reticulate-venation in the leaves. Macroscopic features of roots showed type of root-taproot, surface-glabrous and stem was 1 - 10 dm tall simple to branched and may be prostrate or ascending. Similarly fruit was of schizocarp type.

Rheological (farinograph and extensograph) characteristics, staling, and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations</b> were performed on the dough and the resulting Taftoon bread. Statistical results showed that the salep gum at 5 % and Persian gum at 3 % (w/w flour basis) had a significant effect on the dough properties. Salep and Persian gums when each separately added increased and decreased dough water absorption, respectively. Both hydrocolloids increased the dough resistance to extension and decreased its extensibility. Persian gum shows dual nature in water absorption and some other baking properties. Textural studies revealed that addition of 5 % salep gum (w/w flour basis) reduced the bread crumb firmness and delayed the staling process of the Taftoon bread.

Combinations of lactococcal strains {{from various}} origins with divers {{properties}} were developed as new starters for new dairy products. Flavour formation by such tailor-made cultures was studied. In some cases, a strongly enhanced flavour was observed. For instance, {{the combination of}} B 1157 and SK 110 strains in milk resulted in a very strong chocolate-like flavour. B 1157 produces only a moderate chocolate-like flavour, whereas SK 110 alone fails to produce this flavour. Headspace gas chromatography results corroborate the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>evaluations.</b> High levels of branched-chain aldehydes were found when B 1157 and SK 110 were grown together. The enzyme activities involved in this pathway were studied; both strains contain transaminase activity. Although B 1157 had a very high amino acid decarboxylating activity, its release of amino acids from milk protein was limited. SK 110 was strongly limited in decarboxylating activity, although this strain is very active in proteolysis. By combining these strains, the substrates released by SK 110 can directly {{be used by the}} other strain, resulting in the completion of the whole flavour-formation pathway.

The present stduy was carried out in two stages. The first stage consists of preparing sausages with four different formulations in Isfahan Senobar Factory and producing canned sausage. In the second stage, physicochemical and organoleptic experiments were carried out. Canned (214409) and bottled (No. 10 - 67) sausages were produced and sterilized in autoclave (absolute pressure= 2 atm) to give F value = 4 min. Cans and jars were filled with skinless sausage of 22 calibre and brine (2 % and 25 oC) at a sausage/brine ratio of 1 : 1. Chemical composition such as moisture, fat and protein were measured according to the standard and AOAC methods. Physical experimets including measurement of texture shear strength were performed in sausage and canned sausage over the 3 -month storage period. Factorial experiments in completely randomized design was used to investigate and analyze statistical data in this study. The Duncan’s multiple range test was used to compare data averages.
