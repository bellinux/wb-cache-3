25|$|The Chindits were {{assigned}} {{the task of}} helping the forces of Joseph Stilwell push the Ledo Road through northern Burma to link up with the Burma Road and re-establish an overland supply route to China, by mounting a long range penetration operation behind the Japanese opposing his forces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Northern <b>Front.</b> It had originally been intended that the IV Corps would attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Central <b>Front</b> and cross <b>the</b> Chindwin to tie up Japanese forces which could otherwise be used to aid <b>the</b> Northern <b>Front.</b> As <b>the</b> Japanese launched their own attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Central <b>Front,</b> this advance did not meet its objectives, but it still meant that most Japanese forces were engaged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Central <b>Front</b> and were not available to reinforce the Japanese 18th Division <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Northern <b>Front.</b> <b>The</b> Japanese offensive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Central <b>Front</b> resulted in further proposals and refinements of {{the plans for the}} Chindits.|$|R

5|$|The single known tooth, a third upper molar (M3) {{known as}} T Li 41, is tiny, with {{a length of}} 1.29mm and width of 1.82mm. Mein and Ginsburg claim {{that it is the}} {{smallest}} known prosimian molar. The tooth is triangular in shape and shows a simple, reduced morphology. Three important cusps—the protocone, paracone, and metacone—are present, connected by a crest. They are low and rounded. The metacone, located {{at the back of the}} tooth, is closer to the protocone, which is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lingual corner (the side of the tongue), than it is to the paracone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> labial corner (the side of the cheeks). The protocone is rounded on the lingual side and is attached to a weak crest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and back. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> labial corner, a lengthy crest, the parastylar crest, is present, which includes a minor cusp known as a parastyle. Some wear is visible on the parastylar crest, and at the front of the tooth a contact facet with the preceding second upper molar is present. The tooth has a single, well-developed root, which contains a number of grooves, suggesting that it consists of three smaller, fused rootlets.|$|E
