500|$|The initial {{concept for}} the Model 27 {{was for the}} fighter to be carried half-exposed under the B-29, B-35 or B-36. The USAAF {{rejected}} this proposal, citing increased drag, and hence reduced range for the composite bomber-fighter configuration. On 19March1945, McDonnell's design team led by Herman D. Barkey, submitted a revised proposal, the extensively redesigned Model 27D. The smaller aircraft had an egg-shaped fuselage, three fork-shaped vertical stabilizers, horizontal stabilizers with a significant dihedral, and 37° swept-back folding wings {{to allow it to}} fit in the confines of a bomb bay. The diminutive aircraft measured [...] long; the folding wings spanned [...] Only a limited fuel supply of [...] was deemed necessary for the specified 30-minute combat endurance. A hook was installed along the aircraft's center of gravity; in flight, it retracted to lie flat in {{the upper part of the}} nose. The aircraft had an empty weight just short of [...] To save weight, the fighter had no landing gear. During the testing program, a fixed steel skid under the fuselage and spring-steel [...] "runners" [...] at the underside of the wingtips were installed in case of an emergency landing. Despite the cramped quarters, a pilot was provided with a cordite ejection seat, bail-out <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottle</b> and high-speed ribbon parachute. Four [...] machine guns in the nose made up the aircraft's armament.|$|E
2500|$|At times, Lyne's {{directing}} {{took its}} toll on the cast and crew. In a scene taking place in an office, the director pumped it full of smoke, an effect that [...] "makes the colors less contrasty, more muted". According to Biziou, [...] "The texture it gives helps differentiate and separate various density levels of darkness farther back in frame". The smoke was piped in for 18 to 20 {{hours a day and}} Gere remembers, [...] "Our throats were being blown out. We had a special doctor who was there almost all the time who was shooting people up with antibiotics for bronchial infections". Lane acquired an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottle</b> in order to survive the rigorous schedule.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Hoover began flying the North American P-51 Mustang at air shows around the country. The Hoover Mustang (N51RH) was {{purchased}} by North American Aviation from Dave Lindsay's Cavalier Aircraft Corp. in 1962. A second Mustang (N2251D), later named [...] "Ole Yeller", {{was purchased by}} North American Rockwell from Cavalier in 1971 to replace the earlier aircraft, which had been destroyed in a ground accident when an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottle</b> exploded after being overfilled. Hoover demonstrated the Mustang and later the Aero Commander at hundreds of air shows {{until his retirement in}} the 1990s. In 1997, Hoover sold [...] "Ole Yeller" [...] to his good friend John Bagley of Rexburg, Idaho. [...] "Ole Yeller" [...] still flies frequently and is based at the Legacy Flight Museum in Rexburg.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Masks for high-altitude climbers== Oxygen {{masks are}} used by climbers of high peaks such as Mt. Everest. Because of the severe cold and harsh {{conditions}} oxygen masks for use at extreme altitude must be robust and effective. The oxygen storage tanks used with the masks (called <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottles)</b> are made of lightweight, high-strength metals and are covered in high-strength fiber such as kevlar. These special <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottles</b> are filled with oxygen {{at a very high}} pressure which provides a longer time duration of oxygen for breathing than standard pressure <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottles.</b> These systems are generally only used above 7000 m.|$|R

5000|$|The south {{summit is}} a popular place for climbers to stop for various reasons, and to turn around if so decided. From this {{location}} the cornice traverse, Hillary step, and summit {{can be seen in}} clear weather and for a typical climber using <b>bottled</b> <b>oxygen</b> in the early 21st century, it is a favored spot to change <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottles.</b>|$|R
50|$|A typical HALO {{exercise}} {{will require}} a pre-breathing period (30-45 minutes) prior to jump where the jumper breathes 100% oxygen in order to flush nitrogen from their bloodstream. Also, a HALO jumper will employ an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottle</b> during the jump. Danger can come from medical conditions affecting the jumper. For example, cigarette smoking, {{alcohol and drug use}} (including histamine antagonists, sedatives, and analgesics), anemia, carbon monoxide, fatigue and anxiety can all lead to a jumper being more susceptible to hypoxia. In addition, problems with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottle</b> and during the changeover from the pre-breather to the <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottle</b> can result in the return of nitrogen to the jumper's bloodstream and, therefore, an increased likelihood of decompression sickness. Theoretically, a single breath of atmospheric air may elevate the jumper's arterial nitrogen level to dangerous levels. A jumper suffering from hypoxia may lose consciousness and therefore be unable to open his parachute. A jumper suffering from decompression sickness may die or become permanently disabled from nitrogen bubbles in the bloodstream, which causes inflammation of joints.|$|E
50|$|Smart married Nancy Childs, and {{had four}} children: Sally, Linda, Christine, and Hilary Samuel. By 1999, Smart had {{been relegated to}} a {{wheelchair}} and had to use an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottle.</b> He died on January 8, 2000 in his Weston home of natural causes, and was survived by his children and nine great-grandchildren.|$|E
50|$|Oxyliquit {{explosive}} {{was prepared}} ad hoc from sugar and liquid oxygen from an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottle</b> to blast {{a hole in}} a collapsed cave in Stanisław Lem's 1951 novel The Astronauts.

5|$|The Dornier had {{self-sealing}} {{fuel tanks}} to protect fuel {{stored in the}} wings and fuselage. This reduced the loss of fuel and risk of fire when hit in action, and often enabled the aircraft to return. Twenty <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottles</b> were provided for crew use during long flights above 3,660 m (12,000ft).|$|R
50|$|In September 1940, {{during the}} Battle of Britain, a German Junkers 88A-1 {{aircraft}} {{was shot down}} by the RAF over the school's lake, resulting in numerous fragments of the plane disappearing into Cadogan House as souvenirs.

50|$|As Rob helps Doug descend, a {{blizzard}} strikes {{the mountain and}} Doug's <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottle</b> runs out, causing him to suffer hypoxia. No extra bottles are stored on the route where Rob asked and he radios Helen to send someone up with oxygen. Doug, left alone briefly by Rob, semi-consciously unclips himself from the guide rope and walks unsteadily along the narrow path. He silently topples to his death a moment later.|$|E
50|$|Another {{variation}} on which studies are being focused is the wingpack, {{which consists of}} a strap-on rigid wing made of carbon fibre. It is a mix between a hang-glider and a wingsuit. The wingpack can reach a glide ratio of 6 and permits transportation of <b>oxygen</b> <b>bottles</b> and other material.|$|R
50|$|A more {{accurate}} {{depiction of a}} thermal lance in film is in the 1981 Michael Mann movie Thief, in which a real oxygen lance is used to cut a doorway through a real vault door.
