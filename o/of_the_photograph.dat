5|$|The oldest {{photograph}} on record in Denmark is credited to Peter Faber (1810–1877), a songwriter and {{a pioneer in}} telegraphy. His daguerreotype of Ulfeldts Plads is in the Copenhagen City Museum. The image of the square is in fact reversed left to right, as was normal for daguerreotypes unless a mirror was used together with the camera. Careful analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> suggests that it dates back to July 1840. The exposure time of about 15 minutes in sunlight explains why the only figure to be seen is a man sleeping {{at the foot of}} the Pillar of Shame towards the left of the picture.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{doubt about}} the {{identification}} of the photograph's subject. It was believed that Frederico Borrell García was the subject, but he was actually killed at Cerro Muriano, and was shot while sheltered behind a tree. In addition to a lack of clarity of the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> Frederico Borrell García did not greatly resemble the subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon {{publication}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> {{there were}} allegations from the Falange, an extreme nationalist political group in Spain, that the photograph was staged. However, outside of Spain, it remained unquestioned {{as a legitimate}} documentary photograph until the 1970s.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a new scheme to generate photograph slide show with incidental music based on <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> and music. Unlike existing photograph slide show software, which show <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> one by one (perhaps with some fancy transition effects) with music in the background, our algorithm utilizes content analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> and <b>the</b> incidental music. Firstly, low-quality photographs, such as blurred or under exposed, are filtered out by a photograph quality detector; and <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> are grouped into a three-layer construction, namely, day, scene, and group of similar photographs (GoS). Incidental music is segmented based on its beats, and then aligned with <b>photographs,</b> which makes <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> transitions occur at <b>the</b> beat position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music. Various transition effects and transformation effects are applied based on the structure and content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs.</b> According to different users' preferences, several editing styles are also supported in our algorithm. The experimental results are very impressive according to the user study...|$|R

30|$|For each question, the {{participant}} was instructed to select which <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> showed <b>the</b> woman who was the sexier, the more elegant, and so on for each dimension. Three responses were offered: A, B, or “no difference.” Two more questions were added, asking which <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> would be preferred by other individuals and which <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>the</b> participant would choose for a photo album. After responding, {{the participant}}s were asked what they thought <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study and the masked difference between <b>the</b> two <b>photographs</b> were. Only one man mentioned the shoe heels, and his data were not used in the analysis.|$|R
25|$|Spanish newspapers, {{including}} a newspaper from Barcelona, El Periódico de Catalunya, sent reporters to Espejo {{to verify the}} location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b> The reporters returned with photographs showing a close match between the present day skyline and the background of Capa's photographs.|$|E
25|$|Vishniac's {{photographs}} {{have had}} a profound effect on Holocaust literature and have illustrated many books about the Jewish ghettos and Holocaust. In the case of The Only Flowers of her Youth, the drama <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> inspired Miriam Nerlove to write a novel based on the story of the girl in the picture.|$|E
25|$|Susperregui {{also pointed}} out more contradictions in the {{accepted}} account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> noting that Capa mentioned in interviews that the militiaman {{had been killed by}} a burst of machine-gun fire rather than a sniper's bullet. Capa also gave different accounts of the vantage point and technique he used to obtain the photograph.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of the uprising, Governor Takeo Yamada was {{informed}} of the arson by the police.

It was transferred to the Shiroyama underground shelter, where he also went to command the prefectural officers.|$|E
25|$|Infringement of the {{copyright}} which subsists {{in a photograph}} can be performed through copying the photograph. This is because the owner of {{the copyright}} in the photograph has the exclusive right to copy the photograph. For there to be infringement of the copyright in a photograph, there must be copying of a substantial part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} month the U.S. stamp was issued, a print <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> with Lange's {{handwritten}} notes and signature sold in 1998 for $244,500 at Sotheby's New York. In November 2002, Dorothea Lange's personal print of Migrant Mother sold at Christie's New York for $141,500. In October 2005, an anonymous buyer paid $296,000 at Sotheby's for the 32 rediscovered Lange photos—nearly six times their pre-bid estimate.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{authenticity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> {{was called}} into question a day later. In particular, a number <b>of</b> specifics in <b>the</b> images, such as <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> rifles <b>the</b> soldiers in the pictures are carrying and <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> truck pictured did not match the equipment used by UK troops in Iraq.

25|$|If a {{photograph}} shows private property {{in such a}} manner that a viewer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> can identify the owner of the property, the ASMP (American Society of Media Photographers, Inc.) recommends that a property release should be used if the photograph is to be used for advertising and/or commercial purposes. According to the ASMP, a property release may be a requirement in such a situation.|$|E
25|$|The {{photograph}} of the sit-in participants in jackets and ties calmly but resolutely being escorted from the library by uniformed police has itself become a learning aid in Alexandria. Periodically, the city has commemorated the sit-in and {{used it as a}} teaching opportunity about the Jim Crow segregation era, with students from Samuel W. Tucker Elementary donning similar attire, acting out the sit-in events and posing in recreations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b>|$|E
25|$|Firstly, Mallory's {{daughter}} had {{always said that}} Mallory carried a photograph of his wife on his person {{with the intention of}} leaving it on the summit when he reached it, and no such photograph was found on the body.

This was followed by an appearance at the University of Michigan as part of the Penny W. Stamps lecture series.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{identity}} of the woman had been claimed, in its August 1980 issue, the editors of Life asked that the kissing sailor come forward. In the October 1980 issue, the editors reported that eleven men and three women had come forward claiming to be the subjects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b> Listed in the October 1980 issue as claiming to be the woman were Greta Friedman and Barbara Sokol as well as Edith Shain.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Eisenstaedt photograph, {{which is}} {{protected}} by copyright, this Navy photograph is {{in the public domain}} as it was produced by a federal government employee on official duty. While the angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> may be less interesting than that of Eisenstaedt's photo, it clearly shows the actual location of the iconic kiss occurring {{in the front of the}} Chemical Bank and Trust building, with the Walgreens pharmacy signage on the building façade visible in the background.|$|E

25|$|The {{medical orderly}} was {{originally}} believed, including by Moore-Jones, {{to be the}} Australian John Simpson Kirkpatrick, {{who served in the}} early stages of the Gallipoli Campaign before being killed by a sniper and who was well known for his use of donkeys to transport wounded soldiers from the front lines. However, by 1937 it became known that the man the subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> on which the painting was based on was not Simpson but Richard Alexander Henderson, a stretcher-bearer in the New Zealand Medical Corps.|$|E
25|$|In José Manuel Susperregui's 2009 book Sombras de la Fotografía ("Shadows of Photography"), {{he concludes}} that the {{photograph}} was not taken at Cerro Muriano, but at another location about 30 miles (48km) away. Susperregui determined the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> by examining the background of other photographs from the same sequence as the Falling Soldier, in which a range of mountains can be seen. He then e-mailed images to librarians and historians in towns near Córdoba, asking if they recognized the landscape, and received a positive response from the Spanish town of Espejo.|$|E
25|$|In the second, later, wheelpit, pictured here, {{the wheel}} itself {{was on the}} south side of the pit (on the right in this photograph). The short length of wall on the right is the end wall of the wheelpit. The {{mechanism}} operating the flatrod system was on the north side, aligned with the short section of wall visible further away on the left: this probably formed part of the first support for the flatrods, which are believed to have travelled underground until they reached a V-shaped gulley, just visible towards the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photograph.</b>|$|E
50|$|Over 800 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographs</b> are <b>of</b> {{locations}} in Wales.

Ridley meticulously recorded the subject and location in ink on the glass plates themselves - something which, unfortunately, he did not do with many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English <b>photographs,</b> presumably through familiarity.|$|R
