5|$|In {{between the}} birth of James and Reuben, Morris became {{severely}} ill. During his illness, a man named Gad Farnam moved into the Morris's home to care for him day and night. The two families became very close and Gad's daughter Rhoda, <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> {{old at the time}} of the illness, later became Morris's second wife. It was at this point in Morris's life that he accepted that he would never realize his early dream of becoming a minister.|$|E

50|$|On our own {{documentary}} Dying to do Letterman, {{there are}} two hooks. 1. A man chases his life-long dream of performing on the David Letterman show. 2. He learns he <b>only</b> has <b>five</b> <b>years</b> to live. Either hook on its own is really not enough to carry the film. Combined, they made for a much deeper movie: When a man learns he <b>only</b> has <b>five</b> <b>years</b> to live, he dedicates his life to living his dream of performing on Letterman.|$|R
5|$|The WCHL's {{short and}} {{unstable}} existence {{was a result}} of salary escalation caused by having three leagues competing for top talent. As a result, by the mid-1920s, hockey players were among the highest paid athletes in North America, with top players able to demand even higher salaries than the top baseball stars of the time. Though the WCHL lasted <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> the Tigers boasted five future Hockey Hall of Famers on their roster during that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{new company}} {{was unable to}} raise {{sufficient}} investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had been given <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> by Parliament to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was due to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received the Royal Assent for a revised and much cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O), this envisaged the extension being built to the same light specifications as the existing Tramway.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, in 1947, Anderson left Los Alamos and {{returned}} to teaching at Milwaukee-Downer College, but her involvement in atomic physics led to {{an interest in the}} health effects of radiation. In 1949, she left teaching to begin a career in health physics. At the Health Physics Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which was <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> old when she joined, she became the first chief of education and training. She spent her career helping to establish the new training program in health physics, teaching and advising graduate fellows in health physics from 1949.|$|E

The second eldest child is Rudy, Kell's son from her first marriage to a fox. Rudy, a talented artist, once challenged Kevin for the position of alpha male, unable to accept a rabbit {{as head of the}} household and as his stepfather. He has since matured and has {{come to terms with the}} marriage. The youngest child is Coney, a carnivorous rabbit and their only child by birth. Although <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> old, she is a capable hunter, though Kevin's mother, Dorothy, keeps trying to make her into an herbivore, as well having an artistic streak like her half-brother.|$|E
5|$|When he {{ascended to}} the throne, Pedro II was <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> old. Until he {{came of age}} and {{would be able to}} exert his {{constitutional}} powers, a regency was created. It proved to be weak and to have little effective authority, which led the nation into anarchy, ravaged by political faction struggles and countless rebellions. Exploited as a tool by rival political factions in pursuit of their own interests, Pedro II was manipulated into accepting an early elevation to majority status on 22 July 1840 at age 14, thus putting an end to nine years of chaotic regency rule.|$|E
5|$|When {{he moved}} to Salisbury, Allen met Thomas Young, a doctor living and {{practicing}} just across the provincial boundary in New York. The doctor, <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> older than Allen, taught the younger Allen {{a great deal about}} philosophy and political theory, while Allen was able to bring to Young his appreciation of nature and life on the frontier. Young and Allen eventually decided to collaborate on a book intended to be an attack on organized religion, as Young had convinced Allen to become a Deist. They worked on the manuscript until 1764, when Young moved away from the area, taking the manuscript with him.|$|E

5|$|As Steinhauer {{noted in}} his autobiography, the UK was a {{dangerous}} environment for a foreign agent. <b>Only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> previously, the country {{had not had a}} dedicated counter-espionage organisation. In 1909 a series of spy scares fanned by the press led to the establishment of the Secret Service Bureau, jointly headed by Captain Vernon Kell and Lieutenant-Commander Mansfield Cumming. They soon split their responsibilities; Kell took charge of counter-espionage, while Cumming focused on foreign intelligence. These two divisions of the Secret Service Bureau eventually became two independent intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6. The Bureau quickly identified a list of possible German agents in the UK. Just before the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, Chief Constables across Britain and Ireland were instructed to arrest suspects in their areas. This was done quickly and a number of German agents were caught, crippling German intelligence operations in the UK at a crucial moment in the war. Steinhauer himself had been lucky to escape arrest; he was known by name to the British authorities and he had been spying on the Royal Navy in Scotland as recently as late June 1914.|$|E
5|$|Eliab Harvey {{was born}} in Chigwell, Essex to William and Emma Harvey. His father William Harvey was a Member of Parliament for Essex, but died when Harvey was <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> old, in 1763. Until 1768, Harvey was raised at the family estate of Rolls Park in Chigwell, which had passed to his elder brother William {{on the death of}} their father. Harvey then {{attended}} Westminster School for two years before moving to Harrow School in 1770. At the age of thirteen in 1771, Harvey was entered onto the books of the naval schooner HMS Mary, although he did not actually serve aboard the ship. Utilising a standard legal fiction of the time, Harvey's name was entered on the ship's books without his actual presence, a ruse that would provide him with sufficient seniority to gain rapid promotion when he did enter the navy. In his summer holidays from school, Harvey served at sea, joining HMS Orpheus in 1773.|$|E
5|$|Henry II {{wanted to}} secure the {{southern}} borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais, the daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy. As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of Savoy, Piedmont, Maurienne, and the other possessions of Count Humbert. For his part in the potential marriage alliance, Henry II transferred the castles of Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau into John's name; as John was <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes. Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this; although {{he had yet to}} be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom, these were effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation. Alais made the trip over the Alps and joined Henry II's court, but she died before marrying John, which left the prince once again without an inheritance.|$|E

5|$|In 1654, <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> {{after its}} passage, the Act was repealed. Two years earlier the colony had been seized by Protestants {{following}} {{the execution of}} King Charles I of England and {{the outbreak of the}} English Civil War. In the early stages of that conflict, the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King. Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies, and two of them, the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett, took control of the colonial government in St. Mary's City in 1652. In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen, Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion. Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1657 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692.|$|E
5|$|Junction 28 of the M5 {{lies within}} the parish of Cullompton {{and a short}} {{distance}} from the town centre. Other major road links are the A373 to Honiton and the former A38 to Exeter which runs through the town, and is now the B3181. In 2001 61.6% of people living in Cullompton travelled to work by car or van and 83% of households had at least one car. In October 1969 a bypass was completed but after <b>only</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> this was upgraded to form part of the M5. Since this time traffic coming from the south of Cullompton to the M5 junction has had to pass through the centre of the town. There are now problems with air quality in the town and Mid Devon District Council have made the whole of the built up area in Cullompton an Air quality management area. Traffic on the exit slip road leaving the M5 northbound often backed up onto the motorway, so the Highways Agency and Devon County Council made junction improvements by widening roads, introducing traffic lights and reopening the left hand lane of the northbound slip road, at a cost of £1.3m. This cost was covered by businesses moving to Cullompton.|$|E
