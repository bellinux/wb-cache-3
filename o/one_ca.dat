50|$|Examining how {{certificate}} {{chains are}} built and validated, {{it is important}} to note that a concrete certificate can be part of very different certificate chains (all of them valid). This is because several CA certificates can be generated for the same subject and public key signing them with different private keys (from different CAs or different private keys from the same CA). So, although a single X.509 certificate can have only one issuer and <b>one</b> <b>CA</b> signature, it can be validly linked to more than one certificate building completely different certificate chains. This is crucial for cross-certification between PKIs and other applications.|$|E

5000|$|Phytoplasmas {{belong to}} the {{monophyletic}} order Acholeplasmatales. In 1992, the Subcommittee on the Taxonomy of Mollicutes proposed the use of [...] "Phytoplasma" [...] rather than [...] "MLO" [...] "for reference to the phytopathogenic mollicutes". [...] In 2004, the generic name phytoplasma was adopted and is currently of Ca. status (used for bacteria that cannot be cultured). Phytoplasma taxonomy is complicated because the organisms cannot be cultured; methods normally used to classify prokaryotes are thus not available. Phytoplasma taxonomic groups are based on differences in fragment sizes produced by restriction digests of 16S rRNA gene sequences (RFLPs) or by comparisons of DNA sequences from 16s/23s spacer regions. The actual number of taxonomic groups remains unclear; recent work on computer-simulated restriction digests of the 16Sr gene suggested up to 28 groups, whereas others have proposed fewer groups, but more subgroups. Each group includes at least <b>one</b> <b>Ca.</b> Phytoplasma species, characterized by distinctive biological, phytopathological, and genetic properties.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we {{proposed}} to study polymer-based thick-film resistors (TFRs) made of graphite particles dispersed in an epoxy matrix. Three main axes were investigated: • {{formulation of the}} composites, • characterization with the determination of electrical, mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of the material, • potential applications. Special care was first given to the formulation of the composite formed by an epoxy matrix in which graphite particles are dispersed, providing conductivity to the material. As application temperatures of a polymer is limited by its glass transition T g we used two epoxies: a standard Tg <b>one</b> (<b>ca.</b> 90 °C) and a high Tg <b>one</b> (<b>ca.</b> 200 °C). Particle size and shape eects were also investigated: synthetic graphite (ellipsoidal shape) and expanded graphite (worm-like shape) were taken as fillers.
