This allowed expansion into the 'Province of New Mexico' or Provincia de Nuevo México. In 1595, Don Juan de Oñate, son of <b>one</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> figures in the silver remining region of Zacatecas, received official permission from the viceroy to explore and conquer New Mexico. As was the pattern of such expeditions, the leader assumed the greatest risk but would reap the largest rewards, so that Oñate would become capitán general of New Mexico and {{had the authority to}} distribute rewards to those in the expedition. Oñate pioneered 'The Royal Road of the Interior Land' or El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro between Mexico City and the Tewa village of Ohkay Owingeh, or San Juan Pueblo. He also founded the Spanish settlement of San Gabriel de Yungue-Ouinge on the Rio Grande near the Native American Pueblo, located just north of the present day city of Española, New Mexico.|$|E

50|$|The {{evaluation}} of the primary sources has been cause for much disagreement in modern scholarship.

The key argument for a fabrication is that Darius had reason to invent the story since he had no particular rights to the throne.|$|E

In 1949 the club decided to add a third tier, adding also a lighting system. All of those works were completed in 1953; this third tier gave the stadium its enduring nickname: La Bombonera. Boca Juniors celebrated with a friendly match v. Croatian club HNK Hajduk Split, which ended 1-1.|$|E

50|$|<b>One</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> focuses of Sasisekharan's {{work has}} been on the {{conformation}} of biopolymers, with special emphasis on polynucleotides and polypeptides. The methods he has introduced for reaching the optimal levels of macromolecule conformations assisted him to propose a new model of DNA structure, known to be an alternative to the conventional double helical structure proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. The model proposed by Sasisekharan allowed the separation of polynucleotides without uncoiling them and was reported to have been a new solution. He has published his research findings as articles in peer-reviewed journals; PubMed, an online article repository has listed 89 of them while Microsoft Academic Search has listed 14 of his articles. He holds 5 US patents for his researches. His son, Ram Sasisekharan, is also a known biophysicist and a co-author of some of his publications.|$|E

5000|$|Some authors [...] {{claim that}} the general {{reaction}} to globalization among the Arab states has been a negative or a defensive <b>one.</b> <b>The</b> <b>key</b> reason for the rejection [...] may be the lack of previous cultural penetration of the Islamic Middle East by Western culture, institutions and ideas. In this context globalization {{was seen as a}} form of surrender to a dominant, non-indigenous standpoint. Islam, a religion governed by its own set of laws, developed an alternate world view with many of the elements of globalization contradicting it. It has a powerful and cohesive community which at times acts like a cultural defence wall [...] against the Western influence and, as a result, limits the use of European languages in the Middle East. The rejection of globalization also appeared due to the political systems that governed the Middle East. Mostly autocratic, the Middle Eastern regimes have learned how to survive and mobilize mass support against globalization. Repression and demagoguery were some of the tools used to convince the masses that anti-globalization was the only way of defending the Arab nation and Islam. People were thus discouraged from supporting elements of globalization like democracy, free enterprise, civil and human rights.|$|E
