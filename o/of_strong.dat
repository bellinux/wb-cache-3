5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance southwest of Manzanillo, Colima became a tropical depression on September 12 when its convection became persistent around a newly formed center of circulation.

5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} crossed Central America organized and {{developed into a}} tropical depression on June 27.

5|$|On October 8, a {{circulation}} {{associated with an}} area of disturbed weather acquired convection and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen-E.

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Keli (NPMOC/JTWC Designation: 38P) was {{the first}} {{recorded}} post-season tropical cyclone to form in June within the South Pacific Ocean.

It was designated as Tropical Cyclone Keli early the next day. Cyclone Keli intensified, slowly reaching its 10-minute peak wind speeds of 150km/h, (90mph), which made it a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. As it came under the influence <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> mid latitude westerlies and moved into an area <b>of</b> <b>strong</b> vertical wind shear, the cyclone started to weaken and was declared as extratropical on June 15.|$|E
