The nebular columns and solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry, with surface shaders applied to make {{the edges of the}} nebula glow. A particle render that ILM had devised for the earlier tornado film Twister was used to create a turbulent look within the nebula. Once the shots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Enterprise</b> had been captured, Turner inserted the ship into the computer-generated background and altered its position until the images matched up.|$|E
