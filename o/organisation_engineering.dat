40|$|Abstract. The Multi-agent Systems (MAS) area, while {{concerning}} heterogeneous {{and open}} systems, has evolved towards the specification of global constraints that agents {{are supposed to}} follow. A subset of these constraints are known as organisation of the MAS. This paper describes a software implementation, called S-Moise +, that tries {{to fill the gap}} between the organisational constraints and the agents autonomy. This software ensures that all agents will follow the organisation without requiring that they are developed in a specific language or architecture.

40|$|Engineering is {{believed}} {{to be one of the}} oldest professions and it is estimated that engineering existed 10 000 centuries B. C (Before Christ). Engineering plays an important role in making the environment safer, making daily lives more convenient and also contributes to countries’ economic developments. Engineering has advanced in such a way that it is difficult to survive without some kind of engineering these days. The same as engineering, knowledge management also dates back to biblical times just after creation. Knowledge management is not only applied in organisations, but also within communities, societies, and families. <b>Engineering</b> <b>organisations</b> rely the most on past discoveries and product information (knowledge) in order to solve engineering related problems. Due to globalisation of markets and products, shortage of skills and technological advancement, knowledge has become one of the main competitive factors of many <b>organisations.</b> Therefore <b>engineering</b> <b>organisations</b> need to have knowledge management strategies if they are to stay competitive. Different <b>engineering</b> <b>organisations</b> might have similar knowledge management strategies or different knowledge management strategies depending on organisational size, structure and culture and service offered or product offered. Against this background, this study sought to discover what knowledge management strategies are currently implemented in <b>engineering</b> <b>organisations</b> and recommend on strategies that can be implemented and how they can be implemented. The study is based on a review of literature on <b>engineering,</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>organisations,</b> knowledge and knowledge management and a structured questionnaire on knowledge management in <b>engineering</b> <b>organisations.</b> The population for the study was all <b>engineering</b> <b>organisation</b> employees and the <b>engineering</b> <b>organisations</b> in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa were sampled for the survey...|$|R

40|$|Design {{implications}} for OD&EE The explicit {{effort of the}} Organisation Design and Enterprise Engineering (O D&E E) journal to treat organisa- tion design and <b>organisation</b> <b>engineering</b> as complementary rather than competing approaches to organisational develop- ment, calls for a more nuanced take on the design theories, design practices, design methods and design concepts {{that are at the}} heart of a given discipline. This commentary on the editorial introduction by Rodrigo Magalhães and Hen- derik A. Proper focuses on the current design understanding in O D&E E, and judges it as too narrow in this context. The commentary shows how design as a concept needs to be broadened to contribute to this new emerging area of research and pactice in O D&E E...|$|E

40|$|This paper synthesises an {{overview}} of various models of the engineering design process with {{an overview}} of the most relevant theories within the field of creativity studies to conclude that (i) creativity plays a role throughout the engineering design process, and it is possible to incorporate creativity into the engineering design process in a systematic manner; (ii) doing so, at the very least, holds significant potential for economic benefit; and (iii) due to the complex interplay between creativity and the wide range of factors that influence it, organisational climates and management practices cannot simply be assumed to support creativity effectively. It is proposed that organisations be managed proactively to support creativity in engineering design. For this study, a structured literature search protocol was implemented to determine whether there is any evidence in the literature that <b>engineering</b> <b>organisations</b> are being managed proactively with this in mind; none was found. Two opportunities for future research are suggested based on these findings: (i) the development of a framework to guide the proactive management of <b>engineering</b> <b>organisations</b> to support creativity; and (ii) the development of mechanisms for measuring creativity in <b>engineering</b> <b>organisations</b> and <b>engineering</b> design...|$|R
40|$|MBA - WBSFor many <b>engineering</b> <b>organisations,</b> {{key skill}} retention, {{employee}} engagement and employee motivation {{form the basis}} of their strategy to remain competitive in the long run. In essence what these organisations strive for is to achieve a high level of organisational commitment. Under the current surge of engineering activities the global demand for qualified engineers has increased sharply and <b>engineering</b> <b>organisations</b> are increasingly facing problems in motivating and retaining their employees. This research has provided valuable understanding on how a global engineering company view the potential benefits of a long-term relationship with its employees and what structures are in place in order to create an environment where skills are retained within the organisation. The findings of this research indicated that employee turnover has a negative effect on a global <b>engineering</b> <b>organisation</b> mainly due to the loss of knowledge, training costs and the perceptions of instability it creates in the market place. The research also indicated that the employee turnover can impact positively on the running of the business as it allows for the inflow of employees with new ideas, experiences and specific skills and abilities The research has confirmed that the employees of an <b>engineering</b> <b>organisation</b> have specific characteristics and needs. These findings are then integrated into a model which highlights how a global <b>engineering</b> <b>organisation</b> deals with the knowledge worker’s needs through its retention strategies...|$|R
