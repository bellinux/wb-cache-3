The game follows a group of Digimon competing in a racing tournament within the Digital World, home to all Digimon. The purpose of the grand prix is to determine who is the best racer; thus, they use specially designed karts that equate all contestants in terms <b>of</b> <b>ability.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1960 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Derick Heathcoat-Amory, {{insisted on}} retiring. Macmillan agreed with Heathcoat-Amory {{that the best}} {{successor}} at the Treasury would be the current Foreign Secretary, Selwyn Lloyd. In terms <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> and experience the obvious candidate to take over from Lloyd at the Foreign Office was Home, but by 1960 there was an expectation that the Foreign Secretary would {{be a member of}} the House of Commons. The post had not been held by a peer since Lord Halifax in 1938–40; Eden had wished to appoint Salisbury in 1955, but concluded that it would be unacceptable to the Commons.|$|E

5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation. It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing a loss <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> {{to create new}} memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or in the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} considered using {{a similar}} procurement solution {{to that in}} Denmark, where the spectrum was licensed to private enterprise, and the agencies purchase services from private telecommunications companies, based on conventional GSM technology. However, in Denmark this had not led to the desired results, with only Metropolitan Copenhagen being covered. Instead, the Norwegian Government chose to establish a government agency to build and operate the network. Use of the GSM and NMT450 network was insufficient {{because of lack of}} capacity in the conventional network in case of larger amounts of communication, lack <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> of group conversations, lack of priority systems and long dial-up times.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{household}} {{included many}} young men <b>of</b> <b>ability,</b> including his successor Thomas Becket. Theobald {{was instrumental in the}} early spread of Roman law to England, inviting the Bologna-schooled jurist Vacarius to join his administration and advise on legal matters. Whether Vacarius actually started a school in Theobald's household is unclear, but in the 1140s he taught briefly at Oxford. Theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of canon law in England; the conflict that later arose between Henry II and Thomas Becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during Theobald's time in office. While still in Normandy, Theobald had made an intense study of ecclesiastical or canon law, which he continued after being elected archbishop.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy X-2 reintroduces the series' classic {{character}} class system (seen previously in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics) through {{the inclusion of}} dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can switch {{character class}}es, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere with the use <b>of</b> <b>Ability</b> Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and {{by the use of}} items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the Garment Grid they are wearing. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} <b>of</b> steganalysis, steganalysisproof <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> steganography {{is becoming more}} and more important. The evaluation for steganalysis-proof <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> steganographic algorithms can provide theoretical foundation and promote {{the development}} <b>of</b> steganalysis-proof <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> steganographic algorithms. This paper proposes an evaluation scheme for steganalysis-proof <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> steganographic algorithms. According to the intensity of steganalysis, this scheme classifies the steganalysis-proof <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> steganographic algorithms into three grades from weakness to strongness. The proof schemes to the three grades are given in this paper, which thus can be used to evidently prove the grade <b>of</b> steganalysis-proof <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> any steganographic algorithms. The evaluation scheme has a better performance of evaluating the steganalysis-proof <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> a steganographic algorithm, and can provide a quantitative evaluation criterion for steganalysis-proof <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> steganographic algorithms. 1...|$|R

Previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and/or income. Hazardous land uses (toxic storage and disposal facilities, manufacturing facilities, major roadways) tend to be located where property values and income levels are low. Low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of social vulnerability, including race, a lack <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> to influence regulation and a lack <b>of</b> <b>ability</b> to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution.
