5|$|Using Iraqi passports, Oan {{and three}} {{other members of the}} DRFLA arrived in London on 31 March 1980 and rented a flat in Earls Court. They claimed they had met by chance on the flight.

5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell you}} my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of <b>other</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E

25|$|High {{rates of}} sex {{work in the}} Tenderloin area has been {{associated}} with a high rate of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, especially among {{men who have sex with}} <b>other</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> those who also inject drugs.

25|$|In 1962, {{homosexual}} behaviour was decriminalised in Czechoslovakia, {{following a}} scientific research of Kurt Freund that included phallometry of homosexually oriented men {{who appeared to}} have given up sexual relations with <b>other</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> established heterosexual marriages. Freund {{came to the conclusion}} that homosexual orientation may not be changed. The claim that phallometry on men was the reason for decriminalization of homosexual behavior in Czechoslovakia is contradicted by the fact that it applied to women as well, as the notion of a male-specific fixity of sexual orientation as an argument for gay rights combined with the notion of female sexual plasticity is adverse to lesbian rights.|$|E

Chaney responded that he could not be London's father because he was impotent; he casually asserted that London's mother had relations with <b>other</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> averred that she had slandered him when she said he insisted on an abortion. Chaney concluded by saying that he was more to be pitied than London. London was devastated by his father's letter; in the months following, he quit school at Berkeley and went to the Klondike during the gold rush boom.|$|E

The two girls, Fawn Broadbent and Fawn Holm, soon found themselves in a highly publicized dispute over their freedom and custody. After the allegations against their parents were proven false, Flora helped them flee state custody together on February 15, and they ended up in Salt Lake City at Fawn Holm's brother Carl's house.|$|E

He worked for the McMahons as a barman. The women were Owen's wife Eliza, her daughter and her niece. At about 1:20 am, the gang used the sledgehammer to break down the door of the McMahon household.|$|E

At about 2 pm they put the anchor down near a group of six to eight huts. Two Aborigines, a younger and an older man, {{came down to the}} boat. They did not accept the offer of gifts from Cook, whose lack of knowledge of Aboriginal custom may have prevented him from behaving acceptably in such exchanges. A musket was fired over their heads, which wounded the older man slightly, and he ran towards the huts. He came back with <b>other</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> threw spears at Cook's men, although they did no harm. They were chased off after two more rounds were fired. The adults had left, but Cook found several Aboriginal children in the huts, and left some beads with them as a gesture of friendship.|$|E
