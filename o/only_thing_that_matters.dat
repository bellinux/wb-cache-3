500|$|With little land {{action in}} the west, the initial months of the war were dubbed the [...] "Bore War", later renamed the [...] "Phoney War" [...] by journalists. Chamberlain, in common with most Allied {{officials}} and generals, felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on Germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament. Chamberlain was reluctant {{to go too far}} in altering the British economy. The government submitted an emergency war budget about which Chamberlain stated, [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> is to win the war, though we may go bankrupt in the process". However, actual government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between September 1939 and March 1940. Despite these difficulties, Chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68% and almost 60% in April 1940.|$|E

2500|$|For a poet of his stature, Eliot {{produced}} {{a relatively small}} number of poems. He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H.

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1858, Li was reassigned to serve in Zeng Guofan's office, where {{he was in charge}} of {{drafting}} documents. Li led a carefree life, flouted rules and regulations, and often woke up late. Zeng Guofan once chided him, [...] "Shaoquan, now that you're working in my office, I only have this piece of advice for you: 'Commitment' is the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> to us here." [...] Li was shocked and he improved his behaviour after that. In the same year, Weng Tongshu (翁同書), the xunfu of Anhui, abandoned his post when he came under attack by the Taiping rebels. Zeng Guofan drew from Li's draft when he wrote a memorial to the imperial court to accuse Weng Tongshu of failing in his duty. The lines from Li's draft that were included in Zeng Guofan's actual memorial included: [...] "It is my duty, as Your Majesty's subject, [...] I do not dare to let this pass just because of Weng Tonghe's fame and prestige." [...] Although Li earned Zeng Guofan's praise for drafting the memorial, he also caused Weng Tonghe (Weng Tongshu's brother) to bear a grudge against him for what he wrote. While serving under Zeng Guofan, he was put in charge of Yanjianshao Circuit (延建邵道) in Fujian Province but did not take up his appointment and remained with Zeng.|$|E

Scalia said <b>that</b> the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>mattered</b> was <b>that</b> the vehicle was no longer in the immediate vicinity, and that balancing tests created confusion.

Adenauer was keen to see Britain join the European Coal and Steel Community as he believed the more free-market British would counterbalance the influence of the more dirigiste French, and to achieve that purpose he visited London in November 1951 to meet with Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Churchill said Britain would not join the European Coal and Steel Community because doing so would mean sacrificing relations with the U.S and Commonwealth.|$|R
