5|$|The section {{has been}} {{interpreted}} by Canadian writers, who have analyzed both its intention and its meaning. Because the section affirms the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Charter</b> and thus entrenches it in the Constitution Act, it came into focus in 1994 when a Member of Parliament (MP) proposed to change the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Charter.</b>|$|E

5|$|Article 33 of the BSAC {{charter of}} 1889 gave the British {{government}} {{the right to}} alter or repeal any of the administrative provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>charter</b> after 25 years.

5|$|Between the 13th and 15th centuries Magna Carta was {{reconfirmed}} 32 times {{according to}} Sir Edward Coke, and possibly {{as many as}} 45 times. Often the first item of parliamentary business was a public reading and reaffirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Charter,</b> and, {{as in the previous}} century, parliaments often exacted confirmation of it from the monarch. The Charter was confirmed in 1423 by King Henry VI.|$|E

5|$|Discussions on {{improving}} the UN's effectiveness and responsiveness to international security threats often include {{reform of the}} UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting {{the use of the}} veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Charter,</b> which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Braathens SAFE {{placed an}} order for three Boeing 737-200s, costing a total ofNOK100 million. They were {{intended}} to do the main haul <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>charter</b> market. There had been an internal struggle {{as to whether the}} company should purchase the Fokker F-28 Fellowship or the Boeing 737-100, a shorter version of the 737-200. Having a single plane type would give a single pool of pilot and mechanic certifications, and would have saved the company NOK millions in costs. Following the decision to purchase the F-28, Bjørn G. Braathen, son of Ludvig G. and later CEO, left the company.|$|E

5000|$|A passage {{mandates}} that copies shall be distributed in [...] "cathedral churches throughout our realm, there to remain, and shall be read before the people two {{times by the}} year", hence <b>the</b> permanent installation <b>of</b> a copy in Salisbury Cathedral.

5|$|In Hartford, the {{original}} alignment of US 5 entered {{the city on}} Maple Avenue and {{made its way to}} the Bulkeley Bridge via Main Street, Central Row, and Columbus Boulevard. The route was shifted slightly eastward to Wyllys Street and Columbus Boulevard by 1941. The opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Charter</b> Oak Bridge and Hartford Bypass on September 5,1942 led to US 5 bypassing downtown Hartford on its current alignment; U.S. Route 5A, an alternate route {{on the west side of}} the Connecticut River to Springfield, was extended south along Main Street to the beginning of the bypass.|$|E
5|$|In Multani v. Marguerite-Bourgeoys (Commission scolaire) (2006), {{the issue}} was whether a ban {{in a public school}} on Sikh {{students}} carrying kirpans (ceremonial daggers) for religious purposes was justifiable. Justice Louise Charron, who delivered the Court's majority opinion, applied the Oakes test to section 2(a) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Charter.</b> She held that the school could not discharge its burden of proving that prohibiting the kirpan was a reasonable limit on the student's constitutional freedom of religion.|$|E
5|$|In most countries, the {{protocol}} {{of the head}} of state comes before all others; however, in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence {{the protocol}} of its President comes before any other European, or national, protocol.

5|$|John's {{style of}} ruling, and his defeats in the Anglo-French War in 1214, had alienated {{many of his}} nobles.

The opposition magnates then invited Prince Louis of France to take the English throne, and Louis arrived in England with an army in May 1216.|$|E
