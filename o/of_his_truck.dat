Monk goes to Dr. Kroger's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard, to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to. In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered milk is made from lactose and drug dealers use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, and he probably also killed Teresa. Suddenly, Merrigan appears, ties them to chairs, and loads them into the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck.</b>|$|E

Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried {{to find a way to}} take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan.

Jason Autry, the state's key witness, testified to a series of events that was drastically different from Dylan's confession. He testified that he himself was not involved in the abduction, but that he went to Shayne Austin's home to buy drugs where he saw Zach, Dylan, and Shayne disposing of evidence from the crime. He said Zach had a body in the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck</b> wrapped up in a multi-colored blanket and Shayne was disposing of evidence in a burn barrel.|$|E

He immersed himself in work on the project and was present at the Trinity nuclear test. Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmful ultraviolet radiation. On witnessing the blast, Feynman ducked towards the floor <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck</b> because of the immense brightness of the explosion, where he saw a temporary [...] "purple splotch" [...] afterimage of the event.|$|E

Jones said he was in pain due to mistreatment by the HMO in whose care he had been placed. As was confirmed later, aside from being HIV-positive, Jones also suffered from cancer. During the call, he fired off several rounds from his shotgun, with one of them going through the roof <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck.</b> Authorities then closed the two freeways, preventing anyone from approaching him.
