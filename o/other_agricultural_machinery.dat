40|$|Tractors and <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> {{have been}} {{designed}} specifically for land preparation, tillage, and <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> operation’s tasks. Tractors are {{the primary source of}} power in farms and fields. Thus, to obtain the optimum output from them, proper management and utilization is needed. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> performance has been studied {{over the past three decades}} and optimum results have been obtained for different kinds of <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery.</b> In general, the evaluation of <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> using traditional methods is problematic as they are time consuming and labor intensive. Moreover, by using the common evaluation methods it is typically difficult to obtain accurate and instant results. Accurate measurements of field performance parameters are required for monitoring machinery performance and management decisions. Recently, the improvement in the electronics technology has made field operational management easier to monitor. Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus technology is being used as a communication system in tractors and allows connections between Electrical Control Units (ECU). CAN Bus technology broadcast unique electronic messages which contain continuously updated information about the engine, power train, equipment, power take off, hydraulic system, and other parts of the machines. To evaluate the performance of <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery,</b> there is no longer a need for myriad measurement instruments producing widely varying output to individually measuring fuel consumption for each speed, gear shift and the whole operation. As a result, this study was conducted to evaluate tractor performance by CAN Bus technology as a simple to use, easy to install, high speed data collection, and convenient to retrieve the stored data. These techniques allow for substantial saving of money and time, reducing our workload and eliminating training necessary for specialized measurement tools...|$|R

50|$|The {{enterprise}} {{was started}} by Robert Ransome (1753-1830), a brass and iron-founder in Norwich before moving to Ipswich in 1789 where he started casting ploughshares in a disused malting at St Margaret's Ditches in Ipswich, with capital of £200 and one employee. As {{a result of a}} mishap in his foundry, a broken mould caused molten metal to come into contact with cold metal, making the metal surface extremely hard - chilled casting - which he advertised as 'self sharpening' ploughs, and received patents for his discovery.In 1809 Robert Ransome made his eldest son, James Ransome (1782-1849), his partner and they called themselves Ransome & Son. In 1826 James's son known as Allen but technically James Allen Ransome (1806-1875) went to live at Yoxford, Suffolk, where he established a branch of the business. In 1839 Allen Ransome moved from Yoxford to Ipswich and under his direction the firm of J, R & A Ransome (James, Robert and Allen Ransome) was to assume huge proportions. After about 1841 the manufacture of ploughs and <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> was supplemented by production of portable, traction and other steam engines and thrashing machines.|$|E

50|$|The {{fortunes}} of the AWU ebbed and flowed in the subsequent years. The ten-month-long shearer's strike of 1956 was ended by a declaration of a State of Emergency by Labor Premier Vince Gair. While the proposed cuts to shearing rates were restored and the strike was generally seen as a victory for shearers, {{it was followed by}} a breakdown in the relationship between the AWU and the ALP, the expulsion of Gair from the ALP in April 1957 and his formation of the Queensland Labor Party. It later formed a coalition with the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). Ted Walsh became the deputy leader of the QLP following the split, but by 1960 ran as an independent. His strong personal local following saw him retain his Bundaberg seat until his retirement in 1969. At the same time the management of the Central Branch of the AWU in Bundaberg rested with district secretary Gerry Goding from 1942, who is credited in healing the rift between the ALP and the AWU in later years. Goding guided the union membership through the transition from a labour-intensive agrarian economy to an increasingly diverse one, particularly after increased mechanisation in the sugar industry, and the merger of mill operations. New ventures evolved, including the production of sugar harvesting and <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery,</b> which led to a decline in AWU memberships as the role of canecutters diminished. However, there has been a growth in employment by local government undertaking sewerage and water supply schemes. Workers employed in these industries, and those employed in hospitals, water supply and forestry were members of the AWU. The union was involved in a number of major industrial issues during the 1960s including the Mt Isa mines disputes of 1961 and 1964 and the 1967 Collinsville power station construction dispute, in which the AWU recruited the contractors employed as strike breakers. The Mt Isa and Collinsville disputes continued the union's somewhat controversial reputation at that time.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{analysed}} {{injuries in}} children caused by tractors and <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery.</b> Methods: Retrospective overview of health records of children admitted to hospital between 1 January, 2001, and 31 December, 2004. Results: We found 45 children, aged 7. 2 years on average (SD 2. 3, range 17 months – 14 years). There were 39 boys (87 %) and 6 (13 %) girls. The injuries {{were caused by}} tractor in 28 (62 %) children; the children {{were involved in the}} accidents as passengers on farming cart in 4 (10 %) cases, when moving around other farming vehicles in 8 (18 %) cases, and when moving around small farming machines or using farming tools in 5 (10 %) cases. There were 19 (42 %) light injuries, 20 (44 %) severe ones, and 6 (14 %) very severe injuries. Thirty-three (73 %) children sustained injuries of multiple body parts. Head injury was sustained by 23 (51 %) children. Average length of stay in the hospital was 8. 5 days, (SD 23, range 1 – 133). All the children survived the accident. Conclusions: Tractors and <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> are a possible source of severe injuries in children. In general, several parts of the body are injured simultaneously.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} sought to more {{fully understand the}} types and causative factors of injury/fatality incidents resulting from the rearward-movement of tractors and <b>other</b> self-propelled <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery,</b> with the view that such findings might lead to the development, improvement, and/or better utilization of safety procedures, design principles, and technologies that would prevent—or at least markedly reduce—their occurrence. Thus, {{the scope of this}} study focused only on rearward-travel (not mechanical malfunction) incidents, and principally on agricultural equipment (although cases involving similar equipment in industrial or construction settings were also drawn upon). Applying these two criteria, a search of published and online sources uncovered more than 100 documented cases, 35 of which could clearly be identified as rearward-movement incidents, of which 28 (80 %) were fatal. Each of these 35 cases were then assessed, based on the type of machine, type of worksite, and type/description of incident (i. e., ‘scenario’), which fell into one of three distinct categories or classifications—(1) co-worker run over/crushed/otherwise injured because operator loses visual contact with co-worker; (2) bystander run over/crushed/otherwise injured because operator is unaware of bystander’s presence; and (3) operator run over/crushed/otherwise injured because operator loses visual contact with, or is unaware of, a stationary object or a hazard. Then, from each scenario, a representative incident (i. e., case study) was selected for a more in-depth analysis. The collective findings, from these three case studies and all 35 machinery rearward-movement incidents, were as follows: (1) The ‘victim’ could be the machine operator as well as a co-worker or a bystander; (2) The specific site of the co-worker or bystander injury/fatality was {{at the base of the}} machine’s rear tires or tracks, at the hitching point, or behind a towed implement; (3) The specific cause was loss of visual contact between the operator and co-worker/bystander due to visual obstruction, the operator’s physical limitations, or the operator’s and/or bystander’s lack of alertness. To reduce the likelihood of future occurrences of <b>agricultural</b> <b>machinery</b> rearward travel-related incidents, preventive measures aimed at addressing the key causative factors for each scenario are offered...|$|R
