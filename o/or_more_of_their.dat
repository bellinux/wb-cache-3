5|$|Each {{class is}} managed {{by one of}} eleven {{academic}} departments. Nine departments will be experienced by students {{before the end of}} their senior year, as one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> classes are mandatory for graduation. The other two departments are specialized courses; one involves the Culinary Arts, while the other involves a precollegiate form of ROTC. This system of Professional Learning Communities was designed by Illinois's former Adlai E. Stevenson High School principal, Richard Du Four.|$|E
5|$|From the start, all {{subjects}} of the IB Diploma Programme were available in English and French, and it was mandatory for all students to study both a first and a second language. In 1974, bilingual diplomas were introduced that allowed students to take one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> humanities or science subjects in a language other than their first. The IB Diploma Programme subjects became available in Spanish in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Two Phillies {{have made}} 30% <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Phillies {{appearances}} as both pitchers and position players. In addition to Edgar Smith's batting notes above, he amassed a 15.43 ERA as a pitcher, striking out two. John Strike was hitless in seven plate appearances {{as a right}} fielder while amassing a 11 record as a pitcher.|$|E

50|$|The {{young males}} can be {{identified}} {{as soon as they}} display one (<b>or</b> <b>more)</b> pitch-black feathers <b>of</b> <b>their</b> neck rings and/or one (<b>or</b> <b>more)</b> pink feathers <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nape bands. Often, the young males develop their neck rings and nape bands in two or sometimes three successive moulting seasons. Adult parakeets with neither pitch-black feathers in their neck rings nor pink feathers in their nape bands are usually females.|$|R
5|$|Where possible, the University of Chicago {{attempted}} to re-employ workers {{who had been}} transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to other projects once their work had ended. Replacing staff was nearly impossible, as Groves had ordered a staffing freeze. The only division to grow between November 1944 and March 1945 was the health division; all the rest lost 20 percent <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> staff. From a peak of 2,008 staff on 1 July 1944, {{the number of people}} working at the Metallurgical Laboratory fell to 1,444 on 1 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Later in the war, the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act 1943 {{was passed}} {{to change the}} law to allow the {{transfer}} of Militia units to the AIF if 65 percent <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> personnel had volunteered for overseas service. Additionally, changes to the Act meant that Militia units were able to serve anywhere south of the Equator in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), excluding western Java and northern Borneo, {{and as a result of}} this, Militia units saw action against Japanese forces in the Dutch East Indies, at Merauke, later in the war. Despite this, the AIF remained the Australian Army's main combat force during the war and indeed more than 200,000 members of the Militia transferred to the AIF throughout the course of the conflict. Nevertheless, 32 Militia infantry battalions, later organised into three Militia divisions (3rd, 5th and 11th), saw service over much of the South West Pacific and participated in the following campaigns: Salamaua-Lae, Huon Peninsula, Finisterre Range, New Britain and Bougainville.|$|E
25|$|The {{much smaller}} males scamper from flower to flower {{in search of}} females and are often seen missing one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> legs. This may be due either to near misses by predators such as birds or to {{fighting}} with other males.|$|E

25|$|Intentional acts {{of cruelty}} {{can lead to}} {{multiple}} years behind bars. These acts (of intentional animal cruelty or non-accidental injury) may be indicators of serious psychological problems. According to the American Humane Association, 13% of intentional animal abuse cases involve domestic violence. As many as 71% of pet-owning women seeking shelter at safe houses have reported that their partner had threatened and/or actually hurt or killed one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> pets; 32% of these women reported that one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children had also hurt or killed pets. Battered women report that they are prevented from leaving their abusers because they fear {{what will happen to}} the animals in their absence. Animal abuse is sometimes used as a form of intimidation in domestic disputes.|$|E

25|$|The war {{mobilization}} dramatically expanded union membership, from 8.7 {{million in}} 1940 to over 14.3 million in 1945, about 36% {{of the work}} force. For the first time large numbers of women factory workers were enrolled. Both the AFL and CIO supported Roosevelt in 1940 and 1944, with 75% <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> votes, millions of dollars, {{and tens of thousands}} of precinct workers.|$|E
25|$|A 1985 {{government}} study classified 69.4 {{percent of}} the population as poor on the basis that they were unable to satisfy one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> basic needs in housing, sanitary services (water, sewage, and garbage collection), education, and employment. The defining standards for this study were very low; housing was considered substandard if it was constructed of discarded materials with dirt floors or if it was occupied by more than four persons per room.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, British {{director}} Mehdi Norowzian {{submitted a}} show reel containing {{a number of}} short examples of his work to several prospective employers, including the Irish advertising agency Arks Ltd., {{in the hopes of}} being taken on to direct one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> commercials. Included on the reel was a short piece entitled Joy, which was shot using a static camera on a London rooftop and comprised a jump cut sequence of a man performing an extended dance of exuberation against a plain canvas background.|$|E
50|$|The larva of Setabis lagus (Riodininae: Nymphidiini), is predatory. There are {{records of}} {{predation}} on larvae of Horiola species (family Membracidae) {{as well as}} scale insects (Coccidae). Predatory feeding {{has also been shown}} in Alesa amesis. A number of species associate and are protected by ants during one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> stages <b>of</b> <b>their</b> life cycle.|$|R
50|$|To claim {{tomahawk}} rights, {{the claimant}} typically deadened several trees near {{the head of}} a spring, then blazed the bark <b>of</b> one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> them with <b>their</b> initials or name.|$|R
50|$|Assyrians {{also may}} speak one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> {{languages}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> country <b>of</b> residence. Being stateless, Assyrians also {{learn the language}} or languages <b>of</b> <b>their</b> adopted country, usually Arabic, Armenian, Persian or Turkish. In northern Iraq and western Iran, Turkish and Kurdish are widely spoken. Also, due to their statelessness, Assyrians would have loanwords from the aforementioned languages.|$|R
25|$|By late-March, having {{achieved}} their initial aims with surprising speed and little loss, albeit against enemies ill-prepared to resist them, the Japanese paused {{to consider their}} next moves. Yamamoto and a few Japanese military leaders and officials waited, hoping that the United States or Great Britain would negotiate an armistice or a peace treaty to end the war. But when the British, {{as well as the}} Americans, expressed no interest in negotiating a ceasefire with Japan, Japanese thoughts turned to securing their newly seized territory and acquiring more with an eye to forcing one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> enemies out of the war.|$|E
25|$|Many Southern U.S. states {{historically}} had African Americans compose 35% <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> total population(s), {{with three}} of them (Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina) even having an African American majority at certain periods in their history. In contrast, the African American {{percentage of the total}} population {{in other parts of the}} U.S. (outside of the South) was historically almost always in the single digits (0.0% to 9.9%). Even after the Great Migration, no or almost no U.S. state outside of the Southern U.S. has ever had an African American percentage of its total population be greater than 16%.|$|E
25|$|It is {{commonly}} perceived that once women {{near the end}} of their reproductive years and enter menopause that this equates to the end of her sexual life. However, especially since women today are living one third <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives in a postmenopausal state, maintaining, if not improving, their quality of life, of which their sexuality can be a key determinant, is of importance. A recent study of sexual activities among women aged 40–69 revealed that 75% of women are sexually active at this age; this indicates that the sexual health and satisfaction of menopausal women are an aspect of sexual health and quality of life that is worthy of attention by health care professionals.|$|E

25|$|Maize {{reached the}} Southwest via an unknown route from Mexico. Its {{diffusion}} was relatively rapid. One {{theory is that}} the maize cultivation was carried northward from central Mexico by migrating farmers, most likely speakers of a Uto-Aztecan language. Another theory, more accepted among scholars, is that maize was diffused northward from group to group rather than migrants. The first cultivation of maize in the Southwest came during a climatic period when precipitation was relatively high. Although maize cultivation spread rapidly in the Southwest, the hunter-gatherers living in the region did not immediately adopt it as their primary source of nutrition, but rather integrated maize cultivation as one element, initially a minor element, in their foraging strategy. Hunter-gatherers usually exploit a broad spectrum of food sources to minimize risk in the event that one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> principal sources of food fails.|$|E
25|$|A {{consistent}} accession process {{occurred with}} every new Mamluk sultan. It {{more or less}} involved {{the election of a}} sultan by a counsel of emirs and mamluks (who would give him an oath of loyalty), the sultan's assumption of the monarchical title al-malik, a state-organized procession through Cairo at the head of which was the sultan, and the reading of the sultan's name in the khutbah (Friday prayer sermon). The process was not formalized and the electoral body was never defined, but typically consisted of the emirs and mamluks of whatever Mamluk faction held sway; usurpations of the throne by rival factions were relatively common. Despite the electoral nature of accession, dynastic succession was nonetheless a reality at times, particularly during the Bahri regime, where Baybars' sons Barakah and Solamish succeeded him, before Qalawun usurped the throne and was thereafter succeeded by four generations of direct descendants, with occasional interruptions. The frequency of hereditary rule was much less frequent during the Burji regime. Nonetheless, with rare exception, the Burji sultans were all linked to the regime's founder Barquq through blood or mamluk affiliation. The accession of blood relatives to the sultanate was often the result of the decision or indecision of senior Mamluk emirs or the will of the preceding sultan. The latter situation applied to the sultans Baybars, Qalawun, the latter's son, an-Nasir Muhammad and Barquq, who formally arranged for one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> sons to succeed them. More often than not, the sons of sultans were elected by the senior emirs with the ultimate intention that they serve as convenient figureheads presiding over an oligarchy of the emirs.|$|E
500|$|Two Phillies {{have made}} 30% <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Phillies {{appearances}} as both pitchers and position players.

50|$|Approximately {{one hundred}} {{performers}} representing typical regional characters, with costumes and props, (Calvin and his fellows reformers, different {{spirits of the}} lake, Laura Ashley with her bicycle, living statues, etc.), were sited within the framed view of the staircases' viewfinders. They all were specially trained to perform a choreography (by Serge Campardonhttp://www.compagnienomades.com) every 15 minutes.

50|$|Swansea {{city centre}} {{provides}} about 24,000 jobs, or about 18% {{of jobs in}} the wider urban area. This is a low figure when compared to many other UK cities, which often have around a quarter, a third <b>or</b> even <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> employment in the city centre. Retail, hotel and restaurant jobs are strongly represented in Swansea city centre, and there is a growing finance and business services sector, but much of the employment that would normally be found in a city centre has instead been located in outer areas of Swansea.|$|R
