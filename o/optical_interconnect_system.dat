This feature is utilized {{to accomplish a}} bit-interleaved <b>optical</b> <b>interconnect</b> <b>system.</b> In this system, each daughter board sends only one bit per round and the bit pulses from different boards can cascade in a designed series when the transmitters are distributed in an appropriate manner. In this way, even slow electronic chips can be coordinated to generate an aggregate bandwidth up to 10 Gbps, which is impossible to achieve with a multi-drop electrical bus. Besides the benefits of high data rate and low crosstalk, such a bit-interleaved architecture provides a secure data storage method.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} design of optical receivers and transmitters for VLSI chips. The receivers discussed here run at a moderate speed (100 's Mb/s) {{and they need to}} be relatively sensitive. However, unlike a traditional fiber communication receiver, a low power and area consumption are very important design considerations. The challenge in designing these receivers comes from satisfying simultaneously all the above requirements. The design of VLSI optical transmitters based on reflection-mode modulators is also discussed. Three optoelectronic technologies, namely FET-SEED, MQW diodes flip-chipped onto CMOS, and epitaxy-on-electronic designs were used to design arrays of transceivers. Current-Mode and buffering techniques are introduced into {{the design of}} VLSI-optoelectronic receivers. These techniques enable the integration with the receiver of larger and hence more alignable detectors. The design of a misalignment tolerant array of receivers is proposed and discussed. A time-differential receiver is introduced. It provides the good dynamic range of a dual-rail encoded receiver, but with only half the number of beams. In addition transmitters are optimized to drive large alignable modulators (reflection devices). For this purpose, BiCMOS drivers are also considered and discussed. Low-power adiabatic modulator drivers are proposed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} novel prototype <b>optical</b> <b>interconnect</b> <b>system</b> achieved by MEMS technology for stacked silicon dies. The overall approach {{is drawn from}} concepts on 3 D-TSV metal interconnect and introducing an optical interconnect. Optical interconnect is a promising solution for future global interconnect inside a chip package consisting of a stack of multiple dies. The design allows an optical beam to propagate both in plane and out-of-plane, hence establishing optical communication between stacked dies. The entire system includes a pair of 45 &# 61616; micromirrors with one in an upward-facing (front) position {{and the other in}} downward-facing (rear) position. Fiber grooves were fabricated on each dies for the purpose of optical testing. Passive alignment structures have been integrated in the system to achieve accurate horizontal alignment. The research work have also proposed a planar silica graded index lens integrated 3 D <b>optical</b> <b>interconnect</b> <b>system.</b> A pair of planar silica graded index lens is designed to sit in front of the 45 &# 61616; micromirror pair to mitigate the free space propagation loss. Optical beam free space spot sizes from these planar lenses are commensurate with the micromirror dimensions. To fabricate high quality ultra-smooth 45 &# 61616; micromirror on the (100) monocrystalline silicon surface by anisotropic wet etching, surfactant added TMAH etching behavior was first investigated. Non-ionic surfactants NCW- 601 A, Triton X- 100, NCW- 1002 with both high concentration (25 %) and low concentration (&# 61603; 10 %) TMAH solutions was extensively studied for their etching properties on (100) and (110) silicon surfaces. Etch rate, selectivity and surface roughness were studied. Etchant temperature was also varied from 60 &# 61616;C to 90 &# 61616;C to see the effects on etching behaviour. This research is the first reported use of a new surfactant NCW- 1002 in low concentration TMAH. Better selectivity and surface roughness of the (110) plane (i. e. micromirror surface) can be achieved with this surfactant added low concentration TMAH at 60 &# 61616;C. In view of the intrinsic partial isotropic etching behavior {{in the vicinity of the}} (100) plane for low concentration TMAH with high concentration surfactant, this work has established and demonstrated for the first time in published literature that only a limited portion of the micromirror is truly 45 &# 61616; and is located approximately at the middle of the slope. To reduce the top curved portion, two new techniques have been developed. One technique involves timed HF dip treatments during the etching process to remove the overhanging oxide, which has impeded the etching at the top part of the slope due to the diffusion-dependant effect. The other technique involves a maskless etching. The entire top curved slope can thus be straightened out. To avoid the bottom curved portion, another technique was developed to allow a deeper etch at the lower end of the micromirror to recess the non- 45 &# 61616; lower portion of the slope. Both these techniques can nearly double the size of the truly 45 &# 61616; portion of the micromirror. Based on the framework of a front upward-facing 45 &# 61616; micromirror, a processing technique was developed to fabricate a novel rear downward-facing 45 &# 61616; micromirror using electro-chemical TMAH release. With the assistance of passive alignment structures, optical test was conducted to confirm successful optical interconnect between stacked dies using optical fiber. The loss was measured to be 14. 7 dB, among which free space transmission loss is approximately 10 dB. To reduce the free space propagation loss, a pair of planar silica graded index lens integrated <b>optical</b> <b>interconnect</b> <b>system</b> was then proposed.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{need for}} higher bandwidth and density {{is one of}} the motivations for extensive research on planar optoelectronic structures on printed circuit board (PCB) substrates. Among these applications, optical interconnects have received considerable attention in the last decade. Several optical interconnect techniques, such as free space, guided wave, board level and fiber array interconnects, have been introduced for system level applications. In all planar optoelectronic systems, optical waveguides are crucial elements that facilitate signal routing. Low propagation loss, high reliability and manufacturability are among the requirements of polymer optical waveguides and polymer passive devices on PCB substrates for practical applications. Besides fabrication requirements, reliable characterization tools are needed to accurately and nondestructively measure important guiding properties, such as waveguide propagation loss. In three-dimensional (3 D) fully embedded board-level optical interconnects, another key challenge is to realize efficient optical coupling between in-plane waveguides and out-of-plane laser/detector devices. Driven by these motivations, the research presented in this thesis focuses on some fundamental studies of optical interconnects for PCB substrates, e. g., developing low-loss optical polymer waveguides with integrated efficient out-of-plane couplers for optical interconnects on printed circuit board substrates, as well as the demonstration of a novel free-space <b>optical</b> <b>interconnect</b> <b>system</b> by using a volume holographic thin film. Firstly, the theoretical and experimental investigations on the limitations of using mercury i-line ultraviolet (UV) proximity photolithography have been carried out, and the metallization techniques for fine copper line formation are explored. Then, a new type of low-loss polymer waveguides (i. e., capped waveguide) is demonstrated by using contact photolithography with considerable performance improvement over the conventional waveguides. To characterize the propagation properties of planar optical waveguides, a reliable, nondestructive, and real-time technique is presented based on accurately imaging the scattered light from the waveguide using a sensitive charge coupled device (CCD) camera that has a built-in integration functionality. To provide surface normal light coupling between waveguides and optoelectronic devices for optical interconnects, a simple method is presented here to integrate 45 ° total internal reflection micro-mirrors with polymer optical waveguides by an improved tilted beam photolithography (with the aid of de-ionized water) on PCBs. A new technique is developed for a thin layer of metal coating on the micro-mirrors to achieve higher reflection and coupling efficiency (i. e., above 90 %). The combination of the capped waveguide technique and the improved tilted UV exposure technique along with a hard reusable metal mask for metal deposition eliminates the usage of the traditional lift-off process, greatly simplifies the process, and reduces fabrication cost without sacrificing the coating quality. For the study of free-space optical interconnects, a simple system is presented by employing a single thin-film polymeric volume holographic element. One 2 -spherical-beam hologram is used to link each point light source with the corresponding photodetector.

40|$|Optical {{interconnects}} {{have been}} proposed for use in high-speed digital systems {{as a means of}} overcoming the performance limitations of electrical interconnects at length scales ranging from one millimeter to one hundred meters. To achieve this goal, an optoelectronic very large scale integration (OE-VLSI) technology is needed which closely couples large numbers of optoelectronic devices, such as light emitters and photodetectors, with complex electronics. This thesis has been concerned with the development of an optoelectronic integration technology known as Epitaxy-on-Electronics (EoE). EoE produces monolithic optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs) by combining conventional epitaxial growth and fabrication techniques with commercial GaAs VLSI electronics. Proceeding from previous feasibility demonstrations, the growth and fabrication practices underlying the EoE integration process have been extensively revised and extended. The effectiveness of the resulting process has been demonstrated by fabricating the first monolithic, VLSI-complexity OEICs featuring light-emitting diodes (LEDs). As part of a research foundry project, components of this type were designed and tested by a number of groups involved in <b>optical</b> <b>interconnect</b> <b>system</b> development. To further realize the potential of the EoE technology, and to make its capabilities accessible to a broader user community, the focus of this work was extended beyond the development of the integration process to encompass a study of high-speed photodetectors implemented in the GaAs VLSI process, to examine the role of the EoE technology within optical interconnect applications, to formulate an analytical framework for the design of digital optical interconnects, and to implement compact, low power laser driver and optical receiver circuitry needed to implement these interconnects. by Joseph F.

Compact models for vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and silicon carrier-injection/depletion ring modulators which include both non-linear electrical and optical dynamics are presented, and excellent matching between co-simulated and measured optical eye diagrams is achieved. Advanced modulation schemes, such as four-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM 4), are currently under consideration in both high-speed electrical and optical interconnect systems. How NRZ and PAM 4 modulation impacts the energy efficiency of an optical link architecture based on silicon photonic microring resonator modulators and drop filters is analyzed. Two ring modulator device structures are proposed for PAM 4 modulation, including a single-segment device driven with a multi-level PAM 4 transmitter and a two-segment device driven by two simple NRZ (MSB/LSB) transmitters. Modeling results show that the PAM 4 architectures achieve superior energy efficiency at higher data rates due to the relaxed circuit bandwidth. While RF photonics offer the promise of chip-scale opto-electrical systems with high levels of functionality, in order to avoid long and unsuccessful design cycles, efficient models that allow for co-simulation are necessary. In order to address this, an optical element modeling framework is proposed based on Verilog-A which allows for the co-simulation of optical elements with transistor-level circuits in a Cadence design environment.

At 20 nm scale and using a CMOS compatible process, Ge nanowire photodetectors could be integrated at the transistor level for interconnect applications. We have demonstrated a single 20 nm diameter Ge nanowire photodetector with current gain of more than 〖 10 〗^ 3 and responsivity of 25 A/W operating at 1. 55 um wavelength. Our device is based on the formation of an abrupt heterojunction between Ge nanowire and Si substrate. The device photocurrent is highly scalable based on the number of active nanowires connected in a parallel formation. We have also demonstrated a multilevel modulating device based on the integration of two memristors on a photonic crystal waveguide. Our device enabled the modulation of an optical channel by multiple electrical signals with distinct optical output for every combination of the modulating input signals. The device operation is based on the creation of optical extinction centers within the waveguide through the injection of silver clusters. By using a photonic crystal waveguide instead of traditional waveguide structure to build the device, we exploited the local resonances within the photonic crystal waveguide to tune the waveguide response and optical output characteristics of the device. The demonstrated device operates at the telecommunication wavelength of 1. 55 um and it is fabricated using CMOS compatible process...|$|E
40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>interconnect</b> {{is claimed}} to have signi¯cant {{advantages}} over electrical interconnect due to the superior physical properties of photon propagation over electron propagation. These advantages translate to the well-known fundamentally di®erent bandwidth/distance/cross-section relationships of <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> as compared to their electrical counterparts. Despite the validity of these basic results, too naive or straightforward an application of <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> in electrical <b>systems</b> may not bring about the expected performance gains. In fact, the scienti¯c literature contains several examples of proposed applications of <b>optical</b> <b>interconnect</b> where the real, quanti¯able bene¯ts are at best doubtful. Often, these examples are only intended to demonstrate the feasibility of a technological approach, not its great potential at the systems or application level. Typical °aws one encounters are (i) addressing the wrong problem: one tries to introduce <b>optical</b> <b>interconnect</b> at a location where the electrical interconnect is not the limiting factor; (ii) failing to realize the di®erences between interconnect and communications; and (iii) singling out one property of <b>optical</b> <b>interconnect,</b> while disregarding less bene¯cial properties such as latency, area, power dissipation or optical pathway cost. Capitalizing on the intrinsic potential of <b>optical</b> <b>interconnects</b> in electrical <b>systems</b> requires a holistic approach, that should address the real issues in future electronic systems. To assess the true bene¯ts of replacing an electrical <b>interconnect</b> by an <b>optical</b> one, {{it is imperative to}} take the systems context in which the interconnect is to be used into account. By means of examples taken from the computing area, we shall illustrate the profound impact of this context. We then propose a possible parameter space that is intended to capture part of the relevant context information at the link level, thus providing a badly required common domain of discourse for systems designers and optical component designers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Mixed-signal multidomain systems {{present a}} {{challenge}} for computer-aided design tools. Optical and electronic simulation tools are available as separate entities. However, to date, successful system-level cosimulation has not been implemented, leading to expensive refabrication. We present a unique system-level simulation tool for mixed electrooptical systems. We apply our tool Chatoyant to the simulation of an <b>optical</b> high-speed free-space <b>interconnect</b> <b>system</b> designed for 10 -GHz speeds. The 10 G free-space <b>optical</b> <b>interconnect</b> module has <b>optical,</b> optoelectronic, and microwave components and thus is an ideal vehicle {{to use as a}} test system. We demonstrate how Chatoyant, a mixed-signal multidomain simulator, has been used to evaluate end-to-end performance of this complex system, including the exploration of design tradeoffs and mechanical tolerancing.

30|$|To solve real {{optimization}} {{problems such}} as in industrial and manufacturing applications, the problem should be formulated as a theoretical problem. In 1974, Gonzalez and Sahni (1976) had introduced {{one of the most}} known complex combinatorial problem called the open shop scheduling problem (OSSP). There are several real-world applications of the OSSP, such as system-on-a-chip testing (Iyengar and Chakrabarty 2002), the area of satellite-switched time-division multiple access (Dell’Amico and Martello 1996), routing packets (Suel 1995), the scheduling and wavelength assignment problem in optical networks that are based on the wavelength-division-multiplexing technology (Bampis and Rouskas 2002), routing in <b>optical</b> transpose <b>interconnect</b> <b>system</b> (Lucas 2010), in routing in heterogeneous networks to model communications schedules (Bhat et al. 2000).|$|R
