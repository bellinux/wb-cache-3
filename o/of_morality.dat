5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic {{typically}} envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence {{are seen as}} intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. She looks at the internal source <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code <b>of</b> <b>morality.</b> For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects <b>of</b> <b>morality.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>moralities</b> <b>of</b> {{reason and}} desire are both {{vulnerable}} to serious objections. The <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> desire is deficient {{because it is}} incapable of passing from description to evaluation of conduct, and thus is unable to lay down standards of justification. Furthermore, the life to which <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> desire points is inadequate; contentment is elusive without any criteria to judge and order the ends <b>of</b> conduct. The <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> reason is inadequate, first, due to the inadequacy of reason {{to serve as a}} foundation for any moral judgments and, second, because the moral life as conceived by the moralist of reason is inadequate.The respective inadequacies <b>of</b> <b>moralities</b> <b>of</b> desire and reason generate an antinomy. If <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> desire abandons us to our random and changing appetites, <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> reason suppresses our existence as subjective beings with individual ends. The root of this antinomy of reason and desire is the separation between understanding and evaluation in liberal doctrine.|$|R

5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} {{of capitalism and}} discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, {{as he saw it}} as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal).

5|$|During his {{university}} {{studies at the}} École, Durkheim was influenced by two neo-Kantian scholars, Charles Bernard Renouvier and Émile Boutroux.

5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence <b>of</b> <b>morality.</b> However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E

5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that {{what ought to}} be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible. He also argues that alternative conceptions <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.|$|E
5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from morality is {{the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two chapters. In the first chapter, I analyze Michael Walzer’s account of the moral {{legitimacy}} of states. In the second chapter, I analyze his account <b>of</b> the <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> killing in war. I begin the first chapter by contrasting Walzer’s account of state legitimacy and humanitarian intervention with that of David Luban. Next, I develop a Rawlsian account of state legitimacy and humanitarian intervention and argue that this account is more plausible than both Walzer’s and Luban’s accounts. The second chapter {{is divided into}} two parts. In the first part, I argue that Walzer’s account of the distinction between combatants and noncombatants is misleading because it gives the impression that all and only infantry soldiers are combatants and that all and only civilians are noncombatants. In {{the second part of the}} second chapter, I describe an account <b>of</b> the <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> killing in war developed by Jeff McMahan that is based on an analogy with the <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> killing in domestic society and argue that this account is more plausible than Walzer’s account <b>of</b> the <b>morality</b> <b>of</b> killing in war.
