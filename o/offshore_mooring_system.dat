The oceanographic measurement networks {{play a key}} role both for satellite data calibration and mathematical models validation and feeding as well as to support the early warning systems for environmental pollution control and prevention. The high costs of <b>offshore</b> <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> and traditional oceanographic cruises have suggested the use of VOS (Voluntary Observing Ships) to obtain affordable data.

40|$|As {{the main}} source of {{resonant}} excitations to most <b>offshore</b> <b>moored</b> <b>systems</b> like floating LNG terminals, the low-frequency wave loading is the critical input to motion simulations which are important for the design. Further to the analysis presented by Chen & Duan (2007) on the quadratic transfer function (QTF) of low-frequency wave loading, new developments including numerical results of different components of QTF are presented here. Furthermore, the time-series reconstruction of excitation loads in the motion simulation of <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> is analyzed and a new efficient and accurate scheme is demonstrated. 1. Formulations of QTF and its approximations The quadratic transfer function (QTF) of low-frequency wave loads F(ω 1, ω 2) is composed of two distinct parts: one dependent only on the quadratic products of first-order wave fields and another contributed by the second-order incoming and diffraction potentials. F(ω 1, ω 2) = Fq(ω 1, ω 2) + Fp(ω 1, ω 2) (1) Since the application of low-frequency QTF concerns generally the computation of excitation loading to a <b>moored</b> <b>system</b> whose resonant frequencies are often less than 0. 05 rad/s while wave frequencies ω are generally larger than 0. 30 rad/s, the dynamic behavior of <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> is sensitive only to the low-frequency QTF at small values of (ω 1 −ω 2). In Chen & Duan (2007), it is denoted that ∆ω = ω 1 −ω 2 and ω = (ω 1 +ω 2) / 2 then (ω 1, ω 2) = (ω+∆ω/ 2, ω−∆ω/ 2) (2) By assuming ∆ω ≪ 1, the quadratic transfer function (QTF) is developed as an expansion: F(ω 1, ω 2) = F 0 (ω, ω) + ∆ωF 1 (ω, ω) +O[(∆ω) 2] (3) with the zeroth-order term contributed by the quadratic products of first-order wave fields and formulated...|$|R

40|$|This study proposes {{new methods}} for the reliability-based design of {{structural}} systems, {{with emphasis on}} <b>offshore</b> <b>mooring</b> <b>systems.</b> After a brief introduction to the <b>mooring</b> <b>systems,</b> two main objectives are discussed in this dissertation. The first objective is the calculation of the probability of failure of a structural system, which is an important input for a reliability-based design or any quantitative risk assessment. Two different methods are proposed for calculation of the probability of failure: a method based on the Monte Carlo simulations and a method based on the basic rules of probability, which is called the Progressive Reliability Method (PRM). Both methods are flexible {{to the definition of}} system failure. For example, the probability of a serviceability or ultimate-strength failure can be assessed using any of the two methods. It is shown that the two methods produce similar results, but PRM is preferred because it is exact and usually faster to implement. The second main objective in this dissertation is to develop a method for the optimization of the design of a structural system, given a target probability of failure. In this method, using the structural analysis of a preliminary design, the ratio of the optimal to the preliminary mean capacity of each component, which is called the Optimality Factor, is determined. Two design strategies are considered. First, an optimal design is intended to achieve the maximum system integrity. System integrity is defined as the balanced contribution of system components to its reliability. To quantify the system integrity, the Integrity Index is defined, and its calculation for various systems is discussed. Second, a designated failure scenario is considered, where some components serve as a fuse to protect some other components. This design strategy is especially applicable to <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> with drag anchor foundations because normally, if a drag anchor is pulled out from the seabed, it can cause significant damages to nearby subsea facilities. Using the rules of probability, a method is then developed to calculate the optimality factor of each component...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken to provide tools {{to aid in}} the design and optimisation of <b>offshore</b> <b>mooring</b> <b>systems.</b> The tools present a set of feasible solutions with different performance characteristics. With an increased reliance on the exploitation of the reserves of hydrocarbon on marginal offshore areas, both in Australia and around the world, mooring mobile vessels becomes a more challenging task. The latest evolutionary optimisation techniques offer new prospects for designing and analysing moorings, but to select an appropriate method of optimisation, both the classical deterministic search and evolutionary optimisation methods are reviewed. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) have been investigated in terms of their capability, strengths, and limitations. The GA and PSO have been benchmarked against each other, and PSO has been found to more efficient in the engineering applications considered. Particle swarm optimisation was selected and implemented in the evolutionary mooring design computer software coded by the author. This software tool interfaces with the offshore industry commercial package OrcaFlex, which supplies results from model simulations. A case study of a mooring design is presented to demonstrate the ability of the optimisation tool, while the results provide potential improvements in mooring design solutions. A performance based multi-objectives particle swarm optimisation (MOPSO) was developed where the multiple constraints can confidently be switched to problems with multiple objectives. Meanwhile, the results from the mooring optimisation obtained from MOPSO were compared with PSO, and showed that highly competing constraints leads the PSO search in an unhealthy manner. Alternatively, the performance based MOPSO design produces a set of solutions with a different performance which can be further processed and selected by offshore engineers. MOPSO offers greater flexibility and computational efficiency to optimise the final solutions...|$|R

40|$|Correct {{generation}} of the primary waves and the reproduction of the group-induced second order low and high frequency waves have been considered essential for physical model test in the laboratory to understand {{the effects of the}} wave-action phenomena on, for instance, <b>offshore</b> structures, <b>mooring</b> <b>system,</b> LNG, other floating vessels, harbor resonance, etc [...] When natural waves are reproduced, the primary waves and their locked bounded waves are generated along with some unwanted free waves. Those free waves are evidently generated and propagate towards the test model and reflect from the boundaries. The free waves, having the same frequency of the bounded wave are reproduced due to mismatch of the boundary conditions at the wave paddle. Another two types of free waves are due to the wave paddle displacement and the local disturbances. These unwanted free waves can be eliminated by means of compensating free waves imposed on the system by second-order paddle motion. The control signal for this motion has to be introduced along with the primary waves. An extensive experimental works are carried out in the Offshore Engineering wave Basin (OEB) at the Institute of Ocean Technology (IOT), NRC to investigate the quality and the characteristics of the generated primary waves and their locked bounded waves after when the unwanted free waves are eliminated.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Oceanography in the Faculty of Applied Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyIn order to validate remote sensing products and to provide data for model assimilation, a real-time monitoring line consisting of three moorings was deployed across the Agulhas Current off Port Edward, South Africa. This deployment formed part of a Technology and Human Resource for Industry Programme (THRIP) funded initiative to develop a real-time <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> capable of measuring ocean parameters in the Agulhas Current during 2011. The slope and offshore moorings displayed a distinct stratified regime within the Agulhas Current, a northeastward flowing Agulhas Undercurrent and the southwestward flowing Agulhas Current. Three major reversal events, with northeastward currents occurred on 23 July, 02 September and on 11 October 2011. All current reversals caused a decrease in current velocity. The Agulhas Undercurrent was a persistent feature and average velocities between the line of moorings ranged between 13. 38 cm/s and 15. 52 cm/s. The results obtained from the <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> were consistent in terms of velocity, direction and hydrographic properties of the Agulhas Current as described in previous literature. The low directional variability in the surface layers at the <b>offshore</b> <b>mooring</b> and dominant southwestward flow, except during reversal events indicate the strong influence of the Agulhas Current in this region. The inshore mooring showed less occurrences of the Agulhas Undercurrent if northward flow in the bottom layers was to be considered as signs of the Agulhas Undercurrent. General current characteristics {{as well as the}} characterisation of the mesoscale features affecting the coast off Port Edward was accomplished through the use of the in situ moorings. All current reversals encountered were associated with the process of vortex shedding from the Natal Bight. These events {{may be related to the}} shedding of the Durban Cyclonic Eddy from its origin in the Natal Bight. Data from the <b>offshore</b> <b>mooring</b> suggested that for monitoring Agulhas Current core dynamics, it was ideally placed as highest surface velocities were measured by this <b>mooring</b> <b>system.</b> The slope <b>mooring</b> recorded highest velocities within the Agulhas Undercurrent and was thus ideally placed to measure the Agulhas Undercurrent’s core.

Cinqüenta e sete modelos foram analisados pelo método de Elementos Finitos utilizando o {{software}} Ansys 10. Inicialmente, com o objetivo de quantificar a influência do contato e mensurar a área onde este ocorre, três modelos com contatos entre manilha de união e elos foram analisados com variações no diâmetro (76, 95 e 120 mm) e mantendo-se constante as propriedades mecânicas do {{material e}} a carga aplicada. Em seqüência, cinqüenta e quatro outros modelos foram elaborados sem condições de contato, isto é, com as cargas aplicadas diretamente nos componentes de estudo, que sofreram variações de diâmetros (76, 95 e 120 mm), de propriedades mecânicas (limites de escoamento e resistência mecânica) e de carregamento (proof load e minimum break load). Comparativamente, as manilhas de união apresentaram os menores níveis de tensões e as melhores distribuições de tensões dentre os três componentes para todos os casos analisados. Dos cinqüenta e quatro modelos citados acima, três foram selecionados para análise da vida em fadiga com o software FE-Fatigue. Estes representavam um acessório de união de cada tipo com o diâmetro considerado crítico (120 mm) e sem variações nas propriedades mecânicas do material. Os resultados mostraram que a geometria do componente é determinante para os valores das tensões e da vida-fadiga. A manilha apresentou os melhores resultados de resistência e de vida-fadiga, que para o diâmetro e material escolhidos, foi cerca de três vezes maior do que aquela relativa aos elos Kenter e Multifuncional. This work represents {{an approach to}} predict the performance of three joining accessories (shackle, Kenter link and Multifunctional link) for <b>offshore</b> <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> under monotonic and cyclic loading. Fifty seven models were analyzed by the Finite Element method using the software Ansys 10. Initially, in order to quantify {{the influence of the}} contact conditions and to measure the area where it occurs, three models presenting contacts between the joining shackle and chain links were analyzed varying the diameter (76, 95, 120 mm) and maintaining constant the material’s mechanical properties as well as the applied loads. In sequence, fifty four other models were created without contact conditions, which means that the loads were applied directly on the components in question, with variations in link diameter (76, 95 and 120 mm), in mechanical properties (yield stress and ultimate strength) and in load conditions (proof and minimum break loads). Comparing the joining shackles with the other accessories, the shackles present the lowest stress levels and the best stress distributions with regard to all the cases studied. Three of the fifty four models cited above were selected for predicting their fatigue life making use of the FE-Fatigue software. These represented one of each joining accessory with a diameter considered critical (120 mm), keeping constant the mechanical properties of the material. The results showed that the influence of the component geometry is determinant for the stress values developed during the loading tests as well as its fatigue life.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of design {{challenges}} facing <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> of floating <b>offshore</b> wind turbine (FOWT) platforms in an offshore environment. Some unique aspects of the FOWT industry should be considered when examining applicability of established <b>offshore</b> <b>mooring</b> practices. Important among these are: economy and cost effectiveness; light weight minimal platforms; and water depths ranging from 50 – 300 m. A lighter displacement platform in shallow water, supported by lines with light to moderate pre-tension can result in a higher probability of slack line events and hence snap loads during re-engagement. Such loads can result in shock on the line material and considerably reduce the fatigue life. Such events have the potential to occur in various sea states, and not necessarily limited to extreme conditions. These conditions will be dependent on structure resonant motions, which are influenced by wind loads and moments, wave conditions and mooring line properties. Model tests of typical concepts for FOWT reported in literature have shown occasional slack line episodes.

The modified CABLE 3 D is then integrated into a numerical package, known as COUPLE 6 D, for computing the interaction between a floating structure and its hybrid polyester <b>mooring</b> <b>system.</b> The Deepstar Spar is chosen in this study to represent the floating structure. By considering large elongation in polyester ropes in numerical simulation, the static offset curve of a polyester <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> is softer than that calculated under the assumption of small elongation. That is, about 10 % reduction in restoring force at the mean offset position of the Spar under the impact of 100 -year hurricane storm. The effects of the mean loads on the modulus of polyester ropes are much greater than those of the dynamic loads. Hence, the former is more important in the simulation of the response of floating structures.

40|$|In the {{development}} of wave energy converters, the <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> is a key component for a safe station-keeping and {{an important factor in}} the cost of the wave energy production. Generally, when designing a <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> for a wave energy converter, two important conditions must be considered: (i) that the <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> must be strong enough to limit the drifting motions, even in extreme waves, tidal and wind conditions and (ii) it must be compliant enough so that the impact on wave energy production can be minimised. It is frequently found that these two conditions are contradictory. The existing solutions mainly include the use of heavy chains, which create a catenary shaped mooring configuration, allowing limited flexibility within the <b>mooring</b> <b>system,</b> and hence very large forces may still be present on mooring lines and thus on anchors. This solution is normally quite expensive if the costs of the materials and installation are included. This paper presents a new solution to the <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> for wave energy converters within the FP 7 project, ‘GeoWAVE’, which is a project aiming to develop a new generation of the moorings system for minimising the loads on mooring lines and anchors, the impact on the device motions for power conversion, and the footprint if it is applicable, and meanwhile the new types of anchors are also addressed within the project. However this paper will focus on the new <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> by presenting the wave tank test results of the Pelamis wave energy converter model and the new developed <b>mooring</b> <b>system.</b> It can be seen that the new generation of <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> can significantly reduce the loads on mooring lines and anchors, and reduce the device excursions {{as a result of the}} new <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> when compare to the conventional catenary mooring...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the potential for}} energy reduction obtained by using dynamic line tensioning in thruster assisted position <b>mooring</b> <b>systems.</b> Traditionally, <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> have been designed {{in such a way}} that thruster assistance has not been neccessary under normal environmental conditions. However, as oil production moves into deeper waters, such overdimensioned <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> are no longer feasible. Thus, new "hybrid" solutions must be developed, in which increased thruster action compensates for fewer, and lighter, anchor lines. In this paper, controlling the line tensions dynamically is suggested as an additional means of station keeping, and a control law is derived based on passivity. A model consisting of a rigid-body submodel for the vessel, and a finite element submodel for the <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> is presented and used for simulations. The simulations show the performance of the proposed control system. Keywords [...] - Ship control, position <b>mooring</b> <b>systems.</b> I. Introduction P [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Floating {{structures}} use <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> for {{station keeping}} in any water depths. <b>Mooring</b> <b>system</b> {{is a vital}} component {{for the safety of}} floating structures. Mooring accidents can cause serious injury or damage to the vessel, and hence it is necessary to establish a systematic risk-based decision making for safety assessment of mobile <b>mooring</b> <b>system.</b> This study uses the mobile <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> of a semi submersible pipe laying barge as a case study. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a Methodology for Investigation of Critical Hazards (MIVTA), which is carried out by the development of preliminary risk analysis using HAZOP (Hazard and Operability), to generate the root causes using FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and to construct the sequence of the consequences using ETA (Event Tree Analysis). HAZOP is a systematic examination of a system helpful to identify and evaluate the risks related to accidents/incidents in <b>mooring</b> <b>system.</b> FTA is a deductive method useful to generate the potential causes of <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> failure into undesired events. ETA is an inductive method helpful to define all possible outcomes of accidental events. This study conducts risk-based decision making coupled with the knowledge of the experts of <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> to identify the root causes, to evaluate the frequency of failure and to classify their class of consequences. This study provides a systematic methodology guideline for the risk-based decisio...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{critical components}} of the <b>mooring</b> <b>system</b> for Floating <b>Offshore</b> Wind Turbines including chain cables, anchors and soil. The mooring line is investigated using OrcaFlex models to assess the characteristics of both catenary and semi-taut <b>mooring</b> <b>system.</b> Then, the analysis is advanced {{to look into the}} effects of water depth variation on the performance of the <b>mooring</b> <b>system.</b> The continental shelf located at the northern California coastal area is selected as a study region. Based on the information of macro-scale study on the region, soil properties are developed to aid in understanding the performance of the <b>mooring</b> <b>system.</b> Combining the results from the mooring analysis and soil data base, considerations for appropriate anchor types are presented. The anchor types include: driven piles, drag embedment anchors, and direct embedment plate anchors. This study seeks to provide a novel mooring and anchor concept which can be used to design efficient <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> relevant to Floating Offshore Wind Turbines...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to numerically {{evaluate}} severe corrosion pits on <b>offshore</b> <b>mooring</b> chain. Pitting corrosion {{is considered}} a significant degradation mechanism as cracks tend to nucleate and propagate in areas of high stress concentration. Hence, the idea has been to replicate the pits using a 3 D scanner, and subsequently analyze the pits in a finite element software. The study {{is part of a}} collaborative research project between Statoil ASA and NTNU, where the motivation is the fatigue life of <b>offshore</b> <b>mooring</b> lines. It is believed that surface conditions, like pitting corrosion, are highly influential on the chain segments fatigue life. The final aim is to introduce clear criteria for deciding whether a chain is too damaged to continue service or not. A method for replicating and evaluating the effects of the corrosion pits has been devised in the following. However, before it can be used on an actual situation, the methods capabilities need to be proved for a simple scenario. Consequently, this thesis has focused on developing the method and testing it on artificially made corrosion pits...|$|R
