25|$|For one thing, {{we would}} no longer allow breeding. People could not create {{different}} breeds. There would be no pet shops. If people had companion animals in their homes, those animals {{would have to be}} refugees from the animal shelters and the streets. You would have a protective relationship with them just as you would with an orphaned child. But as the surplus of cats and dogs (artificially engineered by centuries of forced breeding) declined, eventually companion animals would be phased <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> would return to a more symbiotic relationship—enjoyment at a distance.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} 1958–59 season, Russell continued his strong play, averaging 16.7 {{points per game}} and 23.0 rebounds per game in the regular season. The Celtics broke a league record by winning 52 games, and Russell's strong performance once again helped lead the Celtics through the post-season, as {{they returned to the}} NBA Finals. In the 1959 NBA Finals, the Celtics recaptured the NBA title, sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers 4–0. Lakers head coach John Kundla praised Russell, stating, [...] "We don't fear the Celtics without Bill Russell. Take him <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> can beat them... He's the guy who whipped us psychologically." ...|$|E

500|$|Georgia's defense, ranked {{fifth in}} the SEC, was no less a concern for Virginia Tech's offense. [...] "Defense {{is one of the}} major aspects of the SEC", said Georgia center Nick Jones before the game. [...] "You face great {{defenses}} week in and week <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> face a great one week in and week out in practice against our defense. We've been up against great defenses and great personnel, so it's nothing new for us." [...] Heading into the game, Georgia was ranked ninth in total defense, giving up only 264yards per game, and 22nd in scoring defense, allowing an average of just 17.1points a game.|$|E
500|$|Gillan was {{roommates}} with Ritchie Blackmore in the 1970s, {{but left}} the band in 1973 amid tensions with Blackmore and overall exhaustion. In a 2006 interview, Gillan said of Blackmore's final 1993 departure from Deep Purple, [...] "he {{turned into a}} really weird guy, and the day {{he walked out of}} the tour was the day the clouds disappeared and the day the sunshine came <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> haven't looked back since." [...] He added that [...] "there are certain personal issues that I have with Ritchie, which means that I will never speak to him again. Nothing I'm going to discuss publicly, but deeply personal stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|That We Can Play was {{recorded}} {{with a single}} stereo Pro Tools track and [...] "outboard, secondhand vintage synths and sequencers". Ford explained {{the process of making}} each song in an interview with XLR8R: [...] "It's almost like we just sit down with gear and are like, 'Whoa, this sounds sweet,' and then we'll make a beat, and be like, 'What if we do this?' and something comes <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> move from there. Where it gets really complex—and you can't be a slacker—is you have to inventorize all these tiny sounds and constantly be trying to fit all of these moving parts together and see what sticks—and it's a lot of repetitive, careful-listening kind of work." ...|$|E

500|$|Morse conceded on {{the evening}} of September 10. Initial poll returns seemed to {{indicate}} that Giron would win her recall election. The final votes were 9,131 to recall Morse and 8,812 to keep him, a 1.78% difference. The final results also ousted Giron, 19,451 to 15,376, an 11.7% difference. Giron's recall was more surprising, as the district is 47% Democratic to 23% Republican, and news reports stated that Giron was stunned at the results. Other sources stated that Giron remained defiant. Giron has claimed that the recall was due to voter suppression. Giron noted that [...] "We were less than two weeks <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> didn't know what the rules were," [...] referring to the change from mail-in ballots to in-person voting.|$|E
500|$|On 20 February 1947, Attlee {{announced}} Mountbatten's appointment, {{and that}} Britain would transfer power in India {{not later than}} June 1948. Mountbatten took office as Viceroy on 24 March 1947, two days after his arrival in India. By then, the Congress had come around {{to the idea of}} partition. Nehru stated in 1960, [...] "the truth is that we were tired men and we were getting on in years... The plan for partition offered a way <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> took it." [...] Leaders of the Congress decided that having loosely tied Muslim-majority provinces as part of a future India was not worth the loss of the powerful government at the centre which they desired. However, the Congress insisted that if Pakistan were to become independent, Bengal and Punjab would have to be divided.|$|E

The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Parker and Stone {{had trouble}} {{deciding}} how to resolve the episode and bring the zombie characters back to life. Although they ultimately settled on having Kyle kill the [...] "main zombie" [...] {{to bring back the}} others, Parker did not feel the resolution made sense and described it as a deus ex machina. Parker said of the ending, [...] "This was another big one of those episodes where we were sort of (like), 'How do we get out of this one?'" [...] Parker also described the ending of the episode as [...] "a bloodbath, (which) is what a good zombie movie should be". [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first South Park episode Parker and Stone felt unsatisfied with once production was complete. Parker said, [...] "We were pretty bummed <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> kind of thought, well, we're going to have a bad episode go on the air, and hopefully it won't alienate too many people, and we'll try to get our viewers back for Thanksgiving. But we were totally wrong, people totally loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|Bilson and DeMeo then {{submitted}} their seven-page film {{treatment to}} Disney, but the studio put their script through an endless series of revisions. Over five years, Disney fired and rehired Bilson and DeMeo three times. DeMeo explained that [...] "Disney {{felt that they}} needed {{a different approach to}} the script, which meant bringing in someone else. But those scripts were thrown <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were always brought back on". They found the studio's constant tinkering with the screenplay to be a frustrating process as [...] "executives would like previously excised dialogue three months later. Scenes that had been thrown out two years ago were put back in. What was the point"? DeMeo said. One of Bilson and De Meo's significant revisions to the script over the years was to make Cliff and Jenny's romance more believable and avoid cliché aspects that would stereotype Jenny as a damsel in distress. The numerous project delays forced Dear to drop out as director. Joe Johnston, a fan of the comic book, immediately offered his services as director when he found out Disney owned the film rights. Johnston was quickly hired and pre-production started in early 1990. After Bilson and De Meo's third major rewrite, Disney finally greenlighted The Rocketeer.|$|E

[...] "Bill and I had thrown around {{the idea of having a}} studio forever, because by then any time we were home, we were recording Big Drill Car or Chemical People.

[...] Then all of the boys would run for their rooms. [...] At nine o’clock the second call was given, when all lights were tuned <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were supposed to be in bed.

Radcliffe also recalled stopping the team car to buy gas in Waycross, Georgia. When the players tried to drink water from the car wash hose, the owner of the gas station told them, [...] "Put that hose down—that's for white folks to drink."

[...] Detroit was ahead 3 games to 2, and in Gehringer's view [...] "we should've won the sixth game." [...] Late in the game, Brick Owens called Mickey Cochrane {{out on a}} play at third base [...] "even though all of the photographs {{show that he was}} safe by a mile." [...] Gehringer insisted that, if Cochrane had been called safe, [...] "we would've had the bases loaded with nobody <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> could've had a big inning." [...] The Tigers wound up losing Game 6 by one run. [...] They then lost Game 7 in an 11–0 shutout thrown by Dizzy Dean, despite a 2-for-4 game from Gehringer.
