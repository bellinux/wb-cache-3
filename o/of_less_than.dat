40|$|This article investigates when homotopies can be {{converted}} to monotone homotopies without increasing the lengths of curves. A monotone homotopy is one which consists of curves which are simple or constant, and in which curves are pairwise disjoint.

This proves a conjecture of Chambers and Rotman.
