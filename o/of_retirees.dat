40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} provision <b>of</b> <b>retiree</b> {{health insurance for}} public sector workers, {{little attention has been}} paid to its effects on employee retirement. This is in contrast to the large literature on health-insurance-induced 9 ̆ 3 job-lock 9 ̆ 4 in the private sector. I use the introduction <b>of</b> <b>retiree</b> health insurance for public school employees in combination with administrative data on their retirement to identify the effects <b>of</b> <b>retiree</b> health insurance. As expected, the availability <b>of</b> <b>retiree</b> health insurance for older workers allows employees to retire earlier.

40|$|Abstract: The {{proportion}} of large employers offering retiree health insurance has declined by {{half in the}} past 20 years. This paper examines the potential implications of this change by estimating the effects <b>of</b> <b>retiree</b> health insurance (RHI) offer on a comprehensive set of outcomes in the near-elderly population (ages 47 - 64) over a 10 -year period. I find that an RHI offer increases the probability of early retirement by 40 percent {{for both men and}} women. While the results suggest that a retiree health insurance offer has little, if any, effect on health, there is strong evidence that RHI provides significant protection from high out-of-pocket medical costs. In the top 40 percent of the out-of-pocket spending distribution, those with an offer <b>of</b> <b>retiree</b> coverage spend 21 percent less on average. An RHI offer also moderately increases outpatient medical care utilization. Estimates of the value <b>of</b> <b>retiree</b> health insurance <b>of</b> $ 3, 400 per year for men and $ 3, 100 per year for women suggest that increasing opportunities for the near-elderly to purchase coverage at actuarially-fair prices through the individual market or public programs could significantly reduce the projected increase in uninsurance for this age group...|$|R
40|$|I {{examine whether}} the {{availability}} <b>of</b> early <b>retiree</b> health benefits {{increases the likelihood}} of early retirement. Although there is a positive association between the availability <b>of</b> <b>retiree</b> health benefits and early retirement, this association could be driven by other factors that are correlated with retiree health benefits and affect retirement decisions. I build a simple model to show that individuals in poor health and with poor outside insurance options value retiree health benefits more. I then use variation in health status and outside insurance options to examine, within a difference-in-differences framework, whether the estimated correlation between retiree health benefits and early retirement reflects demand for health insurance. My results indicate that the effect <b>of</b> <b>retiree</b> health benefits is not statistically significantly larger for those in poor health, but that it is larger for those who lack insurance from other sources, particularly from their spouses. I conclude that retiree health benefits do increase the hazard of early retirement and that demand for health insurance among the near-elderly is not closely tied to health status. ...|$|R
