25|$|In {{addition}} to Wilson and Leach, Roemer also ran again in 1980. So did State Representative Forrest Dunn of Shreveport, a furniture store owner known for fiscal conservatism and frank expression of ideas who had supported President Ford over Jimmy Carter in 1976. Dunn's entry {{was believed to}} have attracted the same kinds <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> might have otherwise preferred the Republican Wilson.|$|E

50|$|The {{election}} results showed votes were largely cast along racial lines. Barthelemy's victory was assured {{by a combination}} of his overwhelming 86% support <b>of</b> black <b>voters</b> (<b>who</b> formed 54% <b>of</b> the electorate) and a significant number (23%) <b>of</b> white <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> supported him over Mintz. Mintz was able to garner strong support among white <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> had helped elect Barthelemy in 1986, but was not able to convince enough black voters to reject Barthelemy and elect a white candidate instead. He received only 14% support among black voters; not enough to unseat the incumbent.|$|R
25|$|When {{allowing}} {{users to}} have ties in their preferences, {{the outcome of}} the Schulze method naturally depends on how these ties are interpreted in defining d. Two natural choices are that d represents either the number <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> strictly prefer A to B (A>B), or the margin of (voters with A>B) minus (voters with B>A). But no matter how the ds are defined, the Schulze ranking has no cycles, and assuming the ds are unique it has no ties.|$|E
25|$|Although the countback {{method is}} {{designed}} to select a replacement representing the same group <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> elected the original candidate, it remains possible that no similar candidates remain on the ballot. In 1985 the Tasmanian parliament amended the electoral act to allow true by-elections if no candidates of the same party as the outgoing representative remained on the ballot; in this circumstance the party may request that a by-election be held, however this has not yet happened as most political parties and community groups now nominate a surplus number of candidates in order to fill any casual vacancies.|$|E
25|$|SNL {{has also}} {{had an effect on}} American {{elections}} – most commonly presidential elections. Voters have reported that political sketches that were shown on the program influenced them in the voting booth. The so-called SNL Effect was observed during the 2008 presidential campaign, according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> responded to a poll said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on SNL, with ten percent saying that it had made a difference in their decision. Barack Obama was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the Democratic then-nominee.|$|E

5000|$|Additionally, like first {{past the}} post methods, small {{cohesive}} groups <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> can overpower larger numbers <b>of</b> disorganised <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> do {{not engage in}} tactical voting, sometimes resulting in a small minority <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> electing an entire slate of candidates by merely constituting a plurality.|$|R

25|$|Secretary Land led {{the charge}} to {{consolidate}} Michigan’s elections, which saved money, reduced confusion, and helped eliminate ‘stealth elections’. Staying ahead of the work required by the Help America Vote Act, Land also selected a single style voting machine to be implemented statewide with funding from the federal government. In 2005, Land's office announced an effort to use the Help America Vote Act to reduce potential voter fraud by removing names <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> had died, moved out of Michigan, or changed their names. A New York Times investigation found that 33,000 people {{were removed from the}} rolls, while Land's office said 11,000 voters were removed. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Michigan to court over the removal of voter names. The New York Times pointed out that “the problems were not unique to Michigan, and that states with Republican and Democratic election officials had struggled to interpret new federal laws, such as the Help America Vote Act.” In October 2008, a federal judge ruled that the national Voting Rights Act had been violated and six states, including Michigan, were ordered to stop removing names from voter rolls. A spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s office told the Detroit Free Press that, “If you're eligible to vote, {{you will be able to}} cast a vote on Election Day". Furthermore, Land spearheaded several outreach initiatives that increased voter participation, including touring all university campuses to offer registration opportunities, which caused unprecedented voter turnout rates in 2004, 2006, and 2008.|$|E
500|$|Brunner {{has made}} several {{specific}} efforts to alleviate {{some of the}} past voting difficulties. 2008 was the first Ohio election that permits absentee voting {{as a matter of}} preference without any justification for need. [...] This resulted in a record number of absentee ballots. [...] Additionally, voting machine redistribution has been closely studied with the hope of alleviating long waits in problem areas. [...] Redistribution is based on past turnout, new registrations, any recent purges under the National Voter Registration Act, and the number of ballot issues in the district. [...] Each precinct has been supplied with sufficient paper ballots to accommodate 25% number <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> voted in the previous presidential election.|$|E
500|$|Miami's Cuban {{community}} {{came together}} {{as never before}} for the campaign, taking the opportunity to register thousands <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> had never taken part in politics in the city. Bryant actively campaigned to the Cuban community, telling them at a rally, [...] "You came here {{to get away from}} one sin ... and it breaks my heart that if Miami becomes another Sodom and Gomorrah you may have to leave here, too." [...] A Cuban social worker [...] suggested the cause was representative of an older generation of Cuban emigres, worried that their children were being lost in the depravity of Miami. Miami's archbishop wrote a letter against the gay rights ordinance, and ordered it to be read aloud in all Catholic churches.|$|E

500|$|On November 6, Mondale and Ferraro {{lost the}} general {{election}} in a landslide. They received only 41percent {{of the popular vote}} compared to Reagan and Bush's 59percent, and in the Electoral College won only Mondale's home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. The ticket even lost Ferraro's to congressional district, which had long been one of the more conservative districts in New York City; it tended to vote Republican in presidential races. Ferraro's presence on the ticket had little measurable effect overall. Reagan captured 55percent of women voters and about the same share of Catholic voters, the latter being the highest level yet for a Republican presidential candidate. Of the tenth <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> decided based on the vice-presidential candidates, 54percent went to Mondale–Ferraro, establishing that Ferraro provided a net gain to the Democrats of 0.8percent. Reagan's personal appeal and campaign themes of prosperity and [...] "It's morning again in America" [...] were quite strong, while Mondale's liberal campaign alienated Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who usually voted Democratic. Political observers generally agree that no combination of Democrats could have won the election in 1984. Mondale himself would later reflect that [...] "I knew that I was in for it with Reagan" [...] and that he had no regrets about choosing Ferraro.|$|E

2500|$|Differing {{methods of}} {{measuring}} voter turnout {{can contribute to}} reported differences between nations.

2500|$|For the numerator, it {{is often}} assumed that the number <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> {{went to the polls}} should equal the number of ballots cast, which in turn should equal the number of votes counted, {{but this is not the}} case. [...] Not all voters who arrive at the polls {{necessarily}} cast ballots. [...] Some may be turned away because they are ineligible, some may be turned away improperly, and some who sign the voting register may not actually cast ballots. [...] Furthermore, voters who do cast ballots may abstain, deliberately voting for nobody, or they may spoil their votes, either accidentally or as an act of protest.|$|E

[...] "When we look at the result, we see that the Justice and Development Party has taken a very important step towards creating a judiciary mechanism that is entirely dependent on itself," [...] Kılıçdaroğlu said.
