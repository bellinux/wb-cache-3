40|$|This paper {{presents}} an econometric study {{of information and}} communication technology (ICT) in all 70, 000 rural villages in Thailand, where the ICT considered consists of fixed-line <b>telephone</b> <b>service,</b> mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>service,</b> public <b>telephones,</b> computers, and Internet service. The results may provide information that helps policymakers decide where to put limited resources to promote ICT, and helps profit-seeking ICT companies target regions that maximize revenues. The study found that education {{is far more important}} than income in predicting the percentage of households who adopt ICT services, and that some unexpected variables such as the penetration of pickup trucks are useful predictors as well. Even in areas where fixed-line phone service is available, 70 % of households with computers choose not to become Internet subscribers, although many presumably have enough money and technical knowledge. By separating availability from penetration of ICT, the study found that they can have different predictors, which means that researchers who do not separate them may get misleading results. There is no evidence showing mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> as a substitute for fixed-line <b>telephone</b> <b>service.</b> Also, public <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> had little or no impact as a substitute for fixed-line or mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>service,</b> so phone companies need not fear that deployment of more public telephones will decrease their subscribership. Finally, there appears to be significant unmet demand for <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> in rural Thailand where the infrastructure does not yet exist.
