A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, [...] "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> call it, that just gave it this great edge." [...] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, [...] "Davey was so good he {{could do a lot}} of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult." ...|$|E

In the article, the magazine credits the album with [...] "single-handedly changed the face of mainstream rock." [...] Property of Zack also gave the album a fifteenth anniversary feature, commenting, [...] "Enema of the State has become the single most important album in our overarching community since its release in 1999. It is more important, to this current generation and the one preceding it, than Dookie, or Smash, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> put on that pedestal — and it will likely never give up that spot {{at the top of the}} standings." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 14, 1990, {{before the}} start of Favre's senior year at Southern Miss, he was {{involved}} in a near-fatal car accident. When going around a bend a few tenths of a mile from his parents' house, Favre lost control of his car, which flipped three times and came to rest against a tree. It was only after one of his brothers smashed a car window with a golf club that Favre could be evacuated and rushed to the hospital. In the ambulance, his mother was sitting with him. [...] "All I kept asking [...] was 'Will I be able to play football again?'" [...] Favre recalled later. Doctors would later remove 30 inches (76cm) of Favre's small intestine. Six weeks after this incident, on September 8, Favre led Southern Miss to a comeback victory over Alabama. Alabama coach Gene Stallings said, [...] "You can call it a miracle or a legend <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> I just know that on that day, Brett Favre was larger than life." ...|$|E

Sarria maintained his innocence, stating that the arresting officer knew him personally. [...] "But {{they had to make}} an example of somebody... I was {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time." [...] Nonetheless, he was convicted and subjected to a large fine. Sarria, understanding that his conviction meant he could never become certified as a teacher, dropped out of college. Unsure of how to find work, he took the advice of a drag performer named Michelle and entered a drag contest at an Oakland bar called Pearl's. Sarria took second place, winning a two-week performance contract at the bar at $50 a week.

500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care.

500|$|Costa's first {{recording}} {{as leader}} was in 1956, with his trio featuring bassist Vinnie Burke and drummer Nick Stabulas. This was released under slightly differing titles by Josie Records and Jubilee Records, and was well received: critic John S. Wilson, for instance, {{commented on the}} [...] "roaring, spitting piano solos by Eddie Costa". Around this time, Costa was nicknamed [...] "The Bear" [...] by Burke for his powerful playing. Also in 1956, Costa and Burke joined guitarist Tal Farlow, forming a resident trio {{to play at the}} Composer, a club on West 58th Street in New York. Farlow's comment on the absence of a drummer from the trio was that [...] "Eddie's feeding, comping <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> call it was so fierce that there was no doubt at all where the time was, so I didn't miss the drums at all". The trio stayed together, recording several albums under Farlow's name, until, in 1958, the Composer closed. Costa was often in recording studios as a sideman around this time: he appeared on approximately 20 albums in both 1956 and 1957. These included small group settings with Herbie Mann, Oscar Pettiford, and Phil Woods, and accompanying vocalists such as Tony Bennett and Chris Connor.|$|E
500|$|According to Greg Kot, 808s & Heartbreak {{initiated}} the [...] "wave of inward-looking sensitivity" [...] and [...] ""-inspired rappers {{during the late}} 2000s: [...] " [...] presaged everything from the introspective hip-hop of Kid Cudi's [...] (2009) to the wispy crooning, plush keyboards and light mechanical beats of Bon Iver's Justin Vernon and British dub-step balladeer James Blake." [...] Consequence of Sound credited it with shaping subsequent developments in [...] "indie R or electropop <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> call it": [...] "808s is flooded with R and it digitizes the raw emotion and isolated feelings that [...] have carved their brands out of today." [...] Craig D. Linsey from The Village Voice wrote that the album's [...] "naked humanity ... practically set off the emo-rap/r boom that everyone from Drake to Frank Ocean to The Weeknd now traffic in." [...] Marcus Scott of GIANT said rappers such as B.o.B, Drake, and Kid Cudi followed West's album with similarly-minded works, citing West's introspective, emotional themes and synthpop/"Vangelis-inspired" [...] music as influences. In the opinion of Billboard senior editor Alex Gale, the album was [...] "the equivalent of (Bob) Dylan going electric, and you still hear that all the time, in hip-hop and outside of hip-hop." [...] Drake's 2009 mixtape So Far Gone received comparisons from critics to 808s & Heartbreak. Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times cited 808s & Heartbreak as [...] "the template [...] for essentially the entirety of Drake's young career", and that wrote that he [...] "shares West's love for mood and never-ending existential analysis". In a 2009 interview, Drake cited West as [...] "the most influential person" [...] in shaping his own sound. In 2014, Rolling Stone named 808s & Heartbreak one of the 40 most groundbreaking albums of all time. On September 26, 2015, West performed the album in its entirety at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.|$|E

5000|$|After its {{founding}} in 1854, pioneer Omaha became the [...] "Gateway to the West," [...] as an essential stopping, restocking and [...] "jumping off" [...] point for settlers, hunters and miners traveling to the Western United States. The city quickly became notorious for its early gambling, with an early observer remarking that, [...] "Omaha was known from ocean to ocean with cards, dice, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to gamble with." [...] The city had an early history as a [...] "wide open" [...] town where gambling was accepted, along with prostitution, drugs and rampant alcohol use. In 1873, [...] "it seemed that ever lying, cheating, four-flushing, double-dealing, card-sharping, counterfeiting scoundrel who did not already hold high public office was setting up shop {{in the streets of}} Omaha." [...] The Burnt District was an early site for much of the city's illicit activity, including gambling. Dan Allen was a pioneer gambler in Omaha who had great influence throughout the young city. He was the long-time companion of Anna Wilson, the city's foremost madam for almost 40 years. Dan Allen ran a gambling house, saloon and pawn shop for more than a dozen years. The notorious Canada Bill Jones worked the trains from Omaha to Kansas City, Missouri in the 1870s. An 1887 law by the Nebraska State Legislature banned gambling houses in the city, driving many gamblers underground.|$|R

2500|$|By May 1996, Sound on Sound was {{reporting}} that {{the popularity of the}} 808 had started to decline, with the rarer TR-909 taking its place as [...] "the dance floor drum machine to use." [...] This is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons: the 909 gives more control over the drum sounds, has better programming and includes MIDI as standard. Sound on Sound reported that the 909 was selling for between £900 and £1100 and noted that the 808 was still collectible, but maximum prices had peaked at about £700 to £800. Such prices have held in the 12 years since the article was published, this can be evidenced by a quick search on eBay. Despite this fascination with retro music technology, according to Derrick May [...] "there is no recipe, there is no keyboard or drum machine which makes the best techno, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> call it.

Bruner wrote that [...] "Evolution is a religious philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of Atheism". Like other Young Earth creationists, Bruner believes dinosaurs and mankind walked the Earth at the same time; Bruner also believes that scientists found proof of a young Earth but have colluded to hide the evidence. Bruner wrote: [...] "The dinosaurs on the ark may have been babies and not able to reproduce. It might make sense to take the small dinosaurs onto the ark instead of the ones bigger than a bus. After the flood, the few remaining Behemoths and Leviathans may have become extinct because {{there was not enough}} vegetation on earth for them to survive to reproductive age... When the flood waters subsided and rushed into the oceans, there was no vegetation on the earth because the earth had been covered with water." [...] A television reporter asked Bruner on-camera to clarify her beliefs concerning the biblical account of Noah's Ark and whether it was filled with pairs of animals and if the entire world was covered with water. Bruner later wrote, [...] "THE ANSWER IS STILL YES, I believe the Holy Bible. I believe there was a Great Flood. How do YOU explain fossils of seashells and other sea animals on tops of mountains all over the world? How do you explain the Grand Canyon? You are very naive if you believe a tiny river carved out the Grand Canyon.

[...] His comments, made in the run-up to a Republican primary election, were strongly criticised by a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. He said that Ramsey's comments were part of [...] "a disturbing trend in our nation in which it is suggested that American Muslims should have fewer or more restricted constitutional rights than citizens of other faiths." [...] Murfreesboro's local state Senator, Bill Ketron, subsequently introduced what The American Prospect described as [...] "one of the most extreme anti-Sharia-law bills in the country", authorizing the state attorney general to designate [...] "Sharia organizations" [...] and imposing a 15-year jail term on anyone convicted of supporting such an organization. The law was passed, but the state legislature took out direct references to Sharia and Islam.

50|$|In an {{interview}} with William Kloman of The New York Times, when asked why there is hardly any dialogue in 2001, Kubrick explained:I don't have the slightest doubt that {{to tell a story}} like this, you couldn't do it with words. There are only 46 minutes of dialogue scenes in the film, and 113 of non-dialogue. There are certain areas of feeling and reality—or unreality <b>or</b> innermost yearning, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to call it—which are notably inaccessible to words. Music can get into these areas. Painting can get into them. Non-verbal forms of expression can. But words are a terrible straitjacket. It's interesting how many prisoners of that straitjacket resent its being loosened or taken off. There's a side to the human personality that somehow senses that wherever the cosmic truth may lie, it doesn't lie in A, B, C, D. It lies somewhere in the mysterious, unknowable aspects of thought and life and experience. Man has always responded to it. Religion, mythology, allegories—it's always {{been one of the most}} responsive chords in man. With rationalism, modern man has tried to eliminate it, and successfully dealt some pretty jarring blows to religion. In a sense, what's happening now in films and in popular music is a reaction to the stifling limitations of rationalism. One wants to break out of the clearly arguable, demonstrable things which really are not very meaningful, or very useful or inspiring, nor does one even sense any enormous truth in them.|$|R

40|$|The Polish Press Act from 1984 {{states that}} “The task of a {{journalist}} {{is to serve}} society and the state”. In theory, this act guarantees {{the pursuit of a}} particular kind of mission by journalists. However, in the face of ever-worsening public debate, the fulfillment of this task seems to be more and more challenging for Polish journalists. Błażej Lenkowski, the publisher of Liberté! – a socio-political quarterly magazine from Lodz –	emphasizes that “Free media are the foundation of a free, democratic society. They provide an opportunity to control the government”. He claims also that “Media are (…) a natural platform for political and ideological debate thanks to which all citizens can find the political option closest to their heart. They have a choice. The media also provide information that is crucial during elections. They enable individuals to choose more rational options. ” And this exact stance served as a lever for composing this article.

We shall, however, bear in mind that the actions of the organization are not limited to local ventures, but also have a European dimension due to a wide range of complementary activities undertaken by the Industrial Foundation, the magazine’s publisher.
