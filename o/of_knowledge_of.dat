40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to elucidate Calvin's high {{view of the}} function of Scripture in the mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God. Two conclusions emerge:- The first is that the statement 'Scripture is the Word of God' Is not a premise with which Calvin's theological exposition begins, but a position to which the Reformer comes {{as a corollary of}} his understanding of the grace of God. - The second Is that Calvin's contention that the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God is mediated In Scripture rests upon his view that the nature of God is such that its most adequate form of self-expression is as Word. There are three parts to the thesis. - Part I Is an examination of The Actuality <b>of</b> the <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God In the Word of God. This section is concerned with the actual content <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God as it is mediated by the Word of God. The mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God In Scripture is set {{in the context of the}} mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God by the Eternal Word of God and the mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God by the Incarnate Word of God. - Parts II and III explore The Possibility <b>of</b> the <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God in the Word of God. Part II asks how it is possible for the Word of God to be spoken, and answers the question In terms of Calvin's use of the principle of Accommodation. Part III considers how It Is possible for the Word of God to be heard, and answers the question in terms of Calvin's consistent correlation of Word and Spirit. In both cases the mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God in Scripture is again set in the context of the mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God by the Eternal Word of God, and the mediation <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> God by the Incarnate Word of God...|$|R

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|Byard {{began playing}} professionally on piano {{at the age}} of 16, in bands led by Doc Kentross and Freddy Bates. His early lessons had {{involved}} mostly playing by rote, so his development <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> theory and further piano technique occurred from the late 1930s until 1941, including studying harmony at Commerce High School. In that year he was drafted into the army, where he continued with piano lessons and was influenced by pianist Ernie Washington, with whom he was barracked, although Byard also took up trombone at this time. He also studied Stravinsky and Chopin, and continued studying classical composers into the 1960s. Part of his military service was in Florida, where he was a mentor to the young saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and his brother, Nat. After leaving the army in 1946, Byard's musical education continued, through discussions with others, and using library materials combined with music school syllabuses.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ed. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThis study {{described}} the knowledge upper elementary teachers {{used to teach}} students to comprehend informational text comprehension. Teachers were observed for two lessons and participated in interviews following each observation. During the interviews, teacher-participants described how they planned for the lesson and recalled their thinking as they watched segments of their video recorded lesson. Analysis focused on seven knowledge domains adapted from the literature on teacher <b>knowledge,</b> namely <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Students, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Reading, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the Genre <b>of</b> Informational Text, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> General Teaching Practices, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Context, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Curriculum, and <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Topical Content. Analysis of teachers' interviews led to four major findings: first, for some teachers, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Students was well-developed, and in turn, influential in their instructional decision-making; second, for others, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Context was well-developed and influential, but, in this study, <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Context was primarily related to test accountability; third, content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge related to teaching comprehension of informational texts were, at times, incomplete; and fourth, there was wide variability how teachers applied their pedagogical content knowledge related to the authenticity <b>of</b> the literacy <b>knowledge</b> goals and the topical knowledge goals...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. This {{research}} {{sought to}} investigate how school students build on their existing <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> a curriculum topic and transform found information into personal knowledge, and how their <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> this topic changes. Method. The qualitative study involved 574 students from Grades 6 to 12 in 10 New Jersey schools. The context for data collection was an instructional programme framed by Kuhlthau's information search process. Analysis. Data were collected through surveys at the initiation, midpoint and conclusion of the instructional programme. The instruments sought to measure changes in knowledge, specifically in relation to substance <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> estimate <b>of</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and label <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Results. It was possible to operationalise <b>knowledge</b> change in terms <b>of</b> substance, amount and structure <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and user-centreed perceptions <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> growth. Additive and integrative approaches to knowledge development were identified. Conclusion. Students came {{to know more about}} their topics, and perceived that they knew more as they progressed through the task. However, students seemed more oriented to gathering facts and knowing a set of facts, and accumulating these in an additive manner, rather than building complex, integrated and abstract knowledge representations...|$|R

5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the covenant of works and covenant of grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works (sometimes called the covenant of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace. This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{phenomena}} {{of the solar}} eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun. The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78–139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that {{the brightness of the}} Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun. Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat. Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century. When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> waxing and waning of the Moon. Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun). He explained that when the Sun's light is slanting, the Moon appears full. He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical. He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.|$|E
