So, we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E

Hogan entered discussions with Warner Bros. to direct in January 1998. Mike Myers signed on to replace Sean Penn, who vacated the lead role. However, negotiations with Hogan fell through; Sam Mendes, David Fincher and Darren Aronofsky all became interested in taking over the director's position. Fincher and Myers were ing production for Confessions in April 2000 but Fincher dropped out and, by that October, Brian De Palma was attached to direct with Renaissance Pictures co-financing. Later that month, Warner Bros. put the project in turnaround, and Myers lost interest. Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Edward Norton had also been attached to the film in the early development stages.|$|E

She appeared in Klute with Jane Fonda and Lady Liberty with Sophia Loren. In 1971 she went to Vienna to make two films with director Werner Schroeter; The Death of Maria Malibran, and another one that was never released. Her attempt at breaking into the mainstream movie circuit, by campaigning for the leading role in Myra Breckinridge, (1970) led to rejection and bitterness.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} the series was {{conceived}} as Marc Cherry and his mother were watching a news report on Andrea Yates. Prior to Desperate Housewives, Cherry was best known for producing and writing episodes of Touchstone Television's hit comedy series The Golden Girls and its successor, The Golden Palace. In addition, he had created or co-created three sitcoms: The 5 Mrs. Buchanans, The Crew, and Some <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Best</b> Friends, none of which lasted longer than a year. Cherry had difficulty getting any television network interested in his new series; HBO, CBS, NBC, Fox, Showtime, and Lifetime all turned the show down. Finally, two new executives at ABC, Lloyd Braun and Susan Lyne, chose to greenlight it, reportedly after The O.C. on Fox premiered in 2003 and showed that a soap opera could succeed in prime time. Shortly thereafter, Disney had both Braun and Lyne fired, following their approval of another new drama series: Lost.|$|E

He wrote: [...] "Sutcliffe is very gifted and very intelligent. In the {{meantime}} he has become one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> students." ...|$|E
500|$|RCA {{released}} the songs [...] "Yesterday's Wine" [...] and [...] "Me and Paul" [...] as singles. The song [...] "Yesterday's Wine" [...] peaked at number 62 in Billboards Country Singles. The {{promotion of the}} album was complicated for RCA's marketing department by the changes of Imperfect Man between spirituality and mundane behavior. The album did not appear on any chart, failing to satisfy RCA's expectations. Although his contract was not over, Nelson decided to retire {{because of the number}} of failures he had had. Nelson later wrote in his autobiography, [...] "I think it's one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> albums, but Yesterday's Wine was regarded by RCA as way too spooky and far out to waste promotion money on." [...] Nelson returned to music in the following year, as his style was influenced in the Armadillo World Headquarters.|$|E

500|$|The album {{contains}} twelve tracks; {{it opens}} with [...] "Make Me Know It". The second track is {{a cover of}} [...] "Fever", which Presley based on Peggy Lee's version, although his recording incorporates finger-snapping {{and the sounds of}} the two percussionists are divided between the two channels of the stereo mix. On [...] "The Girl <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Best</b> Friend", Presley is supported with doo-wop backing vocals by The Jordanaires. The fourth track is [...] "I Will Be Home Again", a slow ballad performed as a duet with Charlie Hodge. The fifth track is [...] "Dirty, Dirty Feeling", a song characterized by its [...] "raunchy rock sound" [...] and satirical humor; it was written by Leiber and Stoller, and had been previously discarded from the soundtrack of King Creole. [...] The final track on side one is [...] "Thrill of Your Love", on which Presley is accompanied by Cramer on the piano.|$|E
500|$|German {{historian}} Hans Otto Böhm {{commented on}} Oesau as [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> professors". There is little information {{available on the}} personal side of Walter Oesau. He had {{good sense of humor}} and liked to spend time with his friends. He was a simple man, who did not display any flamboyant personal emblems on his aircraft. His aircraft while commanding JG 2 did not have any special markings except for the unit's normal yellow under–cowling. While Oesau commanded, JG 2, like many others, dropped the special symbols for Stab (headquarters flight) units in favor of numerals. This helped make the leader's aircraft anonymous. Unlike other aces, Oesau reportedly never had markings on his rudder representing his personal tally, although this is contradicted by some photos displaying what may be his aircraft rudder painted with score of downed aircraft. The authenticity of the photograph is questioned by some as there are also Ju 87 photos supposedly signed by Oesau (he never flew a Stuka bomber).|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{released}} his fourth full-length solo album Shadows Collide with People on February 24, 2004. This featured guest appearances {{from some of}} his friends, including Klinghoffer, and Chili Peppers bandmates Smith and Flea. In June 2004, {{he announced that he}} would be releasing six records over six months: The Will to Death, Ataxia's Automatic Writing, DC EP, Inside of Emptiness, A Sphere in the Heart of Silence and Curtains. With the release of Curtains Frusciante debuted his only music video of 2004, for the track [...] "The Past Recedes". He wanted to produce these records quickly and inexpensively on analog tape, avoiding modern studio and computer-assisted recording processes. Frusciante noted, [...] "These six records were recorded in a period of six months after coming home from touring with the Chili Peppers for one-and-a-half years. I made {{a list of all the}} songs I had and they totaled about seventy. My objective was to record as many songs as I could during the break that I had. In the midst of doing that, I was writing some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> songs, so some of these albums have as many new songs as old songs. It was definitely the most productive time of my life." ...|$|E

500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the songs}} for The Beatles were written during a Transcendental Meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, India, between February and April 1968. The retreat {{involved}} long periods of meditation, conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours – a chance, in John Lennon's words, to [...] "get away from everything". Both Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly re-engaged themselves in songwriting, often meeting [...] "clandestinely in the afternoons in each other's rooms" [...] to review their new work. [...] "Regardless of what I {{was supposed to be}} doing," [...] Lennon later recalled, [...] "I did write some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> songs there." [...] Author Ian MacDonald said Sgt Pepper was [...] "shaped by LSD", but the Beatles took no drugs with them to India aside from marijuana, and their clear minds helped the group with their songwriting. The stay in Rishikesh proved especially fruitful for George Harrison as a songwriter, coinciding with his re-engagement with the guitar after two years studying the sitar. The musicologist Walter Everett likens Harrison's development as a composer in 1968 to that of Lennon and McCartney five years before, although he notes that Harrison became [...] "privately prolific", given his customary junior status in the group.|$|E
500|$|President Obama {{said that}} Kennedy's death marked the [...] "passing of an {{extraordinary}} leader" [...] and that he and First Lady Michelle Obama were [...] "heartbroken" [...] to learn of his passing, while Vice President Biden said [...] "today we lost a truly remarkable man," [...] and that Kennedy [...] "changed the circumstances of {{tens of millions of}} Americans". Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts Governor and Kennedy's opponent in the 1994 senate race, called Kennedy [...] "the kind of man you could like even if he was your adversary" [...] and former First Lady Nancy Reagan said she was [...] "terribly saddened". [...] She went on, [...] "Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy family.... I will miss him." [...] Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the President pro tempore of the Senate, issued a statement on Kennedy's death in which he said [...] "My heart and soul weeps at the loss <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> friend in the Senate, my beloved friend, Ted Kennedy." [...] (Byrd had broken down on the Senate floor and cried uncontrollably when Kennedy's cancer diagnosis was made public the previous year.) Upon his death, his sister Jean is the only one still living of the nine Kennedy siblings.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Give It Away" [...] {{was made by}} French fashion {{photographer}} and director Stéphane Sednaoui. Kiedis wanted the video to be visually distinct and readily identifiable but disliked much of the material Warner Bros. sent for him to choose from: [...] "I started viewing reels and reels and reels of video directors but nothing looked good to me. Everything was the same, boring, homogenized, contrived shit." [...] Upon finding Sednaoui's reel, however, Kiedis noticed it was [...] "like nothing else. It was slower and poetic, shot in black and white. It seemed like authentic art, not something shot for MTV." [...] He and Flea met with Sednaoui {{to talk about the}} video, for which the director proposed a [...] "very desolated [...] very graphic landscape," [...] while heavily focusing on the band members with little to no outside influence. It was decided that the video would be filmed in black and white while Sednaoui took the idea of painting the band members with silver acrylic from previous photo shoots he had done. Sednaoui recalls that he was [...] "amazed by what [...] gave me because they went far far far beyond what I was expecting and I think that's one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> experiences in that regard". The overall mood of the video was intended to be a personification of the song, which is upbeat and lively.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{was very}} fond of Caillat's 2007 debut album, Coco. Swift explained, [...] "When it came out, I {{fell in love with}} the way that she makes music." [...] Swift later {{contacted}} her management and asked if she could write a song with Caillat. They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, [...] "Breathe" [...] is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, [...] "when it's nobody's fault. It just has to end." [...] Swift explained, [...] "It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do. It's the hardest thing to go through. It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout." [...] Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.|$|E
500|$|The {{disqualification}} upset South Korean supporters, {{many of whom}} directed {{their anger}} at Ohno and the International Olympic Committee. A large number of e-mails protesting the race results crashed the Olympic Committee's email server, and thousands of accusatory letters, many of which contained death threats, were sent to Ohno and the committee. Ohno shared his thoughts on the Koreans' hostile reaction by saying, [...] "I was really bothered by it. I grew up around many Asian cultures, Korean one of them. A lot <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> friends were Korean growing up. I just didn't understand. Later on I realized that was built up by certain people and that was directed at me, negative energy from other things, not even resulting around the sport, but around politics, using me {{to stand on the}} pedestal as the anti-American sentiment". Earlier the same year, President George Bush had named North Korea as one of three members of the Axis of Evil, which had upset some South Koreans; directing their anger at Ohno was a less direct way of voicing anger against Bush's decision. The controversy continued at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held jointly in South Korea and Japan several months after the Olympics. When the South Korean football (soccer) team scored a goal against the U.S. team, Korean players Ahn Jung-Hwan and Lee Chun-Soo made an exaggerated move imitating the move Ohno had made during the speed skating event to indicate the other athlete had drifted into his lane.|$|E
