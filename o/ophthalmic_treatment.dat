It does however entail problems. <b>Ophthalmic</b> <b>treatments</b> are widely recognized as having a low risk of general complications. A classic example is cataract surgery, considered {{to be one of}} the safest and most frequently performed surgical procedures in the world. However, advanced age brings with it risks that should be considered before surgery. Eye operations, as with procedures on other organs, are largely dependent on the quality of surgical tissues. Therefore, the elderly are at increased risk of complications. Improved general health and postoperative follow-up with the use of noninvasive technologies such as optical coherence tomography translate into lower intraoperative risk and better postoperative prognosis. In this review, we discuss the impact of general health on operational prognosis, therapeutic problems, and technical difficulties which a surgeon and anesthesiologist may encounter in the process. We also consider new technology and strategies specifically aimed at treating eye conditions in the elderly.

Ellie eye drops were used to drop eye every 2 hours a day(daily 6 times).

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study is to conduct a histopathological {{research}} of the conjunctival findings and eosinophilic inflammation of novel atopic keratoconjunctivitis in a NC/Nga mouse model using crude Dermatophagoides farina. Methods: NC/Nga mice were sensitized by repeated topical applications of an ointment containing Dermatophagoides farinae body (Dfb). They were then divided into 4 groups depending on the following topical ophthalmic treatment: DFb group undergoing topical ophthalmic ointment containing Dfb; DFco group undergoing topical instillation of allergen extracts of Dermatophagoides farinae; Ba group undergoing topical ointment with substrate alone and NT group without after-topical <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>treatment.</b> At 24 hours after the last <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>treatment,</b> histopathological examination was performed. The density of the subepithelial infiltration of the eosinophils was determined. Serum total IgE and house-dust-mite (HDM) -specific IgE antibody concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: In the DFb group, the conjunctiva showed similar findings to those of atopic keratoconjunctivitis, i. e. intraepithelial pseudotubular formation, Torus-form infiltration due to massive lymphocytes in the palpebral conjunctiva and gelatinous hyperplasia in the limbus with subepithelial granuloma composed of lymphocytes and eosinophils. Subepithelial infiltration of eosinophil density in the DFb group [878. 4 ± 399. 7 cells/mm 2 (mean ± SD) ] was significantly higher than in the other 2 groups (DFco 85. 6 ± 40. 1 Ba 49. 2 ± 32. 3) (P < 0. 001). Total serum IgE concentration and HDM-specific serum IgE antibody concentration in the DFb group and the DFco group were significantly higher compared with those in the NT group.

40|$|A medico-ethnobotanical {{study was}} {{conducted}} among the Tabarkin communities living in Calasetta and Carloforte, in south-western Sardinia. These communities represent a Ligurian minority who have resided in Sardinia since their forebears migrated from Tabarka in Tunisia {{in the second half}} of the 18 th Century, having previously migrated to Tabarka from Genoa in 1544. In this study, we conducted more than 200 interviews and recorded 53 botanical taxa and 72 folk pharmaceutical preparations, which represent the folk medicine of the Tabarkins. The folk phytotherapy of the Tabarkins living in Calasetta and Carloforte is quite restricted compared with other folk phytotherapy recorded in similar recent ethnobotanical studies conducted in Sardinia. This could indicate that there has been a remarkable erosion of Traditional Knowledge (TK) within these two communities. Of particular interest are a few local medical uses we recorded that have never or only very rarely been documented in Italy; namely the use of Dittrichia graveolens (L.) Greuter as an anti-haemorrhoidal, of Centaurea calcitrapa L. as a remedy for malaria, of Glycyrrhiza glabra L. in <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>treatments,</b> and of Urtica dioica L. as an antiviral in cases of German measles. Most of the botanical species quoted in this research are referred to in the two centres using a local Ligurian idiom. Most of the medico-botanical uses we recorded are very similar to those collected in other ethnobotanical surveys carried out in Liguria and south-western Sardinia. Because there was no evidence in this research of any substantial ethnobotanical traces related to the communities' North-African experience, it would appear that the Tabarkins have readily adopted their host culture's use of medicinal plants and have retained their own traditional cognitive concepts and knowledge of the natural plant world through the language only...|$|R

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We performed ophthalmic examinations, including posterior segment examination, using indirect ophthalmoscopy to detect sight-threatening retinopathy {{in patients with}} diabetes in screening camps targeting a high-risk population. RESULTS — We examined 3, 949 persons with diabetes in 32 screening camps over a 13 -month period beginning July 2001. Most of the patients (93. 6 %) were aware of their diabetic status, and 84. 2 % of those aware of their diabetes status were on treatment.

Therefore, they have excellent therapeutic applications in ophthalmology. This manuscript presents four aspects of the therapeutic use of mAbs in ophthalmology: the scientific rationale, the unique characteristics of selected mAbs, the current state-of-the-art application, and relevant therapeutic mAbs for future applications in ophthalmology. We identified in the literature various single-agent therapies that inhibit the following targets: tumor necrosis factor (TNF), epithelial growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} receptor, platelet-derived growth factor, and cluster of differentiation antigens. the roles of all biochemical targets in ocular diseases were evaluated. Current and future mAbs against various cytokines were assessed for the treatment of ocular diseases. the medical literature showed the clinical benefits of mAbs for treating angiogenic and inflammatory ocular diseases. Two anti-VEGF mAbs, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, and three anti-TNF agents, infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, control Ocular neovascularization and intraocular inflammation. Other mAbs such as rituximab, daclizumab, efalizumab, and alemtuzumab showed positive results in animal and early clinical studies and may represent useful adjuvant therapies for ocular lymphoma or ocular inflammation. Ranibizumab is the only FDA-approved therapy; for other mAbs the so-called off-label application remains the standard. Intravenous administration of mAbs has demonstrated acceptable toxicity profiles, while intraocular injection may decrease the chances of systemic complications and increase the amount of drug available to the retina and choroid. in conclusion, effective clinical use of mAbs in ophthalmology is more commonly seen in the field of angiogenic vitreoretinal and autoimmune inflammatory diseases. the challenge for the future is combining biologic therapies to improve the quality and duration of responses while diminishing side effects. the role of mAbs within <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>treatments</b> will be defined according to future clinical experience and the results of randomized clinical trials.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the pathophysiological {{findings of a}} patient with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) showing giant conjunctival papillae. Methods: A 64 -year-old man who had mucosal-dominant PV with giant conjunctival papillae, resembling those of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), underwent an ophthalmological workup. The clinical and pathological findings were investigated. Results: Ophthalmic interventions were unable to provide the desired beneficial effects, and multiple excisions were necessary to remove the proliferative conjunctival lesions. Histopathological investigations of the excised tissues demonstrated acantholysis and a subconjunctival infiltration with numerous inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. However, in contrast to typical VKC, mast cells and eosinophils were rarely found in the subconjunctival tissues. Direct immunofluorescent staining showed a significant deposition of immunoglobulin G and complement component 3 in the epithelial intercellular substance, consistent with mucosal-dominant PV. Then, the patient was hospitalized because of oral erosion exacerbation and malnutrition. Because of the patient's declining general condition, we administered an increasing dose of a systemic steroid with an intravenous immunoglobulin, after which his ocular lesions and symptoms improved.
