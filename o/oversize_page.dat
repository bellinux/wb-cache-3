2500|$|By {{contrast}} Life, one of America's {{most popular}} weekly magazines from 1936 {{through the early}} 1970s, was filled with photographs reproduced beautifully on <b>oversize</b> 11×14-inch <b>pages,</b> using fine engraving screens, high-quality inks, and glossy paper. Life often published a United Press International (UPI) or Associated Press (AP) photo that had been first reproduced in newspapers, but the quality magazine version {{appeared to be a}} different photo altogether. In large part because their pictures were clear enough to be appreciated, and because their name always appeared with their work, magazine photographers achieved near-celebrity status. Life became a standard by which the public judged photography, and many of today's photo books celebrate [...] "photojournalism" [...] {{as if it had been}} the exclusive province of near-celebrity magazine photographers.|$|R
