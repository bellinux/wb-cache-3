500|$|The biggest {{trouble that}} we've had {{basically}} {{is that the}} song, [...] "Hold me Now" [...] was a huge hit, it was really big here, it was really big all over the world. Which is great, {{but it was just}} an accidental thing. It was just a song that we wrote. But after that then, we got everybody—managers, the record company—on <b>our</b> <b>back</b> to write [...] "Hold me Now, Part 2" [...] and harassing you to try and find a formula. But we can't really. We'll never find a formula for what we did. And that upsets some of them.|$|E

500|$|DC Comics {{co-publisher}} Dan DiDio {{explained the}} decision by stating that [...] "e didn't want to turn <b>our</b> <b>back</b> on the diversity issue, but she'll always be the most recognizable [...] We are working with concerns to diversify the line. We're always looking to re-position to be reflective of today's audience." [...] Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: [...] "For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises. It’s {{a bit of a}} shock, to be sure, but we’re {{doing everything we can to}} be respectful to this character’s amazing legacy, while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics readers will be experiencing for the first time... Barbara Gordon leaping, fighting, and swinging over Gotham. Now, when citizens of that city look up, they are going to see BATGIRL. And that is absolutely thrilling." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Jerry Claiborne {{took over}} as {{head coach of the}} Terrapins, which had only nine wins in the past five years. In his first season, Maryland {{improved}} to 5–5–1, and the following year, they reached their first bowl game in almost two decades. The team steadily improved until his fifth season, 1976, when they finished the regular season with an 11–0 record, their first perfect mark since Tatum's 1955 squad. Boomer Esiason later described Claiborne's coaching style as [...] "vanilla", and said his strategy was [...] "run right, run left, run up the middle, punt, and play good defense." [...] He went on to say, [...] "But, there's no question he made me a tougher player [...] [...] [...] We'd do drills where the quarterback had to take on a linebacker. It was like he had a sign on <b>our</b> <b>back,</b> 'Hit us, we're stupid'. It made you a tougher player." ...|$|E
500|$|The New Zealanders {{travelled}} to New York City, {{where they}} played an exhibition game, {{then on to}} San Francisco. There they played two official matches against British Columbia, and won both easily. The tour programme thus ended; New Zealand had played 35 games and lost only once. Gallaher had played in 26 of those matches, including four Tests. Over their 32 matches in the British Isles New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39; overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59. On their arrival back in New Zealand on 6March 1906, the All Blacks were welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 before being hosted at a civic reception in Auckland. Invited {{to speak at the}} reception, Gallaher said: [...] "We did not go behind <b>our</b> <b>back</b> to talk about the Welshman, but candidly said that on that day the better team had won. I have one recommendation to make to the New Zealand [...] Union, if it was to undertake such a tour again, and that is to play the Welsh matches first." ...|$|E

500|$|Sixteen {{songs were}} {{recorded}} for the album with only 11 making the final cut. The band {{made a conscious}} decision to keep the number of tracks, and therefore the running time of Hey Venus!, down [...] "because the last three albums have been almost an hour long". At just over 36 minutes, the album is the shortest full-length release by the band. Some of the songs left off the record were [...] "really heavy and raw" [...] as a result of which Gruff Rhys feels Hey Venus! is [...] "more consistent with <b>our</b> <b>back</b> catalogue". Both lead single [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] and [...] "Suckers!" [...] were originally cut from the album, for being [...] "too generic" [...] and too [...] "obvious ... melodically" [...] respectively, until the band were persuaded to reconsider. Rough Trade Records boss Geoff Travis told the group that [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] was his favourite song and, following the tracks reworking to include a French horn part, it was reinstated. Similarly [...] "Suckers!" [...] was [...] "really pushed" [...] by producer Dave Newfeld until it too took its place on Hey Venus!.|$|E

Hopefully, with the ETs' advanced technology and knowledge, {{they will be able}} to cure my spinal and walking problems and the damage to my vocal cord. Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 — based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real — but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled Why Me, ET?.

2500|$|According to Tarantino, {{the most}} {{difficult}} part of making the film was [...] "trying to take myself to a different place as a filmmaker and throw my hat in the ring with other great action directors", as opposed to the dialogue scenes he was known for. The House of Blue Leaves sequence, in which the Bride battles dozens of yakuza soldiers, took eight weeks to film, six weeks over schedule. Tarantino wanted to create [...] "one of the greatest, most exciting sequences in the history of cinema". The crew eschewed computer generated imagery in favor of traditional practical effects used in 1970s Chinese cinema, particularly by director Chang Cheh, including the use of fire extinguishers and condoms to create spurts and explosions of blood. Tarantino told his crew: [...] "Let's pretend we're little kids and we're making a Super 8 movie in <b>our</b> <b>back</b> yard, and you don't have all this shit. How would you achieve this effect? Ingenuity is important here!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{must have}} been when I was about 19 or 20 and went out {{training}} with a friend on the Belgian borders. As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on <b>our</b> <b>back</b> wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Maurice Garin well. I met him {{and talked}} to him almost every day because {{we lived in the}} same area, 200m from each other, at Lens. Le Père Garin, as my father and grandfather called him used to bring out a chair in fine weather and sit {{in the doorway of the}} little office of the service station he owned at 116 rue de Lille in [...] Lens, under the sign for Antar fuel and oil. My barber was in the neighbouring house and I used to go there once a month to have a crew cut, [...] which was the fashion in those days. My friends and I were aged seven to ten and on our one-speed bikes we used to pin numbers on <b>our</b> <b>back...</b> and we never missed riding past Maurice Garin in a tight group so that he would see. It's strange that nobody thought to take a picture of me, the little kid, alongside the first great champion of the biggest race in the world. But life's like that.|$|E
