2500|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the {{doctrine}} of divine healing had become {{an important part of}} Sandford's teaching. Initially skeptical, Sandford had resolved to “preach that part of the Bible” after attending an 1887 meeting where A.B. Simpson had spoken on the subject. [...] In 1897 Sandford also witnessed and praised the miracles of contemporary faith healer John Alexander Dowie. Soon Tongues of Fire reported healings of pneumonia, cancer, diphtheria, catarrh, [...] "sick headache," [...] sprained wrist, dropsy, typhoid, mental derangement, broken bones, and [...] "utter exhaustion." [...] A local three-year-old girl who had been pronounced permanently blind by medical authorities suddenly regained her sight after prayer was offered for her at Shiloh. But the most spectacular case was the [...] "resurrection" [...] of Olive Mills, who had been seriously ill, perhaps with spinal meningitis. Told Mills was dead, Sandford found her without breath or pulse. In desperation he shouted, [...] "Olive Mills! Come back! In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, come back!" [...] Almost immediately, Mills <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> within a few hours she was out of bed and dressed.|$|E
