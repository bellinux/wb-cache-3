Each design provides overcurrent protection through an inverse I squared T trip-out function with an automatic reset option and demonstrates step-applied fault capability with a 4000 -ampere surge, fast-risetime (low-inductance) power source. They also meet MIL - STD - 461 A specification for electromagnetic interference. The second generation RPCs traded <b>off</b> <b>specification</b> compliance for reduction in cost and complexity for the Type 1 and 2 designs and give comparable or improved performance in most areas.

30|$|After 40 {{iterations}} of the algorithm, {{the final}} regression model contains 22 variables. As anticipated by RAAL technicians, final product quality is strongly {{dependent on the}} crystal size distribution. Thus, the majority of variables in the model are for the percentage of particles above and below certain size limits at various stages of the manufacturing process. In particular, final quality is inversely proportional to the percentage of particles above and below certain in-house quality threshold values. Thus, if the model predicts that quality will be <b>off</b> <b>specification</b> five days into the future, RAAL can adjust conditions in precipitation accordingly. In addition to particle size, the variable to indicate significant system events was also included in the model. As expected, there was a strong positive correlation between final quality and the system event parameter. RAAL have less control over this variable. In the case of a plant shutdown, RAAL can modify their process to respond to the changes resulting from the shutdown. However, they have less control of the system for unforeseen events such as an equipment malfunction.|$|R

Namakwa Sands {{is a heavy}} mineral {{mining and}} {{beneficiation}} business within Tronox, and produces two major products, zircon (zr 02. Si 02 99. 9 %) and rutile (Ti 02 99. 9 %) at a combined annual rate of 140 kt. The heavy mineral concentrates are exported to international markets to make specialist coatings for the paints and ceramics industries. The ceramic industry is very strict on {{the purity of the}} minerals used. Namakwa Sands prides itself in being able to produce zircon and rutile at these requirements; however, strict requirements, especially in terms of Fe impurities (Fe 203 content in zircon concentrate must be < 600 ppm), limit the productivity and come at a cost to recovery. The concentration and separation of heavy minerals is a complex process, which utilizes conductivity differences between minerals. Zircon coated with iron oxides (Fe 203, FeOOH) reports as more conductive during electrostatic separation, which can result in a zircon particle to behave like a rutile particle and in this way cause both products (rutile and zircon) to become <b>off</b> <b>specification...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} amount of {{purchased}} fuels, more and more plants are making use of in-plant generated sources of gases. The availability of such waste gases is usually not constant, thus the total plant's mixed gas heating value swings accordingly. When this mixed gas is fed to the furnaces or boilers that are on strictly volumetric flow control loops, it causes large upsets in the heat release rate, even at a constant flow. These upsets, in turn, cause changes in process temperatures and/or pressures, resulting in <b>off</b> <b>specification</b> products and air pollution violations, and may even cause damage to equipment. The tendency is to operate routinely at a high excess air level, resulting in a much lower overall efficiency, or to even flare the gas. For many fuel gases, the heating value per standard unit volume varies linearly with the mass per standard unit volume. Perhaps a lesser realized fact it that the air required for combustion of 1000 Btu (net) heat release is almost independent of fuel molecular weight. This paper will describe the details of a technique developed by the Foxboro Company to measure the incoming fuel gas total Btu content by using a differential pressure transmitter and vortex flowmeter in series, generate a feed forward signal to maximize overall efficiency through transients, and to do it without compromising any of the safety constraints of the furnace...|$|R

40|$|Issue: A clear {{understanding}} of the desired specification is necessary for wood waste processors to produce a feedstock suitable for composting, whether that material is to be used by the processor themselves or sold to another company. For composting, the critical characteristics may include: • acceptable size distribution • allowable contamination levels Failure to comply with specifications for utilization of wood waste in this application will lead to performance problems and dissatisfied customers. Best Practice: This best practice recommends that suppliers (processors) of wood waste and potential end-users come to a {{clear understanding}} of quality requirements for <b>compost</b> feedstocks. Written <b>specifications</b> should be developed and made available to purchasers of the compost feedstocks, or developed cooperatively with potential customers.

The biodegradable fraction of the autoclaved household waste (‘floc’) was manually separated by screening and underwent characterization for its Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni, and Zn content. Autoclaving did not guarantee the production of compost/digestate that met the UK <b>specification</b> for <b>compost,</b> BSi PAS 100, without restrictions being made on {{the composition of the}} waste feedstock. Results indicate that the levels of Zn and Cd associated with floc materials alone could lead to compost limit values being exceeded. For all other potentially toxic elements (PTEs), the estimated excessive (i. e. above levels of compliance) PTEs levels for compost/digestate were mainly due to external (i. e. non-floc) materials, primarily electronic/electrical waste. Batteries may have also contributed to the high levels of Zn and Hg. In this study, for all PTEs examined, with the exception of Cd and Zn, autoclaving had a performance comparable to that of the most effective mechanical biological treatment systems...|$|R

This research on the Interlock House aims to develop an alert system to notify when the house is operating below efficiency and for identifying abnormal data caused by sensor errors/failures. Additionally, the system would assist in controlling environmental settings. There are three parameters for operating this alert system. The first parameter, used to signify if a sensor is malfunctioning, includes the range for each sensor’s capabilities based <b>off</b> technical <b>specifications.</b> The second parameter, derived from historical data, signifies data that does not have historical precedence (ex. record breaking temperatures). The third parameter, depending on what the specific sensor is measuring, focuses on either the range of human comfort or equipment specifications, using the maximum and minimum again, to control environmental settings and identify when a mechanical component is malfunctioning. Together, the historical data and equipment standards aid in identifying when the house is operating below efficiency. The ideal results of this research would improve the energy efficiency of the Interlock House and thereby provide a model for improving the efficiency of other buildings...|$|R

Despite the desire for urbanization and expansion of the economy, this growth increases the amount of construction, which, if not properly managed, can increase non-point source pollution and threaten surface water quality. Therefore, Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has approved and promoted the use of compost as a stormwater best management practice (BMP) during highway construction. The objectives of this study were to construct and calibrate an indoor rainfall simulator and to determine the effectiveness of using compost rather than conventional hydroseeding or topsoil to reduce erosion from disturbed soils. Runoff rates, interrill erosion, and interrill erodibility were determined and compared across five compost treatments following TxDOT <b>specifications</b> for <b>compost</b> applied as an erosion control and two control treatments of topsoil (TS) and hydroseeding (HS) applied at 5 cm depth. The simulator produced 89 % uniformity using ten Veejet 80100 nozzles at a target rate of 100 mm h- 1. The surface runoff was collected after 5 minutes of rainfall (first flush) and during the last 30 minutes of rainfall (steady-state). The first flush mean runoff for GUC- 5 treatment was significantly higher than all other treatments. All other treatments; 50 % woodchips and 50 % compost blend (ECC- 1. 3, ECC- 5), and hydroseeding (HS) had significantly lower runoff and erosion rates compared to topsoil (TS) and compost manufactured topsoil (CMT) at first flush and steady-state. Furthermore, there were no performance differences between 1. 3 cm and 5 cm compost applications at first flush or steady-state. The results of this project indicate that particle size, soil moisture capabilities, and time at which rainfall is applied affect surface runoff. TxDOT specification of using ECC at 5 cm depth on a max of 3 : 1 slope should be reconsidered. An ECC application depth of 1. 3 cm was effective in reducing first flush runoff and interrill erosion rates...|$|R

Traditional deadreckoned underwater navigation methods result in unbounded error growth as subsea vehicles do not typically have access to an absolute position reference. Synchronous-clock acoustic navigation systems can provide one-way travel time (OWTT) range constraints to nearby vehicle nodes thereby bounding error. Several distributed estimation algorithms for such scenarios have been proposed by the community; however, each makes fundamentally different trade <b>offs</b> in various <b>specifications</b> such as scalability, complexity, directionality, and consistency.
