40|$|Please {{be advised}} that this {{information}} was generated on 2016 - 05 - 12 and {{may be subject to}} change. Sensory systems are specialized cells of plants and animals sensitive to swift variations in the environment. To Aristotle’s five human senses (vision, hear-ing, taste, smell and touch) comparatively recent research added many more structures with the capacity to react upon internal or external events or stim-uli. Beyond his senses man has several extrasensory ways to gather knowledge such as reason, intuition, introspection, the mind’s eye and mysticism. The combined activity of sensory systems and the brain leads to assembly of information from the environmental bombardment of 4 -D stimuli. This results in experience most of which remains unconscious. As a relatively late spandrel like phenomenon of evolution consciousness arose.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the possibility to omit the time-consuming monocular vision measurement in the subjective visual vertical (SVV) test by demonstrating that there is no difference in the results between binocular and monocular measurements. Thirty-one patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma and 20 normal subjects as controls were involved. Both binocular and monocular measurements of SVV were performed. The main outcome of this study was the difference in the results of SVV between binocular and monocular measurements. There were no significant differences in the tilts of the SVV between binocular and monocular measurements in vestibular schwannoma patients as well as in the controls. Abnormal tilts of SVV may be evaluated precisely only by binocular vision instead of monocular vision. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 乙第 32 号 学位授与年月日:平成 26 年 2 月 5 日Author: Yuzuru Sainoo, M. Terakado, D.

40|$|Bone {{conduction}} (BC) {{is the way}} {{sound energy}} is transmitted by the skull bones to the cochlea causing a sound perception. Even if the BC sound transmission involves several pathways including sound pressure induced in the ear canal, inertial forces acting on the middle ear ossicles and cochlear fluids, alteration of the cochlear space, and pressure transmission through the 3 rd window of the cochlea, the BC sound ultimately produces a wave motion on the basilar membrane {{similar to that of}} air-conducted sound. The efficiency of the BC stimulation is largely dependent on the skull bone where the skull acts as a rigid body at low frequencies and incorporates different types of wave transmission at higher frequencies. The interaural stimulation difference is determined by the difference between contralateral and ipsilateral BC sound transmission: the transcranial BC sound transmission. To benefit from binaural processing, the transcranial transmission should be low, while the same should be high when using BC hearing aids for unilateral deaf subjects. By appropriately positioning the stimulation, high or low transcranial transmission can be achieved.

Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} further investigate the biophysical role of the cytoskeletal element; the F-actin, intracellular reorganization and its polymerization in mast cell priming of chemotaxis function. In the present communication it is shown by immunofluoresence confocal microscopy analysis that physical F-actin intracellular reorganization in a membrane bound manner on uman mast cell is involved in VIP-induced priming of human mast cell chemotaxis against FKN. The F-actin reorganization was calcium independent and without modifi cation of its contents as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell scanning analysis. These results identify a novel role for the biophysical association of F-actin in the crosstalk between neuro-inflammatory mediators and mast cells and may be an important target for therapeutic modalities in allergic inflammation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate short- and long-term effects of radiofrequency treatment of the soft palate on snoring. Twenty-nine patients with habitual snoring were studied prospectively and treated up to four times at 4 - 6 week intervals with an Ellman Surgitrone((R)). Electromyography (EMG) of m. palatoglossus was performed in ten patients. Patients and partners evaluated snoring, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness 1 week preoperatively, 6 months and 3 - 4 years postoperatively. Snoring was reduced postoperatively (P < 0. 0001). Sleep time increased, daytime sleepiness was reduced, and the partners slept better after 6 months. However, 3 - 4 years postoperatively only 25 % of patients were satisfied. Another 25 % had received additional treatment. EMG was normal in 6 / 10 patients preoperatively. They all continued to snore postoperatively. Four patients had pathological EMGs; three were responders. In conclusion, radiofrequency treatment for snoring may lead to long-term improvement in one out of four cases. Pre-evaluation with EMG may predict the outcome.

40|$|In his {{clinical}} and experimental observations on Heinz bodies in various diseases {{in the field}} of <b>oto-rhino-laryngology</b> and acatalasemia the author obtained the following results. 1. The mean estimated value of Heinz bodies in normal persons has been 61 ‰ in male and 73 ‰ in female. 2. In chronic sinuitis and chronic otitis media an intermediate acceleration in Heinz body fomation can be seen and only a mild acceleration in chronic tonsillitis. However, no significant fall in the hematocrit value can be recognized in any of these cases. 3. In the patients with cancer {{in the field of}} <b>oto-rhino-laryngology</b> the advanced acceleration in the Heinz body formation can be recognized, {{at the same time the}} hematocrit value reveals a considerable fall in a reverse proportion to the acceleration. 4. In acatalasemia despite the hematocrit value being within the normal range, the formation of Heinz bodies reveals the highest acceleration. 5. The increment in Heinz bodients in the patients gradually begins to fall after the operative removal of lesions and returns to the normal level, while in the case of malignant tumor it hardly declines even after the removal of tumor. 6. In the estimation of Heinz bodies, the higher acceleration can be recognized in the case where catalase in blood is decreased rather than in the case of anemia. 7. when HCl-hydroxylamine is made to act on pigeons and ducks, having an extremely small amount of catalase in blood, and hens and rabbits supposedly to have normal amount of blood catalase, pigeons show the most marked increment in the Heinz body formation, while on the other hand no significant acceleration can be recognized in hens. 8. When hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2)) solution is made to act on the blood of the four animals mentioned above, the acceleration in the Heinz body formation is most striking in pigeons followed by ducks, rabbits, and hens in that order, showing an extremely mild formation of Heinz bodies in hens. 9. In the daily examinations of the blood in the pigeons and hens injected continuously with H(2) O(2), the pigeons reveal a marked increment in Heinz bodins, showing about 87 per cent of the blood, while hens an increase of only about 35 per cent of the blood tested. 10. In the daily examinations of the blood of the pigeons given successive injections of HCl-hydroxylamine the Heinz body formation can be observed far more promptly than in the case of H(2) O(2) -injections in almost 100 per cent of the blood tested. 11. In the daily estimation of Heinz bodies in the blood of the animals receiving successive injections of H(2) O(2) -solutionor HCl-hydroxylamine, the decrease in Heinz bodies contained in erythrocytes commences on the fourth day after the start of injection and returns to the normal level on about the seventh day. 12. Judging from these results, it seems that the presence or the absence of catalase in blood is closely associated with the mechanism of the Heinz body formation. In other words, it is assumed that blood toxin or blood toxin-like substance induces the change in the blood pH, and because of this the catalase activity is either inhibited or inactivated, and it is gradually led from oxidative degeneration of blood components to the formation of Heinz bodies...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies on}} the {{hemolytic}} actions of Pneumonococci and streptococci {{have been carried out}} up to date, but they are all on the catalasemic blood while those on the acatalasemic blood are scarce. And ever since the discovery of acatalasemic patients in the department of <b>oto-rhino-laryngology</b> of our school, various clinical studies have been conducted. Prompted by the urgency of studying the latter, the author have conducted the experiments to clarify the hemolytic action of each bacterium mentioned above on the acatalasemic blood. As for the bacteria of the present experiment, Pneumococci type I, II and III, St. hemolyticus (Cook's strain), and St. viridans have been selected. As for the catalase carrier, the blood of man, domestic rabbit, goat and guinea pig have been employed, and for the acatalase carrier, the blood of domestic duck or that of goose. Thereupon the following results have been obtained: 1. In the case of the 4 % blood agar medium, the presence or the absence of catalase in the culture medium makes almost no difference in the growth of each bacterium. 2. P(II), P(III), St. hemolyticus and St. viridans form the larger hemolytic and the Met Hb rings in the acatalasemic medium than in the catalase medium. As for P(I), it scarcely forms any hemolytic ring in either medium, but its MetHb ring is the largest of all. 3. In the acatalase carrier medium, the large discolored rings are formed, and this can be construed to be due to a pentdyopent reaction. 4. In the 1 %-glucose medium, the growth of bacteria is better and the hemolytic and the discolored rings are far larger. It seems that the formation of MetHb is somewhat inhibited in this medium. 5. In the anaerobic medium, the formation of MetHb is far less than that in the aerobic medium...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study is to evaluate short- and long-term postoperative morbidity and mortality of hypopharyngeal resection and reconstruction. Patients with laryngopharyngeal malignancies were treated with laryngopharyngectomy and the resulting defect was reconstructed with an anterolateral thigh flap. The study group consisted of 20 patients {{with one or more}} primary hypopharyngeal carcinomas or a relapse of this tumour. All patients were diagnosed and operated in the University Medical Center between February 2000 and July 2007. Data were collected from the clinical medical files of the departments of plastic surgery and <b>oto-rhino-laryngology.</b> The dietetic and speech therapy files were used as well. To study the quality of life, the Dutch version of the University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire was sent to all surviving patients. The microsurgical reconstructions were 100 % successful. Fifteen patients (75. 0 %) died during the follow-up period; the 5 -year overall survival was 20 %. Complications such as post-surgical fistulas and strictures requiring surgical intervention were found in five (25. 0 %) and six patients (30. 0 %), respectively. Other post-surgical complications such as wound dehiscence were seen in two patients (10. 0 %). The incidence of donor-site complications at the thigh was very low. No significant relationship was found among preoperative patients' characteristics like age, gender, preoperative radiotherapy, the TNM (tumour, node, metastasis) classification of the tumour and the risk of post-surgical complications. The number and/or the severity of the complications were not significantly associated with the duration of surgery or ischaemia time. In our view, surgery is a good option in the treatment of these patients. Although curative treatment is the best outcome, a satisfactory palliation in itself can be a justification for this type of surgery. Although only seven patients were able to answer the QOL questionnaire, the positive judgements of these patients support this view point...|$|E
40|$|By {{applying}} three methods, namely, the precipitin {{reaction in}} acid medium with the antigen-antibody reaction, the measuring method of heat-noncoagulant protein in determining the serum mucoid content, and the methylene-blue reduction test using the oxdization phenomenon of sulfide ions, on the cancers occurring {{in the field of}} <b>oto-rhino-laryngology</b> as the follow-up study, the efficacy of these three methods has been evaluated. The following are {{the results of the present}} investigation: In the case of cancer patient before treatment the reliability of the precipitin reaction {{in acid medium}} and the measuring method of heat-noncoagulant protein shows the average rate of 80 per cent in general; and these prove to be useful as auxiliary methods for diagnosis. However, the rate of the reliability of the methylene-blue reduction test is poor and therefore its usefulness in diagnosis is low. It is worthy of attention that all these tests gave relatively high rate of positive reaction even in the subjects with diseases such as pharyngeal tuberculosis, peritonsillar abeess and tumors other than cancer. In applying these tests after the treatment, no significant difference can be recognized in the positive rate of methylene-blue reduction test as compared with that before threatment, but in the other two tests the positive rate has been markedly lowered, namely, cancer reaction tended to be negative. With respect to the course after the treatment likewise the methylene-blue reduction test does not coincide with the course of the progress, and only in the case of pharyngeal cancer the recurrence of the cancer can be observed when pseudo-positive or positive continues. The other two methods usually coincide with the course; and in the majority of recurrence cases either positive reaction precedes the recurrence or it turns positive simultaneously with recurrence. Even in the cases with satisfactory improvement, these two methods generally coincide with the progress of the disease after treatment, but there have been a few cases which were positive yet without recurrence...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Chronic {{tonsillitis}} (CT) {{occupies a}} leading {{place in the}} structure of general <b>Oto-rhino-laryngology</b> (ORL) pathology which is characterized by a tendency to {{an increase in the number}} of patients with recurrent course, the development of complications and the diversity of etiopathogenetic mechanisms of onset. It has been established that the most acceptable tactic for the prevention of exacerbations of chronic tonsillitis is the use of various groups of drugs that enhance the humoral immunity of the mucous membranes. The drug Ismigen is an immunostimulant based on a bacterial lysate, which increases the body's resistance to infections due to an increase in serum and secretory antibodies, activation of cellular and humoral factors of nonspecific immunity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of Ismigen in the complex treatment of patients with chronic decompensated tonsillitis by studying the dynamics of microbiological indicators. Materials and methods. To achieve this goal, 31 patients with chronic decompensated tonsillitis (CDT) were examined. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the proposed treatment regimen: Group A: patients with chronic decompensated tonsillitis who underwent laser tonsillotomy - 15 patients; Group B: patients with chronic decompensated tonsillitis who underwent laser tonsillotomy with further immunostimulation with the drug Ismigen - 16 patients. The control group (CG) consisted of 17 practically healthy individual. Patient in group B had sublingual Ismigen postoperatively: once daily for a period for a period of 10 days. Microbiological examination of the material from the mucous membranes of the tonsils or oropharynx was carried out in dynamics before the treatment, 7 days after the treatment and 1 - 2 months after the end of the course of treatment. A comprehensive assessment of the status of the oropharynx microbiocenosis was carried out in accordance with the criteria described earlier. According to these criteria, the status of the microbiocenosis of the oropharynx was divided into: eubiosis, dysbiosis of the 1 st degree, dysbiosis of the 2 nd degree and dysbiosis of the 3 rd degree. Results and discussion. Before treatment, in the decompensated state of CT (59. 7 ± 2. 8) ...|$|E
40|$|Development of the eardrum {{retraction}} pocket, as pathologic finding, depends on Eustachian tube dysfunction, {{onset of the}} middle ear infection and site of development of retraction on the eardrum. The study is aimed at: 1. Determining the incidence of {{eardrum retraction}} pocket and cholesteatoma within it, {{as well as at the}} degree of eardrum retraction; 2. Determining of association between eardrum retraction pocket and changes of the eardrum mucosaand parstensa of the tympanic membrane; 3. Determining of onset and intensity of the bone destruction in eardrum retraction pocket; 4. Examining of Eustachian tube function based on time of mucocilliary transport according to the type of the eardrum retraction pocket. The study is based on the retrospective analysis of the results obtained from the patients treated at the Institute of <b>Oto-Rhino-Laryngology</b> and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinical Centre of Serbia in Belgrade for the diagnosis of the chronic suppurative otitis who underwent otosurgical procedures during the six-year period, from 1996 - 2001. In our series of 540 patients subjected to otosurgical treatment, the incidence of the retraction pocket of the eardrum was 11. 23 %. Onset of more severe degree of eardrum retraction was most frequent in the attic. Cholesteatoma was detected in 82. 2 % of patients of the group with the attic-retraction pocket of the eardrum, as well as in 25 % of patients of the group of tensa-sinus retraction pocket of the eardrum. Atrophic changes of the tympanic membrane pars tensa were detected in almost all tensa-sinus retraction pockets of the eardrum. Approximately one half of the attic-retraction pockets of the eardrum were accompanied by eardrum atrophy. Bone destruction of the auditory ossicles was limited to the long process of incus and superior structures of stapes. Time of the mucocilliary transport was significantly longer (p< 0. 01) in attic-retraction pocket of the eardrum than in tensa-sinus retraction pocket of the eardrum, indicating significance of tube in development of attic-retraction pocket of the tympanic membrane. Reversible changes {{of the middle ear}} mucosa were evidenced in three quarters of the tensa-sinus retraction pockets of the eardrum indicating that inflammation is the major factor influencing onset of tensa-sinus retraction pocket of the eardrum...|$|E
