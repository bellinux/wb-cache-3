5|$|With {{regard to}} sexual <b>orientation</b> categories, asexuality may be argued {{as not being}} a {{meaningful}} category {{to add to the}} continuum, and instead argued as the lack of a sexual <b>orientation</b> or sexuality. Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality, anxiety or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context of sexual <b>orientation</b> identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual <b>orientation</b> identity category.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{polycrystal}} grain <b>orientations</b> on the indentation hardness were studied {{by both the}} experimental investigation and numerical simulation. The surface grain <b>orientations</b> of the sample were measured using the electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) technique, and are divided into three types of grains according to the characteristics of <b>orientations.</b> The indentation experiment was carried out on the surface grains with various <b>orientations</b> as the same direction of the indenter axis. According to the polycrystalline plastic forming theory, a new finite element method (FEM) model was established and the indentation processes on the grains with <b>orientations</b> of [111] and [100] were numerically simulated. By comparing the hardness from simulation results with those of experiments, the new FEM model considering grain <b>orientations</b> was validated.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{clarification}} of science teacher <b>orientations</b> {{as a potential}} component of pedagogical content knowledge. Science teaching <b>orientations</b> and beliefs about science held by 237 preservice science teachers were gathered via content-specific vignettes and questionnaire, respectively, prior to participation in a UK-based teacher education program. Data presented support Didactic, Academic Rigor, conceptual change, activity driven, and inquiry <b>orientations</b> as intuitive teacher stances. The paper proposes a continuum for these five science teaching <b>orientations,</b> ordered by potential teaching quality that {{may be useful to}} science teacher educators. Even though all participants were qualified scientists, naïve beliefs about science were prevalent, with few examples of informed and partially informed beliefs. Alignment of <b>orientations</b> and beliefs shows that <b>orientations</b> override preservice teachers’ notions of science teaching. Therefore, a further recommendation based on these data is that preservice science teachers’ beliefs about science are regarded as a component of subject matter knowledge and excluded from science teaching <b>orientations...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{computation}} of rotation-invariant similarity measures of convex polyhedra, based on Minkowski's theory of mixed volumes. To compute the similarity measure, a (mixed) volume functional {{has to be}} minimized {{over a number of}} critical <b>orientations</b> of these polyhedra. These critical <b>orientations</b> are those relative configurations where faces and edges of the two polyhedra are as much as possible parallel. Two types of critical <b>orientations</b> exist for two polyhedra A and B. Type- 1 critical <b>orientations</b> are those relative <b>orientations</b> where a face of B is parallel to a face of A, and an edge of B is parallel to a face of A, or vice versa. Type- 2 critical <b>orientations</b> correspond to the case that three edges of A are parallel to three faces of B, or vice versa. It has been conjectured that to perform minimization of the volume functional, it is sufficient to consider Type- 1 critical <b>orientations</b> only. Here we present experimental proof showing this conjecture to be false...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} three forest value <b>orientations</b> – {{clusters of}} interrelated values and basic beliefs about forests – {{that emerged from}} {{an analysis of the}} public discourse about forest planning, management, and policy in the United States. The value <b>orientations</b> include anthropocentric, biocentric, and moral/ spiritual/aesthetic <b>orientations</b> toward forests. Computer coded content analysis was used to identify shifts in the relative importance of these value <b>orientations</b> over the period 1980 through 2001. The share of expressions of anthropocentric forest value <b>orientations</b> declined over this period, while the share of biocentric value expressions increased. Moral/spiritual/aesthetic value expressions remained constant over time. The observed shifts in forest value <b>orientations</b> have im-plications for identifying appropriate goals for public forest management and policy, developing socially acceptable means for accomplishing those goals, and dealing with inevitable conflict over forest management...|$|R

This construction uses notably an active decomposition for <b>orientations</b> of a graph which extends the notion of components for acyclic <b>orientations</b> with unique given sink...|$|R
