40|$|AIRBNB: ASSESSING ITS SUSTAINABILITY USING A TBL FRAMEWORK IN ATHENS, GA Introduction The {{growth of}} the sharing economy has been widely noted from Fortune {{magazine}} to President Obama (Eckhardt 2 ̆ 6 Bardhi 2015). It is also touted {{as one of the}} 10 ideas that will change the world in the 21 st Century (Teubner 2014). Moreover, its potential to reduce waste within economic, social, and environmental processes has been dubbed as important as the Industrial Revolution in terms of how we value ownership of goods and services (Belk 2014). The sharing economy was valued at 26 billion in 2013 (Geron 2013 b; Cannon 2 ̆ 6 Summers 2014). Airbnb, a major shared-lodging player in this economy, was valued at 10 billion in April 2014 (Ember 2014) with more than 11 million guests choosing between more than 600, 000 private accommodations in more than 34, 000 cities and 192 countries (Smolka 2 ̆ 6 Hienerth 2014). With this type of growth, Airbnb has earned attention from the global hospitality and tourism industry because of its ability to secure what some might see as an unfair economic competitive advantage by circumventing sales and <b>occupancy</b> <b>taxes,</b> the two major sources of income for CVBs and DMOs, and its ability to supply inexpensive accommodations in the heart of tourist centers (Zervas, Prosperio, 2 ̆ 6 Byers 2014). While the economic competitive advantage presents a challenge to traditional accommodation options, the true impacts of Airbnb have not been studied from a triple bottom line (TBL) framework assessing economic, social, and environmental impacts (Dubois 2015; Sigala 2014). This study aims to study whether Airbnb participants are creating net economic, social, and environmental value to the Athens, GA community. Literature Review While shared-economy literature has primarily addressed economic impacts, analyzing economic, socio-cultural and environmental impacts underneath a triple bottom line framework helps in assessing the sharing economy’s potential to contribute to sustainable development, particularly in tourism (Elkington 1994; Dwyer 2005). Below is a brief review of the research within each of the three categories of the TBL. Economic Impacts Hosts’ and guests’ economic motivations for engaging in the sharing economy have been examined from a variety of methods such as consumer segmentation (Müller 2014), online surveys (Tussyadiah 2015), semi-structured interviews with hosts (Bardhi, Eckhardt 2 ̆ 6 Arnould 2012), and web crawlers investigating price reaction within online rating platforms (Gutt 2 ̆ 6 Hermann 2015). Researchers have also attempted to understand participation from the theoretical lenses of the theory of planned behavior and social exchange theory (Matzner et al. 2015; Ikkala 2015; Kim, Yoon, 2 ̆ 6 Zo 2015). Research has identified economic incentives such as earning more in collaborative production than in the traditional market place, cost consciousness (Bardhi et al. 2012; Hamari et al. 2013; Dubois 2015); time, space and effort saving as reasons for participating in the sharing economy. The degree of negative economic impacts of Airbnb demand on the supply of traditional lodging options varies by lodging type (Zervas, Prosperio, 2 ̆ 6 Byers 2015). For example, in a study by Zervas et al. (2014), it was found that in Houston, Texas, lower-end hotels and motels that do not cater to business travelers were the most affected with a 0. 05...|$|R

40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{three decades of}} {{intensive}} growth in tourism place enormous stress on natural assets of industry. The increasing tourism fatigue, the environmental degradation, noise, congestion at airports and the negative socio-economic impacts slow down {{the rate of growth}} and brought a new concern with the environment and with it limits to growth. In spite of concerns about the environmental destruction will limit the further growth of tourism this perspective should mean the most sustainable pattern of development, if the industry is to survive over the long term. This paper is an attempt to estimate and analyse the Tourist carrying capacity in Algarve. 'The methodology was supported in a model that evaluated simultaneously the Tourist population and the index of consumption. The main indicators used were: Consumption index of transports, seasonally index, <b>occupancy</b> and activity <b>taxes</b> and capacity of infrastructures. These indicators when related with some territorial indexes should indicate the economic infrastructures, other services and resources constraints to a maximum level of tourism. Some of the indicators used have been suggested by the Tourism World Organisation and by territorial plans at the region level. The conclusion present some reflections about the limited capacity of some resources and the possible strategies available to a sustainable development of the sector. ...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedRedevelopment {{has been}} the current {{dominant}} institutional form through which local municipal and county governments in Nevada and California have pursued the processes and goals of urban revitalization and urban economic development for the past half century. In both states, local redevelopment agencies have generated {{billions of dollars in}} new property tax revenues, sales <b>tax</b> revenues, transient <b>occupancy</b> and hotel <b>tax</b> revenues, and business license revenues. Local redevelopment agencies have also been responsible for creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in physically and economically blighted neighborhoods. Local communities in both Nevada and California have come to rely heavily upon redevelopment to generate billions of dollars in direct and indirect economic impact.; But over the next 15 to 20 years, the majority of existing local redevelopment project areas will begin to expire. Recent political, social, economic, and legal trends suggest that redevelopment has become an increasingly unpopular way for local governments to pursue the goals of urban revitalization and urban economic development. The courts and the state legislatures in Nevada and California have issued judgments and passed legislation {{over the past two decades}} that have continually sought to reduce the effectiveness of redevelopment in the urban environment. An opportunity exists today to consider alternative institutional arrangements that can address the criticisms of contemporary local redevelopment, including the criticisms that property-based economic development strategies are insufficient to meet the goals of urban revitalization and urban economic development, that local redevelopment agencies lack a regional economic development focus, that redevelopment is used to further fiscalize existing land uses, and that the use of eminent domain and possible principal-agent corruption of local redevelopment agencies renders local redevelopment agencies incapable of achieving true urban revitalization.; Future institutional arrangements of urban revitalization and urban economic development in Nevada and California must embrace non-property based economic development strategies and employ them using a regional focus. To do so, a new system of incentives, using a network-based model of government, must drive the future efforts of local governments to eliminate and mitigate physical and economic blight while encouraging true urban economic activity...|$|R
