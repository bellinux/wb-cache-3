5|$|After 1700 British {{continental}} {{policy was}} to contain expansion by competing powers such as France and Spain.

5|$|Although Blake {{was himself}} a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> Regency, he was junior to Castaños in the {{military}} hierarchy (but senior to Ballasteros).

5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came to light, the GAL issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with questions over whether members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> government and state security service {{had known about}} the group's operations in places like Bayonne and, if so, to what extent they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, José Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the GAL case. In 1998, both were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and {{misappropriation of public funds}} to finance the GAL. Along with various corruption scandals and the poor state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> economy in the mid-1990s, the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the PSOE defeat.|$|E

5|$|Captain San Pedro {{detected}} {{the movements of}} the American troops from his positions on a nearby hill and ordered his men to open fire.

Puig was expecting reinforcements from Yauco which did not arrive and was ordered to disengage and retreat. Before retreating the right wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> force, which was not overrun, initiated a flanking attack against two positions held by the Illinois and Massachusetts companies. The unexpected strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> force caused some of the 6th Massachusetts troops to momentarily panic, but the Spanish forces were eventually driven off.
