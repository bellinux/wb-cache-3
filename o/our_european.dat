We British have a thousand year history of self-government. We have been free and democratic longer than any other nation. The European Union is too diverse, too bureaucratic, too corporatist and too centralist to be a functioning democracy. We are happy to trade with <b>our</b> <b>European</b> friends and the rest of the world – but we would prefer to govern ourselves.|$|E

500|$|Despite his expulsion, in July 1970 the Labour-controlled Merthyr council offered Davies {{the freedom}} of the borough, an honour which he politely declined; the {{confidence}} of the people recently shown him was, he said, enough. He resumed his place in parliament, on the opposition benches as Labour had unexpectedly lost the election to Edward Heath's Conservatives. Despite some ill-feeling, Davies was not ostracised by his erstwhile colleagues, and was unofficially briefed by the party. He limited his Commons appearances and rarely spoke in debates, generally preferring to serve his constituents from home. On the major national issue of the 1970–74 parliament—Heath's renewed bid for Britain's membership of the European Economic Community (EEC)—Davies voiced uncompromising opposition. In a letter to the South Wales Echo on 9 August 1971 he challenged the government's claim that [...] "our security has been bound up with <b>our</b> <b>European</b> neighbours for over a thousand years", pointing out Britain's involvement in numerous European wars, [...] "including the Hitler war when British security meant co-operation with Russia".|$|E
