40|$|There {{has been}} much {{uncertainty}} as to whether metastasis requires mutation at the time <b>of</b> <b>spread.</b> Here, we use clinical data to calculate the probability <b>of</b> the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> melanoma and breast cancer cells. These calculations reveal that the probability <b>of</b> the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> cancer cells is relatively high for small tumours (∼ 1 event <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> for every 500 cells for melanomas of 0. 1 [*]mm) and declines as tumours increase in size (∼ 1 event <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> for every 108 cells for melanomas of 12 [*]mm). The probability <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer cells from the lymph nodes to the periphery is ∼ 1 event <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> for every 108 cells in the nodal masses, which have a mean diameter of 5 [*]mm, while the probability <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> cancer cells from the breast to the periphery when the primary masses are 5 [*]mm is also ∼ 1 event <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> for every 108 cells. Thus, the occurrence of an event <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> from the breast to the lymph nodes appears not to increase the propensity of the progeny of those cells to spread from the lymph nodes to the periphery.

40|$|International audienceEruptive {{fires are}} one of the main causes of human losses in forest fire fighting. The sudden change in fire {{behaviour}} due to a fire eruption is extremely dangerous for fire-fighters because it is unpredictable. Very little literature is available to support either modelling or occurrence prediction for this phenomenon. In this study, an unsteady physical model <b>of</b> fire <b>spread</b> is detailed, which describes the initiation and development of eruptive fires with an induced wind sub-model. The latter phenomenon is proposed as the mainspring of fire eruptions. Induced wind is proportional to the rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> and the rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> is in a non-linear relationship with induced wind. This feedback can converge or diverge depending on the conditions. The model allows both explaining why an eruption can occur and predicting explicitly its occurrence according to meteorological conditions, topographic parameters, fuel bed properties and fire front width. The model is tested by comparing its results to a set of experiments carried out at laboratory scale and during an outdoor wildfire, the Kornati accident.

In ancient times the method of examination was by the usage of trividha pariksha, dasha vidha pariksha and also ashta sthana pariksha. Ashta sthana pariksha represents both the clinical assessment as well as the laboratory investigations of those times. Among the ashta sthana pariksha, mutra pariksha is one which proves to be an important aid in diagnosis as well as assessing the prognosis of a disease. The taila bindu pariksha which is a part of the mutra pariksha helps in assessing the prognosis of a disease and hence the present study was undertaken to revalidate the same. Kamala is a clinical condition characterised by peeta mutrata. Hence the study was under taken on a single group of 30 patients of kamala to evaluate the prognosis by Taila bindu pariksha. The urine samples collected from the patients were subjected for tailabindu pariksha.

In addition, a fixed point bifurcation is investigated using the rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> tumor as a varying parameter, suggesting that backward bifurcation can occur under reasonable choice of parameters. However, bistable dynamics is unlikely to happen in this case, which implies that the strategies that could reduce the rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> tumor are the most influential to cancer treatment. Through mathematical deduction and numerical simulation, an elaborate uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> tumor R_s is performed.

5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>spreading</b> rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2003 Andrew S. MacAulayMassive short distance spotting has been suspected of increasing the forward rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> bushfires since McArthur (1967) attributed a three-fold increase in rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> to short distance spotting at a fire in Daylesford. However, research into spotting has generally focussed on the prediction of long distance spotting, perhaps because of its more obvious effects on suppression of bushfires. The amount of spotting that a fire generates and the distance that spotfires start from the main fire {{is dependent on the}} amount and type of bark fuel present, as this is the primary source of embers. Existing models of fire behaviour have proposed only one model that allows spotting to influence the forward rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the main fire - the formation of pseudo fire fronts. This thesis proposes two new inl 1 uence mechanisms; pre-frontal burnout and the "indraught effect". Three hypotheses have been formed to test these three influence mechanisms. As it is difficult, costly and dangerous to use high intensity fires for experimental purposes, a fire simulation model (SAROS) was developed to run on a personal computer. The SAROS model is based on the McArthur fire behaviour model (1967), with the addition of mechanisms that allow spotting to affect the forward rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the main fire. SAROS has been tested against data from fires where spotting was thought to have significantly increased the forward rate <b>of</b> <b>spread,</b> and is shown to be a reasonable model of fire behaviour. Further experiments were carried out to test the sensitivity of the model to the input variables and the impact of each of the variables in the model on changes in forward rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> due to spotting. The SAROS model shows that it is possible for massive short distance spotting to increase the forward rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> by over 300 % of the McArthur predicted rate <b>of</b> <b>spread.</b> However under the conditions where McArthur reported spotting increasing the rate <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> by a factor of three, the SAROS model accounts fbI' only around two thirds of that increase.

5|$|The Andean Volcanic Belt {{consists}} of three main volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone (from 2° N to 5° S), the Central Volcanic Zone (16° to 28° S) and the Southern Volcanic Zone (33° to 46° S). Active volcanism occurs where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. The plates are separated by shallower subduction zones, with no present-day volcanism. These shallower zones {{have been attributed to}} the high speed of the plate collision, the young age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the curvature of the subducting plate. The most plausible theory is that variations in buoyancy of a subducting plate creates a flat subduction zone. The Cocos, Juan Fernandez and Nazca Ridges are associated with such volcanic gaps where they collide with the oceanic trench. The subduction <b>of</b> <b>spreading</b> ridges can also diminish volcanism, as observed in the Chile Rise further south. The buoyancy of these crustal structures may hinder subduction, reducing water supply to the mantle and inducing the formation of melts.|$|E

Wyatt promises his parents, Troi, and the rest of the crew that he knew that this would be destiny, and is happy to try to help cure the Tarellian virus.
