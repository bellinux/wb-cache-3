5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> as it cuts, so {{the form}} {{at the bottom}} of the workpiece may be rotated with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the tool to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E
5|$|If it {{advances}} much faster, {{then the}} tool becomes choked; conversely, if it advances much slower, then an interrupted or zig-zag cut occurs. In practice {{the rate of}} cut is slightly less than the ideal rate so that the load is released on the non-cutting edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{for turning}} the inner ring groove {{of a large}} nuclear {{cylindrical}} shell, based on requirements <b>of</b> machining condition, <b>the</b> matching <b>tool</b> assembled are designed. Based on <b>the</b> platform <b>of</b> finite element simulation analysis, the deformation and stress analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> overall structures are carried out, this provides a theoretical basis for the static strength evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools.</b> Through <b>the</b> dynamics modal analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools,</b> natural frequencies and modal shapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> are obtained, this provides a theoretical basis to evaluate <b>the</b> dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools,</b> in particularly, <b>the</b> resonance characteristics. Through static and dynamic analysis, <b>the</b> reasonableness <b>of</b> structural design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> is evaluated theoretically...|$|R
50|$|For example, {{freeform}} negotiation {{is merely}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> without any process. Negotiation within a labor arbitration setting is <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> within a highly formalized and controlled setting.|$|R
30|$|The {{final step}} is <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools.</b> To provide efficient evaluation techniques, <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> should follow <b>the</b> created metamodel and its original objectives. This {{means that the}} original metamodel becomes <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal metamodel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools.</b> <b>The</b> system modeling language and tools are linked together with model transformations. These transformations are used to convert <b>the</b> notations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system modeling language to the format understood by <b>the</b> <b>tools,</b> while <b>the</b> semantics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model is maintained.|$|R
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Great Notch station, which was falling into disrepair, {{received}} a new paint job, {{changed from the}} red-green colors for the Erie Lackawanna to a new all red Erie Railroad paint scheme. The abandoned tool shed made {{out of the old}} wooden boxcar was also removed. Due to the removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> boxcar, the propane tanks that heated the station building were also made visible. After the ending of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad in 1976, the Great Notch station lay abandoned. In June 1979, the State of New Jersey began to remove the tracks for the Caldwell Branch, which also lay abandoned at Great Notch. Currently, what was the track leading to the Caldwell Branch is a siding. On January 20, 1988, the newly rehabilitated station building was destroyed by fire. During the construction of the Montclair Connection in 2001, the adjacent Great Notch Yard received a major upgrade, becoming a new state-of-the-art yard with new trains storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRotary swaging {{is a cold}} bulk forming process. <b>The</b> {{diameter}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workpiece {{is reduced}} incrementally by oscillating movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools.</b> <b>The</b> established processes use lubricants which fulfill necessary functions such as lubricating, cooling and cleaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools.</b> Disadvantages caused by <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> lubricant are costs of recycling, replacement of lost coolant and for <b>the</b> cleaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workpiece. To eliminate the lubricant {{it is necessary to}} substitute <b>the</b> functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lubricant in other ways. For example by means of coating and structuring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools.</b> In this study infeed rotary swaging with structured tools is investigated using finite element simulations.

5|$|Training {{can help}} the user make use of their AAC system to {{communicate}} effectively with others, to control their environment through communication, and to make choices, decisions and mistakes. Skilled users of AAC show communicative competence in four interrelated areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic. Linguistic competence refers to language skills in the person's native language {{as well as the}} linguistic code of the symbol system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> of communication, while social competence and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.|$|E

40|$|Bugs in {{software}} are costly {{and difficult to}} find and fix. In recent years, many tools and techniques {{have been developed for}} automatically finding bugs by analyzing source code or intermediate code statically (at compile time). Different tools and techniques have different tradeoffs, but <b>the</b> practical impact <b>of</b> these tradeoffs is not well understood. In this paper, we apply five bug finding tools, specifically Bandera, ESC/Java 2, FindBugs, JLint, and PMD, to a variety of Java programs. By using a variety of tools, we are able to cross-check their bug reports and warnings. Our experimental results show that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> strictly subsumes another, and indeed <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> often find non-overlapping bugs. We discuss <b>the</b> techniques each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> is based on, and we suggest how particular techniques affect <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools.</b> Finally, we propose a meta-tool that combines <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> together, looking for particular lines of code, methods, and classes that many tools warn about. ...|$|R
