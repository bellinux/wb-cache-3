5|$|Another {{surviving}} {{victim was}} customer Jeff Schaffart, 34, who was treated and released at UNMC for {{a gunshot wound}} to the left arm and the little finger of his left hand. The Omaha Police Department announced on December 22, 2007, that Mandy Hyda, 34, received a bruise when a bullet fragment struck her left leg. She was neither transported nor treated for the injury. It was initially reported that there were five people injured (not including Hyda), but two <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>at</b> the scene who were sent to local hospitals were sent {{for reasons other than}} being shot by Hawkins.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>at</b> the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{had long}} battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly {{dominated}} the county court, {{if only because}} they could more easily get to the courthouse. In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and the courthouse opened in 1801. Most <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>at</b> Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. Less than a week after Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.|$|E

5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic testing {{can be used to}} confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or embryo carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>at</b> risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} African Americans in the {{territory}} during this period was quite small but not insignificant. Newcomers continued to bring slaves with them, but there were many free blacks as well, some working as servants and some as completely independent pioneers. Information about the black immigrants during the earlier periods is sparse, but records do show that most <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>at</b> Fort Snelling were slaves. Records from 1850 indicate a population of 39 free blacks {{out of a total}} population of 6,077 citizens {{in the territory}} (which excluded Native American tribes). Before the 1840s these free persons could often expect to be treated equal to other racial groups. By the time Minnesota had achieved statehood, however, blacks had been disenfranchised and schools were segregated. Despite this, {{from the start of the}} Minnesota Territory in 1848 the leadership was predominantly antislavery thus ending the practice in this era.|$|E
5|$|The post-conventional level, {{also known}} as the principled level, is marked by a growing {{realization}} that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>at</b> the pre-conventional level.|$|E

5|$|More than 21,000 {{members of}} the AIF were {{captured}} by the Japanese during {{the first months of}} 1942. Most of these men were {{members of the}} 8th Division captured at Singapore, the NEI and Rabaul, but about 2,000 members of the I Corps party sent to Java in early 1942 were taken prisoner there. Throughout captivity these POWs were treated harshly, resulting in a high death rate. Australians were held in camps across the Asia-Pacific region and many endured long voyages in grossly overcrowded ships. While most of the Australian POWs who died in Japanese captivity were the victim of deliberate malnutrition and disease, hundreds were murdered by their guards. The Burma-Thai Railway was the most notorious of the prisoner of war experiences, as 13,000Australians worked on it at various times during 1942 and 1943 alongside thousands of other Allied POWs and Asians conscripted by the Japanese; nearly 2,650Australians died there. Thousands of Australian POWs were also sent to the Japanese home islands where they worked in factories and mines in generally harsh conditions. The POWs held in camps at Ambon and Borneo suffered the highest death rates; 77percent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>at</b> Ambon died and few of the 2,500Australian and British prisoners in Borneo survived; almost all were killed by overwork and a series of death marches in 1945. Overall, only 14,000 of the Australian prisoners taken by the Japanese survived captivity. The majority of these deaths were caused by malnutrition and disease. The treatment of the POWs prompted many Australians to remain hostile towards Japan after the war. Australian authorities investigated the abuses against Allied POWs in their country's zone of responsibility after the war, and guards who were believed to have mistreated prisoners were among those tried by Australian-administered war crimes trials.|$|E
5|$|The fifth contest was a Full Metal Mayhem {{match for}} a future match on Impact! for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Early in the match, Abyss placed two tables {{side-by-side}} and then stacked two more on top <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>at</b> ringside. Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table {{at the top of}} the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the Swanton Bomb. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes, however, it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope. While he was climbing again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against the ropes. When Hardy connected with the ropes, he flipped over them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match. Abyss followed by climbing the ladder and removing the envelope to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} {{of the many}} rooms are the state apartments. These were laid out from the 16th century onwards, and were {{enhanced}} in the style <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>at</b> Versailles during the 18th century. In the 19th century and again during the late 20th century, large-scale restoration of the state rooms consolidated the 18th-century style which prevails today. Designed as an enfilade and a ceremonial route to the throne room, the processional route begins with an external horseshoe-shaped staircase which leads from the court of honour to the open gallery known as the Gallery of Hercules. From here guests enter the Mirror Gallery, a long hall inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. This gallery leads to {{the first of the}} state rooms, the Officer's Room, where guests are greeted by court officials before an audience with the prince in the Throne Room. From the Officer's Hall the enfilade continues to the Blue Room. This large drawing room, decorated with blue brocade, is hung with Grimaldi family portraits and has chandeliers of Murano glass. The following room, the largest of the state apartments, is the Throne Room. Its ceiling and frescoes were executed by Orazio de Ferrari and depict the surrender of Alexander the Great. The throne, in the Empire style, is positioned on a dais, beneath a red silk canopy of estate surmounted by a gilt crown. The floors are of Carrara marble. All state ceremonies have been held in this room since the 16th century.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s a sharp {{decrease}} in traffic {{led to a}} period of large surpluses when only the best wagons were used.

The Walt Disney Company promised to increase this number with a combination of replicas and unique attractions. While there is no individual dedication to Magic Kingdom, the dedication by Roy O. Disney for the entire resort was placed within its gates.|$|E
25|$|As eco-socialists {{disagree}} with the elite theories of capitalism, which tend to label a specific class or social group as conspirators who construct a system that satisfies their greed and personal desires, Kovel suggests that the capitalist system itself is self-perpetuating, fuelled by extra-human or impersonal forces. He uses the Bhopal Union-Carbide industrial disaster as an example. Many anti-corporation observers would blame the avarice <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>at</b> the top of many multi-national corporations. Conversely, Kovel traces systemic impulses. Union Carbide were experiencing a decrease in sales that led to falling profits, which, due to stock market conditions, translated into a drop in share values. The depreciation of share value made many shareholders sell their stock, weakening the company and leading to cost-cutting measures that eroded the safety procedures and mechanisms at the Bhopal site. Though this did not, in Kovel's mind, make Bhopal inevitable, it illustrates the effect market forces can have on increasing the likelihood of ecological and social problems.|$|E
