25|$|Due to a 50% longer stroke {{duration}} than a reciprocating four-cycle engine, {{there is}} more time to complete the combustion. This leads to greater suitability for direct fuel injection and stratified charge operation. A Wankel rotary engine has stronger flows of air-fuel mixture and a longer <b>operating</b> <b>cycle</b> than a reciprocating engine, achieving a concomitantly thorough mixing of hydrogen and air. The result is a homogeneous mixture and no hot spots in the engine, which is crucial for hydrogen combustion.|$|E
25|$|The Bizon uses {{a simple}} {{straight}} blowback method of operation, an unlocked breech system reduces cost and build complexity. The Bizon's <b>operating</b> <b>cycle</b> {{is characterized by}} a very short recoil stroke, standard 9×18mm ammunition will only drive the bolt partially {{to the rear of the}} receiver and produces a cyclic rate of 700 rounds/min. High-impulse ammunition forces the bolt to travel all the way to the end of the receiver, barely striking the receiver wall. A rate of fire of 650–680 rounds/min is the result. This has the effect of reducing perceived recoil and increasing controllability and hit probability.|$|E

Initially, perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs, being a net borrower for only say 90 days per year.

2500|$|The {{amount of}} energy in the {{reservoir}} of nuclear fuel is frequently expressed in terms of [...] "full-power days," [...] which is the number of 24-hour periods (days) a reactor is scheduled for operation at full power output for the generation of heat energy. The number of full-power days in a reactor's <b>operating</b> <b>cycle</b> (between refueling outage times) is related to the amount of fissile uranium-235 (U-235) contained in the fuel assemblies {{at the beginning of the}} cycle. A higher percentage of U-235 in the core at the beginning of a cycle will permit the reactor to be run for a greater number of full-power days.|$|E

Long before all possible fission has taken place, the buildup of long-lived neutron absorbing fission byproducts impedes the chain reaction. The fraction of the reactor's fuel core replaced during refueling is typically one-fourth for a boiling-water reactor and one-third for a pressurized-water reactor. The disposition and storage of this spent fuel {{is one of the most}} challenging aspects of the operation of a commercial nuclear power plant.

2500|$|The chamber has 18 flutes {{that aid}} in the {{extraction}} process by allowing combustion gases to flow between the fired case and the chamber walls, preventing the case from [...] "sticking" [...] to the chamber walls.

The high temperature gases cycling through a tube located below the chamber area and above the trigger made the early versions of this pistol uncomfortable, according to some, to shoot after the content of two magazines were fired due to heating. The advantages of this system are a simpler manufacturing process due {{to the absence of}} a locking system and a high mechanical accuracy due to the barrel being fixed in the frame; the barrel does not execute any sort of lateral or vertical movement during the <b>operating</b> <b>cycle</b> as with the Browning cam-action systems common to many other locked breech pistols.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} parameters that influence the life of T 5 and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) operating with instant start ballasts. Measurements were carried out during the starting period of the systems as well as during operation. Results reveal that cold ignition has a strong impact {{on the life of}} the systems. Lamp life was found to be less than 5, 000 <b>operating</b> <b>cycles.</b> The same lamps operating with ballasts providing warm start achieved a life of more than 70, 000 starts. Five groups in different <b>operating</b> <b>cycles</b> were tested. Starting time, starting voltage and inrush current were measured during the starting period and their influence on lamp life was examined. The paper also investigates the hypothesis that in every ignition a constant quantity of emissive material is lost and another quantity is also lost during every hour of operation. In general, the results establish that predictions for the lamp life of these systems cannot be drawn, because of the absence of deterministic effects that can be attributed to fluorescent lamps. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|The {{extension}} of biological processes from carbonaceous impurities removal to {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} removal {{had an impact on}} the biological system configuration. The system must be well designed, optimized, and operated at its optimum in order to meet the ever more stringent effluent standards. An intermittently aerated completely mixed lab-scale activated sludge bioreactor (IACMB) has been used for modelling biological processes of nutrients removal. Concerning the nitrogen removal, the <b>operating</b> <b>cycles</b> 15 – 30 (15 minutes of aeration, 30 minutes of only mixing without aeration) and 30 – 30 were tested. For the experiments with luxury uptake processes, the <b>operating</b> <b>cycles</b> 15 – 45, 15 – 90, 30 – 60 and 15 – 75 were used. The cycle 15 – 75 was the most satisfactory with convenient lengths of aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic period, high efficiency of the nitrification and denitrification processes, and significant decrease in phosphorus concentration. The results have shown that the intermittently aerated bioreactors are suitable for nitrogen removal as well as luxury uptake of phosphorus. The main advantage is high flexibility in maintenance and control of biochemical environments in the bioreactor.
