Saint Phalle's daughter Laura was the lead character in the film, appearing with Saint Phalle, Jean Tinguely, and other artist friends; Peter Whitehead composed the music. For the filming, she designed several pieces of furniture, which were later displayed on the facade of the Palais des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Palace) in Brussels.

60|$|I took a chair {{outside the}} door. As {{yet there was}} no need for me to risk coming again under the subtle {{influence}} of last night. Naturally my thoughts went revolving round the main incidents of the last day and night, and I found myself arriving at strange conclusions, doubts, conjectures; but I did not lose myself, as <b>on</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> in trains of thought. The sense of the present was ever with me, and I really felt as should a sentry on guard. Thinking is not a slow process; and when it is earnest the time can pass quickly.

His act, when he had it off, was demonstrative of his keenness. He turned up the outside of the wrap and smelled it carefully.|$|E

60|$|General Staveley, who I {{am glad to}} hear is better, is {{only one}} day in our rear. An officer has gone back this morning to direct him to halt to-night at the stream {{three and a half}} miles behind. The weather has been warmer for the last two days, and this has of course {{increased}} the labour of the soldiers. Had {{it not been for the}} frequent occurrence of water, I do not think that one quarter of the troops would have got in last night. Yesterday’s camp was admirably chosen for defensive purposes, being surrounded on all sides by a deep nullah. To-day’s camp is convenient, and is also defended on one side by a nullah, but has the disadvantage that the nullah is two hundred feet deep, and is extremely precipitous, the water being only accessible even on foot at two places, and consequently the difficulty of watering the animals is very great. The water, however, and indeed all that we have met with for the last day or two, is delicious. This is indeed a treat. Hitherto the water has been singularly nasty—thick and full of insects when stagnant, earthy and bad-tasting when running. Here it is fresh, clear, and pure. Rum is quite at a discount. The ravine through which the stream runs is very picturesque. The slope is steep, but well-wooded down to the bottom of the nullah; but the stream itself has cut a way from twenty to thirty feet wide through the solid rock at the bottom. The sides are as perpendicular as walls, and are in some places thirty feet deep. It is only, as I have said, at two points that we can get down to the water. This narrow gorge is overhung with trees, and in every cranny and on every tiny ledge grow lovely patches of green ferns. It requires no stretch of fancy to imagine oneself by the side of a pretty mountain-stream in Wales or Ireland. The vegetation is too bright and varied for a Highland stream. Nearly every officer in camp, and a good number of the men, have been down this morning for a bathe, which is doubly refreshing after the fatigue of yesterday and the paucity of our present washing appliances. The camp yesterday morning presented quite an unusual appearance. The head-quarter camp had shrivelled in dimensions from twenty tents down to four; and outside of them, soon after daybreak, the whole staff might be seen engaged in the various processes of washing and dressing. Twelve men may manage to sleep in a tent, but it is quite impossible that they can simultaneously dress there. Not, indeed, that any of the tents contained their full complement. Some had slung their blankets like hammocks upon the trees; others were content to roll themselves in their rugs, and sleep upon a waterproof-sheet under a bush; and besides this there was a hospital-tent, and as there are no sick, some of the officers were drafted off into this. Indeed, all might have been very much more comfortable, had those of their number who, like ourselves, have brought tentes d’abri, been allowed to carry them on their horses. I was very fortunate in getting into shelter before the storm came <b>on</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> I had ridden on before my spare horse, which, with my tent and etceteras upon his back, was nearly at the rear of the column. I arrived here about half-past four, having been nearly nine hours upon the road; and I was fairly exhausted when I got in from fatigue and want of food. Fortunately, however, the natives had brought in bread for sale, and after eating some of this, and going down to the nullah for a bathe, I was quite restored again. I was not, however, comfortable in my mind; for the clouds had been banking-up fast, and the thunder had been almost incessant in the hills for the last two hours. I could see by the baggage which was coming in, that my animal could not, if he kept his place in the line, be in for hours, if at all. When I got up to the camp, I was delighted to see my little tent pitched. My companion, who had been behind me, had, finding that the road was badly blocked, got them along by other paths, fortunately without more damage than one of the horses falling over a precipice twelve or thirteen feet high, into some bushes, which broke the animal’s fall. The horse was but little hurt; and with this slight mishap, which is nothing here, where horses and mules are constantly rolling over steep places, he had succeeded in getting into camp three or four hours before the animals could have possibly reached it, had they kept in their original place in the line; indeed it was most improbable that they could have got in last night at all. The lightning during the next half-hour was incessant, and before the dinner could be cooked, great drops began to patter down. We shouted to the servants to do the best they could for themselves with their blankets and waterproof-sheets, while we took refuge in our little tent, with an officer whose baggage, like that of the great majority, had not arrived. In a minute or two, it came down almost in a sheet. We lit our pipes, and consoled ourselves that if we had nothing to eat, we were no worse off than anyone else, whereas we were in shelter, while hardly another soul was so. While thus philosophising to our own contentment, the front of the tent was suddenly opened, and a hand was thrust in with a dish of cutlets, then plates and knives and forks. Our fellows had nobly stuck to their work, preferring to get drenched to the skin rather than that their masters should go without dinner. These Goa-men are certainly excellent servants. They are not physically strong: they are quiet, weakly-looking men, with little energy and no habitude to hardships. They make capital hotel-waiters, but could scarcely have been expected to have supported the fatigue of a campaign like this. They do so, however, and seem none the worse for it. Altogether they are worth any money upon an expedition of this sort, and are infinitely more serviceable than an English servant would be.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{the four}} NBC sitcoms <b>on</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> I {{got the most}} {{pleasure}} from Parks and Recreation. Its a measure of just how terrific P&R has become that even when it breaks its format with a mostly-outdoors episode, it still moves its ongoing story lines along briskly and provides a constant stream — a babbling brook, in Leslie Knopes case — of laughs. Ken Tucker, Entertainment Weekly [...] "Summer Catalog" [...] received generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, called the episode a [...] "nice character piece {{for most of the}} ensemble", and said it demonstrated how much Leslie has developed as a character since the first season. He praised the jokes about Rons hunger and the scenes with Toms demanding photography sessions. Entertainment Weekly television writer Ken Tucker said the storylines moved along briskly, provided a [...] "constant stream of laughs" [...] and displayed the [...] "rich texture" [...] of the characters. Tucker also said the romances in Parks and Recreation were more believable than contemporary ones in shows like The Office and 30 Rock.|$|E
5000|$|Vocalist/guitarist Charlie Fink {{wrote of}} {{adolescence}} and, in his words, [...] "that excitement of being young {{and being in}} the night." [...] The ambition was unapologetically fuelled by the music of Bruce Springsteen. In addition, Last Night on Earth is influenced by several different sources, including Tom Waits's 1992 album Bone Machine, the poetry of Frank O'Hara, the art of Edward Hopper, {{and the work of}} John Cale, Arthur Russell and Lou Reed. Reed's Berlin (1973) was particularly influential on Fink's desire to step outside his comfort zone, lyrically. [...] "Once you've opened up the third-person narrative it means you have to rely less on your own life and it's more fantasy and fiction," [...] said Fink, whose songwriting expanded to a [...] "strikingly visual style," [...] inspired by cinema. The process, Fink felt, exerted a tangible influence on the way he approached lyrics <b>on</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> on Earth. The album, in contrast to the band's prior two efforts, is a move away from autobiography, and tells short stories in song. For example, [...] "Wild Thing" [...] began as a 10-minute, richly detailed epic in the style of Street Hassle, before Fink boiled it down to its five-minute essence. The track, another instance of Fink's cinema-inspired songwriting, was designed to have a [...] "Twin Peaks feel." ...|$|E
