5|$|Camino, a 2008 Spanish film {{directed}} by Javier Fesser, allegedly {{based on the}} real story of Alexia Gonz√°lez-Barros, a girl who died from spinal cancer at fourteen in 1985 and awaits canonization. Fesser portrays the Opus Dei in a negative way, depicting it as an extreme cult destroying families, suggesting that Opus Dei manipulated the tragedy of the young Camino's painful death for its <b>own</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite being a French-language publication, the gazette {{was seen}} as {{independent}} of France. Its production was tolerated and even encouraged by the authorities, who often used Gazette de Leyde and other similar publications for their <b>own</b> <b>ends,</b> when wishing to publicize information {{that could not be}} released via the official channels. The paper also gave voice to institutions like the Parliament of France that were finding it difficult to publish in the official French newspaper, the Gazette de France.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{evidence}} on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing {{that there is not}} enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his <b>own</b> <b>ends,</b> and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E

5|$|In 1542, {{the thirty}} year old {{must have been}} feeling {{confident}} about his future prospects when he suffered two major interruptions to his life. First, Leuven was besieged by the troops of the Duke of Cleves, a Lutheran sympathiser who, with French support, was set on exploiting unrest in the Low Countries to his <b>own</b> <b>ends.</b> Ironically it was this same Duke to whom Mercator would turn ten years hence. The siege was lifted but the financial losses to the town and its traders, including Mercator, were great. The second interruption was potentially deadly: the Inquisition called.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{the state}} created the wartime shrine board, which {{expanded}} control over state shrines and expanded the state's role. Up to that point, individual priests had been {{limited in their}} political roles, delegated to certain rituals and shrine upkeep, and rarely encouraged Emperor worship, or other aspects of state ideology, independently. No shrine priest, or member of the Wartime Shrine board, had previously sought public office, which some scholars, such as Sakamoto, suggest is evidence of the state's use of Shinto to its <b>own</b> <b>ends,</b> rather than the Shinto priest's attempt to achieve political power.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, Anne {{sometimes}} exploited court factionalism for her <b>own</b> <b>ends,</b> {{in particular}} by supporting {{the enemies of}} the Earl of Mar. As a result, James did not trust her with secrets of state. Henry Howard, active in the highly secret diplomacy concerning the English succession, subtly reminded James that though Anne possessed every virtue, Eve was corrupted by the serpent. In practice, Anne was little interested in high politics unless they touched {{on the fate of}} her children or friends.|$|E

The second level is set in the Sea of Azov: the player must battle the elements of the Black Sea Fleet which is preparing to invade Europe. The mission also involves the rescue of guerrilla fighter Amad.|$|E
5|$|Underwood {{has been}} {{described}} as manipulative, conniving, Machiavellian, sociopathic, and a symbol of political corruption and evil. Throughout the series, he manipulates and destroys several people, including those he calls friends, for his <b>own</b> <b>ends.</b> Among other crimes, he personally commits murder twice, signs off on another murder committed by a subordinate, orders the deaths of two former employees, critically injures a member of his cabinet to prevent her testifying against him, and indirectly allows the murder of a civilian for political ends.|$|E
5|$|Ethicist Tom Regan {{rejected}} Kant's {{assessment of}} the moral worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim that animals are not self-conscious. He then challenged Kant's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make a moral judgment. Regan argued that, if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgment, then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion that animals exist merely {{as a means to}} an end is unsupported; the fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that, like humans, they have their <b>own</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} agents arrive, {{revealing that}} Douchebag went into hiding to escape {{them because of}} his ability to quickly make friends on social networks such as Facebook, which the government wanted to use for its <b>own</b> <b>ends.</b> Learning of the Stick's supposed power, the chief agent takes it and bargains with Douchebag to help him use it. Douchebag refuses but Princess Kenny betrays the group, uses the Stick to fight them and infects himself with the Nazi Zombie virus. Unable to defeat Nazi Zombie Princess Kenny, Cartman tells Douchebag to break their sacred rule by farting on Kenny's balls, which he does. The resulting explosion defeats Kenny and cures the town of the Nazi Zombie virus. In the epilogue as South Park is rebuilt, the group retrieves the Stick of Truth; they decide its power is too great for any person to hold and throw it into Stark's Pond.|$|E
5|$|Vidya goes to meet Damji, {{followed}} by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her {{doubt that he}} will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her hair stick, before shooting him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank you note for Rana and a pen drive containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi ever existed, and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her <b>own</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Rommel {{was seriously}} wounded on 17 July 1944, the Propaganda Ministry {{undertook}} efforts {{to conceal the}} injury {{so as not to}} undermine domestic morale. Despite this, the news leaked to the British press. To counteract the rumors of a serious injury and even death, Rommel was required to appear at a press conference held on 1 August. On 3 August, the German press published an official report that Rommel had been injured in a car accident. Rommel noted in his diary his dismay at this twisting of the truth, belatedly realising how much the Reich propaganda was using him for its <b>own</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, she {{is being}} {{followed}} by a gang, led by a furious Telugu-speaking lady. Shiva manages to lose the pursuers and decides to change the route to avoid the gang, but encounters a second gang. He realises that this gang is not following Charulatha, but himself, as they are the henchmen of a Mumbai-based gangster Baali (Milind Soman). He recalls an incident that happened some years ago in Mumbai, when he stayed there at his friend Poochi's (Jagan) house. He had beaten one of Baali's men, who had attacked him, and later Baali himself, not knowing about him and his reputation in the city, and returned to Bangalore. Both gangs are following the couple to achieve their <b>own</b> <b>ends.</b> After reaching Mumbai and experiencing a series of events, they end up at Poochi's house. Poochi finds out where the grandmother lives and Shiva brings Charulatha there. Shiva, unable to bear {{the thought that the}} journey is complete, leaves silently only to find Charulatha on the road. After hesitating, she reveals that her relatives had spoken ill about her parents, which prompted her leave, not wanting to push the matter further. While in a state of doubt, they are attacked by Baali's gang, who have teamed up with Jayaraman.|$|E
5|$|The latter {{soon began}} {{to come to a}} head. Austria had {{solidified}} its control over Lombardy-Venice and extended its protection to provinces nominally under the control of Francis' daughter Marie Louise. On 18 April Metternich announced that Austria was formally at war with Murat's Naples. Austria won the Battle of Tolentino on 3 May and captured Naples less than three weeks later. Metternich then was able to delay a decision {{on the future of the}} country until after Vienna. Discussions about Germany would drag on until early June, when a joint Austrian-Prussian proposition was ratified. It left most constitutional issues to the new diet; its President would be the Emperor Francis himself. Despite criticism from within Austria, Metternich was pleased with the outcome and the degree of control it granted Habsburgs, and, through them, himself. Certainly, Metternich was able to use the diet to his <b>own</b> <b>ends</b> on numerous occasions. The arrangement was similarly popular with most German representatives. A summation treaty was signed on 19 June (the Russians signed a week later), bringing the Vienna Congress officially to an end. Metternich himself had left on 13 June for the front line, prepared for a lengthy war against Napoleon. Napoleon, however, was defeated decisively at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June.|$|E
5|$|William {{was the son}} of the {{unmarried}} Robert I, Duke of Normandy, by Robert's mistress Herleva. His illegitimate {{status and}} his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and for their <b>own</b> <b>ends.</b> In 1047 William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointments of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 William was able to secure control of the neighbouring county of Maine.|$|E
25|$|Riegels {{used his}} {{experience}} to encourage {{others who had}} made similar plays. In 1957, Paramount High School's Jan Bandringa had intercepted a pass only to run it 55 yards into his <b>own</b> <b>end</b> zone, resulting in a safety for Centennial High, who won the game 9‚Äì7. In a regular season game in 1964, Jim Marshall of the Minnesota Vikings also ran a recovered fumble into his <b>own</b> <b>end</b> zone. Both received word of encouragement from Riegels.|$|R

5|$|The Karma Society {{was founded}} to study God, who was losing {{his faith in}} {{humanity}} due to their behavior. Sera was the only survivor {{of a group of}} children with the ability to communicate with God. To hide from the pain of the experiments, Sera created an artificial environment that would become the Junkyard, populating it with benign versions of Karma Society staff: these artificial beings would become the Junkyard's five tribes. The original Serph manipulated Sera and his team for his <b>own</b> <b>ends</b> while the original Heat attempted to protect her: when Sera saw Serph killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the process. Sera then decides to head for a secondary Karma facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins transmission, the base is destroyed, killing her and Serph. Their data travels to the sun‚Äîthe physical manifestation of God‚Äîand merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph achieves enlightenment and travels with Schr√∂dinger to new worlds, while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera and Serph have reincarnated, with a grown Fred acting as their caretaker.|$|E
