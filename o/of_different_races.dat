5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>races,</b> and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|The Zerg are a {{collective}} consciousness {{of a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>races</b> assimilated into the Zerg genome. The Zerg were originally commanded by the Zerg Overmind, a manifestation of this hive mind, and under the Overmind's control the Zerg strove for genetic perfection by assimilating the favorable traits of other species. After a species has been assimilated into the Swarm, it is mutated towards a different function within its hierarchy, from being a hive worker to a warrior strain. StarCrafts manual notes that some species bear little resemblance to their original forms after {{just a short time}} into assimilation (An example would be the formerly peaceful Slothien species, which was assimilated and mutated into the vicious Hydralisk strain and so on). The Overmind controls the Swarm through secondary agents called cerebrates. Cerebrates command an individual brood of Zerg, each with a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Cerebrates further delegate power through the use of overlords for battlefield direction and queens for hive watch.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} spawned several written adaptations and related merchandise. Starting in 2003, {{a series of}} Final Fantasy XI novels was written by Miyabi Hasegawa and {{released}} in Japanese, German, and French. Additionally, in 2004, Adventure Log, a webcomic by Scott Ramsoomair, was commissioned by Square Enix starting in 2007. Final Fantasy XI PlayOnline Visa and MasterCard credit cards were available in Japan, with features including no annual fees as long as cardholders remain PlayOnline subscribers and various other rewards. There have also been posters with limited edition phone cards and keychains released, also exclusively in Japan. Several T-shirts have been made available for order in North America, and various stuffed animals and gashapon figurines have also been made available to order <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>races</b> from the series. A Vana'diel clock which displayed the in-game time was also marketed, as well as CDs of the game's music.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{unlike many}} online games, Eve does not feature racial bonuses; that is, {{characters}} <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>races</b> do not gain intrinsic advantages for flying ships designed {{by their own}} race. While a character will begin with more advanced skills in his own race's ships, a character of another race can reach the same proficiency through training. Thus, players are encouraged to use starships that meet their preferred style of play, and the game does not place incentives for playing as one race over another. However, the ships <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>races</b> receive unique bonuses to certain things.|$|E

40|$|If {{universities}} expose {{students to}} a more diverse set of peers, do students form more diverse social networks in subsequent interactions?

25|$|However, some {{politicians}} allege {{that there is}} a creeping Islamisation of Malaysian society, and due to the links between race and religion it is thought the economic status <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>races</b> causes many religious problems. The predominance of Islam and its slow spread into everyday life in Malaysia has caused worry for non-Muslim groups. The Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in 2004 appeared at a Christian gathering to read from the Bible and called for religious unity despite differences. This was done at a time when Malaysia was head of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} opposition towards {{immigration in}} Europe. Although we find evidence that {{both economic and}} non-economic variables shape attitudes towards the arrival of immigrants, {{the relative importance of}} these factors depends crucially on the race/ethnicity of the arriving immigrants. We find that more exposure to immigrants reduces opposition towards the arrival <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>race</b> immigrants, while fears over labour market competition are more likely to shape attitudes towards the arrival of same race immigrants. Social welfare considerations are also important in determining attitudes towards further immigration, but mainly towards those <b>of</b> a <b>different</b> <b>race.</b> Attitudes, Immigration, European Union...|$|R

25|$|As {{well as his}} {{interest}} in eugenics, Laughlin {{was fascinated by the}} idea of establishing a world government. He worked on his plans for this institution throughout his adult life. The world government model that he devised was loosely based on the U.S. Constitution and the League of Nations. The allotment of representation in the body was heavily biased in favor of Europe and North America, particularly Great Britain and the United States. Laughlin believed that his world government model would promote the eugenicist aim of preventing the intermixing <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>races.</b> Many leading internationalists expressed interest in Laughlin’s world government plan, including Edward M.
