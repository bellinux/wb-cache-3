METHODS This is a cross-sectional and quantitative study, with data from the Pesquisa Nacional sobre Acesso, Utilização e Promoção do Uso Racional de Medicamentos – Serviços, 2015 (PNAUM – National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines – Services, 2015). For the analysis, we considered the data stratification into geographical regions. We analyzed the data on workers in the municipal pharmaceutical services management and in the medicine <b>dispensing</b> <b>units,</b> according to the country’s regions. For the statistical association analysis, we carried out a Pearson correlation test for the categorical variables. RESULTS We analyzed 1, 175 pharmacies/dispensing units, 507 phone interviews (495 pharmaceutical services coordinators), and 1, 139 professionals responsible for medicine delivery. The workforce in pharmaceutical services was mostly constituted by women, aged from 18 to 39 years, with higher education (90. 7 % in coordination and 45. 5 % in <b>dispensing</b> <b>units),</b> having permanent employment bonds (public tender), being {{for more than one}} year in the position or duty, and with weekly work hours above 30 h, working both in municipal management and in medicine <b>dispensing</b> <b>units.</b> We observed regional differences in the workforce composition in <b>dispensing</b> <b>units,</b> with higher percentage of pharmacists in the Southeast and Midwest regions.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{characterize}} the medicine dispensing {{services in the}} primary health care network in Brazil and in its different regions, aiming to promote the access and rational use of medicines. METHODS This is a cross-sectional, quantitative study with data obtained from the Pesquisa Nacional sobre Acesso, Utilização e Uso Racional de Medicamentos (PNAUM – National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines), 2015. Observation visits were carried out in 1, 175 <b>dispensing</b> <b>units,</b> and interviews were held with 1, 139 professionals responsible for the dispensation of medicines in the <b>dispensing</b> <b>units</b> and 495 municipal coordinators of pharmaceutical services. RESULTS More than half (53 %) of the units presented a space smaller than 10 m 2 for dispensing of medicines; 23. 8 % had bars or barriers between users and dispenser; 41. 7 % had computerized system; and 23. 7 % had counters for individual care. Among those responsible for dispensation, 87. 4 % said they always or repeatedly inform users {{how to use the}} medicines, and 18. 1 % reported developing some type of clinical activity. Isolated pharmacies presented a more developed physical and personal structure than those belonging to health units, but we found no significant differences regarding the information provided and the development of clinical activities. CONCLUSIONS There are major differences in the organization models of dispensation between cities, with regional differences regarding the physical structure and professionals involved. The centralization of medicine dispensing in pharmacies separated from the health services is associated with better structural and professional conditions, as in the <b>dispensing</b> <b>units</b> of the South, Southeast, and Midwest regions.

40|$|Background : Lessons learnt from {{worldwide}} {{disaster and}} public health emergencies such as the earthquake in Haiti 2011 and the 2011 flooding in Pakistani have shown that poor surge capacity increases unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Tanzania has of recent experienced a number of disasters {{and public health}} emergencies. These include the capsizing of the MV Bukoba in 1996 that killed over 1000 people, {{the bombing of the}} United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam in 1998 that killed 11, the influenza outbreak in 2009 and the recent capsizing of MV spice Islander and MV Skagit in 2012 that killed 203 and 144 people respectively. The mortality and morbidity associated with these disasters could have been minimized if the hospital emergency departments where the victims were sent were better prepared to cater for this additional workload in terms of pharmaceutical supplies, medical equipment, and personnel. The surge capacity of Hospitals emergency departments in particular the pharmacy is unknown. Study Objective: To assess hospital pharmacies’ surge capacity for disasters and public health emergencies. Methodology: A cross sectional survey of tertiary hospitals with emergency departments was conducted. Both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were applied. Guided in-depth interviews were conducted and data was analyzed using content relation analysis. Review of important documents was also done. Results: Thirteen out of fifteen of health personnel working in tertiary health facilities could not define the term surge capacity. Only two out of the seven hospitals reported to have adequate pharmaceutical personnel and the average number of pharmacists per pharmaceutical <b>dispensing</b> <b>unit</b> was less than one. Only one of these had a special pharmaceutical <b>dispensing</b> <b>unit</b> within the emergency department. None of the health facilities had a written disaster management plan. The overall perceived role of pharmaceutical personne l in managing disasters is simply as a drug dispenser. Lack of special pharmaceutical <b>dispensing</b> <b>units</b> for emergency departments, lack of training and out of stocks are the main perceived challenges by pharmaceutical personnel when dispensing during disasters. viii Conclusion: Currently hospital pharmacies in Dar es salaam have limited surge capacity to cater for natural and manmade disasters. This is due to lack of knowledge, available pharmaceutical personnel, training, and appropriate emergency plans and protocols. In addition to this, there is negative perception of the pharmacists’ role in disaster preparedness by pharmaceutical personnel and medical officers, inactive hospital disaster management committees, lack of specialized emergency pharmaceuticals’ <b>dispensing</b> <b>units</b> as well as poor management of the scarcely available emergency pharmaceuticals. Recommendations: Ministry of Health and Social Welfare should formulate a clear plan of action to ensure skilled staff availability by facilitating schools of Pharmacy in the country to enroll more students. They should also revise their curricula accordingly to incorporate basic life saving skills. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) should conduct continuous education programs in disaster preparedness for all in service pharmaceutical personnel. The Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, in collaboration with other stakeholders should prepare a set of regulations to govern the tertiary health facilities, both public and private health facilities in disaster and public health emergencies management...|$|R

40|$|Maximum cabin {{pressure}} altitude is limited by regulation to 2440 m (8 kft) for normal flight. In case of cabin depressurization, the {{cabin pressure}} altitude may rapidly increase up to maximum A/C altitude. To protect the passengers from lack of oxygen (hypoxia), the passenger supplemental oxygen supply shall provide per regulation a minimum oxygenation equivalent to 3050 m (10 kft) or 4270 m (14, 000 kft) whether the {{cabin pressure altitude}} is lower or higher than 5640 m (18 kft). The corresponding airworthiness requirement CS/FAR 25. 1443 (c) defines the minimum performance in term of oxygen partial pressure in the trachea. For demonstration, international standards have been available (TSO C 64 a / SAE AS 8025) for several decades. 	More than the oxygen partial pressure in the trachea, the blood oxygen saturation is the most relevant parameter to characterize the level of oxygenation. Current medical instrumentation are available for measuring directly the blood oxygen saturation. This alternative means of demonstration has been systematically studied during a test campaign at the DLR – Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne with human testing in altitude chamber. Different types of <b>oxygen</b> <b>dispensing</b> devices have been tested at different altitudes. Results show that the oxygenation level required by the regulation is achieved with significantly less oxygen than used so far. This is explained by the different efficiency level of oxygen transfer to the blood during the different phases of the breathing process. In other words, {{it is important to}} deliver oxygen at the right time, so that oxygen is effectively transferred to the blood and not “wasted” during subsequent exhalation. In the last years, this alternative means of compliance has been accepted by the Airworthiness Authorities. This has opened possibilities to introduce new technologies in <b>oxygen</b> <b>dispensing</b> equipment and {{to reduce the amount of}} oxygen to be transported on-board.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{characterize}} {{the infrastructure of}} the primary health care pharmacies of the Brazilian Unified Health System, aiming at humanizing the offered services. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study, of quantitative approach, from data obtained in the Pesquisa Nacional de Acesso, Utilização e Promoção do Uso Racional de Medicamentos – Serviços, 2015 (PNAUM – National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines – Services, 2015). Information on 1, 175 pharmacies/dispensing units were gathered from direct observation and assessment of <b>dispensing</b> <b>units</b> installations conducted by trained researchers who used a standardized form. The analyzed variables refer to the physical structure of pharmacies or medicine <b>dispensing</b> <b>units</b> of the health units under research. RESULTS The pharmacy area was greater than 14 m 2 in 40. 3 % of the sampled units, highlighting those from Midwest (56. 9 %) and Southeast (56. 2 %) regions and those of Northeast, with only 23. 3 %. About 80. 2 % units had waiting rooms with chairs for patients, 31. 8 % of them had dispensing areas inferior to 5 m 2, while in 46. 2 % these areas were superior to 10 m 2. Bars were found in service counters in 23. 8 % of health units, thus separating the patient from the professional; 44. 1 % had internet access. In most units, the area of medicine storage had no refrigerator or freezer for their exclusive storage and 13. 7 % had a specific room for pharmaceutical consultation.

The use of a novel surface coating, where matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) targets were uniformly precoated with a thin film of matrix/nitrocellulose, made the sample preparation straightforward and enabled the enrichment and analysis of proteins at low levels in proteomics samples. We demonstrate this by analyzing excised spots in a biological sample originating from a human fetal fibroblast cell line that was subjected to 2 D gel-electrophoresis. Furthermore, a sample deposition rate below 30 Hz results in an increased analyte density on the dispensed sample spot, rendering signal amplification. In general, the sensitivity for proteins and peptides can be enhanced 10 - 50 times compared to traditional MALDI sample preparation techniques. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.
