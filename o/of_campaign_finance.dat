5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his term}} as governor, Jones retired to Airdrie Stud. He started Commonwealth Broadcasting and joined with {{partners}} to purchase several radio and television stations in Kentucky and Tennessee.

5|$|At the {{expiration}} {{of his term}} as lieutenant governor in 1995, Patton announced his candidacy for governor. The 1995 gubernatorial election was novel in several ways, following a 1992 constitutional amendment. It was the first election in Kentucky history in which the governor and lieutenant governor were elected as a ticket. Another new provision stated that if no candidate received at least 40percent {{of the vote in}} his or her party's primary, a runoff election would occur between the top two candidates. Most significantly, {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history the winners of each race would be allowed to succeed themselves in office and serve another term. Also, as a result <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform passed under Governor Jones, candidates would receive public campaign financing and would have their campaign spending capped, negating the advantage of wealthy candidates.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} {{election}} since the Act on a Candidate's Election Funding came into force in May 2009, along with the 2010 amendments to the Act on Political Parties. Both laws mandate the disclosure of the sources <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> and expenses. Every candidate and party as a whole must disclose their source of funding. Campaign funding may start {{six months before the}} election day and end two weeks after the election regardless of when the costs are actually paid. The candidates must file a public report with the National Audit Office detailing their sources of all contributions of over €1,500 in value raised in support of the election campaign. The funds include expenses from the candidate's own assets, loans taken out for the campaign, and contributions received by either the individual or by a group that supports the candidate. Candidates are barred from receiving anonymous contributions of over €1,500 in value.|$|E

25|$|The D.C. Office <b>of</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>Finance</b> {{began an}} {{investigation}} into the 2004 Chavous Democratic primary campaign. The Washington Post reported that the Chavous campaign failed to file financial reports for October and November and paid three invoices totaling $9,000 when the campaign did not have funds to cover the checks. A creditor then {{filed a complaint with the}} D.C. police. The Office <b>of</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>Finance</b> scheduled a hearing on the alleged campaign violations in November 2004, but Chavous did not appear. In an interview with the Post, Chavous blamed a bank error and his campaign treasurer for the problems. Chavous personally gave one creditor a $5,000 cashier's check to cover a radio ad purchase, and his campaign's field coordinator was paid using $2,000 of Chavous' personal funds and $1,000 of the campaign's funds.|$|E

The Independence Party later questioned how Haggerty spent the money, which was to go to poll-watchers. Former New York State Senator Martin Connor contended that because the Bloomberg donations were made to an Independence Party housekeeping account rather than to an account meant for current campaigns, this was a violation <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws. Haggerty also spent money from a separate $200,000 donation from Bloomberg on office space.|$|E
25|$|On 30 August 2008, Vancouver area MP Blair Wilson {{became the}} first-ever Green Member of Parliament, after sitting {{for nearly a}} year of the 39th Canadian Parliament as an Independent.

Carl Holmes was hired by Few and Assistant Chief Gary Garland on a part-time basis at $1,800 a day some time in late 2000 or early 2011. Few had worked for Holmes in his previous job, and Few did not reveal his friendship with him as required by law.

25|$|Boniface II {{attempted}} to re-entrench {{the practice of}} appointing his successor, but the public outcry was too great, resulting in a highly disputed election in 532 characterized by widespread accounts of bribery and coercion, which resulted in Pope John II (the first to take a papal name). Athalaric, the Ostrogoth king, forced John II to approve decrees that banned any private agreements to elect a pope and enacting limits {{on the amount of}} money that could be spent during a papal election (an early example <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform). In fact, Athalaric himself was able to engineer the election of Pope Silverius, the son of Pope Hormisdas, upon John II's death.|$|E
25|$|In April 2014, Watanabe {{was found}} to have {{accepted}} a loan of 800 million yen from the chairman of a cosmetics company without disclosing it as a political donation. While insisting that the loan was used for personal purposes and not for political activities, he resigned as president of Your Party. The party commissioned an investigation by an outside attorney and CPA, who found that Watanabe had paid interest on the loan and had mainly used the funds for paying credit card bills for himself and his wife. While they found no violation <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws, they discovered that Watanabe had also borrowed money from five other parties totaling 615 million yen.|$|E
