5000|$|Early {{commonly}} {{works in}} <b>oils</b> <b>on</b> <b>linen</b> and aluminum panel. Her work captures the drama and emotion of Renaissance and early Baroque artwork. The tropes draw from historical work plays a clear role in her series [...] "Suspended," [...] partly inspired by Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s sculpture, The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Her work combines stylistic elements from Renaissance and Romantic painting with the rawness of contemporary life, “examining the sensitive and personal aspects of conflict, ambition and entropy in an opulent, cinematic style.” Common themes include redemption and hope.|$|R
50|$|Sonmor’s {{paintings}} are described by curator Sarah Boucher of the Musée des beaux-arts de Sherbrooke as “classical subjects - flowers, fruits, still lives, horses - {{with a more}} contemporary technique, a spontaneous brush stroke, a texture modern and fluid, with powerful coloration.” Painted in <b>oils</b> <b>on</b> <b>linen,</b> canvas or panel, his iconography frequently references legend or myth. Sonmor's atmospheric landscapes evoke the 19th-Century European Romanticism of J. M. W. Turner or Caspar David Friedrich. His strong use of chiaroscuro recalls Rembrandt or Caravaggio, while his still lifes recall the vanitas imagery of Dutch painter Jan Steen.|$|R
