5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested.

5|$|Hamlet {{is one of}} {{the most}} quoted works in the English language, and is often {{included}} on lists of the world's greatest literature.

5|$|In 951, the Later Zhou emerged, {{the last}} of the five {{short-lived}} dynasties making up the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The founding emperor of the Later Zhou died in 954 and was succeeded by his adopted son, who would rule with the name Emperor Shizong <b>of</b> <b>Later</b> Zhou. Shizong believed that the Liao dynasty was poised to invade the Zhou, and in 958 he launched a preemptive military campaign against the Liao, aiming to take the sixteen prefectures ceded to the Liao by Emperor Gaozu <b>of</b> <b>Later</b> Jin in 938. Emperor Shizong died in 959, before his army had even met the Liao forces. In 960 the commander-in-chief of the Later Zhou palace guard, Zhao Kuangyin, usurped the throne, then occupied by Emperor Shizong's seven-year-old son, and proclaimed himself the founder of the Song dynasty.|$|E

Thus, the nasal cavity of Dimetrodon is transitional between those of early land vertebrates and mammals.|$|E
