5|$|The Railroad Commission of Texas, {{contrary}} to its name, regulates the state's {{oil and gas}} industry, gas utilities, pipeline safety, safety in the liquefied petroleum gas industry, and surface coal and uranium mining. Until the 1970s, the commission controlled the price <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> because {{of its ability to}} regulate Texas's oil reserves. The founders of the Organization <b>of</b> <b>Petroleum</b> Exporting Countries (OPEC) used the Texas agency as one of their models for petroleum price control.|$|E

50|$|The United States was for decades, through 2008, the world's largest net {{importer}} <b>of</b> refined <b>petroleum</b> products. But the situation quickly changed in 2008 as American refineries {{became much more}} cost-competitive due to large increases in US production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. The US became a net exporter <b>of</b> refined <b>petroleum</b> in 2010, and since 2013 has been the world's largest net exporter <b>of</b> refined <b>petroleum.</b> In 2014, the US exported 3.83 {{million barrels per day}} and imported 1.35 million barrels per day <b>of</b> refined <b>petroleum,</b> for net exports of 2.48 million barrels per day.|$|R

5|$|A further fire {{broke out}} during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that {{extinguishing}} it would leave the risk <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> vapour re-igniting or exploding, {{so it would be}} better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out. Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original explosion and fire.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>petroleum,</b> {{the island was}} largely devoted to pearl fisheries and, {{as late as the}} 19th century, was considered to be the finest in the world. In 1903, German explorer, Hermann Burchardt, visited Bahrain and took many photographs of historical sites, including the old Qaṣr es-Sheikh, photos now stored at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. Prior to the First World War, there were about 400 vessels hunting pearls and an annual export of more than £30,000.|$|E

The bay's abundance <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> and natural gas has attracted industry, and its strategic location on the Texas coast is ideal for military establishment.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria is the 12th largest {{producer}} <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> in {{the world}} and the 8th largest exporter, and has the 10th largest proven reserves. (The country joined OPEC in 1971). Petroleum plays a large role in the Nigerian economy, accounting for 40% of GDP and 80% of Government earnings. However, agitation for better resource control in the Niger Delta, its main oil producing region, has led to disruptions in oil production and prevents the country from exporting at 100% capacity.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{resources}} not in short supply was petroleum oil; supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Considerable effort and enthusiasm was put into making use <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> products as a weapon of war. The Army had not had flame-throwers since the First World War, but a significant number were improvised from pressure greasing equipment acquired from automotive repair garages. Although limited in range, they were reasonably effective.|$|E

5|$|Peak oil, {{an event}} based on M. King Hubbert's theory, {{is the point}} in time when the maximum rate of {{extraction}} <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> is reached, after which {{it is expected to}} enter terminal decline. Peak oil theory is based on the observed rise, peak, fall, and depletion of aggregate production rate in oil fields over time. It is often confused with oil depletion; however, peak oil is the point of maximum production, while depletion refers to a period of falling reserves and supply.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization <b>of</b> <b>Petroleum</b> Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, agriculture, timber, and {{ranching}} were the leading economic engines of Texas. This was changed by the boom, which led to rapid industrialization. Though refineries were initially concentrated around the Beaumont and Houston areas, refining operations gradually grew throughout the state {{by the end of the}} 1920s. By 1940, the value <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> and natural gas produced in Texas exceeded the value of all agricultural products in the state. The state's GDP grew from approximately $119 million ($ in today's terms) in 1900 to approximately $29 billion ($ in today's terms), a more than 240-fold increase. The U.S. GDP as a whole grew by less than 24 times during the same period.|$|E

5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> tankers and gravel barges.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the {{rationing}} <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> fuels gave a {{boost to}} ridership on the electric tramways. To handle the massive increase in ridership, the trams were equipped with two conductors. The single-centre-door solution that worked excellently before the war became a bottle-neck as the trams became packed with riders. Lack of parts, particularly for the British Vickers motors, caused long waits for defective vehicles at the depots. From 1942, the Kolsås Line was transferred to terminate at Nationaltheatret in the city centre, and the Class B was operated along the Lilleaker Line from the west. Trams 164–166 were sent to Düsseldorf in Germany, but were never used because the city lacked balloon loops and the trams were too wide.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, as {{a result}} of both {{production}} peaks in some nations and political instability in others, the world's supply <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> tightened leading to an energy crisis during the 1970s and early 1980s. Petroleum prices rose dramatically, greatly benefiting Texas, particularly as compared {{to other parts of the}} U.S. that faced recession during this time. A new economic boom emerged which, though not as transformative as the early 1900s, pushed the population of Texas to the point that, by the end of the century, Texas was the second most populous state in the nation. Some sources, in fact, use the phrase Texas oil boom to refer to this later period rather than the earlier period that followed Spindletop.|$|E
