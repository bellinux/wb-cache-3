It is quite evident through time that women's labor is needlework, and that their labor is frequently undervalued both when dissimilar and alike to men’s work. In a time period where men overshadowed women in the traditional art, such as painting and sculpture, women <b>often</b> <b>times</b> reverted to other mediums like textiles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Often</b> <b>times</b> after {{internment}} {{families could}} not be reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community lead to an even more intensified gap between the generations. Children had no one with whom to speak Japanese outside the home {{and as a result}} they rarely learned the language fluently. The lack of community also led to a lack of Japanese foundation and many children lost touch with their culture. Mothers had also learned to be bolder in their own way and were now taking on wage-earning jobs, which meant that they had less time to teach their children about traditional Japanese culture and traditions. The internment camps had forever changed the way of Japanese-Canadian life.|$|E
25|$|The Bills and Jets both {{represent}} {{the state of}} New York, though the Jets actually play their games in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The rivalry started as the Bills and Jets were both original teams in the AFL. Though the rivalry represents the differences between New York City and Upstate New York, {{it is not as}} intense as the Bills' rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots, and the teams' fanbases usually have a begrudging respect for each other when not playing one another. <b>Often</b> <b>times</b> the rivalry has become beset with ugly games and mediocrity, but the rivalry briefly heated up when former Jets head coach Rex Ryan became head coach of the Bills for two seasons. Buffalo leads the series 60-53 as of 2016, including a playoff win in 1981.|$|E

25|$|Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) {{introduced}} {{their annual}} Torneo Nacional De Parejas Increibles tournament in January 2010.

The participating teams would all represent the region where they were raised or where they learned to wrestle. The 16 teams represented Mexico, Guadalajara, Jalisco, the La Laguna Region and Monterrey, Nuevo León in the tournament. The tournament was a standard single-elimination Tag Team, split into two brackets of eight teams, the two matches for the two brackets took place on the January 22, 2010 Super Viernes and the January 29, 2010 Super Viernes and the final match was held on the February 5, 2010 Super Viernes as the semi-main event of the show.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to suffering systematic sexual slavery, forced sterilization, enforced marriage, torture, and extrajudicial execution, women also faced rape {{and sexual abuse}} during interrogation by Indonesian authorities. These women included the wives of resistance members, resistance activists and suspected Fretilin collaborators. <b>Often</b> <b>times</b> women were targeted and subjected to torture {{as a form of}} proxy violence when male relatives who were suspected of being Fretilin were not present. [...] In 1999 researcher Rebecca Winters released the book Buibere: Voice of East Timorese Women, which chronicles many personal stories of violence and abuse dating to the earliest days of the occupation. One woman tells of being interrogated while stripped half-naked, tortured, molested, and threatened with death. Another describes being chained at the hands and feet, raped repeatedly, and interrogated for weeks. A woman who had prepared food for Fretilin guerrillas was arrested, burned with cigarettes, tortured with electricity, and forced to walk naked past a row of soldiers into a tank filled with urine and feces.|$|E

[...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, <b>often</b> <b>times,</b> if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Hannah Banana" [...] {{was written}} by series regular Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and {{directed}} by John Holmquist, before {{the conclusion of the}} eighth production season. Commenting on the original development of the episode, series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane stated, [...] " [...] was the result of our ongoing desire to let the series stagnate, and kind of evolve things that may have run their course. There's only so many times you can do the Evil Monkey jumping out of that closet, before the joke gets old, and I think <b>often</b> <b>times</b> there's a fear to mess with what works, and change things permanently. [...] We literally retired the Evil Monkey in this episode, and got a great episode out of it, which was worth it, and kind of evolved the series in a way." [...] Singer and actress Candace Marie provided the voice of Miley Cyrus. Marie received the role when her producer alerted her of the audition, and she eventually received a call from the Family Guy casting director a month later. Even though the episode mocked Cyrus, Marie did not think she would upset any of Cyrus' fans. She added that she is a fan herself, and [...] "was very impressed by the way Family Guy developed the episode," [...] and thought it was [...] "a huge compliment for them to refer to Miley as the [...] "perfect popstar."" [...] After voicing Cyrus, Marie was called back to Family Guy to voice Meg's friend Beth for [...] "several upcoming episodes." [...] Marie described Beth as a girl that is [...] "rarely addressed in conversation but loves to chime in whenever she can." [...] The song in the episode sung by Cyrus {{was written by}} Chevapravatdumrong, and composed and performed by Family Guy composer Walter Murphy.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} of the case, the Washington University Law Quarterly remarked, [...] "The Ninth Circuit's {{extension}} of the free exercise clause to include a privilege against tort liability is incorrect. First, by distinguishing emotional harms from physical harms, the court downplayed the significance of an emotional injury, which is <b>often</b> <b>times</b> as great as physical harm. ... In most of the free exercise cases decided by the Supreme Court the government has acted against the religious group, either by imposing criminal sanctions for religious conduct or denying members some benefit because of their religious beliefs. In Paul, however, the religious group acted as the aggressor, violating the plaintiff's right to emotional well-being. By granting defendants an absolute privilege against tort liability, the court has allowed the Church to use the shield of the first amendment as a sword. ... The Paul decision is an unfortunate expansion of a doctrine intended to protect individual rights. To turn the doctrine on its head {{and use it as a}} means to thwart another person's rights is an ironic twist that would undoubtedly displease the drafters of the first amendment. ... At best, Paul can be viewed as a slight detour from the correct interpretation of the free exercise clause and the proper balancing of interests performed by the Supreme Court and numerous lower courts." ...|$|E
