500|$|Analysts {{believed}} that while {{this was a}} major victory for the video game industry, the challenge is not yet over. Dan Offner, a partner for the video game industry analysis firm Loeb & Loeb {{believed that}} similar laws and regulations will be sought by State and Federal governments, as [...] "the regulation of mature content with respect to minors as a hot button issue for the Federal Trade Commission and the various state governments." [...] Other analysts cited that as more game content becomes available online as opposed to retail channels, the focus may shift more towards [...] "privacy and security" [...] of children and preventing children from amassing large fees from pay-to-use gaming services, pointing to a $3 million settlement that Playdom {{had to pay for}} violating privacy of its younger users. Sean Bersell of the EMA noted that future debates over violent video games may involve public opinion in addition to new legislation, noting that [...] "Retailers along with publishers and parents all have a role in keeping kids away from these games." [...] Seth Schiesel of the New York Times proposed that the Court's decision should be a challenge to the industry to show that they can mature on the decision that video games are a form of art, questioning the industry [...] "Will you use it as cover to pump out schlock <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>you</b> rise to the opportunity and respectability that has been afforded you?" [...] Schiesel also considered that even if games with increased interactivity and reality may make the games more dangerous, this could also make the player more aware of the potential consequences of his or her actions, even when such an action is made with the purpose to gain points/level or to kill a [...] "dangerous enemy" [...] in that game.|$|E

2500|$|Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: [...] "The Goldstone Report {{is a field}} court-martial, and its {{findings}} were prewritten. This is a prize for terror. The report {{makes it difficult for}} democracies to fight terror." [...] On another occasion, Netanyahu said that the report ignored Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza and the Palestinian rocket attacks that preceded the war. He also warned world leaders that they and their anti-terror forces could be targets for charges similar to those in the report. At the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu called the report biased and unjust, asking: [...] "Will you stand with Israel <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>you</b> stand with the terrorists? We must {{know the answer to that}} question now. Only if we have the confidence that we can defend ourselves can we take further risks for peace." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that a belief in a reward after death is poor {{motivation}} for moral behavior while alive. Sam Harris wrote, [...] "It is rather more noble to help people purely {{out of concern for}} their suffering than it is to help them because you think the Creator of the Universe wants you to do it, <b>or</b> <b>will</b> reward <b>you</b> for doing it, <b>or</b> <b>will</b> punish <b>you</b> for not doing it.
