The extract <b>of</b> <b>marigold</b> <b>of</b> 120 g/L {{was the best}} result in reducing {{the area of the}} colony of F. oxysporum. In field pots experiment were evaluated the extract <b>of</b> <b>marigold</b> (120 g/L), potassium phosphite (400 g/L), TRICHOD and be-nomyl (1. 5 g/L) to control F. oxysporum.

The best obtained heights were of 32 cm with extract <b>of</b> <b>marigold</b> 120 g/L, followed by potassium phosphite with 31 cm, and the control reached 26 cm of height. The treatment with an extract <b>of</b> <b>marigold</b> 120 g/L, obtained the best dry weight average of 6. 5 g, sta-tistically different from the control. The extract <b>of</b> <b>marigold</b> presented the best efficiency against the disease, because it reduced the length of the vascular symptom in 88. 5 %; followed by TRICHOD®, benomyl and potassium phosphite that showed reductions of 86, 85 and 84 percent, respec-tively...|$|R

40|$|Effect <b>of</b> extract <b>marigolds</b> (Tagetes erecta L.) leaves as the {{repellent}} to Aedes spp mosquitoes.

This desease is an contagious desease caused by the dengue virus and transmitted through the Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The aim of this research was to analyze the effect <b>of</b> extract <b>marigolds</b> (Tagetes erecta L.) leaves as the repellent to the Aedes spp. The design of this research was the quasi-experimental with Completely Randomized Design (CRD) in which the experiments were conducted by using six variation of concentration of the extract which are 0 % (as a control), 1 %, 2 %, 3 %, 4 %, 5 % in three replication. The result of the study showed that there was an effect of the extract <b>of</b> <b>marigolds</b> (Tagetes erecta L.) leaves as the repellent to Aedes spp. The calculation of average protection power <b>of</b> extrack <b>marigold</b> (Tagetes erecta L.) leaves on concentration 1 % was 37, 5 %, on concentration 2 % was 62, 5 %, on concentration 3 % was 75 %, on concentration 4 % was 87, 5 %, on concentration 5 % was 100 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Intercropping of {{vegetables}} and medicinal plants might produce favorable interactions for both crops, resulting in increased production and profit per unit area. It is known that active compounds can change because of several factors, including the cropping system. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of intercropping <b>of</b> lettuce and <b>marigold</b> on the productivity of these crops and on the flavonoid content <b>of</b> <b>marigold</b> flowers. The experiment was conducted in the experimental area of EPAMIG in Oratorios-MG. Treatments consisted <b>of</b> lettuce + <b>marigolds</b> intercropping between rows, lettuce + marigold intercropping between plants, and monocultures of each species. Spacing was 0. 3 x 0. 3 m. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with ten repetitions. Harvest <b>of</b> lettuce and <b>marigold</b> flowers started 45 days after transplantation (DAT) and extended up to 72 DAT for marigolds. Lettuce and marigold intercropping appears feasible because lettuce production did not differ between the monoculture and intercropped cultivations, and marigold productivity was higher when intercropped with lettuce. No change in the flavonoid (active chemicals of medicinal interest) content in the floral capitula <b>of</b> <b>marigolds</b> was observed...|$|R
