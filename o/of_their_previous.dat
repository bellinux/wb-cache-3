5|$|An {{approximately}} 1,000-person team developed Grand Theft Auto V, an action-adventure video game, {{over several}} years. Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto V on 17 September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, on 18 November 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and on 14 April 2015 for Microsoft Windows, as the fifteenth {{entry in the}} Grand Theft Auto series. Development began soon after Grand Theft Auto IVs release and was led by Rockstar North's core 360-person team, who collaborated with several other international Rockstar Games studios. The team considered the game a spiritual successor to many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>previous</b> projects like Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3. After its unexpected announcement in 2011, the game was fervently promoted with press showings, cinematic trailers, viral marketing strategies and special editions. Its release date, though subject to several delays, was widely anticipated.|$|E

5|$|Audition was {{originally}} {{started by the}} Japanese company Omega Project, who {{wanted to make a}} horror film after the great financial success <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>previous</b> production Ring. To create the film, the company purchased the rights to Ryu Murakami's book Audition, and hired screenwriter Daisuke Tengan and director Miike to film an adaptation.

The film was shot in about three weeks in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{soon after}} Grand Theft Auto IVs release and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The {{development}} team drew influence from many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>previous</b> {{projects such as}} Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3, and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed {{by a team of}} producers who collaborated over several years.|$|E
5|$|Evolve was Turtle Rock Studios' {{first major}} project {{after the company}} split from Valve Corporation in 2011. The concept for Evolve existed prior to the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>previous</b> game, Left 4 Dead. Inspired by hunting games such as Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter, {{the idea is to}} have prey that can strike back at the hunters. The monster design was originally intended to be esoteric but was later toned down. The game is powered by Crytek's CryEngine, as they believed that the engine is capable of creating the dark and dense forests featured in the game. Turtle Rock found difficulty when seeking publishers that could provide funding and marketing for the game. THQ was originally set to serve as the game's publisher, but the rights to the franchise and publishing duties were transferred to Take-Two Interactive after THQ filed for bankruptcy in late 2012.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Flight Unlimited in 1995, project leader Seamus Blackley planned to use that game's computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) code to create a combat flight simulator called Flight Combat. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Studios demanded that Blackley instead design a direct sequel to Flight Unlimited. Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. Constantine Hantzopoulos became the lead designer and project leader of the fourteen-member Flight Unlimited II team. The team eschewed the aerobatics focus <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>previous</b> game in favor of general civilian aviation, in order {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Looking Glass announced the game on December 18, 1996. It was slated to include 6 planes, 45 airports and 8,500 square miles of terrain from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area was chosen because of its varied landscape and numerous airports. In January 1997, Eidos Interactive partnered with Looking Glass to provide the game's marketing and distribution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Korean War, between 1953 and 1971, the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Its main {{garrison}} was Camp Casey, South Korea. During these occupation duties, the division saw a complete reorganization in compliance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan. In 1963, the division's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division while the 13th Infantry Brigade became the 2nd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. The 14th Infantry Brigade redesignated at the 3rd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. These renamed formations retained all of the lineage and campaign credits <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>previous</b> designations. On 2 April 1971, the division and its brigades returned to the United States and inactivated at Fort Lewis, Washington.|$|E
5|$|Pathways was Bungie's fourth title (and third {{commercial}} title) {{after their}} previous game, Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete, sold around 2,500 copies. In {{the summer of}} 1992, Jones was living in dorms at the University of Chicago when he saw Wolfenstein 3D, a shooter game with three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Inspired, Jones created a rough 3D-graphics engine for the Mac that simulated walls with trapezoids and rectangles. Originally, Bungie intended Pathways to be a straightforward 3D version of Minotaur, but they quickly found that the top-down perspective <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>previous</b> game did not mesh with the 3D presentation. An additional consideration was that the developers {{wanted to create a}} game that did not rely on then-rare networks and modems, an issue in marketing Minotaur. The rest of 1992 was spent tweaking the graphics engine.|$|E
