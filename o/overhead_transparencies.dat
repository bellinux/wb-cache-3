When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream.

500|$|In many Buffy episodes, {{understanding}} why evil has appeared {{is important in}} knowing how to fight it, but the reasons for The Gentlemen's arrival and their need to take seven human hearts are never made explicit; they are simply there. According to Giles' <b>overhead</b> <b>transparencies,</b> they can appear in any town. Several Buffy scholars assert that a sexual element similar to what is presented in classic fairy tales is evident in [...] "Hush". Buffy often has prophetic dreams, {{and it is in}} a dream that she first sees one of The Gentlemen; she sees a flash of his face just as Riley touches her shoulder. Buffy has only been sexually intimate twice before: with the vampire Angel, whose lovemaking cost him his soul, and with the womanizing Parker Abrams. Riley is notably different from both and Buffy's anxiety about becoming intimate with him, according to scholars, either calls The Gentlemen to Sunnydale or is represented by them. The Gentlemen murder by cutting chests open and removing hearts, penetrative acts. In Buffy's dream Riley says, [...] "If I kiss you, it'll make the sun go down" [...] and when he does so, it instantly becomes night, as if Buffy has crossed over a threshold. Riley's kiss creates physical and emotional intimacy, but initiates mental, intuitive knowledge as well: in this episode Buffy learns of Riley's secret role as a member of The Initiative. Threshold imagery is again used when Tara and Willow block the door with their combined efforts, shutting The Gentlemen out.|$|E

This type of replacement can be encoded into surrogates which automatically carry out the replacements to keep the obligation up-to-date. The obligation system has a built in error detection scheme that determines if network construction is invalid and, if so, disallows [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Inexpensive rock permeameters {{made from}} <b>overhead</b> <b>transparency</b> sheets and {{flexible}} tubing {{were built in}} an introductory hydrogeology course.

A hydraulic conductivity value of 3. 2 x 10 - 5 cm/s was calculated for a four-sided sandstone specimen from the Woodbine Formation. Similar values were obtained in a second test on the same specimen, a third test on a six-sided specimen, and a fourth test using a conventional falling head permeameter. Students preferred building creased-plastic permeameters and calculating hydraulic conductivity values rather than being given a hydraulic conductivity value in a problem statement. Creased-plastic permeameters cannot withstand air vacuums (as sometimes used while saturating a sample with water) and may leak if poorly constructed or used with nearly impervious rocks. For these reasons, creased-plastic permeameters are not suited to research. However, they provide an inexpensive way for students to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of local rock aquifers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Watermarking {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} mechanisms for intellectual property protection (IPP) of hardware and software artifacts. Numerous watermarking-based IPP techniques have been proposed that satisfy a spectrum of IPP desiderata, including full preservation of functionality, low timing, area and power <b>overhead,</b> <b>transparency</b> to the synthesis and compilation process, and resilience against attacks. Two objectives that are very important, but, until now have not yet been properly addressed, are credibility and fairness. We present a new watermarking technique that specifically targets credibility and fairness. Using a combinatorial result by Valiant and Vazirani, we demonstrate how these two desiderata can be achieved during the watermarking of a satisfiability (SAT) instance. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated on both specially created examples, where the number of solutions is known, as well as on common computer-aided design and operational research SAT benchmark instances. Index Terms—Boolean satisfiability (SAT), intellectual property protection (IPP), watermarking. I...|$|R
