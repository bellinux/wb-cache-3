5|$|The pygmy {{right whale}} shares several {{characteristics}} with the right whales, although having dorsal fins separates them from right whales, {{and they have a}} very distinctive jaw configuration. Pygmy right whales' heads are no more than one-fourth the size <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies,</b> whereas the right whales' heads are about one-third the size <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hexactinellida (glass sponges) have {{silicate}} spicules, {{the largest}} of which have six rays and may be individual or fused. The main components <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> are syncytia in which large numbers of cell share a single external membrane.|$|E
5000|$|When {{they are}} first born, {{their eyes are}} on both sides <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> like other fish. However, when the pacific sand sole starts to mature, one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> eyes starts to migrate to either the left or the right side <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body,</b> just like a {{flounder}} when their eyes migrate. From that point, their eyes will stay that way. They will live {{on the bottom of}} the ocean, on the sand, lying on one side <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body,</b> while both <b>of</b> <b>their</b> eyes are on top <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R

50|$|Lick {{granuloma}} {{is a form}} of self-trauma {{and skin}} disorder in which most commonly dogs, but also cats, continuously lick a small area <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> until it becomes raw and inflamed. The most common areas affected are the lower (distal) portions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> legs, such as the carpus (wrist), or sometimes another part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> such as the base <b>of</b> <b>their</b> tail.|$|R
50|$|A {{study by}} Swami et al. of British {{male and female}} {{undergraduates}} showed a preference for men with legs {{as long as the}} rest <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> and women with 40% longer legs than the rest <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body.</b> The researcher concluded that this preference might be influenced by American culture where long legged women are portrayed as more attractive.|$|R
50|$|Reward Challenge: Tribe members hang (with the dorsal parts <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> {{facing the}} ground) onto {{horizontal}} logs {{for as long}} as they can without any part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> except <b>their</b> hair or their clothes touching the ground. The tribe that still has at least one member hanging on after all members of the other tribe have been eliminated wins the reward.|$|R
5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|Let {{it not be}} concluded, that I wish {{to invert}} the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the {{constitution}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies,</b> men seem to be designed by Providence to attain {{a greater degree of}} virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E
5|$|Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three {{bottlenose}} dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they {{elevate the}} upper part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> vertically out of the water, and propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.|$|E

5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of several}} species of starfish can {{reproduce}} asexually before they reach maturity. They do this by autotomising some parts <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> or by budding. When such a larva senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development. Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> balance issues, {{swimmers}} in {{this class}} can find the starting block problematic and often have slower times entering the water than other competitors in their class. Because the disability of swimmers {{in this class}} involves {{in a loss of}} function in specific parts <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body,</b> they are more prone to injury than their able-bodied counterparts as a result of overcompensation in other parts <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E
5|$|Beetle larvae can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened heads, {{the presence of}} chewing mouthparts, and spiracles along the sides <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles with somewhat flattened, highly mobile larvae include the ground beetles and rove beetles; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and {{are found in the}} click beetle (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, more commonly known as grubs.|$|E
50|$|Dufnering is a {{variation}} of planking that involves a person lying with the bottom half <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body</b> on the floor, the top half leaning up, their arms close to the side <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>body,</b> and <b>their</b> hands ending towards the bottom <b>of</b> <b>their</b> thighs.
