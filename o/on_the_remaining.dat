5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{maintenance}} of the tramway system and the purchase of new trams suffered. Competition from private buses, the MTT's own bus fleet and the growth of private car ownership all took patrons from the tram network. By the 1950s, the tram network was losing money and being replaced by an electric and petrol-driven bus fleet. Adelaide's tram history is preserved by the volunteer-run Tramway Museum, St Kilda and the continuing use of 1929 H type trams <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> Glenelg tram line.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} interstate {{trucking}} in the 1950s {{led to a}} drop in rail traffic throughout the nation. By 1960, the southernmost section of the line was demolished due to low use. This section started at Gansevoort Street and ran down Washington Street as far as Spring Street just north of Canal Street, representing {{almost half of the}} line. The last train <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> part of the line was operated by Conrail in 1980.|$|E

In 1964 the building was considerably altered by adding a 17-storey tower and a kitchen and dining complex to the building. In 2004 the University submitted plans to demolish these extensions {{with the intention of}} converting the original house into a conference venue and building new blocks of flats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> landscaped gardens. The University placed the property up for sale in 2015.|$|E
5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced {{at the end of its}} tour of duty in December 1970. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. The Australian area of operations (AO) remained the same however, with the reduction in forces only adding further to the burden <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> battalions. Regardless, following a sustained effort by 1 ATF in Phuoc Tuy Province between September 1969 and April 1970, the bulk of communist forces had become inactive and had left the province to recuperate.|$|E

5|$|At 05:00 on 13 April Stopford {{gave the}} order for the inshore {{squadron}} to withdraw back to Gambier's fleet. Cochrane was again furious, and even suggested taking Imperieuse and Indefatigable on a desperate attack on the still-grounded Océan. Captain John Tremayne Rodd on the latter refused. Frustrated, Cochrane remained in the anchorage, joined by Pallas and the smaller vessels as the larger ships returned to more open waters. At 08:00 he ordered a renewed attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> grounded ships {{at the mouth of}} the Charente, and by 11:00 the small vessels were in position and opened fire on the French flagship. Although Aetnas gun split, forcing her withdrawal, the barrage otherwise continued throughout the day, although to little effect. It was not until 16:00 when the battered Océan and Régulus, most of their stores thrown overboard, were able to safely retreat towards the mouth of the Charente.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, {{there were}} only 200 parrots in the wild, and in 1975 the {{population}} reached an absolute low of 13 individuals. Numbers then recovered, and in August 1989 there were an estimated minimum of 47 individuals. But on September 18, 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the northeast coast of Puerto Rico inflicting heavy casualties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> birds. In {{the aftermath of the}} hurricane the population was estimated at 23 individuals. In 2004, the wild population was 30–35 individuals, and the long-term trend appears to be stable albeit with some fluctuations. The current range of the species is , 0.2% of what it once was.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure was conducted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> parts of the runway. An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and curvature of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E
5|$|Further east, the strongpoint {{defenses}} were effective. On the Dog Red / Easy Green boundary, {{the defenses}} around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy toll <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined {{the remnants of}} F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins {{was too weak to}} have any effect and was forced back down. To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs.|$|E
5|$|Late in the afternoon, a Yorktown scout {{aircraft}} located Hiryū, prompting Enterprise {{to launch}} a final strike of 24 dive bombers (including 6 SBDs from VS-6, 4 SBDs from VB-6, and 14 SBDs from Yorktowns VB-3). Despite Hiryū being defended by a strong cover {{of more than a}} dozen Zero fighters, the attack by Enterprise and orphaned Yorktown aircraft launched from Enterprise was successful: four bombs (possibly five) hit Hiryū, leaving her ablaze and unable to operate aircraft.

5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E

The Kinzua Sky Walk was opened on September 15, 2011 in a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Sky Walk consists of a pedestrian walkway to an observation deck with a glass floor {{at the end of}} the bridge that allows views of the bridge and the valley directly below. The walkway cost $4.3million to construct, but is estimated to bring in $11.5million in tourism revenue for the region.|$|E
