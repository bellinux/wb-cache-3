The top five answers are placed on the board in a random order, and the panel again gives their opinion on {{what would be the}} most popular answer. If the score going into this question is tied, each contestant is allowed to select one answer, with the winner of the pre-show coin toss deciding who makes the first selection. If one contestant has the lead, that contestant goes first and is given a selection; her opponent is then allowed one provided the first contestant did not pick the most popular answer. If the most popular answer has not yet been revealed, the first contestant is given one more selection. The contestant who selects the highest-ranked answer wins the game, keeps her money, and plays the bonus round.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{compared}} {{the effects of}} <b>open-ended</b> versus specific <b>questions,</b> and various types of <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions,</b> in eliciting story-grammar detail in child abuse interviews. Methods: The sample included 34 police interviews with child witnesses aged 5 - 15 years (M age. = 9 years, 9 months). The interviewers&# 039; questions and their relative sub-types were classified according to definitions reported in the child interview training literature. The children&# 039;s responses were classified according to the proportion of story grammar and the prevalence of individual story grammar elements as defined by Stein and Glenn (1979). Results: <b>Open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> were more effective at eliciting story grammar than specific questions. This finding was revealed across three age groups, two interview phases and irrespective of how question effectiveness was measured. However, not all types of <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> were equally effective. <b>Open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> that encouraged a broad response, or asked the child to elaborate {{on a part of}} their account, elicited more story-grammar detail compared to <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> that requested clarification of concepts or descriptions of the next (or another) activity or detail within a sequence. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that children&# 039;s ability to provide story-grammar detail is maximised when there is minimal prompting from the interviewer. Practical implications: Given the association between story grammar production and victim credibility, greater guidance is warranted in interviewer training programs in relation to the effects and administration of different types of <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions...</b>|$|R

These related to: 1. the specificity of the information required from children; 2. the unfamiliar nature of the open-ended discourse style; and 3. the complex distinction between <b>open-ended</b> versus specific <b>questions.</b> Each of these themes is discussed, along with the implications for trainers and researchers in child investigative interviewing. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Text {{data from}} <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> in surveys are {{difficult}} to analyze and are frequently ignored. Yet <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> are important {{because they do not}} constrain respondents' answer choices. Where <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> are necessary, sometimes multiple human coders hand-code answers into one of several categories. At the same time, computer scientists have made impressive advances in text mining that may allow automation of such coding. Automated algorithms do not achieve an overall accuracy high enough to entirely replace humans. We categorize <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> soliciting narrative responses using text mining for easy-to-categorize answers and humans for the remainder using expected accuracies to guide the choice of the threshold delineating between 'easy' and 'hard'. Employing multinomial boosting avoids the common practice of converting machine learning 'confidence scores' into pseudo-probabilities. This approach is illustrated with examples from <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> related to respondents’ advice to a patient in a hypothetical dilemma, a follow-up probe related to respondents' perception of disclosure/privacy risk, and from a question on reasons for quitting smoking from a follow-up survey from the Ontario Smoker's Helpline.

40|$|The use of <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> in survey {{research}} {{has a very}} long history. In this paper, building {{on the work of}} Paul F.

We draw on prior research, our own and that of others, to argue for increasing the use of <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> in quantitative surveys. The addition of <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions</b> - and the capture and analysis of respondents' verbatim responses to other types of questions - may yield important insights, not only into respondents' substantive answers, but also into how they understand the questions we ask and arrive at an answer. Adding a limited number of such questions to computerized surveys, whether self- or interviewer-administered, is neither expensive nor time-consuming, and in our experience respondents are quite willing and able to answer such questions.

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the nature of investigative interviewers 2 ̆ 7 limitations when using <b>open-ended</b> <b>questions,</b> and to compare how representative these limitations are in three distinct interview paradigms.

Overall, several common problems that would restrict children 2 ̆ 7 s opportunity to provide elaborate and accurate narrative accounts of events were identified and described.
