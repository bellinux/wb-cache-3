5|$|The M249 is a belt-fed {{light machine}} gun. It fires the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, usually a {{combination}} of one M856 tracer and four M855 ball cartridges fed from M27 linked belts. Belts are typically held in a hard plastic <b>or</b> <b>soft</b> canvas box attached to {{the underside of the}} weapon.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus <b>or</b> <b>soft</b> tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone <b>or</b> <b>soft</b> tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.|$|E
30|$|Users {{will be able}} to see {{the most}} {{recently}} uploaded sounds, the most frequently downloaded, and the highest or lowest on various criteria, for example, most identifiable, sounds rated loudest <b>or</b> <b>softest,</b> <b>or</b> sounds with specific acoustic attributes, such as pitch strength or rhythmicity.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{women find}} menstrual cups uncomfortable. This may lessen with {{practice}} inserting the cup. Selecting a smaller <b>or</b> <b>softer</b> cup, and/or trimming {{the stem of}} the cup, if there is one, may also help.|$|R
5|$|Gom bian (also {{known as}} 光饼 or Kompia) — a Foochow {{delicacy}} made with flour, baked in an oven and eaten either {{with or without}} meat and gravy. It is somewhat similar to a bagel. However, it can be either in a crisp <b>or</b> <b>soft</b> version. Traditional soft kompia dipped in pork sauce can be sought from Chung Hua road and the Sunday Market at Pedada road. There are deep fried variations available throughout the town of Sibu.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone <b>or</b> <b>soft</b> tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses mainly {{move about}} by {{relatively}} slow crawling, with some {{swimming in a}} head-first position. Jet propulsion, or backwards swimming, is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and crawling. When in no hurry, they usually crawl on either solid <b>or</b> <b>soft</b> surfaces. Several arms are extended forwards, some of the suckers adhere to the substrate and the animal hauls itself forwards with its powerful arm muscles, while other arms may push rather than pull. As progress is made, other arms move ahead to repeat these actions and the original suckers detach. During crawling, the heart rate nearly doubles, and the animal requires ten or fifteen minutes to recover from relatively minor exercise.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as ice creams) <b>or</b> <b>soft</b> drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar and ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and tree house to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} fish {{is divided}} into a head, trunk and tail, {{although}} the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine {{and there are no}} limbs or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony <b>or</b> <b>soft</b> spines called rays, which {{with the exception of the}} caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk. The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.|$|E

50|$|<b>Soft</b> {{commodities}}, <b>or</b> <b>softs,</b> are commodities such as coffee, cocoa, sugar, corn, wheat, soybean, {{fruit and}} livestock. The term generally refers to commodities that are grown, rather than mined; the latter (such as oil, copper and gold) {{are known as}} hard commodities.|$|R

40|$|The {{scattering}} {{of a plane}} acoustic wave from an acoustically penetrable <b>or</b> impenetrable (<b>soft</b> <b>or</b> hard) sphere separated {{at a distance from}} another sphere, also penetrable <b>or</b> impenetrable (<b>soft</b> <b>or</b> hard), of acoustically small radius, is examined. The penetrable spheres and the surrounding medium are fluids or fluidlike; i. e., they do not support shear waves. Separation of variables, in conjunction with translational addition theorems for spherical wave functions, is used. Analytical expressions are obtained for the scattered pressure field and the scattering cross sections. Numerical results are given for penetrable and impenetrable spheres, showing the influence of the small sphere on the scattering cross sections of the other sphere. © Nauka/Interperiodica 2007...|$|R

25|$|Standard {{treatment}} for most skin <b>or</b> <b>soft</b> tissue abscesses is cutting {{it open and}} drainage. If the diagnosis is uncertain, the wound should be aspirated with a needle, with aspiration of pus confirming the diagnosis and availing for Gram stain and bacterial culture.|$|E

50|$|Pink neon {{signs are}} {{generally}} produced {{using one of}} two different methods. One method is to use neon gas and a blue or purple phosphor, which generally produces a warmer (more reddish) or more intense shade of pink. Another method is to use an argon/mercury blend and a red phosphor, which generally produces a cooler (more purplish) <b>or</b> <b>softer</b> shade of pink.|$|R

A set of foot extensions is available to allow the board to be used on softer surfaces. The extension feet are included with some versions of the Balance Board, but not in European versions.|$|R

25|$|Standard compound-action snips are {{designed}} for cutting steel <b>or</b> <b>softer</b> materials, although the occasional use on stainless steel is not detrimental. For cutting through tougher materials, such as inconel and titanium, special hard snips are available.

These snips will have a different color handle to differentiate them from the other standard types.|$|R
