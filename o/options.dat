5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} <b>options</b> depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for <b>options</b> that will continue the conversation in depth, while <b>options</b> on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard and affect the player's chosen morality. Morality is measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points allow the player to develop talents that affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue <b>options</b> with significant impact in the game.|$|E

5|$|During 2005–06, a Bakerloo {{extension}} {{was proposed}} with three route <b>options.</b> The <b>options</b> were extensions to Hayes via Peckham Rye, Beckenham Junction via Camberwell, or Hayes via New Cross. In July 2011, Network Rail recommended {{an extension of}} the Bakerloo line from Elephant & Castle to Lewisham, where it would take over the line to Hayes. In September 2014, Transport for London ran a consultation on the Bakerloo extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction with <b>options</b> via Lewisham and Camberwell or Old Kent Road, taking over Network Rail's Hayes line. The cost of the extension is estimated at around £2–3 billion with construction expected to take place between the mid-2020s and early 2030s. A February 2017 consultation indicates that the line could extend to Lewisham via Old Kent Road with future extension <b>options</b> later on.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, a {{business}} case was developed with three <b>options</b> {{to extend the}} life of the fleet. The first two <b>options</b> involved expanding the service life extension program (SLEP) at a cost of $4.6 billion and $3.16 billion respectively. The third option, worth $1.72 billion, was to build 242 new wings and avoid the cost of expanding the SLEP. In 2006, option 3 was chosen and Boeing won the contract. The base contract is for 117 wings with <b>options</b> for 125 additional wings. In 2013, the Air Force exercised a portion of the option to add 56 wings, putting 173 wings on order with <b>options</b> remaining for 69 additional wings. In November 2011, two A-10s flew with the new wings fitted. The new wings improved mission readiness, decreased maintenance costs, and allowed the A-10 to be operated up to 2035 if necessary.
