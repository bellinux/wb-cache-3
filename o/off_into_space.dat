5|$|Leo {{intends to}} kill Quatermass {{to prevent the}} {{destruction}} of the asteroid, and also to allow the ammonids to travel back to Earth en masse in the Quatermass II. He tries to kill Quatermass with a gun, but the recoil sends him floating helplessly <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space.</b> Quatermass returns to the rocket and jettisons the nuclear motor, then flies the rocket back to earth as the motor blows up the asteroid, killing the remaining ammonids and relinquishing control over Dillon and all the 'marked' humans, returning mankind to its former freedom.|$|E
5|$|Sonic {{proceeds}} {{to visit the}} planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, including Cream, Knuckles, Shadow, Amy, and the Chaotix. After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space.</b> The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.|$|E
5|$|The Falcon {{journeys}} to the Rebel base at Yavin IV, {{where the}} Rebels analyze the Death Star plans {{and find a}} weakness. Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave. The Rebel fighters attack the Death Star but suffer heavy losses during the assault. During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, and he turns off his targeting computer. Vader appears with his own group of fighters, {{and is about to}} fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the Falcon and attacks Vader and his men, sending Vader's ship <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space.</b> Guided by the Force, Luke fires into the port, destroying the Death Star, and he returns to the Rebel base with his friends to celebrate their victory.|$|E
60|$|Arthur {{followed}} {{him up the}} staircase, which was panelled <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>spaces</b> like so many mourning tablets, into a dim bed-chamber, the floor of which had gradually so sunk and settled, that the fire-place was in a dell. On a black bier-like sofa in this hollow, propped up behind with one great angular black bolster like the block at a state execution {{in the good old}} times, sat his mother in a widow's dress.|$|R

5|$|In 1973, DEC {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} a real-time, graphical version of Lunar Lander, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals, when connected to their PDP-10 or PDP-11 minicomputers. The game was written by Jack Burness, a DEC consultant, and named Moonlander; it was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. Unlike the previous turn-based, textual games, Moonlander is a real-time graphical game. The goal remains to correctly land a lunar module {{on the surface of the}} moon using the game's telemetry data. If the player miscalculates the module's landing, the module will either fly <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space</b> or crash into the moon's surface. The game is controlled with a light pen, and the output display was a vector graphics system; the light pen allowed adjusting the throttle value and the angle of the lunar lander. Burness has said that he does not recall playing the original Lunar, but that by 1973 there were numerous versions of the game which he had played. He based the calculations of the fuel consumption for maneuvering the rocket on the actual lunar lander specifications, which he obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which co-designed the lander. The entire game was written in ten days.|$|E
500|$|Regaining {{consciousness}} in the escaping floatplane, Lois learns that Superman {{has gone to}} confront Luthor. Knowing of the kryptonite danger, Lois convinces Richard to double back to help him. Jason spots the Man of Steel {{in the water and}} Lois and Richard get him into the plane, where Lois removes the shard. Recovering, Superman flies high into the atmosphere to regain his strength by exposure to sunlight. Using his heat vision, he then tunnels deep under the new land mass and, using the last of his strength, is able to fly it <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space</b> before it absorbs more land.|$|E
500|$|Escaping with Luthor in the helicopter, a disillusioned Kitty {{discards}} {{the remaining}} crystals {{and the two}} eventually end up on a deserted island when they run out of fuel. Complications from kryptonite exposure cause Superman to fall into a coma, and while doctors are able to remove more fragments from his skin, they cannot revive him. Lois visits {{him in the hospital}} and whispers into his ear while glancing at Jason. Soon after, hospital staff discover his room empty. No longer feeling alone in the universe, Superman visits his newly revealed son in the boy's room and repeats to Jason the words of his own father as he sleeps. Lois starts writing another article, titled [...] "Why the World Needs Superman." [...] Superman reassures her that he is now back to stay, and flies <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space,</b> where he gazes down at the world.|$|E
50|$|Arthur C. Clarke (1950) {{presented}} {{a summary of}} motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monograph Interplanetary Flight. He argued that humanity's choice is essentially between expansion <b>off</b> Earth <b>into</b> <b>space,</b> versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death.|$|R

500|$|Mars {{lost its}} {{magnetosphere}} 4 billion years ago, possibly because of numerous asteroid strikes, so {{the solar wind}} interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere, lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away atoms from the outer layer. Both Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Express have detected ionised atmospheric particles trailing <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space</b> behind Mars, and this atmospheric loss is being studied by the MAVEN orbiter. Compared to Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is quite rarefied. Atmospheric pressure on the surface today ranges {{from a low of}} [...] on Olympus Mons to over [...] in Hellas Planitia, with a mean pressure at the surface level of [...] The highest atmospheric density on Mars is equal to that found [...] above Earth's surface. The resulting mean surface pressure is only 0.6% of that of Earth (101.3 kPa). The scale height of the atmosphere is about , which is higher than Earth's, , because the surface gravity of Mars is only about 38% of Earth's, an effect offset by both the lower temperature and 50% higher average molecular weight of the atmosphere of Mars.|$|E
500|$|Forced {{to cancel}} Pink Floyd's {{appearance}} at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, {{as well as several}} other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused {{to come out of the}} car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not responding to questions and staring <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space.</b> He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime [...] "See Emily Play" [...] on Boone's show. After these embarrassing episodes, King ended their US visit and immediately sent them home to London. Soon after their return, they supported Jimi Hendrix during a tour of England; however, Barrett's depression worsened as the tour continued, reaching a crisis point in December, when the band responded by adding a new member to their line-up.|$|E
500|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of the rapidly urbanizing United States of the 1910s and 1920s, one house from the artificial grid of modern, planned America takes flight in the dream of a woman who has feasted on Welsh rarebit. [...] The Flying House is rendered in meticulous realistic detail. [...] The house is conventional in every respect—until the viewer reaches the attic, where the woman's husband is seen tending an enormous engine. [...] He attaches a propeller to a shaft out front of the house, and tells his wife that his actions are in reaction to their landlord's intention to evict them over nonpayment. [...] He says he plans to [...] "steal the house", and the couple fly away to find a place where their landlord will never find them—a swamp, the ocean, even the moon, where they are chased off by the Man in the Moon with a flyswatter. [...] The film self-consciously directs the viewers to notice the quality and accuracy of the animation when the house takes <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space,</b> calling attention to the [...] "remarkable piece of animation which follows", accurately showing the revolutions of the Earth and Moon and the [...] "beautiful constellation of Orion". [...] The woman becomes anxious that they will become [...] "lost in the sky". [...] In the end, the house is struck by a military rocket, bringing the nightmare to an end as the woman awakens in her bed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{remastering}} of Series I to III {{was carried}} out during the late 1990s. Changes throughout the series included replacement of the opening credits, giving the picture a colour grade and filmising, computer generated special effects of Red Dwarf and many more visual and audio enhancements. Changes specific to [...] "Kryten" [...] include a new ending with Kryten flying Lister's <b>space</b> bike <b>off</b> <b>into</b> distant <b>space</b> away from Red Dwarf.|$|R
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of [...] "The Exciting Middle Part", while Eliminators destroy Yugopotamia, Timmy is in Fairy World in front of fairy game geeks. He plays The Chosen One Video Game, which utilizes a white wand guitar controller that imitates the actual white wand, like a Guitar Hero controller that imitates a real guitar. When Mark's space pod plunges into the Earth and destroys an Eliminator disguised as Mark, the Eliminator's feet curl up in a way reminiscent of the Wicked Witch of the East from the Wizard of Oz. At {{the site of the}} Abracatraz Prison where the kidnapped fairies are held hostage, its front gate contains an inscription that reads [...] "Abandon all hope, ye who here enter", which when translated into Italian reads [...] "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate", the phrase used at the entrance gate to Hell in the Inferno chapter of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. In order to get Dark Laser to come to Earth so Timmy, along with Mr. Crocker and Vicky, can board on his Death Ball and blast <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space,</b> Timmy posts a video that ridicules him onto a video-sharing website called [...] "TooYube", whose name and logo {{are similar to those of}} YouTube. Before heading to the Blue Moon, Turbo Thunder flies Timmy and Mark from Fridgidarium to another planet, Thunder World. The planet features a [...] "thunder wonderland", an amusement park with a Las Vegas Strip theme, evidenced by hotels and palm trees.|$|E
500|$|Lindelof {{stated that}} [...] "When season five starts, you won't know when or where you are. [...] And {{the way we}} tell stories will be {{different}} too", and confirmed that the [...] "whooshing sound" [...] effect {{will continue to be}} used as the transition for the new storytelling device. [...] When asked if episodes continue to focus on specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that [...] "It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space</b> and then we cut to something that happened in their previous life. [...] They've gone in a slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode." [...] The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to see every character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers [...] "not supposed to have any sense of where and when we are". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, [...] "The Variable". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were [...] "skipping" [...] to the same time periods, and also to show that time travel was painful for the characters.|$|E
500|$|As seen in Crash Bandicoot, Crash {{was once}} an {{ordinary}} eastern barred bandicoot before he was snatched from the wild by Doctor Neo Cortex and subjected to the Evolvo-Ray as part of Cortex's plan to make Crash the [...] "general" [...] of his [...] "Cortex Commandos", which {{would be used to}} dominate the world. However, he is later deemed unworthy of being in Cortex's army and escapes from Cortex's castle. As an act of revenge and to rescue a female bandicoot named Tawna, Crash travels through the Wumpa Islands, defeating Cortex's henchmen along the way. He eventually steals Cortex's airship, defeats Doctor Cortex, and escapes alongside Tawna. A year later in , Crash is sent off to get a new laptop battery for his sister Coco, but is soon abducted by Doctor Neo Cortex, who claims to have changed his ways. Crash is then ordered to gather Crystals for Cortex while fighting off opposition from Doctor Nitrus Brio. Once Cortex reveals his hidden intentions, Crash sends Cortex flying <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>space</b> and aids Nitrus Brio in destroying Cortex's space station. In , when the remains of the space station crash into Earth and set the demonic Uka Uka free, Crash is recruited by Aku Aku to use Doctor Nefarious Tropy's Time-Twisting Machine to gather the powerful Crystals in their original places before Cortex does. Crash eventually gathers all 25 Crystals and defeats Nefarious Tropy, causing the Time-Twisting Machine to implode on itself. In , Crash is recruited to gather Crystals and return a group of destructive masks named the Elementals to a hibernation state and stop Cortex's new superweapon Crunch Bandicoot. In Crash Twinsanity, after foiling another plot by Doctor Cortex to eliminate him, Crash teams up with Cortex in order to defeat the Evil Twins and restore the natural order of the universe.|$|E
