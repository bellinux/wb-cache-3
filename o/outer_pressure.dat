The morphological and physico-chemical properties (composition, structures) of the corrosion system were characterized {{at different stages}} by using optical microscope and scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The corrosion pattern was mainly characterized by a rust layer confined at the interface between the steel and the mortar. Expansion coefficient of rust products was determined from the rust thickness and the Faraday's law. Furthermore, {{in order to understand}} the mechanical effects of corrosion on the damage of mortar, displacement field measurements were obtained by using digital image correlation.

40|$|Uni-axial {{compression}} {{tests of}} two plastics, polycarbonate (PC) and polyacetal (PA), were conducted at various strain rates from 2. 2 × 10 - 4 /sec {{up to the}} order of 103 /sec by using short cylindrical specimens. Also the same tests were conducted under the static <b>outer</b> <b>pressure</b> of 200 or 400 kg/cm 2 applied to the circumferential surface of specimens. High strain rates of the order of 102 ∼ 103 /sec were obtained by a Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus, and some discussions were made on the stress-strain relations obtained. As a result, the stress-strain relations for the materials used showed remarkable strain rate dependence. The ratio of the yield strength of PC without the static <b>outer</b> <b>pressure</b> at the high strain fate 360 /sec to that at the low strain rate 2. 2 × 10 - 4 /sec was 1. 65, and that of PA was 1. 77 under almost the same condition as PC.

40|$|A broad {{parametric}} {{study is}} carried out to investigate the effects of both the inhomogeneity parameter, and a profile index of Stodola’s hyperbolic function on the static response of such structures subjected to both the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>pressures.</b> The investigation {{is based on the}} analytical formulas lately published by the author. The effects of those parameters on the variation of the radial displacement, the radial and hoop stresses are all graphically illustrated for an annulus pressurized at its both surfaces. It is observed that, especially, the variation of the hoop stress in radial coordinate is closely sensible to variation of those parameters. For the chosen problems it was observed that one of two materials whose Young’s modulus is higher than the other is better to locate at the inner surface of the disc having divergent profile to get reasonable maximum hoop stresses. However much smaller radial displacements may be obtained by using positive inhomogeneity indexes for all discs whose surfaces host a material whose Young’s modulus is smaller than the other. To reach a final decision, analytical formulas such as those {{used in the present study}} together with a failure criteria such as Von Mises and Tresca become indispensable means in a design process. ...|$|R
