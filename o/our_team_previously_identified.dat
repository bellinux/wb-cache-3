40|$|Osteoarthritis is a whole-joint disease {{characterized}} by the progressive destruction of articular cartilage involving abnormal communication between subchondral bone and cartilage. <b>Our</b> <b>team</b> <b>previously</b> <b>identified</b> 14 - 3 - 3 ε protein as a subchondral bone soluble mediator altering cartilage homeostasis. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the involvement of CD 13 (also known as aminopeptidase N, APN) in the chondrocyte response to 14 - 3 - 3 ε. After identifying CD 13 in chondrocytes, we knocked down CD 13 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) and blocking antibodies in articular chondrocytes. 14 - 3 - 3 ε-inducedMMP- 3 andMMP- 13 was significantly reducedwith CD 13 knockdown, which suggests that it has a crucial role in 14 - 3 - 3 ε signal transduction. AminopeptidaseNactivitywas identified in chondrocytes, but the activity was unchanged after stimulation with 14 - 3 - 3 ε. Direct interaction between CD 13 and 14 - 3 - 3 ε was then demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance. Using labeled 14 - 3 - 3 ε, we also found that 14 - 3 - 3 ε binds to the surface of chondrocytes in a manner that is dependent on CD 13. Taken together, these results suggest that 14 - 3 - 3 ε might directly bind to CD 13, which transmits its signal in chondrocytes to induce a catabolic phenotype similar to that observed in osteoarthritis. The 14 - 3 - 3 ε–CD 13 interaction could be a new therapeutic target in osteoarthritis...|$|E
40|$|Implementing machine {{learning}} algorithms for large data, such as the Web graph and social networks, is challenging. Even though much {{research has focused on}} making se-quential algorithms more scalable, their running times continue to be prohibitively long. Meanwhile, parallelization remains a formidable challenge for this class of problems, despite frameworks like MapReduce which hide much of the associated complexity. We present three ongoing efforts within <b>our</b> <b>team,</b> <b>previously</b> presented at venues in other fields, which aim {{to make it easier for}} {{machine learning}} researchers and practi-tioners alike to quickly implement and experiment with their algorithms in a parallel or distributed setting. Furthermore, we hope to highlight some of the language features unique to the Scala programming language in the treatment of our frameworks, in an effort to show how these features can be used to produce efficient and correct parallel systems more easily than ever before. ...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} architectures are based on low-power microcontrollers and highly integrated short range radio transceiver chips operating {{in one of the}} few ISM bands. This combination provides a convenient and proven approach to design and build inexpensive sensor nodes rapidly. However, the black box nature of these radio chips severely limit experimentation and research with novel and innovative technologies in the wireless infrastructure. <b>Our</b> <b>team</b> <b>previously</b> proposed a revolutionary architecture for wireless nodes based on Flash FPGA devices. This paper shows the initial results of our work through the implementation and evaluation of a simple baseband FSK modem in the SmartFusion FPGA fabric. We also demonstrate how we could leverage existing software radio projects to use the baseband modem in a wide range of radio frequency bands.

40|$|Electron spin {{resonance}} spectroscopy (ESR) is {{a highly}} efficient technique able to access {{a wide range of}} information about the unfavourable effects caused by a chemical or a drug. ESR in spin labelling fits well in with the study of membranes and particularly with the changes in lipid bilayer organisation induced by drug. <b>Our</b> <b>team</b> <b>previously</b> developed a way to quantify the effective lipid bilayer microviscosity of cell membranes and consequently put in evidence the fluidity effect of the propofol. Recently, the importance of lipid raft domains has been shown due to their important role as a platform for signal transduction and protein sorting. We propose to highlight the effect of the Randomly methylated beta cyclodextrin (Rameb) on these domains on membrane model (liposomes) as well as on colon carcinoma cell line (HCT- 116). Futhermore, ESR in spin trapping is used in order to identify and quantify the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in cells. An ESR study on human colon carcinoma cell line has highlighted the cytotoxicity of the photosensitizer pyrophephorbide-a methyl ester. Using an intracellular located spin trap (4 -pyridyl 1 -oxide-N-tert-butylnitrone, POBN), {{it has been shown that}} the photoexcitation of the dye is able to generate superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen. Moreover, ESR is one of the most sensitive method for measuring cellular oxygen consumption. <b>Our</b> <b>team</b> has studied the alterations of oxygen respiratory in human tubular renal cells treated with an endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS).

40|$|Counter to prior {{claims that}} empathy is {{required}} for higher levels of engagement in human-computer interaction, <b>our</b> <b>team</b> has <b>previously</b> found that, {{in an analysis of}} 844 stimulus presentations, empathy is sufficient for high engagement, but is not necessary. Here, we ran a carefully controlled study of human-computer interactions with musical stimuli [...] - with and without visuals, and with and without recognizable people [...] to directly test whether we could design an engaging stimulus that did not elicit empathy, by avoiding human faces or personal interaction. We measured subjective responses by visual analogue scale and found that the faceless stimulus was as engaging as the face-containing stimulus, but much less empathy-provoking. Therefore, we propose that empathy and engagement be considered independently during interaction design, because they are not monotonically related...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Rather than {{searching the}} entire MEDLINE database, clinicians can perform {{searches}} on a filtered set of articles where relevant information {{is more likely}} to be found. Members of <b>our</b> <b>team</b> <b>previously</b> developed two types of MEDLINE filters. The 'methods' filters help identify clinical research of high methodological merit. The 'content' filters help identify articles in the discipline of renal medicine. We will now test the utility of these filters for physician MEDLINE searching. Hypothesis When a physician searches MEDLINE, we hypothesize the use of filters will increase the number of relevant articles retrieved (increase 'recall,' also called sensitivity) and decrease the number of non-relevant articles retrieved (increase 'precision,' also called positive predictive value), compared to the performance of a physician's search unaided by filters. Methods We will survey a random sample of 100 nephrologists in Canada to obtain the MEDLINE search that they would first perform themselves for a focused clinical question. Each question we provide to a nephrologist will be based on the topic of a recently published, well-conducted systematic review. We will examine the performance of a physician's unaided MEDLINE search. We will then apply a total of eight filter combinations to the search (filters used in isolation or in combination). We will calculate the recall and precision of each search. The filter combinations that most improve on unaided physician searches will be identified and characterized. Discussion If these filters improve search performance, physicians will be able to search MEDLINE for renal evidence more effectively, in less time, and with less frustration. Additionally, our methodology can be used as a proof of concept for the evaluation of search filters in other disciplines. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} first {{abundance}} analysis of 17 M giant {{stars in the}} inner Galactic bulge at (l,b) =(0,- 1), based on R= 25, 000 infrared spectroscopy (1. 5 - 1. 8 μ m) using NIRSPEC at the Keck telescope. Based on their luminosities and radial velocities, we identify these stars with a stellar population older than 1 Gyr. We find the iron abundance = - 0. 22 ± 0. 03, with a 1 σ dispersion of 0. 14 ± 0. 024. We also find the bulge stars have enhanced [alpha/Fe] abundance ratio {{at the level of}} + 0. 3 dex relative to the Solar stars, and low ≈ 6. 5 ± 0. 3.

40|$|Not {{providing}} adequate patient education {{interventions to}} asthma patients remains a major care gap. To help asthma patients and caregivers discuss inhaled controller medication use, <b>our</b> <b>team</b> has <b>previously</b> developed a decision aid (DA). We sought {{to assess whether}} adding this DA to education interventions improved knowledge, decisional conflict, and asthma control among adults with asthma. A parallel clinical trial (NCT 02516449). We recruited adults with asthma, aged 18 to 65 years, prescribed inhaled controller medication to optimize asthma control. Educators randomly allocated participants either to the education + DA or to the education group. At baseline and two-month follow-up, we measured asthma knowledge (primary outcome) with a validated self-administered questionnaire (score - 37 to + 37). Secondary outcomes included decisional conflict and asthma control. Blinded assessors collected data. Between the two time points, the within- and between-group changes were estimated by generalized linear mixed models. Fifty-one participants (response rate: 53 %; age: 44 ± 13 years; women: n = 32) were randomized either to the education + DA group (n = 26) or to the education group (n = 25), and included in statistical analyses. Between baseline and follow-up, mean [95 % CI] knowledge scores increased from 21. 5 [19. 9 - 23. 2] to 25. 1 [23. 1 - 27. 0] in the education + DA group (P = 0. 0002) and from 24. 0 [22. 3 - 25. 7] to 26. 0 [24. 0 - 28. 0] in the education group (P = 0. 0298). In both of the groups, decisional conflict and asthma control improved. There were no differences between groups.

40|$|Ectopic Fas-ligand (FasL) {{expression}} in tumor cells {{is responsible for}} both tumor escape through tumor counterattack of Fas-positive infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor rejection though inflammatory and immune responses. <b>Our</b> <b>team</b> has <b>previously</b> shown that RhoA GTPase and its effector ROCK kinases negatively control FasL membrane {{expression in}} murine melanoma B 16 F 10 cells. In this study we found that B 16 F 10 treatment with the ROCK inhibitor H 1152 reduced melanoma development in vivo through FasL membrane over-expression. Although H 1152 treatment did not reduce tumor growth rate in vitro, the inhibitor delayed tumor appearance and slowed tumor growth in C 57 BL/ 6 immunocompetent mice in vivo. Thanks {{to the use of}} mice bearing mutated Fas receptors (B 6 /lpr), we found that reduced tumor growth, observed in immunocompetent mice, was linked to FasL over-expression induced by H 1152 treatment. Tumor growth analysis in immunosuppressed NUDE and IFNγ-KO mice highlighted a major role for T lymphocytes and IFNγ in the H 1152 -induced tumor growth reduction. Histological analyses of subcutaneous tumors, obtained from untreated versus H 1152 -treated B 16 F 10 cells, showed that H 1152 pretreatment induced a strong intra-tumoral infiltration of lymphocytes. Cytofluorometric analysis showed that these were mainly activated CD 8 lymphocytes, which were responsible for the reduction in tumor growth. Subcutaneous tumor growth was also reduced by repeated intravenous injections of a clinical ROCK inhibitor Fasudil. Finally, H 1152 -induced ROCK inhibition also reduced pulmonary metastasis implantation, but this effect was not dependent on the T cell-mediated immune response. Altogether our data show that B 16 F 10 melanoma cell treatment with ROCK kinase inhibitors, reduces tumor growth and metastasis development and through increased FasL expression, promotes an anti-tumor immune response. These inhibitors could therefore become interesting pharmacological molecules for melanoma immunotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Two adjoined forts {{and their}} surroundings, {{elements}} of the 3 rd century Roman frontier in Dacia – Limes Transalutanus, which were last archaeologically investigated in 1930, were recently systematic surface surveyed, resulting {{in the identification of}} the associated civilian settlement in what seemed, at first glance, as an unexpected location, more distant than other military vici the <b>team</b> had <b>previously</b> <b>identified</b> along the same frontier line. Not only the limits of the settlement at Săpata were established, but also the density of occupation and territory division into various functional areas, allowing further interpretations regarding the network of ancient local roads and {{a better understanding of the}} way in which the Romans adjusted their built facilities to available resources (water) or exploited the strategical features of the relief. Using an efficient, quick and rather inexpensive combination of survey methods (field walking and measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of the soil applied on a 4. 8 ha surface, followed by pottery typological and spatial distribution analysis), the investigation team tried to mitigate the challenging vegetation situation, adjusting likewise to the limited resources of a scheduled research project.   Data relevance was increased by applying statistical corrections and using complementary investigation methods in order to cover the various available types of land (relief, vegetation, visibility); while data integration was ensured employing a unitary spatial gridded system for fieldwork and also by relating the obtained results to the high resolution digital terrain model of the sites obtained during UAV photogrammetric aerial survey. In particular, the study takes the opportunity opened by the analysis of the Roman Age pottery found in Săpata vicus to debate on the significance of the traditional, yet not unitary perceived, scholarly division between ‘Chilia-Militari’ ware (dwelling on Dacian traditions) and Roman local production. The consistent percent of Chilia-Militari types in the collected lot and its uniform spatial distribution inside the civilian settlement raise questions about the potters’ identity, their social status and reason to revive older production techniques. Some data about a Middle Bronze Age settlement, belonging to Tei Culture, identified in the same surveyed area, are given also...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Ocular {{albinism}} type 1 (OA 1) is an X-linked ocular disorder {{characterized by}} a severe reduction in visual acuity, nystagmus, hypopigmentation of the retinal pigmented epithelium, foveal hypoplasia, macromelanosomes in pigmented skin and eye cells, and misrouting of the optical tracts. This disease is primarily caused by mutations in the OA 1 gene. Methods The ophthalmologic phenotype of the patients and their family members was characterized. We screened for mutations in the OA 1 gene by direct sequencing of the nine PCR-amplified exons, and for genomic deletions by PCR-amplification of large DNA fragments. Results We sequenced the nine exons of the OA 1 gene in 72 individuals and found ten different mutations in seven unrelated families and three sporadic cases. The ten mutations include an amino acid substitution and a premature stop codon <b>previously</b> reported by <b>our</b> <b>team,</b> and eight <b>previously</b> unidentified mutations: three amino acid substitutions, a duplication, a deletion, an insertion and two splice-site mutations. The use of a novel Taq polymerase enabled us to amplify large genomic fragments covering the OA 1 gene. and to detect very likely six distinct large deletions. Furthermore, {{we were able to}} confirm that there was no deletion in twenty one patients where no mutation had been found. Conclusion The identified mutations affect highly conserved amino acids, cause frameshifts or alternative splicing, thus affecting folding of the OA 1 G protein coupled receptor, interactions of OA 1 with its G protein and/or binding with its ligand. </p...|$|R
