5|$|Cats do eat grass <b>occasionally.</b> <b>A</b> {{proposed}} {{explanation is}} that cats use grass {{as a source of}} folic acid.

5|$|In {{international}} cricket, Wales and England field {{a single}} representative team, {{administered by the}} England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team, or simply 'England'. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>a</b> separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions.

5|$|The common {{chiffchaff}} is <b>occasionally</b> <b>a</b> host of brood parasitic cuckoos, {{including the}} common and Horsfield's cuckoos, but it recognises and rejects non-mimetic eggs {{and is therefore}} only rarely successfully brood-parasitised. Like other passerine birds, the common chiffchaff can also acquire intestinal nematode parasites and external ticks.|$|E

5|$|To {{diagnose}} osteochondritis dissecans, an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan can {{be performed}} to show necrosis of subchondral bone, formation of loose fragments, or both. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>a</b> nuclear medicine bone scan is {{used to assess the}} degree of loosening within the joint.|$|E
5|$|When {{using its}} own web to catch {{other species of}} salticids, P. fimbriata conceals its {{conspicuous}} palps, which it does not do when stalking a web-spider or <b>occasionally</b> <b>a</b> moving fly.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the case}} of kelpies and water horses, most myths about water bulls are about males of the species. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>a</b> water cow is mentioned, as in the Highland tale set at Borrodale on Skye, where a water cow was reputed to reside in a small loch. Canine {{carcases}} left out to trap the beast were ignored. Sir Walter Scott also refers to a water cow in a story about an attempt to drain Loch na Beiste to kill one believed to be living there.|$|E

5|$|As the {{fortress}} expands and develops, new noble positions become available. While regular dwarves {{will be happy}} with simple rooms provided to them, dwarves appointed or elected to noble positions will need more luxurious accommodation. Nobles will even make demands and , getting negative thoughts {{if they are not}} fulfilled. A justice system is present to punish criminals, for example, dwarves who injure or kill another dwarf or destroy furniture. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>a</b> vampire dwarf, with a fake background history, may arrive with a migrant wave and start killing and feeding on the other citizens without being noticed.|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em ups {{are related}} to—but {{distinct}} from—fighting games, {{which are based}} around one-on-one matches rather than scrolling levels and multiple enemies. Such terminology is loosely applied, however, as some commentators prefer to conflate the two terms. At times, both one-on-one fighting games and scrolling beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics and style and can appeal to fans of either genre. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>a</b> game will feature both kinds of gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>a</b> comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E

The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E

5|$|In Ancient Rome {{people did}} not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was {{affected}}. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>a</b> spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Occasionally</b> <b>a</b> hospice will {{be unable}} to provide care to a patient, either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the patient or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include disruptive or abusive behavior from the patient or other persons in the patient's home or refusal to cooperate with the hospice program. Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E

After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the underlying cause.|$|E

5|$|Some {{people with}} AML may {{experience}} {{swelling of the}} gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue.

5|$|Sometimes {{during the}} tadpole stage, {{one of the}} {{developing}} rear legs is eaten by a predator such as a dragonfly nymph. In some cases, the full leg still grows, but in others it does not, although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>a</b> parasitic flatworm (Ribeiroia ondatrae) digs into the rear of a tadpole, causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and the frog develops an extra leg or two.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's predators include {{birds and}} aquatic mammals. Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) are the {{predominant}} land predator of chicks, responsible {{for up to}} 34% of chick deaths in some colonies though they often scavenge dead penguins as well. The south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) mainly scavenges for dead chicks, as the live chicks are too large to be attacked {{by the time of}} its annual arrival in the colony. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>a</b> parent may defend their chick from attack, although it may be more passive if the chick is sickly.|$|E
