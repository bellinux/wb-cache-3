40|$|We {{study the}} solution's {{existence}} for a generalized Dynkin game of switching type which {{is shown to}} be the natural representation for general defaultable <b>OTC</b> <b>contract</b> with contingent CSA. This is a theoretical counterparty risk mitigation mechanism that allows the counterparty of a general <b>OTC</b> <b>contract</b> to switch from zero to full/perfect collateralization and switch back whenever she wants until contract maturity paying some switching costs and {{taking into account the}} running costs that emerge over time. In this paper we allow for the strategic interaction between the counterparties of the underlying contract, which makes the problem solution much more tough. We are motivated in this research by the importance to show the economic sense - in terms of optimal contract design - of a contingent counterparty risk mitigation mechanism like our one. In particular, we show that the existence of the solution and the game Nash equilibrium is connected with the solution of a system of non-linear reflected BSDE which remains an open problem. We then provide the basic ideas to numerically search the game equilibrium via an iterative optimal stopping approach and we show the existence of the solution for our problem under strong condition, in the so called symmetric case.

40|$|The present work {{studies and}} {{analyzes}} general defaultable <b>OTC</b> <b>contract</b> in {{presence of a}} contingent CSA, which is a theoretical counterparty risk mitigation mechanism of switching type that allows the counterparty of a general <b>OTC</b> <b>contract</b> to switch from zero to full/perfect collateralization and switch back whenever she wants until contract maturity paying some switching costs and {{taking into account the}} running costs that emerge over time. The motivation and the underlying economic idea is to show that the current full/partial collateralization mechanisms defined within contracts' CSA - and now imposed by the banking supervision authorities - are "suboptimal" and less economic than the contingent one that allows to optimally take in account all the relevant driver namely the expected costs of counterparty default losses - represented by the (bilateral) CVA - and the expected collateral and funding costs. In this perspective, we tackle the problem from the risk management and optimal design point of view solving - under some working assumptions - the derived stochastic switching control model via Snell envelope technique and important results of the theory of the backward stochastic differential equations with reflection (RBSDE). We have also studied the numerical solution providing an algorithm procedure for the value function computation based on an iterative optimal stopping approach. Comment: 34 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{customized}} derivatives contracts, efficient trading of large contracts, and liquidity {{are the main}} drivers of OTC deriva-tives markets. The primary reason to use an <b>OTC</b> <b>contract,</b> {{as opposed to an}} exchange-traded contract, is to create a “perfect ” hedge, both for hedge accounting purposes (see Box 1) and to satisfy other require-ments, such as a need for the physical delivery of a commodity at a location or date that may not exist at an exchange. Customized con-tract terms can minimize so-called basis risk, facilitating “perfect” hedging.

40|$|In [1] Zawadoski {{introduces}} a banking network {{model in which}} the asset and counter-party risks are treated separately and the banks hedge their assets risks by appropriate <b>OTC</b> <b>contracts.</b> In his model, each bank has only two counter-party neighbors, a bank fails due to the counter-party risk only if {{at least one of}} its two neighbors default, and such a counter-party risk is a low probability event. Informally, the author shows that the banks will hedge their asset risks by appropriate <b>OTC</b> <b>contracts,</b> and, though it may be socially optimal to insure against counter-party risk, in equilibrium banks will not choose to insure this low probability event. In this paper, we consider the above model for more general network topologies, namely when each node has exactly 2 r counter-party neighbors for some integer r> 0. We extend the analysis of [1] to show that as the number of counter-party neighbors increase the probability of counter-party risk also increases, and in particular the socially optimal solution becomes privately sustainable when each bank hedges its risk to at least n/ 2 banks, where n is the number of banks in the network, i. e., when 2 r is at least n/ 2, banks not only hedge their asset risk but also hedge its counter-party risk.

30|$|Let {{us first}} make some {{comments}} from the hedger’s perspective regarding the crucial features of the margin account. The financial practice may require to hold the collateral amounts in segregated margin accounts, so that the hedger, when he is a collateral taker, cannot {{make use of the}} collateral amount for trading. Another collateral convention mostly encountered in practice is rehypothecation (around 90 % of cash collateral of <b>OTC</b> <b>contracts</b> are rehypothecated), which refers to the situation where the hedger may use the collateral pledged by his counterparties as collateral for his contracts with other counterparties. Obviously, if the hedger is a collateral provider, then a particular convention regarding segregation or rehypothecation is immaterial for the dynamics of the value process of his portfolio. We refer the reader to Bielecki and Rutkowski (2015) and Crépey et al. (2014) for a detailed analysis of various conventions on collateral agreements. Here we will examine some basic aspects of collateralization (sometimes also called margining) in our context.|$|R

Information about Greece is scarce and fragmented, but the inability by European authorities to understand the incredible mismanagement strongly disappoints the taxpayer. The relevant exposure of European banks in the bond market toward the default risk of Greece supports the need for hedging tools, such as Credit Default Swaps. However, there is evidence that the CDS market on Greek sovereign bonds is segmented, and contracts are mis-priced.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the issue of {{computation}} of the bilateral credit valuation adjustment (CVA) under rating triggers, and in presence of ratings-linked margin agree-ments.

We also introduce a new component in the decomposition of the coun-terparty risky price: namely the rating valuation adjustment (RVA) that accounts for the rating triggers. We give two examples of dynamic collateralization schemes where the margin thresholds {{are linked to the}} credit ratings of the parties.

This course of action includes in particular the installation of a centralized clearing entity and with this the obligation to clear all relevant financial derivatives.
