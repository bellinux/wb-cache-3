Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.|$|E
5|$|The smooth toadfish (Tetractenos glaber) is {{a species}} <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the {{pufferfish}} family Tetraodontidae. It {{is native to}} shallow coastal and estuarine waters of southeastern Australia, where it is widespread and abundant. French naturalist Christophe-Paulin de La Poix de Fréminville described the species in 1813, though early records confused it with its close relative, the common toadfish (T. hamiltonii). The two are the only members of the genus Tetractenos after going through several taxonomic changes since discovery.|$|E

40|$|Summary of {{priority}} issues {{for managing the}} ecological effects <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery The Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) process is designed to assess and rank the ecological effects <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> Commonwealth fisheries. The process provides a list of species, habitats and ecological communities that {{are at risk of}} ecological damage from the effects <b>of</b> <b>fishing.</b> This Ecological Risk Management (ERM) report provides how AFMA will respond to these high risk environmental components. The ecological effects <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF) are largely due to the incidental capture of non-target species (including the capture of protected species). The methods <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> employed <b>in</b> the ETBF (pelagic longline, handline, trolling, polling and rod and reel) were found to have little to no direct impact on the physical marine environment. The ERA process analysed the effect <b>of</b> commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> the ETBF, based on the effects on all organisms, habitats and ecological communities that occur {{in the area of the}} fishery. The ERA identified nine species at high risk to the effects <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> the ETBF which are outlined in Table 1. No target species, ecological communities or habitats were assessed to be at high risk from the effects <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>in</b> the ETBF.

5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species <b>of</b> <b>fish.</b> <b>In</b> 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, the Skagen Fisherman's Association was {{established}} {{with the purpose}} of facilitating the local fishing industry through the railway. In 1890, the Skagensbanen narrow-gauge railway from Frederikshavn finally arrived in Skagen, connecting the town to the rest of Denmark. The tracks were widened in 1916 to avoid the need to transfer cargoes <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> Frederikshavn. Many of the town's typical yellow-plastered houses with red roofs which grew up along Sankt Laurentii Vej from 1890 to 1930 were designed by Ulrik Plesner. He was also the architect behind many other buildings in the town, including the railway station, Brøndums Hotel and Skagen Museum. Skagen Missionshus was opened in 1896.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Japan ranked {{fourth in}} the world in tonnage of fish caught.

5|$|Many of {{the islands}} {{were said to have}} Culdee {{connections}}, and had chapels on them. Various saints also have connections with the islands. St Thaney or Thenaw was reputedly the mother of St Kentigern and {{is said to have been}} cast adrift in an oarless coracle in deep waters beyond the Isle of May by her father King Leudonus, which resulted in an abundance <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the seas nearby. St Adrian of May was murdered there by invading Danes in 870 (who killed St Monance in the same raid). He was buried in a stone coffin on the island but is said to have floated across the Firth before coming to rest in a churchyard at Anstruther. The Isle of May has a long history of ecclesiastical activity and there are various remains including that of a 13th-century Benedictine church.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{typically}} harvested local small game, {{but sometimes}} organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their {{main sources of}} animal protein came from mule deer and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk. They began to domesticate turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop. Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as awls and needles from turkey and deer bones. Despite the availability <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the area's rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten.|$|E

5|$|Rainbow trout, chinook and coho salmon, and Pacific Lamprey are {{the most}} common {{anadromous}} fish that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty of jumping over the Butte Creek waterfall, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout. Willow Lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout. Overall, the number <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Tangascootack Creek is {{considered}} to be a cold water fishery. The tributary North Fork Tangascootack Creek has significant trout and macroinvertebrate populations. On the main stem of the creek, there are limited numbers of fish and some aquatic ecosystems, though in the middle and upper parts of the creek, there is virtually no life in the water. Near the headwaters and Bear Swamp, there is some aquatic life, as these locations are upstream of the strip mines and acid mine drainage. The main species <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the creek are brook trout, Semotilus atromaculatus, Catostomus commersoni, and Rhinichthys atratulus. Young-of-the-Year trout also live in the creek.|$|E

Bluegills and longnose dace were {{not present in}} this part of the stream two decades earlier, but rainbow trout and golden shiners were present at that time. The rainbow trout disappeared from the stream because the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission stopped stocking them and the golden shiners were only present in the 1970s due to bait bucket introductions.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} eight species of wild fish in West Creek. Brook trout and brown trout both inhabit West Creek, {{although}} brook trout are slightly more common than brown trout, with nine brook trout and only seven brown trout being observed in a 2010 or 2011 electrofishing survey. Trout are more common upstream of the Pennsylvania Route 239 crossing of the creek than downstream of it. The most common fish in the creek are sculpin, eastern blacknose dace, and cutlips minnows. In the aforementioned electrofishing survey, {{a total of}} 81 sculpin, 34 black-nosed dace, and 17 cutlips minnows were observed. Other species <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the watershed include johnny darter, white sucker, and creek chub.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the Potlatch River watershed, including speckled dace, longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E
