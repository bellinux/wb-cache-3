50|$|Initially {{with only}} the central {{position}} free, the number <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> A positions is 12, the number <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> B positions is 12, and also the number <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> C positions is 12. After every move the number <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> A positions increases or decreases by one, and {{the same for the}} number <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> B positions and the number <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> C positions. Hence after an even number of moves all these three numbers are even, and after an odd number of moves all these three numbers are odd. Hence a final position with only one peg can not be reached: then one of these numbers is one (the position of the peg, one is odd), while the other two numbers are zero, hence even.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{reduction}} <b>of</b> Galois <b>covers</b> <b>of</b> curves, from characteristic zero to positive characteristic. The {{starting point is}} a recent result of Raynaud, which gives a criterion for good reduction for <b>covers</b> <b>of</b> the projective line branched at three points. We use the ideas of Raynaud to study the case <b>of</b> <b>covers</b> <b>of</b> the projective line branched at four points. Under some condition on the Galois group, we generalize the criterion for good reduction of Raynaud.

5|$|Luftflotte 2 {{was well}} {{used in this}} way. Operations against Kenley, Biggin Hill, North Weald and Hornchurch had the {{potential}} to destroy 11 Group's major sector stations and impair its defences. It would also draw the defending fighters into battle. The attempt to attack Kenley, however, failed and 9 Staffel KG 76 paid a high price. The weather prevented any chance of the raids on Hornchurch and North Weald being successful. On the other hand, Luftflotte 3 had poor intelligence, and its raids on the radar stations were ineffective. Radar elimination would enable the Luftwaffe to destroy the command and control system of Fighter Command, but despite the severe damage done to the Poling station, the existence of other stations nearby gave the system plenty <b>of</b> <b>cover.</b> The airfields the Air Fleet attacked at Ford, Gosport and Thorney Island {{had nothing to do with}} the main battle as they belonged to Coastal Command and the FAA.
