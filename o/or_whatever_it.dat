[...] "I don't {{think of myself as}} a powerful person," [...] she told Forbes in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world's hundred most powerful women. [...] "You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> may be. But it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to help others, and for that I'm extremely grateful." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Feynman {{likewise}} held {{a favorable}} {{view of the}} house and of his tenure as Telluride House Faculty Fellow. In an interview he described the House as [...] "a group of boys that have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it’s there that I did the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize. In a correspondence with a fellow Telluride associate congratulating him on the Nobel Prize, Feynman said, [...] "It was at Telluride that I did do all that stuff for which I got the prize, so I look back at those days with nostalgia." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato and Tim James, {{who also}} {{produced}} the track. According to Cyrus, the track's moral is to free yourself from any biding or hindrance, in particular application to women. Cyrus said the song's message applies to different situations. Personally to her, [...] "it is {{about being a}} cage and people looking at you." [...] As for others, she believed it could describe high school, {{in a situation where}} [...] "someone feeling they have to be one way to be with a clique {{and they want to be}} who they are. A relationship, <b>or</b> <b>whatever,</b> <b>it</b> is just breaking out and feeling free." [...] Hollywood Records described [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "a self-empowering song in which Miley asserts that she has to stay true to herself in relationships".|$|E
500|$|Bruce, a boyhood fan of Newcastle United, {{claims to}} have sneaked into St James' Park without paying to watch the team play, saying [...] "I {{have always been a}} Newcastle lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the {{turnstiles}} to get in to try and save a bob <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> was. They were my team, I went to support them as a boy and being a Geordie it's in-bred, you follow the club still the same today." [...] Like several other future professionals from the area, he played football for Wallsend Boys Club. He was also selected for the Newcastle Schools representative team, and at the age of 13 was among a group of players from the team selected to serve as ball boys at the 1974 Football League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
500|$|Composer Gus Levene {{commented that}} Sinatra's {{strength}} {{was that when}} it came to lyrics, telling a story musically, Sinatra displayed a [...] "genius" [...] ability and feeling, which with the [...] "rare combination of voice and showmanship" [...] made him the [...] "original singer" [...] which others who followed most tried to emulate. George Roberts, a trombonist in Sinatra's band, remarked that Sinatra had a [...] "charisma, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is about him, that no one else had". Biographer Arnold Shaw considered that [...] "If Las Vegas had not existed, Sinatra could have invented it". He quoted reporter James Bacon in saying that Sinatra was the [...] "swinging image on which the town is built", adding that no other entertainer quite [...] "embodied the glamour" [...] associated with Las Vegas as him.

500|$|By 1949, Feynman was {{becoming}} restless at Cornell. He never {{settled into a}} particular house or apartment, living in guest houses or student residences, or with married friends [...] "until these arrangements became sexually volatile". He liked to date undergraduates, hire prostitutes, and sleep with the wives of friends. He was not fond of Ithaca's cold winter weather, and pined for a warmer climate. Above all, at Cornell, he {{was always in the}} shadow of Hans Bethe. Feynman did, however, look back favorably on the Telluride House, where he resided for a large period of his Cornell career. In an interview, he described the House as [...] "a group of boys [...] have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it's there that I did the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize.|$|E
500|$|Owing to its {{popularity}} and media exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster {{is often used}} as a modern version of Russell's teapot. Proponents argue that, since {{the existence of the}} invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster—similar to other proposed supernatural beings—cannot be falsified, it demonstrates that the burden of proof rests on those who affirm the existence of such beings. Richard Dawkins explains, [...] "The onus is on somebody who says, I want to believe in God, Flying Spaghetti Monster, fairies, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is. It is not up to us to disprove it." [...] Furthermore, according to Lance Gharavi, an editor of The Journal of Religion and Theater, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is [...] "ultimately...an argument about the arbitrariness of holding any one view of creation", since any one view is equally as plausible as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. A similar argument was discussed in the books The God Delusion and The Atheist Delusion.|$|E
500|$|Lin {{considers}} himself {{a basketball player}} {{more than just an}} Asian American. He understands that there have not been many Asians in the NBA. [...] "Maybe I can help break the stereotype," [...] said Lin. [...] "I feel like Asians in general don't get the respect that we may deserve whether it comes to sports, basketball, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> might be," [...] Lin said. Prior to the 2010–11 NBA season, Americans of Asian descent who played in the NBA included Wataru Misaka, Raymond Townsend, Corey Gaines, Rex Walters, and Robert Swift. [...] " [...] carrying the hopes of an entire continent. I only had to carry the hopes of Little Rock, Arkansas. He's accomplished a lot more than I have already," [...] said Derek Fisher, who had won five NBA championships with the Lakers, after his first game against Lin. Lin is setting an example for prospective Asian athletes in America who rarely see Asian-Americans playing on their favorite teams. [...] "I don't look Japanese," [...] Walters said, referring to his mother's ethnicity. [...] "When they see , it's an Asian-American." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the album sleeve features artwork by long-time Cathedral artist Dave Patchett. Dorrian, describing the art as [...] "climactic", notes that [...] "it's not like a usual epic Dave Patchett piece where he does the full spread; it's just {{one section of the}} artwork now. It's basically thank you and goodbye, fuck you God <b>or</b> <b>whatever.</b> <b>It's</b> just a scene inside The Last Spire I suppose; almost like a nativity scene gone wrong." ...|$|R

Drawn to the supernatural, he notes, [...] "I've been to a lot of places where folklorists say that fairies have been sighted.

500|$|Keenan and Jones {{met through}} {{a mutual friend}} in 1989. After Keenan played a tape {{recording}} for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band. They started jamming together and were {{on the lookout for}} a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he [...] "felt kinda sorry for them," [...] as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy [...] "lachrymology". Although [...] "lachrymology" [...] was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: [...] "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is you're trying to achieve." ...|$|E
500|$|Variety {{was added}} to the city itself, as certain areas were {{designed}} around the villains that control that particular territory. Dax Ginn, marketing game manager at Rocksteady Games, said, [...] "If you move into Joker's territory, you get a very Joker-ized experience, and all the artwork on the buildings– whether that's graffiti, signage, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> might be– gives you a dense kind of Joker experience. So our art team has really put a lot of effort in making that sort of transition between one turf zone to another– really helping the player feel like they're making a physical transition into another emotional space." [...] The architecture was imbued with 19th century Art Nouveau design, such as Strange's Wonder Tower which was inspired by the Eiffel Tower, while character designs employed a modern Hyperrealism style. To keep the environments interesting, base color schemes such as Mr Freeze's ice-themed area, Joker's fire-themed steel mill, and Poison Ivy's jungle-themed area were populated with contrasting elements: for example, the steel mill uses large, white clown faces to contrast the oranges and reds used throughout. To develop the expanded environment of Arkham City and build a [...] "natural urban environment" [...] for Batman, Rocksteady expanded its workforce from 75 to over 100 people.|$|E
500|$|Kristen Stewart {{was on the}} set of Adventureland when Hardwicke {{visited her}} for an {{informal}} screen test that [...] "captivated" [...] the director. Hardwicke had trouble finding an actor otherworldly enough to play vampire Edward Cullen. Then she got a call about a guy in London. [...] "I looked at a couple pictures and was like, ‘I’m not sure,’?" [...] Hardwicke says. [...] "He had been fired from his last job, he was unemployed, he was in debt." [...] Pattinson flew to Los Angeles on his own dime to read with Stewart. Shiloh Fernandez, Jackson Rathbone, Ben Barnes, and Robert Pattinson were the final four up for the role of Edward. Hardwicke did not initially choose Robert Pattinson for the role of Edward Cullen, but after an audition at her home with Stewart, he was selected. Hardwicke said, [...] "Kristen was like, ‘It’s got to be Rob!’ She felt connected to him from the first moment. That electricity, or love at first sight, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is." [...] Hardwicke gave him the part, but he had to make a promise. [...] "You’ve got to realize that Kristen is 17 years old," [...] Hardwicke told him, [...] "She’s underage. You’ve got to focus, dude, or you’re going to be arrested. I made him swear on a stack of Bibles." [...] Pattinson was unfamiliar with the novel series prior to his screen test but read the books later on. Meyer allowed him to view a manuscript of the unfinished Midnight Sun, which chronicles the events in Twilight from Edward's point of view. Fan reaction to Pattinson's casting as Edward was initially negative; Rachelle Lefèvre remarked that [...] "very woman had their own Edward [...] they had to let go of before they could open up to , which they did." [...] Meyer was [...] "excited" [...] and [...] "ecstatic" [...] in response to the casting of the two main characters. She had expressed interest in having Emily Browning and Henry Cavill cast as Bella and Edward, respectively, prior to pre-production.|$|E

2500|$|Looking {{for a more}} hard-hitting sound {{than that}} of their {{previous}} album, U2 began recording How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb in February 2003 with Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, {{but they were not}} satisfied with the results. The group subsequently enlisted Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. U2 lead singer Bono described the album as [...] "our first rock album. It's taken us twenty years <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is, but this is our first rock album." [...] Thematically, the record touches on life, death, love, war, faith, and family.|$|E
2500|$|Gary Vincent, an {{employee}} of Funspot and now curator of the Classic Arcade Museum, {{came up with the}} idea of collecting the games in one spot to give visitors to the arcade a different way of understanding the games. Opened in the late 1990s, the American Classic Arcade Museum collects games built no later than 1987. When asked why 1987 was picked as the cut off date, Vincent replied, [...] "We set the cut off date as 1987 because that is pretty much about the time when we noticed that the videogame industry was starting to change. Instead of having fantasy-based games, puzzle-based, space shoot 'em up games <b>or</b> <b>whatever,</b> <b>it</b> seemed to switch over to more of what I call 'kick-punch-shoot' games." ...|$|E

2500|$|Further, Adrian Fortescue {{noted in}} his article in the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia the {{distinction}} between [...] "Roman Church" [...] and [...] "Church of Rome". He said that the expression [...] "Church of Rome" [...] commonly applied by non-Catholics to the Catholic Church but, according to him, {{it can only be}} used correctly to refer the diocese of Rome; and the term [...] "Roman Church", in case of the patriarchate, can be used as equivalent to [...] "Latin Church": [...] "A German Catholic is not, strictly speaking, a member of the Church of Rome but of the Church of Cologne, or Munich-Freising, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> may be, in union with and under the obedience of the Roman Church (although, no doubt, by a further extension Roman Church may be used as equivalent to Latin Church for the patriarchate)." ...|$|E
2500|$|A common myth {{about this}} story is that the colour-separation overlay (CSO) {{backgrounds}} were accidentally omitted {{in some of the}} car interior scenes, leaving the blue screen behind the characters. In reality, the blue is supposed to represent the sky. The differing shades of blue compared to the location exterior footage {{is the result of the}} shots' separate origins. This is contradicted by Paul Vanezis in an interview, in which he states [...] "I wouldn't put a background in and I'll tell you why they didn't put a background in there - it wasn't lit properly. There wasn't enough blue in it to key it, or yellow or green <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> was. It was shot wrong. It shouldn't have been shot in the studio and it shouldn't have been shot on xchrome. These days with modern technology you could easily key it... easily, but it wouldn't look right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Antichrist {{started with}} the idea of making a horror film. Trier {{thought it was a good}} idea to start with a certain genre, and chose horror cinema because [...] "the genre [...] that you can put a lot of very, very strange images in a horror film". He had {{recently}} seen several contemporary Japanese horror films such as Ring and Dark Water, from which he drew inspiration. Another basic idea came from a documentary Trier saw about the original forests of Europe. In the documentary the forests were portrayed as a place of great pain and suffering as the different species tried to kill and eat each other. Trier was fascinated by the contrast between this and the view of nature as a romantic and peaceful place. Trier said: [...] "At the same time that we hang it on our walls over the fireplace <b>or</b> <b>whatever,</b> <b>it</b> represents pure Hell." [...] In retrospect he said that he had become unsure whether Antichrist really could be classified as a horror film, because [...] "it's not so horrific ... we didn't try so hard to do shocks, and that is maybe why it is not a horror film. I took [...] more as an inspiration, and then this strange story came out of it." ...|$|E
