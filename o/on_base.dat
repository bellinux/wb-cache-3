5|$|Any runners already <b>on</b> <b>base</b> may {{attempt to}} advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play.

If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners <b>on</b> <b>base</b> may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E
