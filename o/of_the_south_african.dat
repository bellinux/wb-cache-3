5|$|Techniques {{based on}} DNA {{comparison}} suggest Aloe vera is relatively {{closely related to}} Aloe perryi, a species endemic to Yemen. Similar techniques, using chloroplast DNA sequence comparison and ISSR profiling have also suggested it {{is closely related to}} Aloe forbesii, Aloe inermis, Aloe scobinifolia, Aloe sinkatana, and Aloe striata. With the exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> species A. striata, these Aloe species are native to Socotra (Yemen), Somalia, and Sudan. The lack of obvious natural populations of the species has led some authors to suggest Aloe vera may be of hybrid origin.|$|E

5|$|After the 4–0 series {{win over}} England, which was Bradman's {{farewell}} series, Morris became Australia's vice-captain and {{was expected to}} be its leading batsman. He started well, scoring two centuries during Australia's first series in the post-Bradman era, a tour to South Africa that saw Australia win the Test series 4–0. By the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>African</b> tour, Morris had amassed nine Test centuries and his batting average was over 65, but thereafter his form declined. Australia increasingly fell on hard times as the core of Bradman's team aged and retired. Morris was overlooked for the captaincy and then briefly dropped as his cricketing prowess waned. His career ended after his first wife became terminally ill. Later in his life, Morris served as a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground for over twenty years.|$|E

In August 1977 Biko was arrested for breaking his banning order.|$|E
