5|$|At dawn on {{the morning}} of 7 April, Pedro, his wife, and others, {{including}} his daughter MariaII and his sister Ana de Jesus, were taken on board the British warship HMS Warspite. The vessel remained at anchor off Rio de Janeiro, and, on 13 April, the former emperor transferred to and departed for Europe aboard HMS Volage. He arrived in Cherbourg-Octeville, France, on 10 June. During the next few months, he shuttled between France and Great Britain. He was warmly welcomed by, but received no actual support from, either government. Finding himself in an awkward situation because he held no official status in either the Brazilian Imperial House or in the Portuguese Royal House, Pedro assumed the title of Duke of Braganza on 15 June, a position that <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> his as heir to Portugal's crown. Although the title should have belonged to MariaII's heir, which he certainly was not, his claim was met with general recognition. On 1 December, his only daughter by Amélie, Maria Amélia, was born in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The union's {{membership}} {{also changed}} greatly {{in the years}} after World War II; what <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a predominantly Jewish and Italian workforce became largely Latino, African-American and Asian. The leadership of the union had less and less in common with its membership and very often had no experience in the trade itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{automobile}} in the 1910s and 1920s had a twofold effect on the University-Cultural Center area. The prosperous automotive trade increased the population of Detroit by nearly a factor of four between 1900 and 1920. This pushed the city limits far to the north, making what <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a suburban, open area {{into the heart of}} the city. The University-Cultural Center area also became home to automotive-related commercial and industrial businesses, particularly along Woodward and Cass.|$|E

25|$|In 1856, {{he tried}} to contact his mother, but his letter and emissaries were intercepted by the British in India, and did not reach her. However, he persisted and, with help from Login, was allowed to meet her on 16January 1861 at Spence's Hotel in Calcutta and return {{with her to the}} United Kingdom. During {{the last two years of}} her life, his mother told the Maharaja about his Sikh {{heritage}} and the Empire which <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> his to rule.|$|E
25|$|Pope Pius VI (1789) and Queen Mary I {{reformed}} {{the order}} into a secular institution. In 1834, when the civil government of Portugal became anti-Catholic, after {{the defeat of}} King Miguel in the Civil War, under the constitutional monarchy the order lost its properties. The ancient military orders were transformed by the liberal constitution and subsequent legislation into mere orders of merit. The privileges which <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{an essential part of}} the membership of the old military orders also ceased.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, this {{development}} of a pagan order created the foundations of a bridge of reconciliation over which paganism and Christianity could meet. Likewise, Julian’s persecution of Christians, who by pagan standards were simply part of a different cult, was quite an un-pagan attitude that transformed paganism into a religion that accepted only one form of religious experience while excluding all others—such as Christianity. In trying to compete with Christianity in this manner, Julian fundamentally {{changed the nature of}} pagan worship. That is, he made paganism a religion, whereas it <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> only a system of tradition.|$|E

25|$|In {{many cities}} of Russia, Ukraine, in Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan tramways have been facing {{difficulties}} since {{the disintegration of}} the USSR. Tramways of Shakhty, Arkhangelsk, Astrakhan, Grozny, Tbilisi, Baku, Yerevan and Tashkent have been abandoned. Some tramway systems have suffered extensive closures of vital parts of network (including Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev) and some are facing threats of closures (Nizhniy Novgorod) or even total abandonment (Voronezh). Saint Petersburg's tramway network is largest in Europe, <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the largest in the world, but has yielded its position to Melbourne. Tram in Molochne (Crimea, Ukraine) – is the smallest tram system in the world.|$|E
25|$|As midwifery {{began to}} develop so did the {{profession}} of obstetrics {{near the end of}} the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> at the beginning of the century. But the specialty was still behind in its development stages in comparison to other medical specialities, and remained a generality in this era. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in asepsis and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.|$|E
25|$|During his civil {{engineering}} days, Cauchy <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> briefly {{in charge of}} repairing {{a few of the}} Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning this to his pupil; with great malice, the young Duke went about saying Mister Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. His role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838. Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics. The only good that came out of this episode was Cauchy's promotion to Baron, a title by which Cauchy set great store. In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was finally reunited with his family after four years in exile.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Lawrence {{returned}} to Britain {{to star in}} September Tide, a play written specifically for her by Daphne du Maurier. Her role {{was that of a}} middle-aged Cornish woman whose son-in-law, a bohemian artist, falls in love with her. The playwright had intended her to open the play on Broadway, but Lawrence's husband thought it was too British for the American market. The London press paid little attention to her return to the stage, and she was distressed to discover that in a country struggling to recover from the effects of World War II, the public no longer was as interested in the private lives of stage stars as it <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been.</b> Prior to opening in the West End, the play toured Blackpool, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester, where the frequently sparse audiences consisted primarily of elderly people who remembered Lawrence from her heyday. While on the road, she underwent erratic mood swings and frequently clashed with her fellow cast members, including actors Michael Gough and Bryan Forbes, and the crew. The play opened in London in mid-December 1948.|$|E
25|$|Despite terrible winter weather, Eckford {{not only}} quickly {{established}} a shipyard, but also quarters for the shipbuilders, mess and kitchen buildings, a hospital, offices, and blockhouses, in what <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> merely a quiet hamlet, and made Sackets Harbor {{one of the}} US Navy's main bases during the war, also taking the opportunity to invest in real estate in the area. With the shipyard in operation, Eckford took time away from it in December 1812 to join Chauncey in an inspection tour of American military and shipyard facilities on the Great Lakes and, finding the yards on Lake Erie at Erie, Pennsylvania, and Black Rock, New York, struggling, made suggestions to their staffs {{on how to improve}} their shipbuilding efforts. Chauncey wrote to Noah Brown to hurry north from New York City and take charge at Erie, which Brown did in February 1813 while his brother Adam remained in New York City to work with Christian Bergh in ensuring that Noah received the men and supplies he needed. Noah Brown later moved to Lake Champlain, and later still to Sackets Harbor, where he joined Eckford in ship design and construction activities.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot help himself when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she looks a lot like Hazumu.|$|E

2500|$|In 1950, Arendt {{became a}} {{naturalized}} {{citizen of the}} United States. The same year, she started seeing [...] again, and had what the American writer Adam Kirsch called a [...] "quasi-romance" [...] that lasted for two years {{with the man who}} <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> her mentor, teacher and lover. During this time, Arendt began to defend [...] from criticism of his actions under the Third Reich when he had been a proud member of the NSDAP, portraying [...] as a naïve man swept up by forces beyond his control, and that at any rate 's philosophy {{had nothing to do with}} National Socialism. She served as a visiting scholar at the University of Notre Dame, University of California, Berkeley, Princeton University, and Northwestern University. In 1959, she was named the first female lecturer at Princeton. She also taught at the University of Chicago from 1963 to 1967, where she was a member of the Committee on Social Thought; The New School in Manhattan where she taught as University Professor from 1967 until her death in 1975; Yale University, where she was a fellow, as well as the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University (1961–62, 1962–63).|$|E
2500|$|Hanson {{wrote his}} father <b>once</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> robbed by young black men, and {{had given him}} [...] "the Talk" [...] warning his son to {{exercise}} caution in known crime-ridden areas and to note that African-American male youth have a far higher incidence of assault than other groups; and Hanson added that having been robbed himself by black men, he had given [...] "the Talk" [...] warning his children to avoid situations when in dangerous areas and to exercise caution there when encountering groups of young African-American men when alone, whom Hanson argue were statistically {{more likely to have}} had criminal records. Hanson therefore criticized Holder and Obama for suggesting that racism may have been a factor in the trial of Hispanic George Zimmerman who had been charged and acquitted of murder with the shooting death of Trayvon Martin—and especially for intruding in an ongoing criminal case before a jury had even been selected. Hanson argued that Zimmerman was later found by a jury of his peers to be justified in shooting Martin in self-defense, and he suggested that Obama was alluding to racism being a factor in the case, to distract attention from his then unpopular presidency.|$|E
