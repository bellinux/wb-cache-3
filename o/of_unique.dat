5|$|Although the Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} find the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers (positive integers), it may be generalized to the real numbers, and to other mathematical objects, such as polynomials, quadratic integers and Hurwitz quaternions.

Unique factorization is essential to many proofs of number theory.|$|E
