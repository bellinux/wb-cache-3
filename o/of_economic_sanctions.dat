5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was in the building, meeting Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, but none of them were injured in the attack. In {{immediate}} aftermath, Tuđman remarked that the attack was apparently meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia. Marković blamed Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević, who denied the accusation and suggested the event was staged by Croatia. The attack prompted international condemnation and consideration <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> against Yugoslavia. The presidential residence was immediately moved to the Presidential palace, which was formerly known as Villa Zagorje. The Banski dvori sustained significant damage, but repairs started only in 1995. The building later became the seat of the Croatian Government.|$|E

40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>sanction</b> {{has been}} widely used and {{increasingly}} a popular tool in maintaining peace and political stability in the world. The use <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sanction,</b> {{as opposed to the}} use of military power, to punish target countries have been supported by the Charter of United Nations (UN). Tsebelis (1990) modelled <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> using game theory and found that any attempt to increase the severity of the sanctions was counterintuitive, namely the policy reduced the likelihood of sender country(s) in enforcing <b>economic</b> <b>sanction,</b> however, it did not change the probability of the target country(s) in violating international agreement/law. This paper focuses on the refinement of the sanction game proposed by Tsebelis (1990) to analyse international relations. Recent findings from various studies on the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sanction</b> have been used to reconstruct the game. In contrast to Tsebelis’(1990) findings, any attempt to increase the severity <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sanction</b> may reduce the probability of the target country(s) in violating international agreement/law. A similar result was obtained in the case for which the sender country(s) applies any policy in preventing violation of international agreement/law by providing aids, assistances, and incentives to the target country. ...|$|R

25|$|Benazir Bhutto {{presided over}} the country during the {{penultimate}} times of Cold war, and cemented pro-Western policies due to common distrust of communism. Her government oversaw the successful troop evacuation of Soviet Union from neighboring Communist Afghanistan. Soon after the evacuation, the alliance with U.S. came to end when the secret of a successful clandestine atomic bomb project was revealed to world which led to imposition <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> by the United States. In 1989, she ordered a military intervention in Afghanistan that brutally failed, leading her to depose {{the directors of the}} intelligence services. With offing American aid to the country, she hastily imposed the 7th Plan to restore the national economy while centralizing the economy. Nonetheless, the economic situation worsened when the state currency of Pakistan lost the currency war with India.

25|$|Jordan {{participated in}} the {{imposition}} <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> against Iraq even though the sanctions would severely affect its economy. The effects of the Gulf War, the sanctions on Iraq, and the flow of refugees to Jordan were estimated by a UN report to be $1.5billion out of a gross domestic product (GDP) of $4.2billion in 1990, and $3.6billion out of a GDP of $4.7billion in 1991. The end of the Gulf War coincided {{with the end of}} the Cold War. This allowed the United States to play a more active role in solving the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Bush administration were still angry at Hussein for the Gulf War events but realized they needed Jordan's participation in any peace process. Hussein agreed to an American request to join an international peace conference so that Jordan could start repairing its relationship with the United States, and end its political isolation. Hussein's moves towards democratization 1989 and his stance during the 1990 Gulf War had won him considerable popularity across Jordan's political spectrum. But when Hussein replaced his conservative prime minister, Mudar Badran, with liberal Palestinian Taher Al-Masri, who was in favor of peace negotiations with Israel, the Muslim BrotherhoodJordan's main opposition group, who at that time occupied 22 out of 80 seats in the House of Representatives, and whose members and support came mostly from Palestinians in the countryvehemently rejected the new prime minister by voting against him during the vote of confidence. The Brotherhood also refused to participate in the National Congress where the King hoped to gather support for a peace settlement.|$|E

40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>sanctions,</b> {{an age-old}} tool of statecraft, are {{becoming}} increasingly central to shaping strategic outcomes. In the post-Cold War <b>economic</b> <b>sanctions</b> have become virtually the default option in US foreign policy.
