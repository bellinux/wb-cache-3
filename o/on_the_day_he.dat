5|$|For years, stories {{circulated}} of {{a treasure}} being buried within the amphitheater. W. T.

5|$|Gens' {{wife and}} {{daughter}} were living near the ghetto <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> was shot. A Jewish policeman informed them that Gens had been shot and that the Gestapo was looking for them. They fled and managed to stay in hiding until Soviet troops arrived. In 1945, they obtained papers for repatriation to Poland. From there they moved to West Germany as Jewish aliyah. They emigrated to Australia in 1948 and to the United States in 1953.|$|E
5|$|After the discovery, Leicester City Council {{set up a}} {{temporary}} exhibition about Richard III in the city's medieval guildhall. The council announced it would create a permanent attraction and subsequently spent £850,000 to buy the freehold of St Martin's Place, formerly part of Leicester Grammar School, in Peacock Lane, {{across the road from}} the cathedral. The site adjoins the car park where the body was found, and overlies the chancel of Greyfriars Friary Church. It was converted into a £4.5 million visitor centre telling the story of Richard's life, death, burial and rediscovery, with artefacts from the dig including Philippa Langley's Wellington boots and the hard hat and high-visibility jacket worn by archaeologist Mathew Morris <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> found Richard's skeleton. Visitors can see the grave site under a glass floor. The council anticipated that the visitor centre, which opened in July 2014, would attract 100,000 visitors a year.|$|E
5|$|At the {{dormitory}} lives an energetic first-year student named Yukari Kamioka. She {{is on the}} track and field team along with Mariya, who is her , and has low confidence in her ability to run. Another first-year at {{the dormitory}} named Kana Suoin meets Mizuho <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> moves in, and soon after Mizuho becomes her Oneesama. Kana is {{more than happy to}} serve Mizuho any way she can, since she admires him immensely. A hyperactive ghost resides in Mizuho's room named Ichiko Takashima and is shown to speak very fast when excited. She says that Mizuho looks very much like her previous Elder love interest, who turns out to be Mizuho's deceased mother. The student council president at Seio is Takako Itsukushima who tends to have a serious personality.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, aged 19, he met {{and married}} Harriet Elizabeth Alp and settled with her at 48 Staithe Road in Burgh St. Peter near Lowestoft, where they had two sons and a daughter, {{including}} Thomas Crisp Jr., who would be with his father <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> won the Victoria Cross. Establishing himself as a fisherman, Thomas Sr. achieved his mate and then skipper qualifications, entitling him to captain a fishing vessel sailing from the port. In 1902 he was taken on by Chambers, {{one of the largest}} boat owning families in Lowestoft, to crew and then captain their ketch George Borrow, in which he remained for thirteen years. In 1907 the family moved to Lowestoft while Crisp continued his work at sea, proving {{one of the most popular}} fishing captains in Lowestoft and joined on his ketch by his son in 1913.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2011, Jeter {{recorded}} his 3,000th career hit, {{a home run}} off of David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeter finished the day with five hits in five at-bats, the second player to have five hits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> achieved his 3,000th hit (the first was Craig Biggio). He also became the second player to {{hit a home run}} for his 3,000th hit, Wade Boggs having done so in 1999. The last of Jeter's five hits proved to be the game-winning hit. He is {{the only member of the}} 3,000 hit club to record all of his hits with the New York Yankees, and the only player to join the club as a Yankee. Jeter became the second player to reach 3,000 career hits while still a regular shortstop (the first was Honus Wagner). Only Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, and Robin Yount were younger than Jeter on the day of their 3,000th hit. MLB and HBO produced Derek Jeter 3K, a documentary that profiled his path to 3,000 hits and originally aired on July 28, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Republican William S. Taylor {{was elected}} to succeed Bradley in the {{contentious}} 1899 gubernatorial election. When Democratic nominee William Goebel and his running mate J. C. W. Beckham challenged the election results, Bradley formed part of the legal team for the Republicans. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which found {{in favor of the}} Democrats. Despite {{being a member of the}} state's minority party, Bradley {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate in 1907. Again, divisions within the Democratic Party played a role in his election. Bradley's opposition to Prohibition made him more palatable to some Democrats than their own candidate, outgoing Governor Beckham. Beckham refused to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate, and after two months of balloting, four Democratic legislators crossed party lines and elected Bradley. Bradley had a largely undistinguished career in the Senate. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> announced he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, he was involved in a streetcar accident. He died from his injuries on May 23, 1914.|$|E

5|$|Samuel Colt {{was born}} in Hartford, Connecticut, the son of Sarah (née Caldwell) and Christopher Colt (1777–1850), a farmer who had moved his family to the city after he became a businessman. His {{maternal}} grandfather, Major John Caldwell, had been {{an officer in the}} Continental Army; one of Colt's earliest possessions was John's flintlock pistol. Colt's mother died from tuberculosis when Colt was six years old, and his father remarried two years later, to Olivia Sargeant. Colt had three sisters, one of whom died during her childhood. His oldest sister, Margaret, died of tuberculosis at 19, and the other, Sarah Ann, later committed suicide. One brother, James, became a lawyer; another, Christopher, was a textile merchant. A third brother, John C. Colt, a man of many occupations, was convicted of an 1841 murder and committed suicide <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> was to be executed.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's case {{continued}} on March 24. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton {{had attempted to}} discuss the case with him the day his indictment was made public. Cochran refused to discuss it. Reporter J.H. Aubere testified that he had interviewed Burton that day, and that Burton had denied practicing before the Post Office. Hector McRea, the Controller of Rialto, testified to a meeting between Mahaney and Burton, where Burton's representation was ended because the matter before the Post Office had concluded. Inspector Cochran was recalled to state that his conversation with Burton took place before Aubere's interview. Further, Cochran testified that, on February 5, 1902, Burton {{had told him that}} he wished to represent Rialto before the Department for a fee, having been assured by other Senators that such conduct was common and legal. Burton also told Cochran that he needed to repay a disputed debt of $70,000. Finally, Mahaney testified that, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> personally paid Burton $500, Burton advised Rialto to destroy its correspondence with him and that two such letters were destroyed. Thereafter, the prosecution rested.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya {{answers that}} one may {{complete}} Brahmacharya (the student stage of life), then Grihastha (householder), followed by Vanaprastha (retirement) and finally Sannyasa (pilgrimage as Parivrajaka Bhikshu, renunciation). Or, continues Yajnavalkya, one may renounce immediately {{after completing the}} student stage of life, or after the householder stage, {{regardless of whether or}} not one has completed the sacred fire ritual or any other rituals. Olivelle interprets the sacred fire ritual reference as an indirect reference to marriage, and thus the text asserts that those who have married or never married can both renounce. The Jabala Upanishad herein recommends that a person may renounce <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> feels detached from the world, regardless of which stage of life he is in, and whether he has completed that stage.|$|E

5|$|Clara and Merry flee {{back to the}} {{ceremony}} and the Doctor faces the creature, realising it feeds off memories, stories, and feelings. He tries to overfeed it by offering {{the sum total of}} his Time Lord memories; Merry also leads the citizens in a song of hope, confusing Akhaten who then disappears. However, the Doctor's memories are not enough to sate the creature and Akhaten reappears. Clara returns to help, offering Akhaten the leaf that blew into her father's face <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> met her mother, which contains an infinite amount of untold potential that Clara's mother never saw because she died early. Akhaten, overwhelmed by the infinite potential it has consumed, implodes on itself and the Rings are saved. The Doctor returns Clara to her home on the same day they left and gives her back her mother's ring, telling her that all the creatures she saved wanted her to have it back. Suddenly Clara remembers seeing the Doctor at her mother's funeral and asks why he was there. He tells her that she reminds him of someone who died and she rebukes him for using her as a replacement, but he assures her she is not a replacement and Clara leaves. However, the moment she is gone, the Doctor's expression becomes grim and closes the TARDIS door from which Clara left.|$|E
5|$|The {{timing of}} the {{coronation}} has varied throughout British history. King Edgar's coronation was some 15 years after his accession in 957 {{and may have been}} intended to mark the high point of his reign, or that he reached the age of 30, the age at which Jesus Christ was baptised. HaroldII was crowned on the day {{after the death of his}} predecessor, Edward the Confessor, the rush probably reflecting the contentious nature of Harold's succession; whereas the first Norman monarch, WilliamI, was also crowned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> became king, 25December 1066, but three weeks since the surrender of English nobles and bishops at Berkhampstead, allowing time to prepare a spectacular ceremony. Most of his successors were crowned within weeks, or even days, of their accession. EdwardI was fighting in the Ninth Crusade when he acceded to the throne in 1272; he was crowned soon after his return in 1274. EdwardII's coronation, similarly, was delayed by a campaign in Scotland in 1307. HenryVI was only a few months old when he acceded in 1422; he was crowned in 1429, but did not officially assume the reins of government until he was deemed of sufficient age, in 1437. Pre-modern coronations were usually either on a Sunday, the Christian Sabbath, or on a Christian holiday. Edgar's coronation was at Pentecost, WilliamI's on Christmas Day, possibly in imitation of the Byzantine emperors, and John's was on Ascension Day. Elizabeth I consulted her astrologer, John Dee, before deciding on an auspicious date. The coronations of Charles II in 1661 and Anne in 1702 were on St George's Day, the feast of the patron saint of England.|$|E
