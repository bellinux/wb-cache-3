5000|$|Most {{researchers}} {{agree that}} the CNV component {{has been associated with}} information processing and response preparation. The main controversy is whether the CNV is composed of more than one component. After discovery of the CNV, researchers were able to distinguish between two main components of the CNV. Loveless and Sanford (1975) and Weerts and Lang (1973) increased the interstimulus interval to greater than 3 seconds and showed that two components can be visually distinguished from the CNV. The first wave followed the warning stimulus and was called the <b>O</b> <b>wave,</b> or orienting wave. [...] This wave showed enhanced amplitude in the frontal regions. The second wave preceded the imperative stimulus and was called the E wave, or expectancy wave. A study conducted by Gaillard (1976) provided further evidence that the <b>O</b> <b>wave</b> was frontally distributed and was more strongly affected by auditory stimuli rather than visual stimuli.|$|E
50|$|A {{very similar}} - and equally {{important}} - event-related potential (ERP) component had earlier been {{discovered by the}} British neurophysiologist William Grey Walter in 1962 and published in 1964. It is the contingent negative variation (CNV). The CNV also composes two waves; the initial wave (i.e., <b>O</b> <b>wave)</b> and the terminal wave (i.e., E wave). The terminal CNV has similar characteristics as the BP and many researchers have claimed that the BP and the terminal CNV are the same component. At least there is a consensus that both indicate a preparation of the brain for a following behavior.|$|E
40|$|Separation for <b>O</b> <b>wave</b> and X wave {{is a very}} {{important}} job in interpretation of ionograms, which is premise for automatic scaling. In this paper, a new digital method for separating <b>O</b> <b>wave</b> and X wave is presented, based on a numerical synthesizing technique, which is different from using image recognition to separate trace O and trace X in the ionograms, and from using the electrical method to synthesize and detect circularly polarized waves. By replacing analog phase shifters and switches in existing ionosonde with digital phase shifters with different initial phase, 0 °, + 90 °, − 90 °, circularly polarized waves are synthesized digitally within the range of 1 - 30 MHz, which eliminates the nonlinearity and expands the bandwidth of the ionosonde, and {{there is no need to}} switch the analog switches continuously.

40|$|Slow wave {{components}} of the event-related brain potential (ERP) were investigated as possible indicators of the brief, transient period of involuntary attention known as the orienting reflex (OR). Convergent information was also derived from concomitant heart rate (HR) changes. Subjects were asked to count 10 series of 200 ms, 1000 Hz tone pips at 20, 40, or 60 dB SL. In some series the intensity was held constant and in other series the intensity varied unpredictably. Responses were studied as functions of stimulus intensity, probability, degree and direction of intensity change between different stimuli within a series. ^ Since a within-subjects design was used and responses were averaged over trials, {{it was not possible}} to assess for habituation effects. However, the averaged HR responses consistently showed a brief initial deceleration that has traditionally been interpreted as an indicator of the OR. HR deceleration was greater for an intensity increase than a decrease, but was not significantly related to the degree of change. ^ The ERP responses over the various conditions showed a consistent structure, including P 300 and early and late <b>O</b> <b>wave</b> components. P 300 amplitude was significantly responsive to the effects of stimulus intensity. P 300 amplitude was also greater for an intensity increase than a decrease, but was not reliably related to the degree of intensity change. However, P 300 did reflect stimulus processing, in that significantly larger P 300 amplitudes were elicited by rare than by frequent stimuli. ^ <b>O</b> <b>wave</b> amplitudes were consistent with Sokolov 2 ̆ 7 s (1963) stimulus comparator theory of OR elicitation. The O waves were elicited by decreases as well as increases in stimulus intensity in proportion to the degree of intensity change. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the existence of a neuronal model consisting of expected stimulations. An interpretation of the O waves as reflecting the detection of stimulus change is proposed. ...|$|E

The original pulse is divided into N copies of itself, approximately equally-spaced temporally. The N pulses are amplified, and then recombined coherently to produce the final intense pulse (Fig. 1 a). We employ a sequence of birefringent crystals to achieve the desired division. At each crystal, a pulse is split into two equal-intensity pulses, one an ordinary (<b>o)</b> <b>wave</b> and one an extraordinary (e) wave. The amplified pulses can be recombined in a sequence of crystals similar to the one that divided the pulses.

The 17 F and 14 <b>O</b> <b>wave</b> functions are defined in the shell model involving s, p and sd orbitals. The model provides a good overall description of the 18 Ne spectroscopy at energies typical of nova and x-ray burst processes. In particular, the 3 + 1 state, an s-wave resonance dominating the reaction rate at temperatures above 5 × 108 K, is well described. We find a proton width Γp= 21. 1 keV, in good agreement with the experimental value Γp= 18. 0 ± 2 stat ± 1 sys keV. Its gamma width, unknown experimentally, is Γγ= 33 meV, similar to values deduced from the shell model, and used in astrophysics (Γγ= 30 ± 20 meV).

The increasing energy demand, the greenhouse effect and the approaching exhaustion of conventional energy resources, forces humanity to use energy more economically and to develop alternative energy supplies, a. <b>o.</b> <b>wave</b> energy. A Wave Energy Converter (WEC) converts the kinetic and potential energy in ocean waves into electricity. A single WEC, with a capacity comparable to a classic power plant (e. g. 400 MW), is technologically impossible. Therefore arrays of smaller devices, placed in a geometric configuration or ‘farm’, are needed. WECs in a farm interact and the overall power absorption is affected. An optimal pattern of WECs in order to maximise the power absorption is of major importance {{in the design of}} a wave farm. At Ghent University, a mild-slope wave propagation model MildWAVE has been developed (Troch, 1998), e. g. to study diffraction patterns in a harbour (Geeraerts et al., 2003) or to study the effect of short-crested waves on wave penetration (Caspeele, 2006). The phase-resolving model is able to generate linear water waves over a mildly varying bathymetry and to calculate instantaneous surface elevations (and velocity potential) throughout the domain. Wave transformation processes such as refraction, shoaling, reflection, transmission and diffraction are simulated intrinsically. The existing model is adapted by simulating the energy extraction and radiation of a WEC through sponge layers (Beels et al., 2006).

Forty-two normal subjects [N], and twenty hypertensive patients [HT] were included in this study. In fourteen subjects of N, we infused angiotensin-II (0. 5 - 4 μg/min) to create acuty pressure overloading [N (A-II) ]. The image of the SVC was obtained by orienting the sector plane parallel to the SVC from the right supraclavicular fossa on supine position. The Doppler sample volume in SVC was placed at 7 - 9 cm from the transducer, and flow velocity signal was recorded at 100 mm/sec with a carrier frequency of 3. 5 MHz and a pulse repetition frequency of 6 KHz during resting end-expiration. At rest, BFVP in SVC was characterized by a small reversed flow during active atrial contraction period (A wave), and forward flows during ventricular systole (S wave) and during ventricular diastole (D wave). Between S and D waves, close-by the second heart sound, BFVP was transiently diminished (<b>O</b> <b>wave).</b> In N, during acute pressure overloading, A, S, O and D waves occured significantly earlier then those at control rest, while in HT, only S wave was present significantly earlier than that in N at rest. In HT, peak flow velocity of S wave was significantly less and that of D wave was increased compared with those in N at rest, so that D/S ratio was significantly increased in HT. These findings suggest that in HT, {{in spite of the}} left heart disease, the reserve function of the right atrium (RA) might be diminished and angiotensin may lead the increment of smooth muscle activity of SVC, RA and the right ventricle, which may result in decrease in cavity compliance.
