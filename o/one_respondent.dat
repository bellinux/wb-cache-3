500|$|Singer Taufik Batisah was criticised for {{incorrectly}} {{singing the}} word berseru (to proclaim) instead of bersatu (to unite) during his rendition of Majulah Singapura {{before the start}} of the 2009 Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix on 27 September 2009. A Straits Times poll then found that out of 50 people only 10 were able to sing the national anthem perfectly. Most people got between 80 and 90% of the lyrics right, while six could recite only the first line or less. Although many correctly stated that the title of the anthem meant [...] "Onward Singapore", a majority did not understand the meaning of the anthem. However, most of the persons surveyed disagreed that the anthem should be in English, with <b>one</b> <b>respondent</b> saying: [...] "It's better in Malay because there's a cultural history to it and [...] is more meaningful, and has traces to our roots." ...|$|E

A main contributor to the ongoing discussion was a reader using the pen name [...] "X", and several other readers also responded. In a response, X stated that the U.S. system was less expensive and more efficient compared to British and Indian methods, and posited whether another system could be used that is both cost effective and safe. Additional reader responses generally concurred with X's opinion, but did not provide solid suggestions about how to remedy such problems. <b>One</b> <b>respondent</b> stated {{that some of the}} comparisons were faulty as being based upon U.S. railway lines that did not use telegraphic dispatching. This discourse in Railroad Gazette during this time also covered various aspects of problems and flaws in the American railroad system, and potential reforms to remedy these problems.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The paper {{describes}} {{some of the}} approaches being taken to explore what does happen, {{as opposed to what}} 'should' happen, when higher education students are engaged on design and technology activities. The paper explores the use of a schema, grounded in data, that is used by students as a reflective tool prior to an interview. The schema evolved from the perceived tension between design and technology as a stimulus for change in the made-world, and design and technology as a stimulus for change in the learner. The primary focus of this paper is the development of the study's methodology and segments of data have been included to assist this purpose.

Of the study's respondents who visited South Korea, 22% described their visit as a negative experience, and about 20% described their visit as a both negative and positive experience. Inability to speak Korean was mentioned as being a cause of their visit being a negative experience by more than <b>one</b> <b>respondent,</b> and inability to speak Korean was generally the cause of the negative parts of the visit for the respondents who reported both a positive and negative experience. <b>One</b> <b>respondent</b> said that they felt that Koreans in South Korea looked down on them for their inability to speak Korean. Another respondent said that the Koreans in South Korea were initially nice to them, but the respondent said that Koreans in South Korea became rude to them after finding out that they could not speak Korean.

50|$|Service name {{resolution}} was handled entirely between netman processes. A client's representative would multicast the desired service {{name to the}} network using a MUI Unnumbered Information extension to X.25. Responses indicating server availability would be directed (not multicast) back by potential server representatives. When {{there was more than}} <b>one</b> <b>respondent</b> to the multicast (as was normal for, say, dmap) the first one would be selected for opening a connection. Only one server was ever contacted per client service request. As with all UI-class messages in X.25, packet loss was possible, so the MUI process was conducted up to three times if there was no response.|$|E

Approximately nine out of ten respondents favored having the Hinomaru as the national flag, and six out of ten supported Kimigayo as the national anthem. Overall, about 46 percent were in favor of the bill. Respondents thought of the Hinomaru as the flag of Japan and that its history should be taught. Some felt that Kimigayo was an inappropriate anthem for modern Japan; <b>one</b> <b>respondent</b> suggested using the song [...] "Sakura Sakura" [...] instead.

30|$|Binge Eating Scale (Gormally et al. 1982) is a sixteen-item {{questionnaire}} {{used to assess}} the presence of binge eating behavior indicative of an eating disorder. Each item has three or four weighted statements, and the respondent is directed to choose <b>one.</b> <b>Respondents</b> indicate which statement is most similar to their eating, and the measure is scored by summing the weighted scores for each item with the possible range of scores from 0 to 46. The Binge Eating Scale has also been used in normal-weight samples (Dalle Grave et al. 2010) to categorize participants into binge eating and non-binge eating groups. In this research the total score was used to yield a continuous measure of binge eating tendencies. The scale has been validated with treatment-seeking obese individuals and has demonstrated high internal consistency (Gormally et al. 1982).|$|R

40|$|Wildlife feeding is a wide-spread and {{controversial}} practice that can pose serious {{threats to the}} safety of both wildlife and visitors. The design and effectiveness of warning signs in recreational areas varies considerably and is rarely the product of theoretical models or scientific research. This study uses front-end and formative evaluation to design and test the perceived effectiveness of warning signs relating to bird feeding. Stage One examined visitors 2 ̆ 7 beliefs, attitudes and bird feeding behaviour and found significant differences between feeders and non-feeders. Stage Two involved designing and evaluating three signs that built on the beliefs, knowledge and mis/conceptions identified in Stage <b>One.</b> <b>Respondents</b> thought the sign that focused on the birds 2 ̆ 7 health and safety would be the most persuasive, however, elements of the other two signs were also positively evaluated.
