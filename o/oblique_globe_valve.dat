The plug is also called a disc or disk. [...] In <b>globe</b> <b>valves,</b> the plug is connected to a stem which is operated by screw action using a handwheel in manual <b>valves.</b> Typically, automated <b>globe</b> <b>valves</b> use smooth stems rather than threaded and are opened and closed by an actuator assembly.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Globe</b> <b>valves</b> are {{typically}} two-port valves, although three port valves are also produced mostly in straight-flow configuration. Ports are {{openings in the}} body for fluid flowing in or out. The two ports may be oriented straight {{across from each other}} or anywhere on the body, or oriented at an angle (such as a 90Â°). [...] <b>Globe</b> <b>valves</b> with ports at such an angle are called angle <b>globe</b> <b>valves.</b> <b>Globe</b> <b>valves</b> are mainly used for corrosive or high viscous fluids which solidify at room temperature. This is because straight valves are designed so that the outlet pipe is in line with the inlet pipe and the fluid has a good chance of staying there in the case of horizontal piping. In the case of angle valves, the outlet pipe is directed towards the bottom. This allows the fluid to drain off. In turn, this prevents clogging and/or corrosion of the valve components over a period of time.A <b>globe</b> <b>valve</b> can also have a body {{in the shape of a}} [...] "Y". This will allow the construction of the valve to be straight at the bottom as opposed to the conventional pot type construction (to arrange bottom seat) in case of other valves. This will again allow the fluid to pass through without difficulty and minimizes fluid clogging/corrosion in the long term.|$|R

A single constant was obtained in laminar flow to determine the loss coefficient for all the sizes of valves and types of fluids tested in the valve, indicating that dynamic similarity had been achieved.

40|$|<b>Globe</b> <b>valves</b> {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} types of valve used for {{throttling}} applications for all sizes due to better controllability and wider range. One of the major limitations associated with the use <b>globe</b> <b>valves</b> in liquid application is cavitation and it takes place both in part open and in fully open conditions due to varied reasons. There are different designs of <b>globe</b> <b>valves</b> available but for control valve applications, cage and plug designs are widely employed. Cage and plug design consists of body, valve cage, plug and an actuating mechanism. Actuating mechanism is connected to the valve plug which is a moving part, through valve shaft. There are many investigations reported about the flow visualization and numerical simulation of normal type <b>globe</b> <b>valves.</b> But study on valves with cage and plug design are not reported in detail. The objective of the present study is to provide a three dimensional analysis of flow through a <b>globe</b> <b>valve</b> with cage and plug design with emphasis on the inception and development of cavitation in detail. Cavitation reduction is achieved by breaking the flow in the form of more than one liquid jet, thereby increasing the turbulence inside the valve flow path. The numerical simulation was done using GAMBIT to set up geometry and grid and FLUENT to solve difference equation postulated from the conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid in motion. The k-epsilon model was used for turbulence. Results of five configurations of the cage with constant flow areas and valve stroke are presented in this paper. The numerical results were verified with an experimental program employing total flow measurement and pressure drop created by the valve at full opening. The study was conducted for different jet configurations to generalize the results of the study. Experimental validation was done in the water test facility with an operating pressure of 1. 6 MPa and flow rate of 0. 05 m 3 /s. In the study, total area of opening for the flow and the valve stroke were kept constant. Accelerometers and dynamic pressure sensors were employed to sense the severity of cavitation at different differential pressures across the test valve...|$|R

Analysis of the pressure difference between the upside and downside of the valve core and comparison with similar previous work increase the reliability of the simulation. Then an analysis of flow and cavitation characteristics is carried out with three comparisons: a comparison between opened and closed states, a comparison between different inlet velocities, and a comparison between different valve core displacements. The results demonstrate that the vapor volume fraction reaches its peak point at the valve seat near the outlet tube, and that a higher inlet velocity or smaller valve core displacement can cause greater cavitation damage.

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{cavitation}} {{that occurs}} inside valves not only increases the energy consumption {{burden of the}} whole piping system but also leads to severe damages to the valve body and the piping system with a large economic loss. In this paper, {{in order to reduce}} the hydrodynamic cavitation inside <b>globe</b> <b>valves,</b> effects of valve body geometrical parameters including bending radius, deviation distance, and arc curvature linked to in/ export parts on hydrodynamic cavitation are investigated by using a cavitation model. To begin with, the numerical model is compared with similar works to check its accuracy. Then, the cavitation index and the total vapor volume are predicted. The results show that vapor primarily appears around the valve seat and connecting downstream pipes. The hydrodynamic cavitation does not occur under a small inlet velocity, a large bending radius, and a large deviation distance. Cavitation intensity decreases with the increase of the bending radius, the deviation distance, and the arc curvature linked to in/export parts. This indicates that valve geometrical parameters should be chosen as large as possible, while the maximal fluid velocity should be limited.

40|$|A novel pilot-control <b>globe</b> <b>valve,</b> {{which can}} be used in {{vertical}} pipelines with a lower driving energy consumption, is proposed. A governing equation for valve core motion is obtained through a theoretical analysis of the forces applied on the valve core. A 3 D simulation of valve core motion is conducted in Fluent by using User Defined Function (UDF) to involve different spring stiffness, steady state displacements, impact speeds and transient state displacements. The results show that there are different opening modes for different spring stiffness. For smaller spring stiffness, the valve is subject to a quicker response to flow to ensure it can work properly; however, this can more easily result in a higher impact speed. With the increasing of spring stiffness, the steady displacement of the core reduces especially beyond a turning point. Besides, the numerical transient displacements with 0. 9 and 1. 1 times the spring stiffness show good agreement with those obtained from a theoretical analysis. It is found out that the real spring design point should have 0. 9 times the spring stiffness determined by the theoretical analysis.

Thus, developing novel parametric analysis methods is very important for dealing with complex physical systems, refining useful parameters from numerous data, and proposing accurate prediction formulas. A spring slider system, a direct-current circuit system, a pipeline pressure drop system and a steady heat transfer model of flat plate system were described from the point of systemic parametric analysis method. Then, the key physical parameters in above four systems were summarized. Based on the comparative results, a novel systemic parametric design method, obstacle contained system (OCS) design method, was proposed. The OCS was made up of three elements:an obstacle element, a pass body element and a D-value element. With an abundant accurate data pole, the OCS design method could build the direct relationship of the obstacle element and the D-value element, which meant the simplification of the physical models and much easier to get relatively accurate results. Meanwhile, the design of pilot-control <b>globe</b> <b>valve</b> orifice was checked with both the OCS design method and the numerical simulation. The diameter of orifice on the valve core could influence the pressure difference and the maximum vapor rate inside pilot-control <b>globe</b> <b>valves.</b> Achieved by two different methods, the OCS design method and the numerical simulation, the results showed that the effects of orifice diameters on the pressure difference and the maximum vapor rate under different inlet velocities, were within 2 % errors, which was reasonable and acceptable for the engineering application.
