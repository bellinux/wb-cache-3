25|$|During this {{transition}} period and beyond, various groups of former Kuroda bushi held sporadic meetings and training sessions {{in memory of}} the now bygone era. The old bushi present at these sessions included Uchida Ryogoro, Shiraishi Hanjiro and many of the former Dangyo (instructors) of the Kuroda clan. Due to newfound cooperation between the surviving SMR-lineages there were several joint-licenses of the Haruyoshi and Jigyo-branches of SMR issued in the late 19th century. Shiraishi Hanjiro was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> who received a full Menkyo Kaiden license. By the end of the Meiji era, (1912), only Shiraishi was still active as a fully qualified exponent and dedicated teacher of the last two remaining Kuroda Jō lineages.|$|E
25|$|The 224th {{commanded}} by Lieutenant-Colonel D.H. Thompson {{was divided into}} groups for the landings. The commanding officer and sixty-five men who were to establish the Main Dressing Station (MDS) travelled in the same aircraft as brigade headquarters, while Nos 1, 2 and 3 Sections were attached to the 1st Canadian, 8th and 9th parachute battalions. Arriving in Normandy from around 01:00, many of the unit landed {{too far to the}} east in the flooded marshes beside the River Dives. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> was the commanding officer who then spent three weeks trying to rejoin the unit from behind German lines before being captured. The members of the 224th who landed on the correct drop zone proceeded to set up their Main Dressing Station in a farm at Le Mesnil. By noon, around two thirds of the 22nd were still missing, but the MDS had managed to treat fifty-five wounded and conduct ten surgical operations.|$|E
500|$|News anchors Brian Williams and Andrea Mitchell played {{themselves}} in the episode {{in which the two}} tease the Liz Lemon character of her supposed relationship with Giamatti's Ritchie. This was Williams' fourth appearance on the show, having appeared in the episodes [...] "The Ones", [...] "Audition Day", and [...] "Future Husband", and Mitchell's first appearance on 30 Rock. Ben Bailey, the game show host of the Discovery Channel program Cash Cab played himself. In the beginning of the episode, several men hit on Liz, which surprises her, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> who hits on her was credited as [...] "Moonvest" [...] and was played by Craig Castaldo, or known as Radio Man.

500|$|Notwithstanding Eisenhower's {{estimation}} of Patton's abilities {{as a strategic}} planner, his overall view of Patton's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe can best be seen in Eisenhower's refusal to even consider sending Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which he privately remarked, [...] "Patton is indispensable to the war effort– one of the guarantors of our victory." [...] As Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy told Eisenhower: [...] "Lincoln's remark after they got after Grant comes to mind when I think of Patton– 'I can't spare this man, he fights'." [...] After Patton's death, Eisenhower would write his own tribute: [...] "He was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> born to be a soldier, an ideal combat leader... It is no {{exaggeration to say that}} Patton's name struck terror at the hearts of the enemy." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Álvaro del Portillo, who was Escrivá's closest {{collaborator}} {{for many}} years, {{there was one}} basic quality of Escrivá [...] "that pervaded everything else: his dedication to God, and to all souls for God's sake; his constant readiness to correspond generously {{to the will of}} God." [...] Pope Paul VI summarized his opinion of what he termed the [...] "extraordinariness" [...] of Escrivá's sanctity in this way: [...] "He is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> who has received the most charisms (supernatural gifts) and have corresponded most generously to them." ...|$|E
50|$|Frank’s {{political}} activism was evident {{as a student}} demonstrator against the rule of Ferdinand Marcos. As First-Quarter Stormer, he joined the student mass action on January 30, 1970, the First Battle of Mendiola Bridge. He was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>manning</b> the barricades when Metrocom soldiers stormed the University of the Philippines campus. His participation in numerous rallies notwithstanding, he finished the law course, cum laude, at the UP in 1971.

2500|$|On February 22, 1775, the British general Thomas Gage {{sent two}} {{officers}} and an enlisted {{man out of}} Boston to survey the route to Worcester, Massachusetts. In Framingham, those spies stopped at Buckminster's Tavern. They watched the town militia muster outside the building, impressed with the men's numbers but not their discipline. Though [...] "the whole company" [...] came into the tavern after their drill, the officers managed to remain undetected and continued on their mission the next day. Gage did not order a march along that route, instead ordering troops to Concord, Massachusetts, on April 18–19. Framingham sent two militia companies totaling about 130 men into the Battles of Lexington and Concord that followed; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> was wounded.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1836, the unpopular {{government}} of the Duke of Broglie lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, and the King needed a new Prime Minister. As he had done in 1830, he chose a man he was certain would soon fail; [...] Adolphe Thiers. On the subject of Thiers, Louis-Philippe told Victor Hugo, [...] "He (Thiers) has spirit, but he is spoiled by {{the spirit of a}} parvenu; [...] he has shown himself to be insatiable." [...] Louis Philippe cited what he said was Talleyrand's view of Thiers: [...] "You will never make anything of Thiers, but nonetheless he will be an excellent instrument. But he is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> whom you can make use of only if you give them satisfaction; but he is never satisfied. The misfortune, for you and for him, is that you cannot make him a cardinal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Churaman was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> of History to whom destiny proved {{remarkable}} unsparing and bounteous. Majama-ul-Akhbar {{though a}} later work, aptly sums up.”...... {{his good fortune}} proved like waters richly fertilizing the field of his successful career in life....” More due to the combination of fortuitous circumstances than to his own endeavours, he rose {{from the depths of}} a despised rebel to the enviable height of a Panchhazari Mansabdar and the uncrowned king of the region between Delhi and the Chambal. Stars smiled upon him right form the dawn of his eventful career. It was his luck as a chief Fateh Singh failed and hence the leadership was devolved on him, though he did not directly descend from the famous Raja Ram. Further, his tenure as the Jat chief coincided with the waning Mughal power. This offered him golden opportunities to fulfill his designs. Besides, it is noteworthy that, although he was not negligent in his turbulent ways, again and again he received royal favours. To Crown all, he was extremely [...] fortunate in gaining the favour of certain influential nobles of the day.|$|E

2500|$|Rolfe was an {{enthusiastic}} letter writer. [...] John Holden recalled that [...] "Corvo was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> who never speak a word {{if they can}} write it. We {{lived in the same}} house, a very little one, yet he would always communicate with me by note if I was not {{in the same room with}} him. He had dozens of letter books. He seized upon every opportunity for writing a letter, and every letter, whether to a publisher or to a cobbler, was written with the same care." [...] About a thousand of his letters have survived, and several sequences of them have been published in limited editions. [...] The letters reveal a lively, intelligent and absorbent mind, but because of Rolfe’s paranoiac tendencies they are often disputatious and recriminatory. [...] Among the commentators who rated Rolfe’s letters more highly than his fiction was W H Auden, who wrote that Rolfe [...] "had every right to be proud of his verbal claws … A large vocabulary is essential to the invective style, and Rolfe by study and constant practice became one of the great masters of vituperation." [...] The letters have yet to be collected into a single scholarly edition.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the German Spring Offensive petered out in July 1918, they had reached the closest point to Paris of the entire war and had come close to {{breaking}} the Allied armies and winning the conflict. 850,000 British and French soldiers had been wounded killed or captured in just four months. Although the Hundred Days Offensive which would eventually defeat the German army began two weeks later, the damage to Edgar Cox was done. During the months of the Spring Offensive he had worked feverishly to discover the locations and details of the next attacks and had deteriorated both mentally and physically in the process. Cox was knocked out by the influenza pandemic for much of June and {{did not return to}} duty until mid-August. He had become a heavy smoker and [...] by August was no longer eating or sleeping, suffering severely from nervous exhaustion. On 26 August 1918 he announced that he would go for a swim and was driven down to Berck Plage near GHQ at Étaples. He entered the water alone and his body was recovered from the sea some time later. He was buried in Étaples Military Cemetery with full military honours. Following his death, the Royal Geographic Society reported that the British nation in the First World War had [...] "suffered no more grievous loss than in the death of General Cox", and that [...] "He was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men,</b> of whom there are very few, of whom nothing but praise was ever heard." ...|$|E
2500|$|The men of {{the convoy}} then began {{launching}} boats to pick up Japanese survivors and kill all of the remaining prisoners. A machine gun mounted on the grounded cargo ship and a second on the Shinyō Maru were also opened up on the Allied personnel. Marine Corps Sergeant Onnie Clem later reported the following; [...] "Up on the bridge there was a machine gun spraying the hatch. A burst of machine-gun fire caught {{all three of us}} and knocked us back down in the hold. We'd all been hit. I got plowed in the skull. Another bullet chipped out my chin. Nevertheless, I was able to work myself back up on deck, and I was eyeing that bridge when I came out that time. The gun was still there, but the gunner was laying out on deck. Somebody had apparently got up there and killed him. At this time I found out that we were out in the ocean about two or three miles from shore. All I had was a loincloth." [...] Fifteen or 20 others were recaptured and taken aboard one of the torpedo boats, where they were executed by firing squad as punishment for trying to escape. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>men</b> was able to free his hands which had been tied behind his back, and he successfully escaped by jumping overboard again. The Japanese dropped 45 depth charges and other explosives on the American submarine over the course of two hours, and the ship sustained some light damage, but nobody was hurt. After that, she surfaced and began patrolling the area again.|$|E
