The journal's website is at: [URL] paper summarises the results of a study to assess the environmental impact of <b>oxo-degradable</b> plastics. These plastics are mainly based on polyethylene and contain additives that cause the plastic to undergo oxidative degradation by a process accelerated by light and/or heat. The approach used in the study has been to review the published research on <b>oxo-degradable</b> plastics, assess other literature available in the public domain, and also to engage with stakeholders throughout the life cycle of the product. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to assess what happens at the end of life of the plastics and whether this has a beneficial effect. The study concluded that incorporating additives into petroleum-based plastics to accelerate their degradation does not improve their environmental impact and potentially gives rise to certain negative effects. In particular there is concern that these plastics are neither suitable for conventional recycling methods, due to the presence of degradation accelerators, nor suitable for composting, due to the lack of biodegradability. There is also concern about the fate of <b>oxo-degradable</b> plastic fragments in the environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{consumption of}} <b>oxo-degradable</b> polyethylene plastics in Indonesia is potentially cause pollution. This {{problem can be}} overcome by utilizing plastic degrading-bacteria as degradation agent. The present study aims to isolate and characterize of <b>oxo-degradable</b> polyethylene degrading-bacteria from Benowo landfill soil Surabaya. Isolation and screening {{was done by the}} culture technique and clear zone method. Total abundance of bacteria was calculated based on the Total Plate Count method. Bacterial colonies screening was done based on morphological characteristics and the diameter of clear zone. Four isolates with the largest diameter of clear zone were futher characterized based on cell morphology and physiology biochemistry characters. The results showed the average of total abundance of <b>oxo-degradable</b> polyethylene degrading- 4 - 1 bacteria of Benowo landfill was 1. 28 x 10 CFU g. The four of twelve isolates with the largest diameter of clear zone showing the highest degradation capability, that were isolates A 221 (0. 7 cm), A 231 (1 cm), A 232 (0. 6 cm), and C 231 (1. 3 cm). Colony morphology characteristics of four isolates were generally shape of circular and irregular; margin of entire and lobate; elevation of flat; optics of opaque; and pigmentation of yellow, greenish and cream. These four isolates were Gram negative with the shape bacilli and cell size range of 3 - 4 µm. Physiological and biochemical characteristics among the four isolates were resistant to acidic conditions; non...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of the so called oxo-biodegradable additives in the Argentine market motivated {{the assessment of the}} effects of abiotic and biotic factors on the structure and mechanical behavior of polyethylene (PE) with <b>oxo-degradable</b> additives (PE+AD). Samples of <b>oxo-degradable</b> packaging films found in local shops together with polyethylene films with and without d 2 ẅ additive were annealed at different temperatures between 50 and 110 ¼C and submitted to ultraviolet radiation at different irradiances (0, 35; 0, 45; 0, 89 and 1, 20 W/m 2). Furthermore, aged <b>oxo-degradable</b> films were set in a controlled compost bioreactor in order to evaluate their biodegradation ability. Experimental results showed that elongation at break was the mechanical property more sensitive to the polymeric degradation. The structural changes determined by FT-IR remarked the importance of the UV degradation time over the irradiation rate; the carbonyl index of the degraded samples pointed out that chain scission was a thermally activated process. Regarding degradation due to UV radiation, at the same dose, the elongation at break is lower at lower irradiance both in PE and PE+AD samples. On the other hand, thermal degradation of PE without additive is more susceptible to degradation than PE + AD. At the beginning of the biodegradation tests, PE + AD showed a higher CO 2 production rate with respect to PE; however, this rate reduced along the first 30 days, reaching the CO 2 production of PE without additive. The maximum biodegradation observed for both PE and PE+AD samples was 24 % after 90 days of incubation...|$|E
40|$|The public {{awareness}} of the quality of environment stimulates the endeavor to safe polymeric materials and their degradation products. The aim of the forensic engineering case study presented in this paper is to evaluate the aging process of commercial <b>oxo-degradable</b> polyethylene bag under real industrial composting conditions and in distilled water at 70 °C, for comparison. Partial degradation of the investigated material was monitored by changes in molecular weight, thermal properties and Keto Carbonyl Bond Index and Vinyl Bond Index, which were calculated from the FTIR spectra. The results indicate that such an <b>oxo-degradable</b> product offered in markets degrades slowly under industrial composting conditions. Even fragmentation is slow, and it is dubious that biological mineralization of this material would occur within a year under industrial composting conditions. The slow degradation and fragmentation is most likely due to partially crosslinking after long time of degradation, which results in the limitation of low molecular weight residues for assimilation. The work suggests that these materials should not be labeled as biodegradable, and should be further analyzed {{in order to avoid the}} spread of persistent artificial materials in nature...|$|E
40|$|Outdoor {{weathering}} {{field trials}} performed with <b>oxo-degradable</b> polyethylene (PE) thin films were conducted across temperate, grassland, and subtropical sites around Australia. It {{was found that}} a site factor, that was apparently independent of total solar dose and temperature, significantly impacted the rate and extent of photo-oxidation. Controlled laboratory-based accelerated aging trials of both PE film with no prodegradant and <b>oxo-degradable</b> PE films (containing iron stearate) revealed that the rate and extent of PE photo-oxidation did not correlate with temperature under the film or UV exposure, but was soil dependent. Under accelerated photo-oxidative conditions, the time to reach embrittlement for a PE film aged over the soil from the temperate site (OM 8. 4) was half (24. 5 days) the time taken when aged over air (48 days). Further investigation revealed that humic acids and fulvic acids within soil organic matter may contribute to an increased rate of PE photo-oxidation, possibly through the formation of volatile reactive oxygen species that may form under photo-oxidative conditions. The presence of water also {{had a significant impact}} on the rate of photo-oxidation. Overall, the impact of soil on PE photo-oxidation was found to be complex and likely dependent at least in part on soil components that varied between different soil types, consequently influencing their photo-chemistry...|$|E

40|$|Degradable {{materials}} {{have been suggested}} to overcome accumulation {{in the field of}} persistent plastic residues associated with the increasing use of polyethylene mulches. New degradable {{materials have}} been proven successful for increasing crop productivity; however, their degradation in the field has been hardly addressed. A qualitative scale was {{used in the present study}} to assess the above-soil and in-soil degradation of degradable mulches during the cropping season. Degradation was determined in three biodegradable plastic mulches (Biofilm, BF; Mater-Bi, MB; Bioflex, BFx), two paper sheet mulches (Saikraft, PSA; MimGreen, PMG) and one <b>oxo-degradable</b> plastic mulch (Enviroplast, EvP). Polyethylene (PE) mulch was used as control. Mulches were tested in five Spanish locations (Castilla-La Mancha, La Rioja, Navarra, Aragón and Catalunya), with three crop seasons of processing tomato. Biodegradable plastic mulches BF and MB degraded more and faster above-soil than paper mulches; among biodegradable mulches BF degraded more than MB, and MB more than BFx. The above-soil degradation of the <b>oxo-degradable</b> mulch EvP was highly dependent on location and crop season, and it degraded more than PE. Main environmental factors triggering above-soil degradation were radiation, rainfall and crop cover. In-soil, paper mulches and BF degraded more and faster than MB, whereas BFx and EvP barely degraded. Environmental factors triggering in-soil degradation during the crop season were rainfall and irrigation water. The effect of soil parameters (organic matter, nutrient availability) on degradation during the cropping season was not evidenced. The qualitative scale used proved convenient for determining mulch field degradation. A visual scale for supporting the qualitative evaluation is provided. In order to standardise parameters and criteria for future studies on field mulching degradation evaluation, a unified degradation qualitative scale is suggested.

40|$|A plastic {{material}} is {{any of a}} wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organic solids that are mouldable. Plastics are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass, but they often contain other substances. It is a white, waxy polymer constituted of only carbon and hydrogen. The drastic rise in the use of non-biodegradable {{plastic material}}s during the past decades has not been accompanied by corresponding development procedure for the safe disposal or degradation of these polymers. This research paper is mainly evaluating the <b>oxo-degradable</b> response of a polyethylene film sample containing pro-degradant additive by means of successive accelerated UV and thermal ageing. The results of the successive accelerated UV and thermal ageing test demonstrate that the film sample containing the d 2 w pro-degradant additive has undergone significant degradation. The film sample containing the additive demonstrates a large change in carbonyl optical density measurement at the conclusion of the test (Figure 1). These results are consistent with the film sample containing the pro-degradant additive being in an advanced state of degradation. The sample containing additive reached a carbonyl optical density value of 0. 0361 after 528 hours ageing (inclusive of 48 hours UV pre-ageing). This result is consistent with inclusion of additive promoting degradation in the film sample. This conclusion is confirmed by observation: at the end of the ageing tests the oxo-biodegradable film sample show signs of breakdown (Figure 1). The film containing the additive demonstrated no significant increase in carbony...|$|E
