40|$|This {{experimental}} study examines relationships between alternative evolution paths of basaltic liquids (the so-called Bowen and Fenner trends), and silicate liquid immiscibility. Synthetic analogues of natural immiscible systems exhibited in volcanic glasses and melt inclusions {{were used as}} starting mixtures. Conventional quench experiments in 1 atm gas mixing furnaces proved unable to reproduce unmixing of ferrobasaltic melts, yielding instead either turbid, <b>opalescent</b> <b>glasses,</b> or crystallization of tridymite and pyroxenes. In contrast, experiments involving in situ high-temperature centrifu-gation at 1000 g (g 98 m/s 2) did yield macroscopic unmixing and phase separation. Centrifugation for 3 ^ 4 h was insufficient to complete phase segregation, and resulted in sub-micron immiscible emulsions in quenched glasses.

2500|$|Angel gilding {{was widely}} used by Chicago's stained glass studios in the 1920s and 30s {{to make a}} {{distinctive}} style of stained glass for Chicago's historic bungalows. These Prairie Style windows have a clear glass background with the designs picked out in <b>opalescent</b> <b>glass</b> and double-sided gold mirror. To make the double-sided [...] the studios angel gilded large sheets of thin (1.6mm, or 0.06inch) glass. A worker would cut two copies of the desired shape from the glass and place the pieces back to back in a single came. Because the pieces are gold on both sides, they catch and reflect the light whether the window is viewed {{from inside the house}} or from the street. Frank Lloyd Wright used double-sided angel gilded glass in many of his windows, including the now demolished Imperial Hotel in Tokyo.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of his career, Tiffany used cheap jelly jars and bottles because they had the mineral impurities that finer glass lacked. When he was unable to convince fine glassmakers to leave the impurities in, he began making his own glass. Tiffany used <b>opalescent</b> <b>glass</b> in a variety of colors and textures to create a unique style of stained glass. He developed the [...] "copper foil" [...] technique, which, by edging each piece of cut glass in copper foil and soldering the whole together to create his windows and lamps, made possible a level of detail previously unknown. This can be contrasted with the method of painting in enamels or glass paint on colorless glass, and then setting the glass pieces in lead channels, that had been the dominant method of creating stained glass for hundreds of years in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|The Main Concourse is {{the center}} of Grand Central. At [...] long by [...] wide by [...] high, the {{cavernous}} Main Concourse is usually filled with bustling crowds. and is often used as a meeting place. The ticket booths are here, although many now stand unused or have been repurposed since the introduction of ticket vending machines. The large American flag was hung in Grand Central Terminal {{a few days after the}} September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. The main information booth is in the center of the concourse. The four-faced brass clock on top of the information booth, perhaps the most recognizable icon of Grand Central, was designed by Henry Edward Bedford and cast in Waterbury, Connecticut. Each of the four clock faces is made from <b>opalescent</b> <b>glass</b> (now often called opal glass or milk glass), though urban legend has it that the faces are made of opal and that Sotheby's and Christie's have estimated their value to be between $10 million and $20 million. A 1954 New York Times article on the restoration of the clock notes that [...] "Each of the glass faces was twenty-four inches in diameter...."

40|$|In {{the present}} work, 50 samples of stained glass {{have been studied}} in order to {{disclose}} the improvements in glass production introduced after the growth of industry in the late 18 th and early 19 th centuries; the large scale production of glass {{and the development of}} new techniques led to a revival of stained glass manufacture, culminated during the late 19 th century with the addition to the batch of many new colouring agents, or syhnthetic versions of the old ones, and synthesized raw materials (such as Solvay processed soda). The sample repertory includes both transparent and <b>opalescent</b> <b>glasses</b> produced by some Italian, German and American glassworks between the late 19 th and {{the first half of the}} 20 th centuries. All samples have been preliminarily analyzed by SEM-EDS and XRF in order to characterize the batch composition and the colouring agents. XRD has been utilized as well to identify crystalline phases employed as opacifying agents. Based on major element contents, the majority of samples can be considered as soda-lime-silica glasses, with few examples of mixed alkali-lime and lead-potash glasses. Concerning coloured transparent glasses, the addition of new colouring agents synthesized during the 19 th century such as pure cobalt (mainly used for blue tints), cadmium (yellow and orange), selenium (pink and amber) and zinc (associated with sulphur to produce a deep red tint) has been confirmed. Moreover, high contents of calcium and fluorine have been detected in all opalescent samples by SEM-EDS and XRF (XRD analysis confirmed the presence of fluorite, CaF), while zirconium (introduced as zircon, ZrSiO 4 or zirconium dioxide,ZrO 2), has been detected as well in some samples...|$|R
50|$|La Farge {{experimented with}} color problems, {{especially}} in the medium of stained glass. His work rivaled the beauty of medieval windows and added new resources by his use of <b>opalescent</b> <b>glass</b> and by his original methods of layering and welding the glass. <b>Opalescent</b> <b>glass</b> had been used for centuries in tableware, but it {{had never before been}} formed into flat sheets for use in stained-glass windows and other decorative objects. For his early experiments, La Farge had had to custom-order flat sheets of <b>opalescent</b> <b>glass</b> from a Brooklyn glass manufacturer. La Farge apparently introduced Tiffany to the new use of <b>opalescent</b> <b>glass</b> sometime in the mid 1870s, showing him his experiments. Sometime in the late 1870s or early 1880s, however, relations between the artists soured, probably due to a lawsuit between the two men.|$|E
50|$|The Kokomo <b>Opalescent</b> <b>Glass</b> Works of Kokomo, Indiana, is {{the oldest}} {{manufacturer}} of hand cast, rolled cathedral and <b>opalescent</b> <b>glass</b> in America, and the oldest manufacturer of <b>opalescent</b> <b>glass</b> in the world. In continuous operation since 1888, it was founded by Charles Edward Henry (born Paris, France about 1846), who was relocating his existing stained glass manufacturing business from New Rochelle, New York. KOG {{has long been an}} important supplier to the American stained glass industry, including documented sales to Louis C.

5000|$|La Farge filed {{a patent}} {{application}} on Nov. 10, 1879, shortly after a newspaper account praised a recent window he made for Richard Derby of Long Island as [...] "the first {{application of a}} new material glass to windows." [...] He was granted patent no. 224,831 on February 24, 1880, for a [...] "Colored-Glass Window", with technical details about manufacturing <b>opalescent</b> sheet <b>glass</b> and layering it to create windows. Eight months later, Tiffany applied for a similar patent, which was granted in 1881 as no. 237,417. The major difference in their patents is that Tiffany lists somewhat different technical details, for instance relating to the air space between glass layers. Since La Farge's patent focused more on the material and Tiffany's more on its use in construction, {{it appeared that the}} two patents might be mutually dependent, prohibiting either artist from making stained-glass windows without the other's permission. There is some indication that La Farge may have come to some kind of agreement with Tiffany on the use of La Farge's patent, but the details are unclear and disputed by scholars. What does seem certain is that around 1882 La Farge planned to sue Tiffany, claiming that Tiffany had infringed his patent by appropriating some of his working methods for <b>opalescent</b> sheet <b>glass.</b> Official records of the lawsuit have not been found, suggesting it was never filed, but there are multiple references to it in the correspondence of both men. Possibly, as stained glass increased in popularity, drawing other artists to the medium, both La Farge and Tiffany decided it would be too much trouble to legally defend their patents.|$|R

25|$|In 1881 Tiffany did the {{interior}} {{design of the}} Mark Twain House in Hartford, Connecticut, which still remains, but the new firm's most notable work came in 1882 when President Chester Alan Arthur refused {{to move into the}} White House until it had been redecorated. He commissioned Tiffany, who had begun {{to make a name for}} himself in New York society for the firm's interior design work, to redo the state rooms, which Arthur found charmless. Tiffany worked on the East Room, the Blue Room, the Red Room, the State Dining Room, and the Entrance Hall, refurnishing, repainting in decorative patterns, installing newly designed mantelpieces, changing to wallpaper with dense patterns, and, of course, adding Tiffany glass to gaslight fixtures and windows and adding an <b>opalescent</b> floor-to-ceiling <b>glass</b> screen in the Entrance Hall. The Tiffany screen and other Victorian additions were all removed in the Roosevelt renovations of 1902, which restored the White House interiors to Federal style in keeping with its architecture.|$|R

Some <b>opalescent</b> <b>glass</b> was used by several stained glass studios in England from the 1860s and 1870s onwards, notably Heaton, Butler and Bayne.

40|$|Currently the {{importance}} of the application of non-invasive and portable techniques to the characterization of glass is well known. However, despite the large number of publications on medieval glass, few studies have been performed on early modern glass. Since the opportunities to sample or to move the work of art out of the conservation location are very limited, the application of non invasive and portable techniques appears to {{be the best way to}} perform an in-depth characterization of the chromophores and raw materials even though the complexity of interpreting the results and the lack of references necessitate a preliminary phase of testing on standard and reference samples. In this study a collection of colored and <b>opalescent</b> <b>glasses</b> from the first half of the 20 th century and some standard samples of cobalt and cadmium glasses produced ad hoc at the Vicarte Centre (Universidade Nova de Lisboa) were analyzed using both traditional (XRF, SEM-EDS, XRD and UV-Vis-NIR) and portable and non-invasive techniques (XRF, FORS). The standard samples consist of 21 glasses different base compositions (soda-lime, potash and mixed alkali) and different amounts of chromophores. For cobalt colored glasses different amounts of cobalt (0. 5, 0. 75 and 1 % wt) were added to each base composition (9 samples). Also, yellow to orange and ruby red colorations were obtained by modulating the cadmium/sulfide and cadmium/selenium ratios. The cobalt blue glass absorption spectra detected by FORS are usually characterized by three sub-peaks located around 530 nm, 590 nm and 650 nm due to the cobalt tetrahedral coordination. A change in the base composition of the glass could, however, affect the three-peak position due to a change in the ligand field strength. The influence on the FORS spectra of a different base composition and amount of soda present in the glasses (detected by SEM-EDS and XRF) was studied. For glasses with soda content under 15 % (some soda-lime samples and mixed base glasses), the resolution of the three-peak absorption band of cobalt is poor. The band appears to be broad, unsymmetrical, and centered around 550 nm even though the characteristic triplet was detected when the amount of soda increased to between 15 % and 29 %. A shift of about 10 nm in the position of the peaks can be observed in all glasses with a potash base. The study of the glasses colored by CdS and Se is still in progress, and the results will be available soon...|$|R
40|$|Glass {{formation}} in the K 2 O-TiO 2 -P 2 O 5 -SiO 2 system, and the structure and crystn. behavior of glasses having compns. near the stoichiometry of KTiOPO 4 (KTP) have been examd. by DTA, X-ray diffraction (XRD), fast Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy and second harmonic generation (SHG). Pure glasses may be obtained adding an appropriate amt. of P 2 O 5 as well as SiO 2 to the KTP compn. Transparent and homogeneous glasses were synthesized for the 56 (K 2 O· 2 TiO 2 ·P 2 O 5) · 44 P 2 O 5 (KTP- 44 P) and the 90 (K 2 O· 2 TiO 2 ·P 2 O 5) · 10 SiO 2 (KTP- 10 Si) molar compns. In contrast, for the 80 (K 2 O· 2 TiO 2 ·P 2 O 5) · 20 SiO 2 (KTP- 20 Si) and for higher SiO 2 contents, the obtained glasses were partially opaque and phase sepd. KTP glasses with lower P 2 O 5 content cannot be obtained as they crystallize during quenching. The KTP- 10 Si glass shows the only exothermic peak connected to KTP phase crystn. whereas the KTP- 44 P and the KTP- 20 Si glasses devitrify in two steps. Firstly the same unidentified phase is formed in both these glasses and the KTP phase is formed only at higher temps. Transparent and <b>opalescent</b> KTP <b>glasses</b> exhibiting SHG activity may be produced by careful heat treatments at temps. just above Tg.
