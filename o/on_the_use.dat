5|$|As {{bishop of}} Turin, Claudius {{found that men}} were often {{directed}} to go on pilgrimage to Rome for penance and that worshippers were accustomed to venerate Christ and the saints by bowing before images and relics. Claudius, coming from an educated background, was not greatly exposed to such provincial modes of worship. He made attacks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of images, relics, and crosses, he opposed pilgrimages to obtain absolution, and he had little regard for {{the authority of the}} pope due to his belief that all bishops were equal.|$|E

5|$|Locusts {{have formed}} plagues since prehistory. The Ancient Egyptians carved {{them on their}} tombs and the insects are {{mentioned}} in the Iliad, the Bible and the Quran. Swarms have devastated crops and been a contributory cause of famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locations where swarms tend to originate, have meant that control measures can be used at an early stage. The traditional means of control are based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of insecticides from the ground or the air, but other methods using biological control are proving effective.|$|E
5|$|M. vitrata {{causes the}} most {{damage to the}} growing cowpea due to their large host range and {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It causes damage to the flower buds, flowers and pods of the plant with infestations resulting in a 20–88% loss of yield. While the insect can cause damage through all growth stages, most of the damage occurs during flowering. Biological control has had limited success, so most preventative methods rely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of agrichemicals. Genetically modified cowpeas are being developed to express the cry protein from Bacillus thuringiensis, which is toxic to lepidopteran species including the Maruca.|$|E
