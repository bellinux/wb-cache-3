In many cases, given an arbitrary tooth shape, it is possible to develop a <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> for the mating gear that provides a constant velocity ratio. However, two constant velocity <b>tooth</b> <b>profiles</b> are the most commonly used in modern times: the cycloid and the involute. The cycloid was more common until the late 1800s.

The cycloid is in some ways the more interesting and flexible shape; however the involute has two advantages: it is easier to manufacture, and it permits the center-to-center spacing of the gears to vary over some range without ruining the constancy of the velocity ratio. Cycloidal gears only work properly if the center spacing is exactly right. Cycloidal gears are still used in mechanical clocks.|$|R
