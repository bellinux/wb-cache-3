In this paper, an attempt {{has been made to}} develop mathematical models in order to relate laser cutting parameters such as the laser power, cutting speed, assist gas pressure and focus position, and cut quality characteristics such as the surface roughness, kerf width and width of heat affected zone (HAZ). A laser cutting experiment was planned as per Taguchi’s L 27 orthogonal array with three levels for each of laser cutting parameters considered. 3 mm thick AISI 304 stainless steel was used as workpiece material. Mathematical models were developed using a single hidden layer artificial neural network (ANN) trained with the Levenberg– Marquardt algorithm. On the basis of the developed ANN models the effects of the laser cutting parameters on the cut quality characteristics were presented.

40|$|An {{asymptotic}} {{analysis of}} balanced flow operations of differential mobility analyzers (DMAs) {{and a new}} class of instruments that includes opposed migration aerosol classifiers (OMACs) and inclined grid mobility analyzers (IGMAs) provides new insights into the similarities and differences between the devices. The characteristic scalings of different instruments found from minimal models are shown to relate the resolving powers, dynamic ranges, and efficiencies of most such devices. The resolving powers of all of the instruments in the nondiffusive regime of high voltage classifications, R_(nd), is determined by the ratio of the flow rate of the separation gas (sheath or crossflow) to that of the aerosol. At lowvoltage,when diffusion degrades the classification, the OMAC and the IGMA share an R_(nd) factor advantage in dynamic range of mobilities over the DMA, although the OMAC also suffers greater losses because diffusion immediately deposits particles onto its porous electrodes. On the basis of this analysis, a single master <b>operating</b> <b>diagram</b> is proposed for DMAs, OMACs, and IGMAs. Analysis of this <b>operating</b> <b>diagram</b> and its consequences for the design of differential electrical mobility classifiers suggests that OMACs and IGMAs also have advantages over DMAs in design flexibility and miniaturization. Most importantly, OMACs and IGMAs may outperform DMAs for the currently difficult classification of particles with diameters less than 10 nm. On the other hand, DMAs are more amenable to voltage scanning-mode operation to enable accelerated size distribution measurements, whereas it is most convenient to operate OMACs and IGMAs in voltage stepping-mode operation...|$|E

Symmetric and nearly symmetric configurations in three-layer flows are unstable when the core layer is more viscous than the cuter layers.

40|$|Microscale tipstreaming is a {{hydrodynamic}} phenomenon {{capable of}} producing submicron sized droplets within a microfluidic device. Tipstreaming is the ejection of small drops from a liquid thread formed by interfacial tension gradients and convective transport of surfactant. To use tipstreaming in potential applications, including nanoparticle synthesis, chemical detection and separation, occlusion therapy, and others, {{it is necessary to}} understand and be able to control the thread formation process. However, there are many technical challenges restricting successful implementation of microscale tipstreaming. This thesis provides several tools and solutions to overcome these technical challenges. Modeling the tipstreaming phenomenon has allowed for prediction of conditions where tipstreaming is expected to occur for an arbitrary oil-water-surfactant system. This facilitates the use of tipstreaming to quickly estimate conditions where thread formation will be observed, reducing the need for experimentally determining the tipstreaming <b>operating</b> <b>diagram.</b> The key component of the model is the reliance on interfacial shape observations to simplify the fluid flow and surfactant transport equations.

40|$|Motivated by the {{redrawing}} of hot glass {{into thin}} sheets, we investigate {{the shape and}} stability of a thin viscous sheet that is inhomogeneously stretched in an imposed non-uniform temperature field. We first determine the associated base flow by solving the long-timescale stretching flow of a flat sheet {{as a function of}} two dimensionless parameters: the normalized stretching velocity α, and a dimensionless width of the heating zone β. This allows us to determine the conditions for the onset of an out-of-plane wrinkling instability stated in terms of an eigenvalue problem for a linear partial differential equation governing the displacement of the midsurface of the sheet. We show the sheet can become unstable in two regions that are upstream and downstream of the heating zone where the minimum in-plane stress is negative. This yields the shape and growth rates of the most unstable buckling mode in both regions for various values of the stretching velocity and heating zone width. A transition from stationary to oscillatory unstable modes is found in the upstream region with increasing β while the downstream region is always stationary. We show that the wrinkling instability can be entirely suppressed when the surface tension is large enough relative to the magnitude of the in-plane stress. Finally, we present an <b>operating</b> <b>diagram</b> that indicates regions of the parameter space that result in a required outlet sheet thickness upon stretching, while simultaneously minimizing or suppressing the out-of-plane buckling; a result that is relevant for the glass redraw method used to create ultrathin glass sheets.

40|$|The {{formation}} of polymer nanofibers from fluid jets in· an electric field, {{also referred to}} as electrospinning, has been studied. Controlling the fiber properties requires a detailed understanding of how a millimeter-diameter fluid jet emanating from a nozzle is transformed into solid fibers that are four orders of magnitude smaller in diameter. To this end, a fiber spinner operating under a uniform electric field and providing a controlled process environment was designed. In the conventional view of electrospinning, the mechanism leading to small fiber diameters has been attributed to the splaying phenomenon, in which a single jet splits into multiple smaller jets due to radial charge repulsion. Using high-speed photography and an aqueous solution of poly(ethylene oxide) as a model fluid, it was shown that the jet does not splay but instead undergoes a rapid whipping motion. The high whipping frequency created the optical artifact of multiple jets. The whipping jet was best observed in the onset region of the instability. Further downstream, the amplitude of the instability continued to grow, and the jet trajectory became more chaotic. This was verified through photography of the entire jet and close-up observations of representative regions further downstream. Based on these findings, an alternative mechanism for the {{formation of}} polymer nanofibers is proposed. It is conjectured that the whipping instability causes stretching and bending of the jet. The large reduction in jet diameter is achieved by increasing the path length over which the fluid jet is accelerated and stretched prior to solidification or deposition on a collector. Whipping induced stretching is conjectured to be the primary mechanism causing the jet diameter reduction. To provide a concise way of displaying the stability of electrified fluid jets {{as a function of the}} electric field and the flow rate, <b>operating</b> <b>diagrams</b> were developed. These diagrams delineate regions of different jet behavior, and the stability borders for two transitions have been mapped. The first transition is from dripping to a stable jet; and represents the suppression of the Rayleigh instability. For high conductivity fluids, an additional transition from a stable to a whipping jet can be observed at higher electric fields. The experimental findings are supported by a theoretical analysis of the jet thinning and the onset of the instability. To elucidate the fundamental electrohydrodynamics, glycerol was studied as a model fluid. Based on the experimental observation that whipping occurs on a length scale much larger than the jet radius, an asymptotic approximation of the electrohydrodynamic equations has been developed by Hohman and Brenner. This theory governs both long wavelength axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric distortions of the jet, and allows the jet stability to be evaluated as a function of all relevant fluid and process parameters. Three different instabilities are predicted: the classical Rayleigh instability, an axisymmetric conducting mode, and a non-axisymmetric conducting mode. The presence of these instabilities at various locations along the jet has been verified with high-speed video and photography. The particular instability that is observed depends on the jet shape and the surface charge density. To achieve quantitative agreement between experimental and theoretical jet profiles, the jet current and the local electric field in the vicinity of the nozzle had to be taken into account. The electric currents in stable jets were found to be linear in both the electric field and the flow rate Theoretical <b>operating</b> <b>diagrams</b> were developed based on the experimental insight that the instabilities are convective. The dependence of the stability borders on both the electric field and the flow rate is correctly reproduced by the Hohman-Brenner theory. This implies that <b>operating</b> <b>diagrams</b> have the potential to be used as predictive tools to better understand and control the process. The quantitative agreement between theory and experiments suggests that the fundamental process in electrospinning involves indeed a rapidly whipping jet, which is caused by the interaction of surface charges on the jet and the applied electric field. The notion of a whipping jet has also been extended to low viscosity fluids, where the jet disintegrates into fine droplets, i. e., electrospraying. For sufficiently large jet radii, experiments have verified the theoretical prediction that the dispersal of fluid results from the growth of a non-axisymmetric conducting mode along the jet, which subsequently breaks into droplets due to the axisymmetric conducting mode. by Y.

40|$|The {{atomization}} {{stage is}} essential in spray drying, because the droplet size distribution constituting the spray strongly influences the particle size distribution of the dried product, and then the powder characteristics. The aim of this work is to study {{the impact of the}} fluid viscosity on the spraying stage in the process of spray drying. We focus on the atomization by centrifugal pressure nozzle and work with model solution with controlled rheological properties. The rheological behavior is Newtonian and shear viscosity is changed from 1 to 70 mPa. s by the temperature or the concentration of Maltodextrin. A specific pilot of atomization allows to measure on-line the spraying pressure and the real flow rate of the solutions and to observe the spray. The first objective is to characterize the pressure/flow rate relationship for each product tested. The second objective is to show the feasibility of the use of pressure nozzle at medium pressure by using 4 hollow cone pressure nozzles. We observe that the viscosity of the solution impacts the pressure/flowrate relationship. While in the case of water, the relation between the pressure and the square of flowrate is linear as shown classically, this is no longer the case when the viscosity is higher. These results are represented in a non-dimensional space by plotting dimensionless pressure as a function of Reynolds number established at the nozzle grooves. This chart provides similar evolution for the four nozzle and different products. Moreover, by normalizing these curves, all results are superimposed on a single curve, which is an <b>operating</b> <b>diagram...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a near-linear complexity (geometric and meshless/algebraic) multigrid/multiresolution method for PDEs with rough (L^∞) coefficients with rigorous a-priori accuracy and performance estimates.

The resulting elementary gambles form a hierarchy of (deterministic) basis functions of H^ 1 _ 0 (Ω) (gamblets) that (1) are orthogonal across subscales/subbands with respect to the scalar product induced by the energy norm of the PDE (2) enable sparse compression of the solution space in H^ 1 _ 0 (Ω) (3) induce an orthogonal multiresolution operator decomposition. The <b>operating</b> <b>diagram</b> of the multigrid method is that of an inverted pyramid in which gamblets are computed locally (by virtue of their exponential decay), hierarchically (from fine to coarse scales) and the PDE is decomposed into a hierarchy of independent linear systems with uniformly bounded condition numbers. The resulting algorithm is parallelizable both in space (via localization) and in bandwith/subscale (subscales can be computed independently from each other). Although the method is deterministic it has a natural Bayesian interpretation under the measure of probability emerging (as a mixed strategy) from the information game formulation and multiresolution approximations form a martingale with respect to the filtration induced by the hierarchy of nested measurements.

40|$|Meso-scale {{structure}} is {{of critical importance}} to circulating fluidized bed (CFB) applications. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with consideration of meso-scale structures can help understand the structure-oriented coupling between flow, heat/mass transfer and reactions. This article is to review our recent progress on the so-called multiscale CFD (MSCFD), which characterizes the sub-grid meso-scale structure with stability criteria in addition to conservation equations. It is found that the mesh-independent solution of fine-grid two-fluid model (TFM) without sub-grid structures is inexact, {{in the sense that}} it overestimates the drag coefficient and fails to capture the characteristic S-shaped axial profile of voidage in a CFB riser. By comparison, MSCFD approach in terms of EMMS/matrix seems to reach a mesh-independent solution of the sub-grid structure, and succeeds in predicting the axial profile and flow regime transitions. Further application of MSCFD finds that neglect of geometric factors is one of the major reasons that cause disputes in understanding the flow regime transitions in a CFB. The <b>operating</b> <b>diagram</b> should, accordingly, include geometric factors besides commonly believed operating parameters for the intrinsic flow regime diagram. Recent extension of MSCFD to mass transfer finds that Reynolds number is insufficient for correlating the overall Sherwood number in a CFB. This is believed the main reason why the conventional correlations of Sherwood number scatter by several orders of magnitude. Certain jump change of state of motion around Reynolds number of 50 - 100 can be expected to clarify the abrupt decay of Sherwood number in both classical- and circulating-fluidized beds. Finally, we expect that the real-size, 3 -D, full-loop. time-dependent multiscale simulation of CFB is an emerging paradigm that will realize virtual experiment of CFBs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The specific experimental possibilities of a fast breeder reactor enable a wide scope of experiments in the field of fuel transmutation to be conducted. Significant knowledge will be gained from all these experiments during the remaining six operating cycles planned for the plant up to 2009, representing a total irradiation time of 720 EFPD equivalent to approximately 5. 5 years of operation. 39...|$|E
40|$|Aqueous {{zirconium}} fuel processing studies, {{directed at}} adapting the hydrofluoric acid process to continuous dissolution-complexing {{in order to}} increase the capacity of the ICPP process, resulted in two successful approaches to the complexing-feed adjustment step. Continuous in-line adjustment (conversion of uranium(IV) to uranium(VI) necessary for extraction) was accomplished in one minute or less at approximately 90 deg C; surges of dissolver product from the operating dissolver up to 1. 9 times the flow sheet rate did not inhibit the oxidation of the uranium at this temperature. Batchwise mixing in air of dissolver product solution with complexer solution oxidized the uranium within two minutes at 23 deg C or higher. Further studies of continuous zirconium dissolution indicated that precipitation of uranium at the acid inlet can be a problem, probably because of local concentration gradients of free HF, which result in conditions of low uranium solubility. Control of dissolver acid composition by electrical conductance measurement appeared possible due to the linear relationship of conductance with acid concentration. Aluminum alloy dissolution rates in nitric acid were found to vary significantly, depending on the type and amount of alloying agent. Silicon, nickel, and copper in the alloy significantly decreased the dissolution rate. Batch dissolution times for standard test coupons ranged from 14 minutes for a high purity aluminum to 1400 minutes for an alloy containing 2. 9 percent silicon. In the electrolytic dissolution of Nichrome in a bench-scale basket dissolver, the substitution of titanium for niobium as the anode basket material significantly reduced the contact resistance. Current interruption due to contact failure was essentially eliminated, and contact resistance on the titanium was sufficiently low that increasing solution resistance due to acid depletion became a major contributor to current decline as dissolution progressed. The indirect solution-contact electrolytic dissolution principle was further studied, producing data on electrode corrosion, power consumption, and gas generation on noble metal electrodes using both direct and alternating current. A second dual component analyzer, msking use of density-conductivity measurements on the dissolver effluent, was shown to give an accurate measure of the acid and dissolved metal concentrations. Chemicalirradiation tests of insulating materials for use in electrolytic dissolvers were completed. Alumina ceramic was the only material tested that showed little or no change at dose levels of 10 /sup 10 / r; plastic materials with varying degrees of resistance are reported. Studies on waste treatment methods indicated the successful application of either ion exchange resins or locally available soil material to the removal of low concentrations of Cs/sup 137 / and Sr/sup 90 / from ICPP fuel storage basin effluent. The workability of a meltfreeze process for separation of aluminum nitrate from fission products, aimed at a 200 -fold reduction in volume of ICPP generated wastes, was demonstrated in a singlestage laboratory unit. Pertinent solubility and density measurements were made and the <b>operating</b> <b>diagram</b> applicable to a multistage process is presented. Preliminary experiments on impregnation of calcined alumina with molten sulfur appeared to be favorable from the standpoints of leach resistance, particle immobilization, and heat transfer. Operation of the Demonstrational Waste Calcining Facility further confirmed the applicability of process control methods developed in pilot plant operations to the DWCF, and demonstrated that these methods provide an ample degree of control over processing conditions. With this assurance of operability of the unit, plans are being made for a run spiked with radioactive Na/sup 24 / as the next test. Key processing conditions, which were selected for this run, include operation at 400 deg C bed temperature, control to an amorphous bed, and return of the primary cyclone fines directly to storage with the bed product...|$|E
40|$|Viscous liquid {{jets and}} {{filaments}} {{are important in}} a number of industrial and domestic applications as well as in several natural processes. Application of an electric field is found to have a remarkable effect on the behaviour of these jets, mainly in controlling the propagation of instabilities and breakup dynamics. Such electrified jets have been exploited {{in a number of}} industrial applications such as electrospraying, electrospinning, electroseparations, ink-jet printing, etc. This thesis presents five theoretical and computational studies on different electrified viscous jet/filament systems. The first study is on electrospinning, a simple technique to generate polymeric nanofibers by taking advantage of distinctive flow instabilities in electrified jets of polymer solutions. This process, though easy to perform is quite complex to model mainly due to coupling of a number of physics together and the large number of dependent parameters. Here it is attempted to derive a relation between the final fiber diameter and the various process parameters. A scaling analysis of an approximate equation for the motion of a bent jet is performed and two new dimensionless numbers describing viscous moment and surface charge repulsion effects are identified. Experimental data {{for a wide range of}} polymer solutions are all shown to have a common slope, when expressed in terms of these new dimensionless ratios. Using this correlation between the dimensionless numbers, a new scaling expression is obtained for the final fiber diameter as a function of various process parameters. In the next study, stability of immersed viscous liquid threads subjected to radial or axial electric fields is investigated using linear stability analysis. Axisymmetric (m = 0) and asymmetric (m = 1) modes of perturbation are studied for arbitrary viscosity ratios. The viscosity ratio, in general, is shown to have a damping effect on the two modes of perturbations, and the effect is more pronounced for the m = 1 as compared to m = 0 perturbation. Investigating the effect of both the electric field and the viscosity ratio simultaneously, an <b>operating</b> <b>diagram</b> is generated, showing the predominance of the two modes at any given value of operating parameters. The above analysis is extended to understand the occurrence of the unique “pearling” stability on lipid bilayer cylindrical vesicles under electric field. It is shown that a certain critical axial electrical field needs to be applied to induce pearls on a bilayer vesicle. The maximum growth rate and the wavenumber of the pearling instability were found to in- crease with increasing electric field. While growth rate continues to increase, the maximum wavenumber reaches a steady value at higher electric fields. Like electric field, viscoelasticity induced by dissolved polymer molecules also plays a significant role in controlling the dynamics of breakup of jets and filaments. In the fourth study, capillary thinning of viscoelastic liquid bridges is investigated using an efficient hybrid method that combines a 1 -D slender-filament approximation for the full profile of a liquid bridge with a 0 -D stress balance to predict the temporal evolution of the filament “neck”. In addition, an advanced constitutive model for polymeric stresses is used to study the anomalous concentration dependence of break-up dynamics in polymer solutions that are nominally regarded as being dilute. The microstructural constitutive model incorporates changes in the friction coefficient of polymer molecules as they unravel, stretch and begin to experience significant intermolecular interactions in strong extensional flows due to a phenomenon known as “self-concentration”. The hybrid simulation technique is used with this new constitutive model to predict dynamics of liquid-bridge necking that compares well with experimental observations reported in the literature on dilute polymer solutions. In the last study, the importance of relaxation time and self-concentration on electrospinning of dilute polymer solutions is investigated by considering the steady region of an electrified jet of a polymer solution. It is shown that elastic stresses increase exponentially with Deborah number (De). For each concentration there exists a critical De below which the elastic stresses at the end of the steady jet region are insufficient to overcome capillary stresses and lead to an unstable jet in the whipping region. However, above the critical De, the elastic stresses may be sufficiently dominant to lead to more uniform fibers, thus pointing to the possibility of improved “electrospinnability” even with dilute polymer solutions. Also, it is suggested that self-concentration may play an important role in electrospinning of polymer solutions with higher relaxation time and high conductivity.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model of force balance {{was developed to}} describe the fluidization characteristics and predict the high-temperature defluidization behavior of iron powders. The calculation {{was focused on the}} evolution of the forces acting on particles with temperature based on the surface viscosity and bubble motion. The parameters in the model were obtained by a statistical regression method. Comparing with the experimental data, the simulated results of the defluidization temperature represented a good agreement. This model explained theoretically the dependence of defluidization behavior on the fluidizing gas velocity and gas properties. Accordingly, the stable fluidization and the defluidization regions were determined in the <b>operating</b> phase <b>diagram</b> of fluidization. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B. V.
