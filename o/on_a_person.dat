5|$|Chapter VI of Part II of the ISA confers {{additional}} powers on the Minister for Home Affairs {{to prevent}} subversion. If a written law confers power <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> body or authority to appoint people to positions, the Minister can order {{that he or}} she be provided with a list of the people from which the appointment will be made, and other information. The Minister can then direct that people whose appointment would be prejudicial to the interests of Singapore shall not be appointed or recruited. Furthermore, no person is permitted to disclose any communication received from the Minister except in the course of official duty.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} tear gas and other riot control agents have been {{produced}} with effects ranging from mild tearing of the eyes to immediate vomiting and prostration. CN and CS are {{the most widely used}} and known, but around 15 different types {{of tear gas}} have been developed worldwide e.g. adamsite or bromoacetone, CNB, and CNC. CS has become the most popular due to its strong effect. The effect of CS <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> will depend on whether it is packaged as a solution or used as an aerosol. The size of solution droplets {{and the size of the}} CS particulates after evaporation are factors determining its effect on the human body.|$|E
5|$|The Discourses are a {{collection}} of explanations and elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. Some {{of the most important}} topics treated are: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle of illusion), the nature of the ego, reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realization. His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E

The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both, and the disqualifications referred to above.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{flooding}} and gusty winds destroyed 204 houses along the southeast Texas coastline, {{most of which}} occurred in Matagorda County. In addition, the winds damaged 1,407 homes, with 144 of them being severely damaged. The wind also affected 147 businesses, of which 64 were either destroyed or severely damaged. Strong winds downed numerous power lines, leaving around 74,000 residents without power in the immediate aftermath. Overall, Claudette caused $180million (2003USD, $ USD) in damage in Texas and one death from a fallen tree during the storm. Also, the storm was indirectly responsible for a death when a tree fell <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> {{in the aftermath of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year {{he earned his}} second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At {{the time of his}} retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties). In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> by the United States government.|$|E

5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>person.</b> The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{live animals}} to {{represent}} the tribbles was immediately ruled out. According to Gerrold's account, {{the inspiration for the}} form of the tribble instead came from a fluffy keyring owned by Holly Sherman. Sherman's Planet in this episode was subsequently named after her. The design came from Wah Chang, but they were individually sewn by Jacqueline Cumer√©. She was paid $350 to sew five hundred tribbles from synthetic fur and stuff them with foam rubber. Six ambulatory tribbles were made using the mechanisms of walking toy dogs, which were quite noisy and required the dialogue to be looped in during editing. Other tribbles were created by Jim Rugg out of beanbags for when it was required for one to sit <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> or object, and the breathing tribbles were hollow with surgical balloons inserted. Some of these tribbles were later displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. in 1992. The sale at Christie's auction house in 2006 included tribbles from this episode {{as part of a larger}} Star Trek sale. Because of the synthetic fur technology of the 1960s, relatively few original tribbles exist as of 2010 because the fur fell out over time and they went bald. An original tribble was sold at auction in 2003 for $1,000.|$|E
