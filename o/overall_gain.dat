[...] Staggered tuning allows the bandwidth to be widened at the expense of <b>overall</b> <b>gain.</b> [...] The <b>overall</b> <b>gain</b> is reduced because when any one stage is at resonance (and thus maximum gain) the others are not, unlike synchronous tuning where all stages are at maximum gain at the same frequency.

2500|$|Negative {{feedback}} {{feeds the}} difference of the input {{and part of the}} output back to the input in a way that cancels out part of the input. The main effect is to reduce the <b>overall</b> <b>gain</b> of the system. However, the unwanted signals introduced by the amplifier are also fed back. [...] Since they {{are not part of the}} original input, they are added to the input in opposite phase, subtracting them from the input. In this way, negative feedback acts as a technique to reduce errors (at the expense of gain). Large amounts of negative feedback can reduce errors to the point that the response of the amplifier itself becomes almost irrelevant as long as it has a large gain, and the output performance of the system (the [...] "closed loop performance") is defined entirely by the components in the feedback loop.|$|E
2500|$|If {{predictable}} {{operation is}} desired, negative feedback is used, by applying {{a portion of}} the output voltage to the inverting input. The closed-loop feedback greatly reduces the gain of the circuit. [...] When negative feedback is used, the circuit's <b>overall</b> <b>gain</b> and response becomes determined mostly by the feedback network, rather than by the op-amp characteristics. If the feedback network is made of components with values small relative to the op amp's input impedance, the value of the op-amp's open-loop response AOL does not seriously affect the circuit's performance. The response of the op-amp circuit with its input, output, and feedback circuits to an input is characterized mathematically by a transfer function; designing an op-amp circuit to have a desired transfer function is in the realm of electrical engineering. [...] The transfer functions are important in most applications of op-amps, such as in analog computers. High input impedance at the input terminals and low output impedance at the output terminal(s) are particularly useful features of an op-amp.|$|E
