5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, media {{coverage}} of the game focused on Auburn's exclusion from the national championship game, a controversial point for Auburn fans and other <b>observers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{weeks leading up}} to the game. In addition, both teams boasted high-ranked defenses that had performed well during the year. Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom were considered among the best players at their position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall performed well for the Hokies during the regular season and was predicted to continue his success in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was {{reactivated}} in 1986 at Fort Drum, New York, {{as part of}} {{the third}} Light Infantry Division in the new Army of Excellence force structure. The 1st Brigade consisted of three organic battalions: 1–32nd Infantry, 1–87th Infantry, and 2–22nd Infantry. For exercises and operational employment, the brigade formed the core of TF Warrior, receiving attachments that habitually included 3–6th Field Artillery, 10th Forward Support Battalion, A/3-62nd Air Defense Artillery, A/41st Engineer, A/110th Military Intelligence, A/10th Signal Battalion, and 1st PLT/10th Military Police Company. After its activation, the brigade participated in numerous exercises, including Honduras, Panama, the National Training Center (Fort Irwin, CA), the Joint Readiness Training Center (Fort Polk, LA), REFORGER 88 and 90, and operational deployments to the Multinational Force and <b>Observers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sinai.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a red}} marble step to the chancel end of the {{crossing}}. The crossing has a chamfered north east angle for a tower stair, with a door at the foot. Two small windows {{light the}} staircase to the ringing chamber. There is a complex oak roof in nine panels with heavy beams and pendant bosses. The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows <b>observers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bell ringing chamber to view the crossing. The massive arches, supporting the equally monumental tower, is apparently early thirteenth century.|$|E
50|$|For instance, {{if there}} is a coin flip that on heads will create one observer, while on tails it will create two, then we have two {{possible}} worlds, the first with one observer, the second with two. These worlds are equally probable, hence the SSA probability of being the first (and only) <b>observer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heads world is 1/2, that of being <b>the</b> first <b>observer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tails world is 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4, and the probability of being <b>the</b> second <b>observer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tails world is also 1/4.|$|R

5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to <b>observers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E

25|$|Another {{part of the}} 2007 {{electoral reform}} {{was that it was}} now {{possible}} to accommodate election <b>observers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> election process.

25|$|In 2002 the National Rainbow Coalition won {{political}} control of Kenya, {{but the country}} remained politically unstable.

The reserve brigades were forced back through the green line to the black line, which the British artillery-observers could still see and the German counter-attack was stopped by massed artillery and small-arms fire.|$|E

25|$|The major {{products}} of volcanic processes on the Moon are evident to Earth-bound <b>observers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{form of the}} lunar maria. These are large flows of basaltic lava that correspond to low-albedo surfaces covering {{nearly a third of}} the near side. Only a few percent of the farside has been affected by mare volcanism. Even before the Apollo missions confirmed it, most scientists already thought that the maria are lava-filled plains, because they have lava flow patterns and collapses attributed to lava tubes.|$|E
25|$|Reuters {{reported}} that intensive battles were {{still going on}} in Salheddine and that neither the rebels or the government were in control. According to an NBC News report, the rebels acquired nearly two dozen surface-to-air missiles, which were delivered to them via neighbouring Turkey. However, a rebel FSA spokesman denied the report.

25|$|Any {{event that}} changes the number of <b>observers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{universe}} may have experimental consequences. Quantum tunnelling to a new vacuum state would {{reduce the number of}} observers to zero (i.e., kill all life). Some cosmologists argue that the universe is in a false vacuum state and that consequently the universe should have already experienced quantum tunnelling to a true vacuum state. This has not happened and is cited as evidence in favor of many-worlds. In some worlds, quantum tunnelling to a true vacuum state has happened but most other worlds escape this tunneling and remain viable. This {{can be thought of as}} a variation on quantum suicide.|$|E
