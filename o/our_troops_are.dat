500|$|The Serbs retook Rašulijača at noon, and the 1st Combined Division {{exploited}} this {{to advance}} towards Lešnica. Meanwhile, the 1st Morava Division attacked Iverak {{and managed to}} drive the Austro-Hungarians back. The village of Velika Glava fell to the Serbs before mid-day, and by the late afternoon the Rajin Grob ridge had been retaken. At around this time, the Austro-Hungarians began retreating with increasing rapidity, their will and cohesion apparently shattered. The 3rd Army had similar success, routing the 36th Infantry Division and forcing it to retreat in considerable disorder. The Serbs then moved to pursue the fleeing Austro-Hungarians all along the front. By 20 August, Austro-Hungarian forces were fleeing across the Drina River, still being pursued by the Serbs back into Bosnia, with the entire 5th Army being forced across the Austro-Hungarian side of the river. Many Austro-Hungarian soldiers drowned in the water as they fled in panic. Serbian military reports announced that [...] "the enemy is withdrawing in the greatest disorder." [...] Putnik then notified King Peter in a telegram, saying [...] "the main enemy has been defeated in Jadar and on Mount Cer, and <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> in hot pursuit." [...] Upon their triumph at Cer Mountain, the Serbs sought to recapture the heavily fortified town of Šabac. Violent clashes occurred on 21 and 22 August, during which Serb forces fought {{their way to the}} western approaches of the town. By 23 August, the Serbs had encircled the town and that evening they brought up their siege artillery. On 24 August, Serbian forces entered Šabac and discovered that the Austro-Hungarians had decamped the previous night. By 16:00, the Serbs reached the banks of the Sava River, bringing the first Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia to an end.|$|E
2500|$|After some time, Shouchun {{gradually}} ran low on {{supplies and}} became increasingly {{isolated from the}} outside world. Two of Zhuge Dan's close aides, Jiang Ban (蔣班) and Jiao Yi (焦彝), told their general: [...] "Zhu Yi came with a large army but failed to achieve anything. Sun Chen executed Zhu Yi and returned to Jiangdong. He is actually putting on a front when he sent troops to help us. His decision to turn back already shows that he is adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Now, since <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> still high on morale and eager to fight, we should focus all efforts on breaking {{one side of the}} siege. Even if we cannot drive back the enemy, we can at least allow some of our forces to escape and survive." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 11 April Nelson had {{assembled}} the batteries on the heights overlooking the town. Hood then {{sent a message}} to Lacombe-Saint-Michel, advising him of the British positions and inviting him to surrender. The French commander simply responded [...] "I have hot shot for your ships and bayonets for your troops. When two thirds of <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> killed, I will then trust to the generosity of the English". His approach rebuffed, Hood ordered Nelson to open a heavy fire on the town's defences; the ensuing fire and counterfire between the British and French batteries has been described as [...] "immense". Hood also ordered the 24-gun sixth rate HMS Proselyte, a small ship captured from the French at the Siege of Toulon and armed with 12-pounder cannon, to enter the harbour under Captain Walter Serocold and bombard the seaward defences. Serocold's ship shifted at anchor however and became exposed to heated shot from the town's batteries. A number of red-hot cannonballs lodged in the ship's stores and a fire started that rapidly blazed out of control. Serocold continued his fire on the town while calling for help from the fleet, managing to evacuate Proselyte into ship's boats and escape the harbour before the ship was entirely consumed by the flames.|$|E

2500|$|In late May 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee held {{nomination}} {{hearings for}} Petraeus and Lieutenant General Ray Odierno to lead United States Central Command and Multi-National Force-Iraq, respectively. During the hearings, Committee Chairman Carl Levin praised these two men, stating that [...] "we owe Gen. Petraeus and Gen. Odierno {{a debt of}} gratitude for the commitment, determination and strength that they brought to their areas of responsibility. And regardless of how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide." [...] During his opening statement, Petraeus discussed four principles that would guide his efforts if confirmed as CENTCOM Commander: seeking to strengthen international partnerships; taking a [...] "whole of government" [...] approach; pursuing comprehensive efforts and solutions; and, finally, both supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and ensuring readiness for possible contingency operations in the future. Petraeus also noted that during the week before his testimony, the number of security incidents in Iraq was the lowest in over four years. After Petraeus's return to Baghdad, and despite the continued drawdown of surge forces as well as recent Iraqi-led operations in places like Basrah, Mosul, and Baghdad, the number of security incidents in Iraq remained at their lowest level in over four years.|$|E
2500|$|O'Donnell {{condemned}} {{many of the}} Bush administration's policies, {{especially the}} war in Iraq and the resulting occupation. She also questioned the official explanation {{for the destruction of}} the World Trade Center, and stating in one episode, [...] "I do believe that it's {{the first time in history}} that fire has ever melted steel". She consistently mentioned recent military deaths and news about the war, and criticized the U.S. media for its lack of attention to these issues compared to media coverage throughout the world. This led to a series of heated exchanges with co-host Hasselbeck, as well as [...] "the most-discussed moment of her professional life." [...] On May 17, 2007, O'Donnell rhetorically asked, [...] "655,000 Iraqi civilians dead. Who are the terrorists? ... if you were in Iraq and another country, the United States, the richest in the world, invaded your country and killed 655,000 of your citizens, what would you call us?" [...] Conservative commentators criticized O'Donnell's statements, saying that she was comparing American soldiers to terrorists. On May 23, 2007, a heated discussion ensued, in part, because of what O'Donnell perceived as Elisabeth Hasselbeck's unwillingness to defend O'Donnell from the criticisms; O'Donnell asked Hasselbeck, [...] "Do you believe I think <b>our</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> terrorists?" [...] Hasselbeck answered in the negative but also stated [...] "Defend your own insinuations." [...] O'Donnell was hurt and felt Hasselbeck had betrayed her friendship: [...] "there's something about somebody being different on TV toward you than they are in the dressing room. It didn't really ring true for me." [...] O'Donnell stated that Republican pundits were mischaracterising her statements and the right-wing media would portray her as a bully, attacking [...] "innocent pure Christian Elisabeth" [...] whenever they disagreed. O'Donnell decided to leave the show that day, but afterwards stated that the reason was not the argument itself, but rather the fact that she saw on the studio monitor that the camera had shown a split screen, with her and Hasselbeck on either side. O'Donnell felt that the show's director and producer [...] "had to prepare that in advance [...] I felt there was setup egging me into that position. The executive producer and I did not gel." [...] O'Donnell and ABC agreed to cut short her contract agreement on May 25, 2007. ABC News reported that her arguments with Hasselbeck brought the show its best ratings ever.|$|E

Then a great stockade on a hill near the river, three miles from Rangoon--which our people thought could not be taken, so strongly was it protected--was attacked.

60|$|Our cavalry {{had gone}} farther south {{by the way}} of Prince Edward's Court House, along with the 5th corps (Griffin's), Ord falling in between Griffin and the Appomattox.

These troops retreated to {{the north side of the}} Appomattox to join Lee, and succeeded in destroying the bridge after them. Considerable fighting ensued there between Wright's corps and a portion of our cavalry and the Confederates, but finally the cavalry forded the stream and drove them away. Wright built a foot-bridge for his men to march over on and then marched out to the junction of the roads to relieve Humphreys, arriving there that night.
