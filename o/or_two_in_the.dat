In spring, returning birds pass through Mongolia {{from the end of}} March and south easternmost Russia in April and May, reaching their breeding grounds in May, perhaps as late as June in the far north.|$|E
5|$|Often, all the mayflies in a {{population}} mature at once (a hatch), and for a day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity {{seems to be an}} important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. Baetis intercalaris, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces the individual's risk of being eaten. The lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only vestigial (unusable) mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. Dolania americana has the shortest lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, KGO-TV {{produced}} weekday talk/variety {{shows in}} the 9:00 to 10:00a.m. timeslot following Good Morning America. A.M. San Francisco ran from 1975 to 1987/1988, when it was replaced by Good Morning, Bay Area, hosted by Susan Sikora. Hosts of A.M. San Francisco included the husband-and-wife team of Fred LaCosse and Terry Lowry (other ABC owned-and-operated stations produced their own A.M. programs in the 1980s; for example, A.M. Chicago at WLS-TV evolved into The Oprah Winfrey Show, and Live with Kelly and Ryan evolved from a similar A.M. program on WABC).

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Channel V Australia, he recalled {{that the two of}} them were able to communicate their thoughts about the tracks they developed, [...] "on an organisational level", thus accelerating the process. Madonna was completely involved in the recording which was a surprise for Solveig, since he had expected the singer not to stay more than an hour <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recording studio and then leave. Madonna expressed her thoughts about the composition, including the instrumentation to be used as Solveig added, [...] "at some point she wanted to choose the sound of a snare drum or a synth and that kind of stuff. She was really in the session!" [...] Madonna reciprocated the feelings saying that she liked Solveig's way of working: [...] "He's very organised and methodical in his thinking so I like his work process". The singer also stated that she was able to disapprove something which she did not like without hurting his feelings.|$|E

2500|$|Singing without drums is {{extremely}} rare and considered inappropriate (Nettl, 1989). The drum accompaniment to songs is rhythmically independent to the singing but in perfect unison, [...] "slightly off the beat", and [...] "often related roughly by {{the proportion of}} 2:3", to the vocal pulse or beat level (though see Pantaleoni, 1987). Another change in Blackfoot music is increased relatedness of the drum part to the song now than in the past. Often drumming over repeated sections that comprise a song begins with players softly striking {{the rim of the}} bass drum. The tempo increases as the drumming moves further {{to the center of the}} drum skin. At some point [...] "hard beats", loud strokes off the rhythm by an individual, sometimes the leader, and beats may be omitted. Drumming may pause for a phrase <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last stanza of the last repetition and finish loudly. When playing the stick game, players drum upon a plank, and the drumming is more likely to coincide with vocal beats, but less accurate unison playing. Rattles are no longer used.
