30|$|With {{increasing}} degree <b>of</b> <b>melting,</b> χ, the Cl/F {{ratio in}} the final <b>melt</b> increases independently <b>of</b> {{the composition of the}} slab fluid (Figure  4). This ratio also increases with increasingly Cl-rich metasomatic fluids. Therefore, both the fluid composition and degree <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> are the major variables controlling the melt Cl/F values. The increasing degree <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> has more effect on the Cl/F ratio than α, the rate <b>of</b> fluid-induced <b>melting</b> (Figure  4). For example, at constant degree <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> (20 %), the Cl/F ratio <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> increases by a factor of 1.3 (from 5.2 to 6.7) as the melt H 2 O content varies from 2.6 to 5.9  wt.%. In comparison, for α = 0.059, Cl/F increases by factor of 6.4 (from 1.0 to 6.7) from 1 % to 20 % degree <b>of</b> <b>melting.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{advantage}} {{of establishing a}} thermodynamic model is that the degree <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> can be calculated at a certain P-T in a multi-component system. The seismic observations suggested a degree <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> <[*] 5 – 30 % in ultra-low velocity zones {{at the base of}} the lower mantle (Williams and Garnero 1996). The estimation of the degree <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> depends on the wetting property and the elastic properties of the melt; conversely, these properties depend on the compositions of the melt; thus, they depend on the degree <b>of</b> <b>melting.</b> The degree <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> is also an important parameter in understanding the chemical differentiation during magma ocean crystallization. The melt-solid separation by rheological transition occurs at a crystal fraction of approximately 60 % (e.g., Abe 1995). Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the phase relations together with the knowledge of the degree <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> at relevant pressures and temperatures. However, there are some difficulties in obtaining the degree <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> by high-pressure melting experiments under thermal gradients because the observed degree <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> arises from the thermal gradients, not from the phase equilibrium.|$|R

Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands <b>of</b> <b>melted</b> nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on atomization <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> has been reviewed. Models {{have been developed}} and applied to analyze the phenomena associated with centrifugal atomization <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> using rotating disk method. Some suggestions and guidelines for the development and operation of a centrifugal atomizer have been given. Previous experiments <b>of</b> <b>melt</b> atomization and present observations of water disintegration {{at the edge of}} a rotating disk have confirmed that the disintegration <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> or water occurs in one of three basic modes: direct droplet formation (DDF), ligament formation (LF) and film formation (FF). Wave theories have been used to analyze the disintegration <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> in the different regimes. The equations for the fastest growing wave number have been derived. Models for the calculation of powder particle sizes have been suggested and the calculated results have compared with available experimental data in the literature. Calculations have shown that disk diameter and disk rotating speed are two very important atomizing parameters. The type <b>of</b> <b>melt</b> and melt superheat also affect the powder particles size. In general, fine powder particles can be obtained by increasing disk rotating speed and using large diameter disk, provided that the melt does not solidify on the disk. In the DDF regime waves forming at the periphery of a disk are responsible for the break up <b>of</b> <b>melts.</b> The fastest growing wave number depends on the disk speed, disk diameter and properties <b>of</b> <b>melt.</b> In the FF regime sheet wave theory of Dombrowski and Johns was used to study the collapse <b>of</b> the <b>melt</b> sheet. The fastest growing wave number is a complex function of the speed and thickness of film and the properties <b>of</b> <b>melt</b> and atomizer atmosphere. The effects of disk diameter, disk rotating speed and melt flow rate on atomization are achieved through influencing the speed and thickness of film. The studies on the flow <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> on rotating disks have shown that the film forming on the disk was very thin, about tens of microns and the tangential velocity <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> was much higher than the radial velocity. The analysis of heat transfer <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> on a rotating disk has shown that partial solidification <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> on the disk is possible. To obtain a good atomization condition it is necessary to control the partial freezing <b>of</b> <b>melts</b> on the disk. A large melt superheat and a high melt flow rate are required to prevent melts from freezing on the disk. The use of a small diameter disk can also avoid freezing <b>of</b> the <b>melt</b> on the disk. Combining the calculations of heat transfer on the disk with the prediction of wave theory for particle sizes, it is shown that a disk of small diameter rotating at high speed is desirable for the production of fine powders. The cooling ability obtained by centrifugal atomization using the rotating disk method depends on the design of atomizer, the operating conditions and the type of material to be atomized. A large diameter disk on which solidification <b>of</b> <b>melt</b> is avoided and a high disk rotating speed result to the formation of fine powder particles which experience a high cooling rate. The nucleation undercooling <b>of</b> <b>melt</b> depends on particle size, disk speed, material to be atomized and the nucleation condition. A small particle size and a high disk speed lead to a large undercooling. The times for the completion of solidification of powder particle of typical sizes produced by centrifugal atomization have been calculated and their effects on the atomizer vessel diameter have been discussed...|$|R

Despite the availability of enormous amounts of experimental data, no generally applicable methods have been developed to estimate the <b>melting</b> point <b>of</b> a compound from its chemical structure. A quick estimation <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> point can be a useful tool in the design of new chemical entities. In this dissertation, a simple means <b>of</b> estimating the <b>melting</b> points for a large variety of pharmaceutically and environmentally relevant organic compounds is developed. Melting points are predicted from the separate calculation of the enthalpy and entropy <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> directly from the chemical structure.
