50|$|Regardless of {{the sound}} format, any sound {{represented}} on the film image itself {{will not be the}} sound for the particular frame it occupies. In the gate of the projector head, there is no space for a reader, and the film is not travelling smoothly at the gate position. Consequently, all optical sound formats must be offset from the image because the sound reader is usually located above (for magnetic readers and most digital <b>optical</b> <b>readers)</b> or below (for analog <b>optical</b> <b>readers</b> and a few digital optical) the projector head.|$|R
50|$|Optical RFID (aka OPID) is an {{alternative}} to RFID {{that is based on}} <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Applications for <b>optical</b> RFID tags may be found in future supply chain scenarios.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{prototype}} of an open source, <b>optical</b> fingerprint <b>reader,</b> called RaspiReader, using ubiquitous components. RaspiReader, a low-cost and easy to assemble reader, provides the fingerprint research community a seamless and simple method for gaining {{more control over the}} sensing component of fingerprint recognition systems. In particular, we posit that this versatile fingerprint reader will encourage researchers to explore novel spoof detection methods that integrate both hardware and software. RaspiReader's hardware is customized with two cameras for fingerprint acquisition with one camera providing high contrast, frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) images, and the other camera outputting direct images. Using both of these image streams, we extract complementary information which, when fused together, results in highly discriminative features for fingerprint spoof (presentation attack) detection. Our experimental results demonstrate a marked improvement over previous spoof detection methods which rely only on FTIR images provided by COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Finally, fingerprint matching experiments between images acquired from the FTIR output of the RaspiReader and images acquired from a COTS fingerprint reader verify the interoperability of the RaspiReader with existing COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

50|$|A barcode is {{a series}} of {{alternating}} dark and light stripes that are read by an optical scanner. The organization and width of the lines is determined by the bar code protocol selected. There are many different protocols, such as the prevalent Code 39. Sometimes the digits represented by the dark and light bars are also printed to allow people to read the number without an <b>optical</b> <b>reader.</b>|$|E

40|$|Optical {{forms that}} contain multiple-choice answers {{are widely used}} both for electing {{students}} and evaluating student achievements in education systems in our country and worldwide. Optical forms are evaluated by employing optical mark recognition techniques through <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> High cost of these machines, limited access to them, long waiting time for evaluation results make the process hard for educationists working in cities or countries. In this study, a mobile application was developed for the educationists who own mobile phones or tablets {{for the purpose of}} evaluating students' answer sheets quickly and independent of location and <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> <b>Optical</b> form recognition, reading and evaluation processes are done on the image of student's answer sheet that is taken with the mobile phone or tablet of educationist.

The older permit is also machine readable, which facilitates entry into Mainland China at any manned immigration checkpoint or through self-service immigration gates (currently available at Hong Kong-Shenzhen, Macau-Zhuhai crossings, Beijing West Railway Station, and international airports throughout Mainland China). These gates scan the permits with an <b>optical</b> <b>reader</b> and use the software to verify one's biometric informations, such as thumb prints and facial scans, with the database. After the inspection is completed, the person is released.|$|E
40|$|We {{open source}} an easy to assemble, spoof resistant, high resolution, <b>optical</b> {{fingerprint}} <b>reader,</b> called RaspiReader, using ubiquitous components. By using our open source STL files and software, RaspiReader {{can be built}} in under one hour for only US $ 175. As such, RaspiReader provides the fingerprint research community a seamless and simple method for quickly prototyping new ideas involving fingerprint reader hardware. In particular, we posit that this open source fingerprint reader will facilitate the exploration of novel fingerprint spoof detection techniques involving both hardware and software. We demonstrate one such spoof detection technique by specially customizing RaspiReader with two cameras for fingerprint image acquisition. One camera provides high contrast, frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) fingerprint images, and the other outputs direct images of the finger {{in contact with the}} platen. Using both of these image streams, we extract complementary information which, when fused together and used for spoof detection, results in marked performance improvement over previous methods relying only on grayscale FTIR images provided by COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Finally, fingerprint matching experiments between images acquired from the FTIR output of RaspiReader and images acquired from a COTS reader verify the interoperability of the RaspiReader with existing COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Comment: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1708. 0788...|$|R

50|$|During {{this period}} Canada Post applied {{computer}} readable codes {{to speed the}} delivery of mail. On 1 April 1971 the postal code system was introduced. The technique involved {{the use of a}} six-character geographic code placed on the envelope or parcel by the sender. The code was in turn machine scanned by a computer-driven <b>optical</b> <b>reader</b> that signaled the sorting equipment to direct the item to the proper destination. While technically effective, the introduction of the system lead to serious labour trouble at Canada Post for several years by unionized workers who were afraid of pay cuts or job loss (Postal codes in Canada).|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of using barcode technology {{is that it}} is cheap and easy to generate the credential and it can easily be applied to cards or other items. However the same affordability and simplicity makes the technology susceptible to fraud, because fake barcodes can also be created cheaply and easily, for example by photocopying real ones. One attempt to reduce fraud is to print the barcode using carbon-based ink, and then cover the bar code with a dark red overlay. The barcode can then be read with an <b>optical</b> <b>reader</b> tuned to the infrared spectrum, but can not easily be copied by a copy machine. This does not address the ease with which barcode numbers can be generated from a computer using almost any printer.|$|E

50|$|Some {{influential}} figures {{had doubts}} about his proposed design for the decryption machine, and Flowers proceeded with the project while partly funding it himself. Like the later ENIAC of 1946, Colossus {{did not have a}} stored program, and was programmed through plugboards and jumper cables. It was faster, more reliable and more capable than the Robinsons, so speeding up the process of finding the Lorenz χ pin wheel settings. Since Colossus generated the putative keys electronically, it only had to read one tape. It did so with an <b>optical</b> <b>reader</b> which, at 5000 characters per second, was driven much faster than the Robinsons' and meant that the tape travelled at almost 30 miles per hour (48 km/h). This, and the clocking of the electronics from the optically read paper tape sprocket holes, completely eliminated the Robinsons' synchronisation problems. Bletchley Park management, which had been sceptical of Flowers's ability to make a workable device, immediately began pressuring him to construct another. After the end of the war, Colossus machines were dismantled on the orders of Winston Churchill, but GCHQ retained two of them.|$|E
40|$|As the {{prevalence}} of febrile illnesses continues to increase, {{there is a growing}} need for reliable, low-cost means of diagnosing these diseases. To address this, a highly sensitive point-of-care fluorescence lateral flow immunoassay is being developed to diagnose dengue in its earliest stages. Through use of different fluorescent labels, multiplexed test strips will eventually be created to test for several diseases simultaneously. To quantify the resulting signals produced by the assay, a corresponding <b>optical</b> <b>reader</b> was designed, built, and tested in accordance with design thinking principles. The effectiveness of the design was verified through usability testing. The reader works in conjunction with software run on any internet-enabled device to take an image of a test strip and analyze the signal levels by comparing them to predetermined calibration curves. Through use of the fluorescence lateral flow immunoassay and corresponding <b>optical</b> <b>reader,</b> users in resource-limited settings can diagnose dengue rapidly and accurately. 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|E
