5|$|After {{playing their}} {{previous}} game at Birmingham's Lakeview Park, {{the city of}} Montgomery gave Alabama and the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Alabama (now known as Auburn University) $500 to play each other at Riverside Park. In the second edition <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> since {{become known as the}} Iron Bowl, Auburn won 40–16. Auburn scored first when Rufus Dorsey scored on a 10-yard touchdown run and kicked the extra point for a 6–0 lead. Alabama responded on their next possession when John Burgett scored on a 35-yard touchdown run. However G. H. Kyser missed the extra point and Auburn still held a 6–4 lead. Auburn then extended their lead to 18–4 at halftime after a pair of touchdown from J. C. Dunham.|$|E

5|$|Female {{sexuality}} {{is often not}} adequately represented in texts and documents.

Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E

Kenneth cannot bring himself to ask Jennifer out, so Tracy (Tracy Morgan) decides to help him.

Jennifer {{believes}} Kenneth is black, but Kenneth reveals he is white and expresses his feeling for her, and admits to her that Tracy was doing all the talking. Jennifer tells him she does not mind <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened. However, after feeling Kenneth's face and comparing it to her own, she leaves, horrified at his appearance.|$|E

His wife and daughter know nothing <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> befallen him and struggle to live in the city. The daughter gets a position in a sweatshop, and her eyesight deteriorates until she is unable to work anymore. Now blind, she resorts to playing the violin for money while her mother becomes a beggar.|$|E

NATO also committed itself to extend further membership invitations in the upcoming 2008 Bucharest Summit. This summit was the first NATO summit held on territory of a former USSR republic.|$|E
5|$|Wild Guns {{received}} positive reviews at {{its initial}} release, and in retrospective reviews {{is considered a}} cult classic. Critics have praised the gameplay <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> become a niche genre, {{as well as the}} cooperative mode and graphical attention to detail. The game was re-released on the Virtual Console for the Wii in 2010 and Wii U in 2014. An enhanced remaster titled Wild Guns: Reloaded was released in 2016 for PlayStation 4, featuring classic gameplay with enhancements such as additional characters and stages. A Microsoft Windows version was released in 2017.|$|E
5|$|During {{the repair}} efforts, Yar becomes close to Castillo, but is unnerved by tense {{interactions}} with Guinan. Guinan reveals to Yar {{that she knows}} Yar dies a meaningless death in the other timeline, and that the two should never have met. Based on her discussion with Guinan, Yar requests a transfer to the Enterprise-C, which is granted by Picard. As the Enterprise-C prepares to return through the anomaly, three Klingon battlecruisers attack. With the anomaly becoming unstable, Picard orders the Enterprise-D to cover the Enterprise-C's withdrawal. The Enterprise-D suffers major crew losses under the Klingon barrage, including the death of Commander Riker, forcing Picard to man the tactical station himself. With the Enterprise-D {{on the brink of}} destruction, the Enterprise-C traverses the anomaly, triggering the return of Enterprise-D's original timeline. In the restored timeline, Guinan– the only one subtly aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> transpired– asks Geordi La Forge to tell her more about Yar.|$|E

5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win}} the stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
5|$|In the {{rebuttal}} phases, {{a witness}} or a rival character provides their idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened. The player {{is able to}} press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying. By doing this, the player gets closer to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases. Upon solving a case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth. If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E
5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> befallen us. It is not {{on things}} of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

Setting up barricades and making improvised weapons, they battle the zombies, but Menard is killed. The patients reanimate inside the hospital, killing the staff, as the zombies breach the defences. Peter, Anne, and Brian escape as the hospital is consumed by fire. Brian is attacked by a zombified Susan, whom Peter shoots before the three {{make it back to}} the boat and leave the island. At sea, Brian dies. Anne and Peter lock his body in a cabin as proof <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened on Matul.

Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> {{happened}} to the other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are dreading. Avery makes the choice {{to take a job}} offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his surgical internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out.
