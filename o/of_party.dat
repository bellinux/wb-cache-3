50|$|The {{effective}} number <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> is {{a concept}} introduced by Laakso and Taagepera (1979) which provides for an adjusted number <b>of</b> political <b>parties</b> in a country's party system. The idea behind this measure is to count parties and, at the same time, to weight the count by their relative strength. The relative strength refers to their vote share ("effective number of electoral parties") or seat share in the parliament ("effective number of parliamentary parties"). This measure is especially useful when comparing electoral systems across countries, as {{is done in the}} field of political science. The number <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> equals the effective number <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> only when all parties have equal strength. In any other case, the effective number <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> is lower than the actual number <b>of</b> <b>parties.</b> The effective number <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> is a frequent operationalization for the fragmentation <b>of</b> a <b>party</b> system.|$|R

The aim of the thesis is to analyze this procedural institute and to point out imperfections of current legislation related to substitution <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> in civil proceedings. The thesis {{is divided into three}} basic sections, the first section focuses on theoretical fundamentals and basic concepts, the second section focuses {{on the history of the}} regulation relating to substitution <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> in civil proceedings, including the professional public discussion on the topic <b>of</b> substitution <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> in civil proceedings, which was published in legal literature prior to the amendment to the Civil Procedure Act No. 30 / 2000 Sb. The last section is focused on current legislation <b>of</b> substitution <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> in civil proceedings, particularly on the evaluation of current legislation <b>of</b> substitution <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> in civil proceedings and consideration of the proposals according to intended law. Substitution <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> in civil proceedings is divided into the substitution if the claim is not extinguished (if a party dies and the claim is not extinguished), i. e. the universal succession, and into transfer of interest (if an interest is transferred), i. e. the singular succession.

5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the party discipline inspection system mirrors that of the MOS, with the CCDI responsible for cases involving breaches <b>of</b> <b>party</b> discipline and state law by party members. Like the MOS, the CCDI lacks judicial authority and is limited to investigating allegations of corruption and breaches <b>of</b> <b>party</b> discipline. Since the CCDI {{does not have the}} power to prosecute, it is supposed to transfer cases (after investigation) to the Supreme People's Procuratorate or the Supreme People's Court. Despite this, its formal jurisdiction is loosely defined. The CDI's ability to begin investigations and administer party sanctions has often led to the slow transfer (or sometimes no transfer) of cases to the Supreme People's Procuratorate.|$|E

5|$|A {{major focus}} for Kenyatta {{during the first}} {{three and a half years}} of Kenya's {{independence}} were the divisions within KANU itself. Opposition to Kenyatta's government grew, particularly following the assassination of Pio Pinto in February 1965. Relations between Kenyatta and Odinga were strained, and at the March 1966 party conference, Odinga's post—that <b>of</b> <b>party</b> Vice President, was divided among eight different politicians. In 1966, Odinga stepped down as state Vice President, claiming that Kenya had failed to achieve economic independence and needed to adopt truly socialist policies. Backed by several other senior KANU figures and trade unionists, he formed the Kenya Peoples Union (KPU). The KPU were legally recognised as the official opposition, thus restoring the country's two party system.|$|E
40|$|Persistence of Procedural Relationship <b>of</b> <b>Parties</b> in Civil Proceedings The thesis {{deals with}} the {{procedural}} relationship in adversarial civil proceedings. The aim of the thesis is to define the persistence of procedural relationship as a characteristic of civil proceedings, {{as one of the}} fundamental principles of civil proceedings, and to analyze exceptions to this principle. The thesis is divided into two sections. The first one focuses on changes <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> in procedural relationship, while the latter one focuses on changes in procedural relationship attributable related to the court. The thesis aims to comprehensively address the procedural relationship <b>of</b> <b>parties,</b> thus it includes a section referring to changes of procedural relationship related to the court. The thesis primarily focuses on changes of procedural relationship relating to the parties, such as joinder <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> and substitution <b>of</b> <b>parties.</b> Since the general rule refers to the persistence of procedural relationship, derived from the rights <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> to a judgement on the merits, it is necessary to save the procedural rights <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> should any exception to this general rule apply.

5|$|After {{narrowly}} surviving {{a vote of}} {{no confidence}} by 17 votes to 14 {{at a meeting of}} the party's Executive Committee in Glasgow on 16 May 2015, Murphy announced that he would step down as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in June. Stating that he wanted to have a successor in place by the summer, he confirmed that he would no longer be standing for a seat in the Scottish Parliament. Before relinquishing the leadership role, Murphy drew up proposals for a number <b>of</b> <b>party</b> reforms, including the adoption of a one-member, one-vote ballot for future leadership contests. His resignation took effect on 13 June after his reforms had been provisionally accepted by Labour's executive committee. A timetable was also set out that would see a new leader elected on 15 August, while Gray was appointed as acting leader. Dugdale and Macintosh stood in the contest to choose Murphy's successor; Dugdale was subsequently elected as Scottish Labour's new leader with a 72% share of the vote. At the same time, Rowley became her deputy.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, new {{government}} turned toward Soviet influence and the Stalinist monumentalism. The doctrine of Socialist realism in Poland, {{as in other}} countries of the People's Republics, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements {{were made in the}} field of urban design. The guidelines for this new trend were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council <b>of</b> <b>Party</b> Architects. Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing the new social order by the communists. The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics. It aimed at expressing persistence and power. This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with apartment blocks constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint, with repetitious courtyards and wide, tree-lined avenues.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, McGovern was an {{exemplar of}} modern American liberalism. He became most {{known for his}} outspoken {{opposition}} to the growing U.S.involvement in the Vietnam War. He staged a brief nomination run in the 1968 presidential election as a stand-in for the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy. The subsequent McGovern–Fraser Commission fundamentally altered the presidential nominating process, by greatly {{increasing the number of}} caucuses and primaries and reducing the influence <b>of</b> <b>party</b> insiders. The McGovern–Hatfield Amendment sought to end the Vietnam War by legislative means but was defeated in 1970 and 1971. McGovern's long-shot, grassroots-based 1972 presidential campaign found triumph in gaining the Democratic nomination but left the party badly split ideologically, and the failed vice-presidential pick of Thomas Eagleton undermined McGovern's credibility. In the general election McGovern lost to incumbent Richard Nixon in one of the biggest landslides in American electoral history. Re-elected Senator in 1968 and 1974, McGovern was defeated in a bid for a fourth term in 1980.|$|E
