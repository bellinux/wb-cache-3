5|$|To {{obtain the}} {{greatest}} <b>operational</b> <b>efficiency,</b> ML constructed two dedicated container terminals {{with their own}} gantry cranes, spreaders etc. The Manchester terminal was built on an open site next to {{the western end of}} No. 9 Dock. A second container berth was added in 1972. The other terminal was created at Montreal, with similar equipment, where the containers were trans-shipped to a dedicated liner train operated by Canadian National Railways, which carried them onwards to Toronto and further destinations.|$|E
5|$|JALways {{became a}} wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of Japan Airlines on March 9, 2001 through {{an exchange of}} shares. The change in ownership enabled JAL to consolidate and improve management and <b>operational</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the JAL Group's international passenger operations, part of the JAL Medium Term Corporate Plan 2000-2002. The airline introduced new uniforms for its cabin crew on April 1, 2005, and retired its last McDonnell Douglas DC-10 on October 31. JALways became an affiliate member of Oneworld on April 1, 2007, together with four of its sister airlines, in the alliance's biggest expansion in its young history.|$|E

5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, the striped {{burrowing}} frog (Cyclorana alboguttata) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state {{without access to}} food and water for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during aestivation, the metabolism of the frog is altered and the <b>operational</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the mitochondria is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious {{for an extended period}} of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat. Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected. Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius.|$|E
5|$|Parsons Transportation Group {{was awarded}} a $138million {{contract}} in November 2011 to design and install CBOSS by October 2015. Parsons began physical work on CBOSS in September 2013, starting with the installation of a fiber optic line along the Caltrain right-of-way. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) approved Caltrain's plans in 2014 and Caltrain noted that CBOSS was due to enter revenue service {{by the end of}} 2015. Because Caltrain had multiple goals for CBOSS, including increased safety, improved <b>operational</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and ensured interoperability with other rail providers (Caltrain shares tracks with Union Pacific, Altamont Corridor Express, and Amtrak), implementation was challenging and Caltrain, the busiest commuter rail service on the West Coast, still had not fully implemented the system by the end of 2016.|$|E

25|$|The 1970s saw British Rail {{successfully}} introduce {{high speed}} diesel train services, as well as major resignalling projects designed to increase <b>operational</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In 1976, the InterCity 125 High Speed Train (HST) was introduced on some services and the InterCity brand was adopted. This created an increase in passengers using the railways and improved British Rail's finances. British Rail also started development of the world's first tilting train – the Advanced Passenger Train (APT). However, lack of money, political pressure and {{the launch of the}} prototype into passenger service before technical problems were fully overcome lead to the project being cancelled in the early 1980s.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{analysis}} of the <b>operational</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the major Italian airports. The study is based on a cross-sectional, time series dataset of 14 Italian airports for the period 2000 - 2004. In the sample there are the two international airport systems of Rome and Milan, each composed by two airports, and ten regional airports. The analysis of the industry characteristics have pointed out that both structural and institutional factors cause an high degrees of dissimilarities among the 14 Italians airports. In this framework comparing the efficiency could be troublesome and misleading at the same time. Thus the methodological goal of the paper has been the application of two multivariate techniques, factorial and cluster analysis, in order to reduces dissimilarities and improve the results of the efficiency measures. The two multivariate techniques help in determining variables which mostly affect the airports <b>operational</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> The <b>operational</b> <b>efficiencies</b> have been estimated using non parametric models. In particular, the modified Torqvinst index has been employed to measure both Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and Variable Factor Productivity (VFP) indexes. Moreover, in order to remove the effects of the variables beyond the managerial control the residual Total Factor Productivity (RTFP) and Variable Factor Productivity (RVFP) indexes have been computed. ...|$|R

25|$|There {{are wide}} {{differences}} in the <b>operational</b> <b>efficiency</b> among urban water and sanitation utilities in Latin America. The two most common measures of operation efficiency are labor productivity and non-revenue water (water losses). In terms of labor productivity, the most productive utilities have less than 2 employees per 1000 connections. They include EPM in Colombia, SEDAPAL in Lima, Aguas del Valle in Chile's 4th region, as well as Aguas de Formosa and Aguas de Salta in Argentina. The utility with the lowest labor productivity in the sample is EPSEL from the Lambayeque Region in Peru with more than 15 employees per 1000 connections. The average of the sample is about 5 employees per 1000 connections.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{a seven-year}} {{strategic}} commercial partnership between Gatwick and EasyJet, the airport proposed a number of changes to individual airlines' terminal locations. These would see EasyJet consolidate all its Gatwick operations in the North Terminal, while British Airways and Virgin Atlantic would swap their terminals. Gatwick believes that these terminal moves improve the airport's <b>operational</b> <b>efficiency</b> and resilience, {{as the use of}} different terminals by EasyJet and British Airways reduces pressure on the North Terminal's check-in, security, boarding and ramp areas at peak times. In addition, a terminal swap by Virgin frees up lounge and gate space for BA long-haul passengers in the South Terminal and, unlike BA's current short-haul schedules, Virgin's long-haul schedules do not clash with EasyJet's busy schedule in the North Terminal due to the airlines' differing peak times.|$|E
