5|$|Between 1907 and 1911, Caragiale studied Romanian {{heraldry}} and, to this goal, read Octav-George Lecca's Familii boierești române ("Romanian Boyar Families"). Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> {{added by}} {{him to his}} {{copy of the book}} are polemic, sarcastic, or mysterious, while the sketches he made on the margin include portrayals of boyars being put to death in various ways, as well as caricatures (such as a blazon displaying a donkey's head, which he mockingly assigned to Octav-George Lecca himself). Several of the heraldic objects he created were destined for his own use. In June 1928, he raised a green over yellow ensign he created for the Caragiale family at his property in Fundulea. He also hoisted other symbols, including the flag of Hungary, which, he claimed, underlined his foreign origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode {{can be traced back}} to an early idea Vince Gilligan, the writer of the episode, had. His {{original}} idea featured a man holding an individual hostage on a Tilt-A-Whirl. Gilligan pitched this idea at several meetings and it soon became a recurring joke. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> Gilligan received noted that his premise lacked an explicit mystery to investigate and so Gilligan decided that after the ride was shut off, the man's head would explode. Researching various government experiments, Gilligan discovered the controversial use of low-frequency waves. The secret military experiment featured in this episode is based on two real-life military experiments, Project HAARP and Project ELF. The former is a U.S. Army experiment dealing with electromagnetic radiation in the Earth's ionosphere, and the second is a U.S. Navy experiment dealing with long wavelengths. Thus, a script was crafted that featured an individual that, due to a secret experiment, could not slow down for fear of rupturing his head.|$|E

25|$|Although Bach did {{not write}} any opera, he was not averse to the genre, nor to its ornamented vocal style. In church music, Italian composers had imitated the operatic vocal style in genres such as the Neapolitan mass. In Protestant surroundings, there was more reticence to adopt such style for liturgical music. For instance, Kuhnau, Bach's {{predecessor}} in Leipzig, had notoriously written against opera and Italianate virtuoso vocal music. Bach was less imbued; one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> after a performance of his St Matthew Passion was that it all sounded much like opera.|$|E
