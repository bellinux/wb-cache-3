5|$|Castle Hill, {{also called}} Mere Castle, was a medieval {{fortification}} built by Richard, the Earl of Cornwall, in 1253 {{on a hill}} overlooking the village <b>of</b> <b>Mere,</b> Wiltshire, England. The castle was constructed in stone, with six towers, inner buildings and gates. It was abandoned in the 14th century and stripped of its stone and metalwork. Only earthworks remain in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The village <b>of</b> <b>Mere</b> was a {{small and}} {{unimportant}} settlement in the early 13th century. In 1243 Richard, the Earl of Cornwall, acquired the manor. Richard was the brother of Henry III and immensely rich. In 1253 he began to build a castle at Mere.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, revisionist {{authors would}} {{formulate}} accusations against Moreno, depicting {{him as a}} British agent and a man <b>of</b> <b>mere</b> theoretical European ideas without a strong relation with the South American context. Saavedra is depicted instead as a popular caudillo, a predecessor of José de San Martín and Juan Manuel de Rosas. This perspective did not acknowledge that the wealthy citizens were aligned with Saavedra against Moreno, that Saavedra himself was wealthy and aristocratic, and that the 1811 revolution made no requests of a social nature, save {{for the removal of}} Morenist forces from the Junta.|$|E

He is not keen on the idea, but not wanting to say no or give into Avery's demands, decides to employ the Fabian strategy—named after Fabius Maximus, a Roman general who {{employed}} a strategy of avoiding battles, instead wearing the enemy down by attrition. Jack is successful in avoiding redecorating the apartment; he agrees to knock down a wall instead.

5|$|Henry III {{added to}} the {{endowment}} left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of £81, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost bankrupt. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an administrator, John <b>of</b> <b>Mere,</b> to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems {{on the cost of}} providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king's sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey's income never recovered and it settled into what has been described as genteel poverty.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime <b>of</b> <b>mere</b> negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E

5|$|Ryu fights back to {{the inner}} {{chambers}} of the Ancient Ship of Doom, where he prepares {{to engage in the}} final showdown against Clancy, who has now transmuted into a super bio-noid. Clancy offers Ryu to have him and Irene work for him by his side wipe out the human race and usher a new age, but Ryu refuses and commences with the final battle. After transforming twice into progressively-stronger versions of himself, Clancy is defeated by Ryu, and Ryu is transported outside the warship and back to Irene; they both watch as the Ancient Ship of Doom is brought down and explodes, and they witness the crumbling of Castle Rock fortress. In the aftermath, Ryu tells Irene that Clancy's and Foster's plan have been foiled, and that mankind will live on and refuse to be part of anyone's evil plans; he adds that mankind would never stoop to a level in which they would completely destroy themselves out <b>of</b> <b>mere</b> ambition. The two watch as the sun rises and as a new day begins.|$|E
5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often <b>of</b> <b>mere</b> excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E
5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life <b>of</b> <b>mere</b> hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and the data from the Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E
50|$|Where land {{similar to}} that <b>of</b> Martin <b>Mere,</b> gently undulating glacial till, becomes flooded and {{develops}} fen and bog, the remnants <b>of</b> the original <b>mere</b> remain until the whole is filled with peat. This can be delayed where the mere is fed by lime-rich water from chalk or limestone upland and {{a significant proportion of}} the outflow from the mere takes the form of evaporation. In these circumstances, the lime (typically calcium carbonate) is deposited on the peaty bed and inhibits plant growth therefore peat formation. A typical feature <b>of</b> these <b>meres</b> is that they are alongside a river rather than having the river flowing through them. In this way, the mere is replenished by seepage from the bed of the lime-rich river, through the river's natural levée, or by winter floods. The water <b>of</b> the <b>mere</b> is then static through the summer, when the concentration of the calcium carbonate rises until it is precipitated on the bed <b>of</b> the <b>mere.</b>|$|R
