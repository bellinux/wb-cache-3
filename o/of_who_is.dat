5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> going to be the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier {{reduces the}} {{individuality}} of the characters, enhancing {{the notion of}} humanity, keeping {{in line with the}} theme of history as a repetition of patterns regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> in power. The simultaneous presence of fact and fiction and the cycle of reversal of fortunes presents characters as functional variants of each other. Through frequent use of metonymy, whereby a part replaces a whole, for example, referring to soldiers as uniformes (uniforms), Carpentier shifts the focus from individuals to the collective.|$|E
5|$|There is a socio-political {{cycle of}} order and {{disorder}} where, regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> in power, the same injustices take place: when the blacks take control, they betray their own traditions and {{follow the example of}} European states. By means of these repeated scenarios, history is presented as a cyclical re-enactment of the same human dilemmas.|$|E

5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle {{in the early}} 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or {{turn away from the}} caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E

25|$|The Nazi regime instituted laws {{discriminating against}} Jews, {{declared}} a race by the Nazis, and thus needed a working definition <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a Jew {{as to its}} law-defined race system. These definitions almost completely categorised persons through the religions followed by each individual's ancestors, according to membership registries. Thus, personal faith or individual observance, {{as well as the}} religious definitions of Judaism as given by the Halacha, were mostly ignored.|$|E
25|$|Jewish Renewal. Founded in the counter-cultural {{movements}} of the 1960s and 1970s, Jewish Renewal tends to embrace the ecstatic worship style and mysticism of hasidism, while rejecting the halakhic rigor of Orthodox Judaism. Jewish Renewal congregations tend to be inclusive on the subject <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a Jew. The Jewish Renewal movement lacks the formal institutional structure of the other liberal movements.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the ongoing}} {{debate over the}} {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a Jew among Israeli Jews, the Jewish status of a person, which is considered a matter of 'nationality' by the Israeli authorities, is registered and controlled by the Israeli Ministry of the Interior, which requires a person to meet the halakhic definition to be registered as a 'Jew'.

25|$|Also unlike modern P2P services, the {{identity}} of the downloaders is hidden from view. On P2P services a downloader is identifiable to all others by their network address.

Some Usenet providers do keep usage logs, but not all make this logged information casually available to outside parties such as the Recording Industry Association of America.

25|$|As {{well as the}} sovereign, the Commonwealth realms share {{a single}} royal family.

Though there is no strict legal or formal definition <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> or is {{not a member of the}} Royal Family, the group is loosely defined as the extended family of the monarch, and these persons constitute the apex of a modern royal court.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Royal Family is a {{group of}} people related to the country's monarch and, as such, {{belonging}} to the House of Windsor.
