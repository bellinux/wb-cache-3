5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} {{going to follow}} the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements {{from each of the}} films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the <b>one-line</b> quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E
25|$|A natural {{question}} arises {{as to the}} relationship of the <b>one-line</b> and the canonical cycle notation. For example, considering the permutation (2)(31), which is in canonical cycle notation, if we erase its cycle parentheses, we obtain a different permutation in <b>one-line</b> notation, namely 231. (The permutation (2)(31) is actually 321 in <b>one-line</b> notation.) Foata's transition lemma establishes the nature of this correspondence as a bijection on the set of n-permutations (to itself). Richard P. Stanley calls this correspondence the fundamental bijection.|$|E
25|$|Under this assumption, one may {{omit the}} first row and write the {{permutation}} in <b>one-line</b> notation as , that is, an ordered arrangement of S. Care {{must be taken to}} distinguish <b>one-line</b> notation from the cycle notation described later. In mathematics literature, a common usage is to omit parentheses for <b>one-line</b> notation, while using them for cycle notation. The <b>one-line</b> notation is also called the word representation of a permutation. The example above would then be 2 5 4 3 1 since the natural order 1 2 3 4 5 would be assumed for {{the first row}}. (It is typical to use commas to separate these entries only if some have two or more digits.) This form is more compact, and is common in elementary combinatorics and computer science. It is especially useful in applications where the elements of S or the permutations are to be compared as larger or smaller.|$|E
25|$|These {{easements}} {{are exceptions}} to the acceptable routes which are otherwise explicitly defined, and are listed in Section E of the Guide for easy reference. They are simple to understand <b>one-line</b> rules, and exist to ensure that in most circumstances the simplest journey is acceptable.|$|E
25|$|For example, in the <b>one-line</b> {{notation}} 312548976, 5 is {{the first}} element larger than 3, so the first cycle must be (312). Then 8 is the next element larger than 5, so the second cycle is (54). Since 9 is larger than 8, (8) is a cycle by itself. Finally, 9 is larger than all the remaining elements to its right, so the last cycle is (976).|$|E

25|$|Since {{there are}} no {{punctuation}} marks in Classical Chinese, {{it can be difficult}} to conclusively determine where one sentence ends and the next begins. Moving a full-stop a few words forward or back or inserting a comma can profoundly alter the meaning of many passages, and such divisions and meanings must be determined by the translator. Some editors and translators argue that the received text is so corrupted (from originally being written on <b>one-line</b> bamboo strips linked with silk threads) that it is impossible to understand some chapters without moving sequences of characters from one place to another.|$|E
25|$|When a thread—or in some cases, {{an entire}} forum—becomes unstable, {{the result is}} usually {{uncontrolled}} spam {{in the form of}} <b>one-line</b> complaints, image macros, or abuse of the report system. When the discussion becomes heated and sides do nothing more than complain and not accept each other's differences in point of view, the discussion degenerates into what is called a flame war. To flame someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion. Likely candidates for flame wars are usually religion and socio-political topics, or topics that discuss pre-existing rivalries outside the forum (e.g., rivalry between games, console systems, car manufacturers, nationalities, etc.).|$|E

He adds that a bit later, in 1992, he watched the movie Shoah by Claude Lanzmann, which left an impression on him, especially the discussion by Raul Hilberg about the bureaucratic aspect of genocide.|$|E

500|$|Monroe had no film roles {{during the}} first months of her {{contract}} and instead dedicated her days to acting, singing and dancing classes. Eager {{to learn more about the}} film industry and in order to promote herself, she spent time at the studio lot to observe others working.

The studio also enrolled her in the Actors' Laboratory Theatre, an acting school teaching the techniques of the Group Theatre; she later stated that it was [...] "my first taste of what real acting in a real drama could be, and I was hooked". Monroe's contract was not renewed in August 1947, and she returned to modeling while also doing occasional odd jobs at the studio.|$|E
500|$|... "Phantom Lord" [...] is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song {{begins with}} {{synthesized}} bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. [...] "No Remorse" [...] is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo {{in the fifth}} minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] was inspired by Diamond Head's [...] "Dead Reckoning" [...] and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, <b>one-line</b> chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. [...] "Metal Militia", {{one of the fastest}} songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity. Mustaine composed the main riff, which emulates a marching army.

The Guardian stated that Stefani's part was the only catchy hook on In My Mind, but added that it [...] "seems to be built around a <b>one-line</b> cast-off found on the Love. Angel. Music.

500|$|Azaria {{got along}} with Gold, who was lukewarm about working with him, but after a woman Azaria had [...] "worked with in New York got really furious with him because he said he'd work with me and then didn't", Gold sent him out for auditions.

His part—a <b>one-line</b> role as the police officer Maldonado—was edited out before the show was broadcast, although the role secured him admission to the Screen Actors Guild. Azaria appeared in the TV film Nitti: The Enforcer, about the gangster Frank Nitti, and appeared in the failed pilot Morning Maggie alongside Matthew Perry, with whom he became good friends. He played Joe in an episode of the sitcom Family Ties in 1988 in which he had one line, and the following year he played Steve Stevenson in an episode of Growing Pains. Azaria has described his career progression as being gradual; he did not achieve overnight recognition or fame. In Los Angeles, Azaria was trained by acting coach Roy London. Between acting jobs he performed as a stand-up comedian, and worked as a bartender for a catering firm.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{concept was}} {{a candy bar}} that would have three main components, a heavy texture, rich flavor, and a reasonable price; {{the combination of these}} qualities would ensure that it would be an easily marketable product.

[...] To give the product some [...] "impact" [...] with consumers, it was decided to name it after the Japanese god of thunder, Raijin.

Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me".
