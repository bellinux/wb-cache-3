5|$|Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms {{chemical}} {{bonds with}} almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides. The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized {{in the presence}} <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show. For example, the mineral FeO (wüstite) is written as , where x is usually around 0.05.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and {{the small size of}} helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by a blast <b>of</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
5|$|After the war finished, Rogerson {{continued}} studying fungal systematics {{and started}} a doctoral program with Harry Morton Fitzpatrick at Cornell University; noted mycologist Richard Korf was another of Fitzpatrick's graduate students at the time. Under Fitzpatrick, Rogerson studied Hypomyces fungi and their anamorphs. Fitzpatrick committed suicide in 1950, and Donald S. Welch replaced him as Rogerson's advisor {{for the last few}} months of his doctoral program. Rogerson received his doctorate from Cornell in 1950. That year, he joined the faculty of Kansas State University as an assistant professor, but he would ultimately advance to associate professor. While at Kansas, he worked on the identification of fungi, and published nearly 20 papers on fungal taxonomic novelties, aeromycology (the fungal flora <b>of</b> <b>air),</b> <b>and</b> plant diseases caused by fungi.|$|E
5|$|Brumfield {{demanded the}} right to return to Hill 82 in order to destroy the bunker system and to recover the bodies of Parker and Gillson, and he and Major John Essex-Clark—the {{operations}} officer—began planning a battalion attack. However, with American casualties rising and all available helicopters required for casualty evacuation, the planned operation was cancelled. The thick jungle canopy compounded the issue, and Williamson decided to stage the casualties through an area secured by the Australians at LZ Princess. Operation Hump concluded on 9 November, with the US 1/503rd Battalion and 1 RAR being extracted by helicopter and returning to Bien Hoa in the late afternoon. Following 1 RAR's return to Bien Hoa, Brumfield continued to petition for permission to conduct the operation. A battalion attack was subsequently planned for 14 November, but Williamson later deferred it dependent on the availability <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> helicopter support, and the start date of the upcoming Operation New Life. Ultimately it was never conducted.|$|E

An initial attack on Cassino, which involved the 4th Indian Division, the 28th Maori Battalion and New Zealand engineers, was mounted on 15 February but failed due to a lack <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> armoured support. Two days later, the 5th Brigade attempted to capture the town's railway station but this too failed.|$|E
5|$|Kirby's Dream Land is an action-platformer. Like {{many other}} platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games, levels are side-scrolling, {{played on a}} {{two-dimensional}} plane in which Kirby can move left or right as well as jump. Kirby's main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, after which the player can either swallow them or spit them out as a projectile attack. In addition to running and jumping, Kirby can also fly by inflating himself with a mouthful <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> flapping his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby's only method of attack is to release the air puff held in his mouth which cancels his flight.|$|E

5|$|Silver {{does not}} react with air, even at red heat, and thus was {{considered}} by alchemists as a noble metal along with gold. Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper (which forms copper(I) oxide when heated in air to red heat) and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with sulfur and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air {{to form the}} black silver sulfide (copper forms the green sulfate instead, while gold does not react). Unlike copper, silver will not react with the halogens, {{with the exception of}} the notoriously reactive fluorine gas, with which it forms the difluoride. While silver is not attacked by non-oxidizing acids, the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as dilute or concentrated nitric acid. In the presence <b>of</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> especially in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of cyanide.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} {{consists of}} a single large cylinder, usually back mounted, with one first-stage regulator, and usually two second-stage regulators. This configuration is simple and cheap but it has only a single breathing gas supply: it has no redundancy in case of failure. If the cylinder or first-stage regulator fails, the diver is totally out <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> faces a life-threatening emergency. Recreational diver training agencies train divers {{to rely on a}} buddy to assist them in this situation. The skill of gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses. This equipment configuration, although common with entry-level divers and used for most sport diving, is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed, or where there is an overhead environment (wreck diving, cave diving, or ice diving) as it provides no functional redundancy.|$|E
5|$|Spiders (order Araneae) are {{air-breathing}} arthropods {{that have}} eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom. They {{are the largest}} order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other orders of organisms. Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exceptions <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> sea colonization. , at least 45,700 spider species, and 113 families have been recorded by taxonomists. However, there has been dissension within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified, {{as evidenced by the}} over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900.|$|E

5|$|Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{complicated}} in execution, requiring coordination <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> naval forces. Launched in poor weather conditions, Taxable did {{not appear}} to have the desired effect and failed to elicit any significant response from the Germans. The reaction to Glimmer was more encouraging. The attacks on the bomber squadrons indicated, at least to the satisfaction of RAF Bomber Command, that the Germans believed a genuine threat existed. There is no evidence that Big Drum elicited any specific response from the shore. According to historian Mary Barbier, the adverse conditions and complexity of the operations contributed to the limited enemy response.|$|E
5|$|The {{principles}} of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite {{limit to the}} electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns <b>of</b> <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> raises the electric field {{in the air to}} greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100MV and have discharge energies as great as 250kWh.|$|E
5|$|The term 'bomber mafia' {{came from}} the {{sometimes}} bitter debates between United States Army staff and Air Corps men who observed, and argued with, the insistence by instructors and students of the ACTS that heavy bombers were the new primary weapon of war, and that a separate air arm was required to command them. For the first few years, the strongest voice at ACTS against the bomber doctrine was Captain (later General) George C. Kenney who called {{for the use of}} air power to attack enemy fighting units on the ground. He advocated the close coordination <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> ground forces, with an emphasis on medium bombers and fighter bombers. Kenney left ACTS in 1929, and heavy bomber doctrinarians filled the vacancy. The doctrine also ran counter to the theories of Billy Mitchell himself, who espoused that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to diversify the economy and make it less {{dependent}} on export goods, the government has pushed to increase tourism to Malaysia. As a result, tourism has become Malaysia's third largest source of foreign exchange, although it is threatened by {{the negative effects of}} the growing industrial economy, with large amounts <b>of</b> <b>air</b> <b>and</b> water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism. The tourism sector came under some pressure in 2014 when the national carrier Malaysia Airlines had one of its planes disappear in March, while another was brought down by a missile over Ukraine in July, resulting in the loss of a total 537 passengers and crew. The state of the airline, which had been unprofitable for 3 years, prompted the government in August 2014 to nationalise the airline by buying up the 30 per cent it did not already own. Between 2013 and 2014, Malaysia has been listed {{as one of the best}} places to retire to in the world, with the country in third position on the Global Retirement Index. This in part was the result of the Malaysia My Second Home programme to allow foreigners to live in the country on a long-stay visa for up to 10 years. In 2016, Malaysia ranked the fifth position on The World's Best Retirement Havens while getting in the first place as the best place in Asia to retire. Warm climate with British colonial background made foreigners easy to interact with the locals.|$|E
