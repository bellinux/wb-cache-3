40|$|The verb fail, {{preceding}} to + infinitive, has two senses. One presupposes active attempt; {{the other}} lacks this presupposition and approximates in meaning to simple negation. Examining all relevant occurrences in the British National Corpus, the paper considers the second sense <b>of</b> <b>fail</b> {{to in the}} framework of FDG. An initial analysis of the second sense as involving a subject-raising verb is abandoned in favour of seeing the relevant use <b>of</b> <b>fail</b> to as a periphrastic negative. Close corpus analysis reveals that fail to obeys various collocational restrictions pertaining to dynamicity, telicity and positive semantic prosody. This leads into a case study <b>of</b> <b>fail</b> to be, which reveals several additional facts. In the FDG-theoretical section, the first sense <b>of</b> <b>fail</b> is analysed as involving a lexical verb taking a Configurational Property as its complement and the second as corresponding to a Negative operator (Neg) on a Configurational Property. The use <b>of</b> <b>fail</b> to in litotes entails two loci for Neg, while the periphrastic use of failure arises from applying Neg to a Lexical Property. The conclusion reflects on possible motivations for the grammaticalization <b>of</b> <b>fail</b> invoking a view of negation as not purely semantic but also as having pragmatic aspects...|$|R

5|$|The {{cognitive}} ability {{of children with}} AS often allows them to articulate social norms in a laboratory context, where {{they may be able}} to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations.

5|$|After {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>failed</b> {{attempts}} at colonising Tobago, Duke Jacob Kettler of Courland and Semigallia sent one more ship to the island, which landed there on 20 May 1654, carrying soldiers and colonists, who named the island New Courland. At {{approximately the same}} time, Dutch colonies were established at other locations on the island, and eventually outgrew those of the Duchy of Courland in population. When the Duke was captured by Swedish forces in 1658, Dutch settlers overtook the Courland colonies, forcing the Governor to surrender. After a return of the territory to Courland through the 1660 Treaty of Oliwa, a number of attempts {{were made by the}} next Duke of Courland (Friedrich Casimir Kettler) at re-colonisation, but these met with failure, and he sold New Courland in 1689.|$|E

5|$|After years <b>of</b> <b>failed</b> {{attempts}} to extract {{oil from the}} salt domes near Beaumont, a small enterprise known as the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company was joined in 1899 by Croatian/Austrian mechanical engineer Anthony F. Lucas, an expert in salt domes. Lucas joined the company {{in response to the}} numerous ads the company's founder Pattillo Higgins placed in industrial magazines and trade journals. Lucas and his colleagues struggled for two years to find oil at a location known as Spindletop Hill before making a strike in 1901. The new well produced approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, an unprecedented level of production at the time. The 1902 total annual production at Spindletop exceeded 17 million barrels. The state's total production in 1900 had been only 836,000 barrels. The overabundance of supply led oil prices in the U.S. to drop to a record low of 3 cents per barrel, less than the price of water in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Belgrade, Smederevo and Veliko GradiÅ¡te {{continued}} {{to be subjected to}} more vigorous artillery bombardments, and a number <b>of</b> <b>failed</b> attempts to cross the Danube resulted in heavy Austro-Hungarian losses. The bulk of the Austro-Hungarian forces were stationed in Bosnia, and the Serbian General Staff were not misled by these feints on the Danube. Subsequently, the Austro-Hungarians attempted to cross the Drina at Ljubovija and the Sava at Å abac, and these attacks were seen as more significant. On 12 August, Austro-Hungarian troops entered Serbia through the town of Loznica, crossing the Drina. There, and in the village of LeÅ¡nica, the Austro-Hungarian 13th Army Corps made a crossing, while on the same day the Austro-Hungarian 4th Army Corps crossed the Sava to the north of Å abac, while other Austro-Hungarian troops crossed the Drina. The town of Å abac was quickly taken. By 14 August, over a front of about , the Austro-Hungarians had crossed the rivers and converged on Valjevo. The Austro-Hungarian 2nd and 5th Armies moved towards Belgrade, where they encountered the Serbian 1st, 2nd and 3rd Armies. On 15 August, Putnik ordered his forces into counterattack.|$|E
5|$|In January 1851, Allen {{purchased}} the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial {{building in the}} area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory {{had a long history}} <b>of</b> <b>failed</b> business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 30 June 1798 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} fought {{along the}} Biscay coast of France during the French Revolutionary Wars. The French Navy had been largely driven from the Atlantic Ocean early in the war following heavy losses in a series <b>of</b> <b>failed</b> operations. This had allowed the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet to institute a close blockade on the French naval ports of the Biscay coast, particularly Brest in Brittany. The blockade strategy included a constantly patrolling inshore squadron composed of frigates, tasked with preventing the passage of French ships into {{or out of the}} port. In the spring of 1798, several French frigates stationed in the Indian Ocean were sent back to France as the base at Ãle de France could no longer supply them effectively. One of these ships was the 40-gun frigate Seine, which departed Port Louis laden with 280 soldiers from the garrison.|$|E
5|$|The JinâSong Wars were {{a series}} of {{conflicts}} between the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115â1234) and Han Chinese Song dynasty (960â1279). In 1115, the Jurchens rebelled against their overlords, the Khitan Liao dynasty (907â1125), and declared {{the formation of the}} Jin. Allying with the Song against their common enemy the Liao, the Jin promised to return to the Song the territories in northern China that had fallen under Liao control since 938. The Jurchens' quick defeat of the Liao combined with Song military failures made the Jin reluctant to cede these territories. After a series <b>of</b> <b>failed</b> negotiations that embittered both sides, the Jurchens attacked the Song in November 1125, dispatching one army towards Taiyuan and the other towards Kaifeng, the Song capital.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Empire {{was known}} to create tower {{structures}} from the skulls of rebel fighters in order to elicit terror among its opponents. The First Serbian Uprising against Ottoman rule erupted in February 1804, with ÄorÄe PetroviÄ (KaraÄorÄe) as its leader. On 19 May 1809, 3,000 Serbian rebels {{under the command of}} Stevan SinÄeliÄ were attacked by the Ottomans on Äegar Hill, in NiÅ¡. The rebels were plagued by lack of coordination, largely due to the rivalry between commanders Milivoje Petrovic and Petar Dobrnjac. As a result, SinÄeliÄ's fighters failed to receive support from the other rebel detachments. The numerically superior Ottomans lost thousands of soldiers in a number <b>of</b> <b>failed</b> attacks against the rebels, but eventually overwhelmed the Serbian lines. Knowing that he and his men would be impaled if captured, SinÄeliÄ fired at his entrenchment's gun powder magazine, setting off a massive explosion.

5|$|The Second Boer War {{was fought}} from 11 October 1899 to 31 May 1902, between the British Empire {{and the two}} {{independent}} Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (Transvaal Republic). After a set <b>of</b> <b>failed</b> negotiations over foreigner land rights in the territories, led by Joseph Chamberlain, both sides issued ultimatums. When the ultimatums were rejected, war was declared. The war had three distinct phases. First, the Boers mounted pre-emptive strikes into British-held territory in Natal and the Cape Colony, besieging the British garrisons of Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley. The Boers then won a series of tactical victories against a failed British counteroffensive to relieve the three sieges. The second phase began after British forces under Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts launched counteroffensives with increased troop numbers. After Natal and the Cape Colony were secure, the British were able to invade the Transvaal and the republic's capital, Pretoria, was captured in June 1900. The third phase began in March 1900, when the Boers engaged a protracted hard-fought guerrilla warfare against the British forces. In an effort to cut off supplies to the raiders, the British, now {{under the leadership of}} Lord Kitchener, responded with a scorched earth policy of destroying Boer farms and moving civilians into concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was also}} part of the East Michigan Pike, {{designed}} to be a counterpart of the West Michigan Pike {{on the other side of}} the LP. The original route of the East Michigan Pike included a section along the coast of The Thumb between Bay City and Port Huron and used the same route as the Dixie Highway north of Bay City. Backers of this auto trail lost out in terms of name recognition to the Dixie Highway, relegating the East Michigan Pike to the list <b>of</b> <b>failed</b> auto trails. The southern part of what is now US23 in the state was {{also part of}} the auto trail craze. The Top of Michigan Trail was designated in 1917 from the state line north to the Bay City area, before turning inland along other roadways. The name faded from shortly after the time the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) assigned the first highway numbers in the state.|$|E
