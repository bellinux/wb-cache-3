40|$|The {{paper was}} {{originally}} written {{as a case}} study of the UK’s current policy approach to increasing gender diversity on corporate boards. It was presented at an EU forum on ‘Women in economic decision-making’ in Oslo, May 2012. The forum was an exchange of good practice between nineteen countries with <b>one</b> <b>government</b> <b>representative</b> and one academic from each. The UK, Norway and Denmark were given as case studies. The UK government has taken a non-interventionist ‘business-led’ multiple-stakeholder approach, to avert the need for an EU level policy intervening in the form of legislation. The paper assesses the effects so far...|$|E

A draft government strategy document produced in 2008 stated that jatropha {{was the top}} priority for biodiesel (Government of Kenya 2008), a position borne out through interviews. <b>One</b> <b>government</b> <b>representative</b> described jatropha as ‘a better candidate than any other’ for biofuel production in Kenya because of its potential to produce energy in ‘marginal’ areas without compromising food security (GOV 1 interview, 2009). Jatropha’s dominant status was also apparent at a June 2009 research forum called the Kenya Biodiesel Workshop, whose content focused almost entirely on jatropha (Ministry of Energy 2009).|$|E

5000|$|On 18 December 1940, the Faroese króna was pegged to the British pound {{at a rate}} of 22.4 krónur = 1 pound. This {{rate was}} officially {{accepted}} by the British government in a treaty titled [...] "Agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Administration of the Faroe Islands, for Regulating the Financial Relations between the United Kingdom and the Faroe Islands," [...] which came into force on 27 March 1941. At the same time, the Board of the Currency Central was reorganized to only three members, one representative of the British <b>Government,</b> <b>one</b> <b>representative</b> of the State (referring to the State of Denmark, meaning the County of Faroe), and one representative of the Løgting or the parliamentary National Board.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} role of women in fishing {{industry}} organisations and communities in promoting best-practice health behaviours among fishers in Australia. Design: This paper reports aspects of research that examined how the fishing industry can best support physical health and mental well-being of fishers. The study employed a mixed-methods, multisite case study approach. Data were gathered from face-to-face and phone interactions. Setting: Two sites in Victoria and one in Western Australia. Participants: Thirty-one male fishers, including commercial licence owners, skippers, deckhands, three female family members, three fishing association <b>representatives,</b> <b>one</b> local <b>government</b> <b>representative,</b> two health care providers, and three regional health planning and funding bodies. Interventions: Not applicable. Main outcome measures: Not applicable. Results: Often unrecognised, women associated with the fishing industry are integral to the promotion of good health for fishers. They are key to identifying health issues (particularly mental health issues) and proposing community-based health and well-being strategies. They often do so by incorporating health information and activities into ‘soft entry points’ – informal, non-health service mechanisms by which fishers can access health information and health services. Conclusions: While not working at the industry coalface, women have a stake, and are key players, in the commercial fishing industry. Their knowledge of, and credibility within, fishing enterprises makes them valuable sources of information about health issues facing the industry and effective strategies to address them. This expertise should be applied in conjunction with industry associations and health providers to achieve better health outcomes for fishers and their families...|$|R
