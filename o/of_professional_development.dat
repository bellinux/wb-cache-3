25|$|Dialogue journal {{writing has}} become an {{important}} component <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> for teachers in both pre-service teacher training programs at universities and in in-service workshops and coaching. It might take place between the professor and a class of prospective teachers in a teacher preparation program; between prospective or new teachers and experienced teachers they are working with, as a mentoring and coaching opportunity; or between prospective and practicing teachers. Those who use and study these approaches have found that these professional conversations promote reflection on oneself {{as a teacher and}} between teachers as they reflect on their practice. Some research focuses on the types of responses and interactions that are effective for promoting teacher learning. With use of the Internet, these interactions can take place among educators around the world.|$|E
25|$|To {{obtain a}} Professional certificate, the {{applicant}} must have completed a NYS-approved {{teacher education program}} at a college/university and hold a master's degree or above. Each state has different requirements to become a permanently certified teacher, and the requirements keep increasing. For example, professional certification in NYS requires three years of classroom teaching experience. It also requires being mentored by a certified teacher within the first year teaching. However NYS no longer offers permanent certification to those who haven't already been certified by February 2004.The Professional certificate replaces it. To maintain a professional certificate, a teacher must complete 100 hours <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> every five years. These professional development hours are decreased by a few percentages for every year teaching in a non-public school.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the nature <b>of</b> online <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> (OPD) for K- 12 {{educators}} in the context of Blackboard, a web-based courses management system (WBCMS). Considering the widespread access to the Internet, an increased demand for teacher <b>professional</b> <b>development,</b> and the advances in information and communication technologies, a proliferation <b>of</b> online <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> courses for teachers has emerged in recent years (Dede, 2006; Galley, 2002). With such a wide variety <b>of</b> online <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> courses available, it is important to study the characteristics of effective OPD courses in order for educators responsible for coordinating staff development to gain the knowledge to better create, facilitate, and select online <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> (OPD) courses and/or opportunities for K- 12 educators. This case study examined the factors impacting educator interest and engagement in OPD courses, the characteristics of OPD courses that educators (participants) perceived as effective, and how a specific OPD course addressed the characteristics <b>of</b> effective <b>professional</b> <b>development.</b> The findings in this study identified three reasons for which the participants chose to enroll in an online <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> course. They are: (1) maintaining teacher certification requirements, (2) interest/relevance, (3) convenience (time). After engaging in the entire OPD course, participants reported three perceived characteristics <b>of</b> effective online <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> courses - instructional design, interactivity, and collaboration. These findings agreed with the research literature in that instructional design, interactivity, and collaboration are important characteristics in online <b>professional</b> <b>development.</b> It was determined in this case study that online <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> meets the four overarching characteristics <b>of</b> effective <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> of: (1) time, (2) collaboration, (3) content and pedagogy focused, and (4) relevance. The findings from this case study offer a description of the nature <b>of</b> effective online <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> and may be used as a foundation for discussing implementing online <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> courses in school districts...|$|R

40|$|The study {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the role <b>of</b> mentoring in <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> and to understand how educators at secondary schools in Gauteng perceive and experience mentoring as part <b>of</b> their <b>professional</b> <b>development.</b> The primary research question that guided {{this study was to determine}} the role that mentoring plays in the <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> educators. I used three sub-questions that focussed on educators perceptions and experiences of mentoring, the aspects of mentoring that contributed mostly to their <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> and the <b>professional</b> practice within the education sector in general. This qualitative study used a case study approach to gather the data and was embedded in an instructional leadership theory. Interviews as well as my notes were employed as data collection methods and a thorough literature study was done. Participants consisted of principals, Heads of Departments (HoDs) and educators at two secondary schools in the Gauteng Province. The focus of the study was the role <b>of</b> mentoring in <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> and the he study found that there was no clear link between <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> and mentoring at the schools. The purposively-sampled participants indicated their need for mentoring in relation to <b>professional</b> <b>development.</b> The study found a lack <b>of</b> a formal <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> and mentoring programme in two secondary schools in the Gauteng province, and that mentoring was not part <b>of</b> the <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> strategy at the schools. The absence <b>of</b> a formal <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> and a formal mentoring programme included the aspects of planning, time management and budgeting for the mentioned formal programmes. The literature highlights the lack of mentoring, as part <b>of</b> schools <b>professional</b> <b>development</b> strategies and practices.
