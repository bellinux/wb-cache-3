5|$|All clergy, whether deacons, priests or bishops, may preach, teach, baptise, witness {{marriages and}} conduct funeral liturgies. Only bishops and priests can {{administer}} the sacraments of the Eucharist, Reconciliation (Penance) and Anointing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sick.</b> Only bishops can administer {{the sacrament of}} Holy Orders, which ordains someone into the clergy.|$|E

5|$|His selflessness and {{strength}} were exemplified {{during this period}} by the assistance that he gave to a fellow worker who had become ill. Johnson would carry two sacks of corn on each journey between the wharf and the grain warehouse, rather than the usual single sack, up an incline so steep that it was known as Labour-in-vain-hill. He gave the extra money he earned to the family <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick</b> man until {{he was able to}} return work.|$|E
5|$|While chrism is {{used only}} for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated, a {{different}} oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, {{has begun to be}} in danger of death. This sacrament, known as Anointing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sick,</b> is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins.|$|E
5|$|Young met {{mountain}} man Jim Bridger on June 28. They discussed routes into the Salt Lake Valley and {{the feasibility of}} viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the Green River, and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, {{they were joined by}} 12 more members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick</b> detachment of the Mormon Battalion.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Moalem's {{first book}} Survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sickest</b> was {{published}} in 2007 by William Morrow (HarperCollins). The book, co-written by Jonathan Prince, lays out eight case studies revolving around the argument that common hereditary diseases exist because at one point they were an adaptive advantage for our ancestors. One proposed hypothesis is that water induced wrinkling of skin is an adaptation to improve traction in wet or slippery environments. Research has subsequently shown this to be likely the case.|$|R

5|$|Alfonsín had {{lung cancer}} {{for almost a}} year before his death, which led to pneumonia. His medic Alejandro Sandler {{explained}} that his health had worsened at several points, which were followed by brief recoveries. In his last days he was visited by vice president Julio Cobos and monsignor Justo Laguna, who gave him the Anointing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sick.</b> He received home care, as Sandler preferred him to stay with his family. The president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was out of the country and phoned several times; Ricardo Alfonsín called her at 17:00 and informed her of his father's health. He died on March 31, 2009, at 20:30; Sandler announced it at 21:03. Alfonsín was sleeping at the moment, next to his family. Cobos was the first politician to arrive at his home.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of new deputies increased disputes within the Junta. He opposed both Saavedra and Funes, albeit {{in a more}} moderate manner than Moreno. Those fights affected his health, {{and he had a}} mild heart attack on 28 January 1811. Fearing for his life, he wrote his will and received the Anointing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sick.</b> Three days later he had another strong disagreement with Funes, and had another heart attack when he was returning to his house. He was buried in the cemetery of San Nicolás de Bari, as requested in his will. The death certificate states that he hadn't been given last rites because his unanticipated death did not allow for time. Alberti was the first member of the Primera Junta to die.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops has an {{extended}} cameo, being sick with an unidentified disease. Its appearance {{was a particular}} logistical nightmare for Stan Winston when Spielberg asked to shoot the animatronic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick</b> creature earlier than expected. The model, operated by eight puppeteers in the Kaua'i set, wound up being the first dinosaur filmed during production. Winston also created a baby Triceratops for Ariana Richards to ride on, a scene cut from the film for pacing reasons. Gary Rydstrom combined the sound of himself breathing into a cardboard tube with the cows near his workplace at Skywalker Ranch to create the Triceratops vocals.|$|E

In 1498, she spearheaded <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Santa Casa da Misericórdia as confraternities with humanitarian purposes, especially <b>the</b> care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor, <b>the</b> <b>sick,</b> and abandoned children. The original foundations survive today, and more have since been founded in other towns and cities of Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{fragmented}} votive life-size sculptures of little children lying {{on their side}} and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among {{the best known of}} these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem, the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick</b> child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6thcentury BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas's first {{proposed}} remedy {{was a complete}} moratorium {{on the use of}} Indian labor in the Indies until such time as better regulations of it were set in place. This was meant simply to halt the decimation of the Indian population and to give the surviving Indians time to reconstitute themselves. Las Casas feared that at the rate the exploitation was proceeding it would be too late to hinder their annihilation unless action were taken rapidly. The second was a change in the labor policy so that instead of a colonist owning the labor of specific Indians, he would have a right to man-hours, to be carried out by no specific persons. This required the establishment of self-governing Indian communities on the land of colonists – who would themselves organize to provide the labor for their patron. The colonist would only have rights to a certain portion of the total labor, so that a part of the Indians were always resting and taking care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick.</b> He proposed 12 other remedies, all having the specific aim of improving the situation for the Indians and limiting the powers that colonists were able to exercise over them.|$|E

25|$|The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Coptic and Old Catholic Churches {{consider}} this anointing to be a sacrament. Other Christians too, in particular Anglicans, Lutherans and some Protestant and other Christian communities use a rite <b>of</b> anointing <b>the</b> <b>sick,</b> without necessarily classifying it as a sacrament.|$|R

25|$|Some Protestant US {{military}} chaplains {{carry the}} Roman Rite {{version of the}} Anointing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sick</b> with them for use if called upon to assist wounded or dying soldiers who are Catholics. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider invalid as a sacrament the administration of Anointing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sick</b> by such chaplains, who {{in the eyes of}} those Churches are not validly ordained priests. The rite performed by them is thus seen as having the same by no means negligible value of any other form of prayer offered for the sick or dying.|$|E
