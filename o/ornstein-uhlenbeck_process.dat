2500|$|Academics {{had to play}} {{catch up}} with {{practitioners}} in this matter. One important theoretic development came from a Czech mathematician, Oldrich Vasicek, who argued in a 1977 paper that bond prices all along the curve are driven by the short end (under risk neutral equivalent martingale measure) and accordingly by short-term interest rates. [...] The mathematical model for Vasicek's work was given by an <b>Ornstein–Uhlenbeck</b> <b>process,</b> but has since been discredited because the model predicts a positive probability that the short rate becomes negative and is inflexible in creating yield curves of different shapes. [...] Vasicek's model has been superseded by many different models including the Hull–White model (which allows for time varying parameters in the <b>Ornstein–Uhlenbeck</b> <b>process),</b> the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model, which is a modified Bessel process, and the Heath–Jarrow–Morton framework. [...] There are also many modifications {{to each of these}} models, but see the article on short rate model.|$|E
2500|$|Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process: in brief, an <b>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck</b> <b>process</b> is a {{continuous}} stochastic process that behaves like a Brownian motion, but attracted toward some central value, where {{the strength of}} the attraction increases with the distance from that value. This is useful for modelling scenarios where the trait is subject to stabilizing selection around a certain value (say [...] ). Under this model, the above-described transition of [...] being in state [...] to [...] being in state [...] would have a likelihood defined by the transition density of an <b>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck</b> <b>process</b> with two parameters: , which describes the variance of the driving Brownian motion, and , which describes the strength of its attraction to [...] [...] As [...] tends to , the process is less and less constrained by its attraction to [...] and the process becomes a Brownian motion. [...] Because of this, the models may be nested, and log-likelihood ratio tests discerning which of the two models is appropriate may be carried out.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{models have}} been {{developed}} to estimate ancestral states of discrete and continuous characters from extant descendants. Such models assume that the evolution of a trait through time may be modelled as a stochastic process. [...] For discrete-valued traits (such as [...] "pollinator type"), this process is typically taken to be a Markov chain; for continuous-valued traits (such as [...] "brain size"), the process is frequently taken to be a Brownian motion or an <b>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck</b> <b>process.</b> [...] Using this model as the basis for statistical inference, one can now use maximum likelihood methods or Bayesian inference to estimate the ancestral states.|$|E
