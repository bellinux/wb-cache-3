5|$|On 21 March 1995, Martin {{was taken}} to court on an initial charge, naming him as Simon James Davis and accusing him of forging Lowe's {{signature}} on a DBS Bank credit card transaction slip to obtain S$6,000 in cash on 9 March. Three days later, he was charged under his real name {{for the murder of}} Gerard Lowe in a River View Hotel room some time between 8 March and 9. In subsequent hearings, he was additionally charged with forgery (forging Lowe's signature five more times to obtain cash and goods worth $3,200), vandalism (smashing the glass panel), possession of an <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> (the electroshock weapon), and possession of a controlled drug (he had 24 sticks of cannabis {{at the time of his}} arrest).|$|E
5|$|Maryland's {{offense was}} run by first-year {{offensive}} coordinator and former wide receivers coach James Franklin, who utilized a West Coast system. During the 2008 regular season, starting quarterback Chris Turner threw for 2,318yards, 11touchdowns, and 10interceptions. NFL Draft prospect Darrius Heyward-Bey accumulated 561receiving yards in ten games. Heyward-Bey also recorded 208rushing yards and was often utilized in reverses and other trick plays due to his breakaway speed. Maryland had another <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> in running back Da'Rel Scott, who ran for 959yards during the regular season. Overall, the rushing offense gained 134.5yards per game and was ranked 72nd in the nation. Against Virginia Tech and Boston College, Maryland rushed for −12and −6yards, respectively. The previous year, in the 2007 Emerald Bowl against Oregon State, Maryland recorded 19yards on the ground against the then second-ranked rushing defense.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} changes from the 1370s onwards was the {{adaptation}} of the town walls to mount gunpowder weapons. At this time cannon were still unreliable, only capable of reaching relatively short ranges and required the construction of specialist gunports. Cannons fired stone cannonballs, which did relatively little damage to stronger stone walls, and so were primarily used in defence of fortifications {{rather than as an}} <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> by besiegers. The first gunports in Britain were installed in the 1360s on the Isle of Wight, but Southampton was not far behind. Around 1378 to 1379 the ongoing French threat led to gunports for handguns being built into the western Arcade wall, and by 1382 the town bought its own gun. God's House Tower was built to defend the southern quays around 1417 and the sluices that controlled the level of the town's moats, and equipped with numerous gunports rooftop firing points, and by 1439 Catchcold tower had also been constructed, again designed to accommodate gunpowder weapons.|$|E

5|$|The low foot {{to lower}} leg ratio in Deinonychus is due partly to an unusually short {{metatarsus}} (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom {{suggested that the}} short metatarsus {{may be related to}} the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features– the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.– as support for the use of the hind leg as an <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon,</b> where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the Deinonychus leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles was used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of Deinonychus represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack was}} led by Hernando Pizarro, the senior Spanish {{commander}} in Cusco, with a force of 100Spaniards (30infantry, 70cavalry) and an estimated 30,000 native allies. One of his main assets against the Inca armies was the Spanish cavalry because horses provided a considerable advantage in hitting power, maneuverability, speed, and stamina over Inca warriors. All Spaniards wore some kind of armor, {{the most commonly used}} types were chain mail shirts and padded cloth armor which were lighter and cheaper than full armor suits; they were complemented by steel helmets and small iron or wooden shields. The main Spanish <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> was the steel sword, which horsemen supplemented with the lance; both weapons could easily penetrate the padded armor worn by Inca troops. Firearms, such as arquebuses were rarely used during the Spanish conquest of Peru because they were scarce, hard to use, and despised by horsemen as an ungentlemanly weapon. Spaniards relied heavily on Indian auxiliaries because they provided thousands of warriors as well as support personnel and supplies. These native troops had the same sorts of arms and armor as their Inca counterparts. During the Ollantaytambo campaign, the Pizarro expedition included thousands of auxiliaries, mainly Cañaris, Chachapoyas, and Wankas as well as several members of the Inca nobility opposed to Manco Inca.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-Saxon {{term for}} javelin was france. In Anglo-Saxon warfare, {{soldiers}} usually formed a shield wall and used heavy weapons like Danish axes, swords and spears. Javelins, including barbed angons, {{were used as}} an <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> from behind the shield wall or by warriors who left the protective formation and attacked the enemy as skirmishers.|$|E
25|$|Defenses {{work best}} against the <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> {{with which they}} are matched.

25|$|Chennault, however, {{also had}} a blind spot in his zealous {{advocacy}} of fighters as the <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> of the Air Corps.

25|$|Chicago's main <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> was Payton and {{the running}} game. A big reason for Payton's success was fullback Matt Suhey {{as the primary}} lead blocker. Suhey was also a good ball carrier, rushing for 471 yards and {{catching}} 33 passes for 295 yards. The team's rushing was also aided by Pro Bowlers Jim Covert and Jay Hilgenberg {{and the rest of}} the Bears' offensive line.|$|E
25|$|After the Fall of Rabaul in February 1942 the Catalina {{squadron}}s {{became the}} RAAF's only <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> against the Japanese.

50|$|This section {{creates an}} offence of manufacturing, distributing and {{importing}} <b>offensive</b> <b>weapons,</b> {{but does not}} itself define which weapons it applies to, other than excluding firearms and crossbows.

25|$|Middlesbrough next visited Stoke City's Britannia Stadium {{in another}} {{important}} game. Like {{much of the}} season, the team once again failed to score. As expected, Rory Delap's throw-in's were Stoke's main <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon.</b> Although they dealt with most of them well, Ryan Shawcross headed one home on 84 minutes, giving them a vital 1–0 win over their relegation rivals. The loss left Middlesbrough four points from safety, with the battle against relegation taking its toll on the club's morale.|$|E
25|$|But {{the lead}} {{did not last}} long. Pittsburgh {{defensive}} back Larry Anderson returned the ensuing kickoff 45 yards to his own 47-yard line, and then the Steelers marched 53 yards in 9 plays using every <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> in their arsenal. First, Harris ran for 12 yards, fullback Rocky Bleier ran for 1, then tight end Bennie Cunningham caught a pass for 8. Bleier ran again for 2, followed by Bradshaw's 12-yard completion to receiver Lynn Swann on the last play of the first quarter.|$|E
25|$|When {{without his}} {{trademark}} shield, Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel, {{or even a}} photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix. Rogers, having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes, carried {{a variant of the}} energy shield which can be used with either arm, and used to either block attacks or as an improvised <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> able to cut through metal with relative ease. Much like his Vibranium shield, the energy shield can be thrown, including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand.|$|E

25|$|With the forelimbs being {{approximately}} 64% of the hindlimbs, Postosuchus {{had small}} hands bearing five toes. Only the first toe bore a large claw, {{which was used}} as an <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon,</b> and the forelimbs were robust, probably to hold the prey. The feet were much larger than the hands, with the fifth metatarsal forming a hook shape. The halluxes were more slender than the other toes and the marginal ones could not touch the ground. Being a crurotarsan, the heel and ankle of Postosuchus resemble those of modern crocodiles.|$|E
25|$|Serving is the act {{of putting}} the ball into play by {{striking}} it with the hand or arm from behind the rear court boundary. Serving can {{take the form of}} an underhand serve, overhand serve or a jump serve. The underhand and overhand serves are similar on the beach and indoors, with the exception that on the beach the wind often has a significant effect on the trajectory of the ball. Although the serve can be used as an <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon,</b> most rallies are won by the receiving team, as they have the first attack opportunity.|$|E
25|$|Graf {{also had}} a {{powerful}} backhand drive but {{over the course of}} her career tended to use this less frequently, opting more often for an effective backhand slice. Starting in the early 1990s, she used the slice almost exclusively in baseline rallies and mostly limited the topspin backhand to passing shots. Her accuracy with the slice, both cross-court and down the line and her ability to skid the ball and keep it low, enabled her to use it as an <b>offensive</b> <b>weapon</b> to set the ball up for her forehand put-aways. However, Graf admitted in 1995 that she would have preferred having a two-handed backhand in retrospect.|$|E
