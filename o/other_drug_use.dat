50|$|Collaborating with Elena Sliepcevich and David Duncan, his {{publications}} {{from the}} early 1980s largely focused {{on the study of}} risk taking and risk reduction related to alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in youth. Many of the studies during this early stage of his career were conducted in rural settings, thus providing a catalyst for his later work in the SIU-C Center for Rural Health and Social Service Development. Throughout his career many of his publications have been concerned with instrument development, needs assessment, program evaluation, and the creation of responsive interventions and curricula. His current research blends the rural setting; the multiple health-related problems of that setting; and the challenging issues of measurement and evaluation.|$|E
50|$|The Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs (JSAD) is a peer-reviewed {{scientific}} {{journal that}} publishes original research articles on {{various aspects of}} the use and misuse of alcohol and other drugs. Topics covered include the biological, medical, epidemiological, social, psychological, and legal aspects of alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> abuse, and dependence. The journal was established in 1940 as the Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol, changed its name in 1975 to Journal of Studies on Alcohol, before obtaining its current name in 2007. The journal appears bimonthly and publishes supplements at irregular intervals. The Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs is a not-for-profit journal based in the Center of Alcohol Studies at Rutgers University.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has found}} that jurors {{are more likely to}} convict in {{stranger}} rape cases than in date rape cases. Often, even in cases in which sufficient physical evidence is present to support conviction, juries have reported being influenced by irrelevant factors related to the female victim such as whether she used birth control, engaged in non-marital sex, was perceived by jurors as sexually dressed, or had engaged in alcohol or <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Researchers have noted that because date rape by definition occurs {{in the context of a}} dating relationship, jurors' propensity to discount the likelihood of rape having occurred based on date-like behaviors is problematic. A 1982 American study of assignment of responsibility for rape found respondents were more likely to assign greater responsibility to a rape victim if she was intoxicated at the time of the rape; however, when her assailant was intoxicated, respondents assigned him less responsibility.|$|E

5000|$|A {{concern has}} also been raised that fear appeals serve to {{contribute}} to the widening of health disparities. This is because certain individuals are more likely to develop the maladaptive responses mentioned above. Empirical research suggests that fear appeals work best for individuals with high levels of self-efficacy, and that maladaptive responses are more likely in those with low self-efficacy. This means that fear appeals work best for those who are equipped, both physically and psychologically, to take appropriate action. Individuals who do not have the resources for health behaviour change are often those who already have negative health status. For example, people who regularly engage in behaviours which are damaging to health (e.g. smoking and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use)</b> have been found to typically have lower self-efficacy than others. [...] Therefore, it seems that, in addition to having the potential to cause harm, this harm is more likely to affect groups that would most benefit from health behaviour change, therefore contributing to the widen of health disparities.|$|E

Summary This state of knowledge paper explores: 	{{the prevalence}} of sexual violence and alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> (AOD) in Australia; 	the association between alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and severity of, or vulnerability to, sexual violence and re-victimisation; 	correlations between child sexual abuse and subsequent alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> and adult sexual abuse and subsequent alcohol and other drug use; and 	current practice around identification, assessment, response and referral pathways between AOD and sexual assault services. The paper finds that despite methodological limitations in the literature, there is growing consensus that the sexual assault services sector and the AOD sector share {{a significant number of}} clients and that integrated or coordinated service provision is key. This work is part of the ANROWS Landscapes series. ANROWS Landscapes (State of knowledge papers) are medium length papers that scope current knowledge on an issue related to violence against women and their children. Papers will draw on empirical research, including research produced under ANROWS’s research program, and/or practice knowledge.  ...|$|E

Purpose of review: Alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> {{are major}} {{contributors}} to the global burden of disease. Prevention is critical and evidence is beginning to {{support the use of}} online mediums to prevent alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and harms among adolescents. This study aims to expand the evidence base by conducting a systematic review of recent universal prevention programs delivered by computers and the Internet. Recent findings: A total of 12 papers reporting outcomes from trials of nine universal online prevention programs were identified. Of the identified interventions, five targeted multiple substances, two focused solely on alcohol, one targeted only cannabis and one primarily addressed smoking. The majority of programs were delivered at school; however one was implemented in a primary care setting. Six programs demonstrated significant, but modest, effects for alcohol and/or <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> outcomes. Summary: Evidence to support the efficacy of computer and Internet-based prevention programs for alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and related harms among adolescents is rapidly emerging, demonstrating that online prevention is an area of increasing promise. Further replication work, longer-term trials and attempts to increase the impact are required...|$|E
