50|$|<b>Orcein</b> is a reddish-brown dye, orchil is a purple-blue dye. <b>Orcein</b> is {{also used}} as a stain in {{microscopy}} to visualize chromosomes, elastic fibers, Hepatitis B surface antigens, and copper-associated proteins.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} {{components of}} <b>orcein</b> were elucidated {{only in the}} 1950s by Hans Musso. The structures are shown below. A paper originally published in 1961, embodying most of Musso's work on components of <b>orcein</b> and litmus, was translated into English and published in 2003 in a special {{issue of the journal}} Biotechnic & Histochemistry (Vol 78, No. 6) devoted to the dye. A single alternative structural formula for <b>orcein,</b> possibly incorrect, is given by the National Library of Medicine http://chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/jsp/common/ChemInfo.jsp?calledFrom=lite&type=formulas and Emolecules http://www.emolecules.com/cgi-bin/search?t=ss&q=1400-62-0&c=1&v=.|$|E

50|$|<b>Orcein,</b> or purple moss, {{was another}} common purple dye. It {{was known to}} the ancient Greeks and Hebrews, and was made from a Mediterranean lichen called archil or dyer's moss (Roccella tinctoria), {{combined}} with an ammoniac, usually urine. <b>Orcein</b> began to achieve popularity again in the 19th century, when violet and purple became the color of demi-mourning, worn after a widow or widower had worn black for a certain time, before he or she returned to wearing ordinary colors.|$|E
50|$|In histology, the HOPS stain {{is a way}} of marking tissue for {{microscopic}} examination. HOPS is {{an acronym}} for haematoxylin, <b>orcein,</b> phyloxin and saffron.|$|E
50|$|The litmus mixture has the CAS number 1393-92-6 and {{contains}} 10 to 15 different dyes. Most {{of the chemical}} components of litmus {{are likely to be}} the same as those of the related mixture known as <b>orcein,</b> but in different proportions. In contrast with <b>orcein,</b> the principal constituent of litmus has an average molecular mass of 3300. Acid-base indicators on litmus owe their properties to a 7-hydroxyphenoxazone chromophore. Some fractions of litmus were given specific names including erythrolitmin (or erythrolein), azolitmin, spaniolitmin, leucoorcein, and leucazolitmin. Azolitmin shows nearly the same effect as litmus.|$|E
50|$|In histopathology, the {{presence}} of HBsAg is more commonly demonstrated {{by the use of}} the Shikata <b>orcein</b> technique, which uses a natural dye to bind to the antigen in infected liver cells.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used in}} the {{production}} of the dye <b>orcein</b> and as a reagent in some chemical tests for pentoses, such as Bial's Test. It may be synthesized from toluene; more interesting is its production when acetone dicarboxylic ester is condensed with the aid of sodium. It crystallizes in colorless prisms with one molecule of water, which redden on exposure to air. Ferric chloride gives a bluish-violet coloration with the aqueous solution. Unlike resorcinol it does not give a fluorescein with phthalic anhydride. Oxidation of the ammoniacal solution gives <b>orcein,</b> C28H24N2O7, the chief constituent of the natural dye archil. Homo-pyrocatechin is an isomer (CH1: OH: OH= 1 3 :4), found as its methyl ether (creosol) in beech-wood tar.|$|E
50|$|There {{are reports}} dating almost 2000 years old of lichens {{being used to}} make purple and red dyes. Of great {{historical}} and commercial significance are lichens belonging to the family Roccellaceae, commonly called orchella weed or orchil. <b>Orcein</b> and other lichen dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic versions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Orcein</b> is not {{approved}} {{as a food}} dye (banned in Europe since January 1977), with E number E121 before 1977 and E182 after., Its CAS number is [...] Its chemical formula is C28H24N2O7. It forms dark brown crystals. It {{is a mixture of}} phenoxazone derivates - hydroxyorceins, aminoorceins, and aminoorceinimines.|$|E
50|$|Weigert's elastic stain is a {{combination}} of stains used in histology which is useful in identifying elastic fibers. Often <b>orcein</b> or {{a combination}} of resorcinol and fuchsine are used for staining. For counterstaining cell nuclei nuclear fast red or hematoxylin is also used. After applying elastic fibers show up blue coloured while cell nuclei gets red or blue.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Orcein,</b> also archil, orchil, lacmus and C.I. Natural Red 28, are {{names for}} dyes {{extracted}} from {{several species of}} lichen, commonly known as [...] "orchella weeds", found {{in various parts of}} the world. A major source is the archil lichen, Roccella tinctoria. Orcinol is extracted from such lichens. It is then converted to <b>orcein</b> by ammonia and air. In traditional dye-making methods, urine was used as the ammonia source. If the conversion is carried out in the presence of potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, and calcium sulfate (in the form of potash, lime, and gypsum in traditional dye-making methods), the result is litmus, a more complex molecule. The manufacture was described by Cocq in 1812 [...] and in the UK in 1874. Roberts noted orchilla as a principal export of the Cape Verde islands, superior to the same kind of moss found in Italy or the Canaries, that in 1832 was yielding an annual revenue of $200,000. Commercial archil is either a powder (called cudbear) or a paste. It is red in acidic pH and blue in alkaline pH.|$|E
50|$|Purple dyes from lichens were {{historically}} {{very important}} throughout Europe from the 15th to 17th centuries. They were generally extracted from Roccella spp. lichens {{imported from the}} Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands, Madagascar, or India. These lichens, and the dye extracted from them, are called orchil (variants archil, orchilla). The same dye was also produced from Ochrolechia spp. lichens in Britain and was called cudbear. Both Roccella spp. and Ochrolechia spp. contain the lichen substance orcin, which converts into the purple dye <b>orcein</b> in the ammonia fermentation process.|$|E

He propounded the concept of speciation in asexual organisms and the some of techniques he developed for the study of chromosomes with respect to their physical and chemical nature, such as repetitive DNA <b>orcein</b> banding, multiple DNA analysis and analysis of chemical nature of chromosomes, are being practiced globally. He introduced a new protocol for inducing division in adult nuclei through chemical application which assisted in cell rejuvenation. He redefined angiosperm taxonomy, proposed new concepts of the dynamic DNA and dynamic structure and behaviour of chromosomes and suggested the use of embryo irradiation and in-vitro cultures for the generation of variability, and tissue culture as a tool for conservation of endangered species and for maintaining genetic variability. His studies proved that organogenesis, differentiation and reproduction return variable chemical composition of chromosomes while maintaining the genetic skeleton. His researches have been documented by way of several books and over 500 articles; Chromosome Painting: Principles, Strategies and Scope, Chromosome Techniques: Theory and Practice, Chromosome Techniques — A Manual, Botanical Survey of India, Advances in Cell and Chromosome Research, Plant Genome: Biodiversity and Evolution (2 volumes), and Cytology of Different Species of Palms and Its Bearing on the Solution of the Problems of Phylogeny and Speciation are some of his notable works.

40|$|Background and Aim. The best {{staining}} {{to evaluate}} liver fibrosis in liver hepatitis {{is still a}} debated topic. This study aimed to compare Masson’s trichrome (MT), Sirius Red (SR), and <b>orcein</b> stainings in evaluating liver fibrosis in chronic HCV hepatitis (CHC) with semiquantitative and quantitative methods (Collagen Proportionate Area (CPA) by Digital Image Analysis (DIA)) and correlate them with transient elastography (TE). Methods. Liver stiffness evaluation of 111 consecutive patients with CHC was performed by TE. Semiquantitative staging by Metavir score system and CPA by DIA were assessed on liver biopsy stained with MT, SR, and <b>orcein.</b> Results. MT, SR, and <b>orcein</b> staining showed concordant results in 89. 6 % of cases in staging CHC, without significant difference in both semiquantitative and quantitative evaluations of fibrosis. TE values were concordant with <b>orcein</b> levels in 86. 5 % of the cases and with MT/RS in 77. 5 % (P< 0. 001). No significant correlation between the grade of necroinflammatory activity and TE values was found. Conclusion. In CHC, SR/MT and <b>orcein</b> stainings are almost concordant and when discordant, <b>orcein</b> staining is better related to TE values than MT/RS. This suggests that elastic fibers play a more important role than reticular or collagenous ones in determining stiffness values in CHC...|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} shown that {{different}} supplies/batches of <b>orcein</b> perform differently and may fail. The "natural" forms generally performed better although the most informative results were obtained with a "synthetic" product. <b>Orcein</b> dye solutions can be used soon after preparation and for up to 7 days {{without the need for}} differentiation. After 10 days or so the staining properties become much less selective. Non-specific staining severely reduces contrast and upon differentiation overall contrast is reduced and the staining of elastin is reduced. Copper-associated protein positivity gradually fails and after 14 days is lost. For demonstrating HBsAg in paraffin sections of liver, it is best to use <b>orcein</b> dye preparations that are no older than 7 days and to test each batch or <b>orcein</b> against a known positive control...|$|E
40|$|HBs Ag in the hepatocytes {{have been}} stained by <b>orcein</b> methods. However, not only HBs Ag but also {{degenerative}} and necrotic cytoplasm of hepatocytes are occasionally stained by the method, {{that makes it}} difficult to identify HBs Ag. Moreover, <b>orcein</b> dyes have different staining properties from lots to lots, that causes difficulty in obtaining a stable result. Therefore, we tried to modify the <b>orcein</b> method and found that the procedure using a sensitizer (ferric ammonium sulfate or uranium nitrate) after oxidizing solution gave stable and satisfactory results. By this method, in the hepatocytes, only HBs Ag are stained positively. The mechanism of function of the sensitizer is not clear, but we considered that Fe or U ions occupy small gaps in the protain molecular structure in the cells before <b>orcein</b> molecules occupy these gaps and that the method does not give a false positive result. It is also suggested that various HBs-staining-dyes can react with SO_ 3 H groups which are formed by the oxidization of SS groups of proteins. We have developed a new staining method for HBs Ag, using Resorcin-fuchsin. The results of our method were also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis B antigen (HBAg) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in conventional formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue by peroxidase and fluorescent immunostaining {{as well as by}} <b>orcein.</b> Complete locational and morphologic identity is seen between material stained by specific immunologic methods and by <b>orcein.</b> The antigen is restricted to the cytoplasm and is generally observed in the hepatocyte; it is present in three morphologic forms. Certain morphologic forms can even be identified in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue. Results of immunostaining procedures indicate that the antigen demonstrated in this study consists entirely of surface coat of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg). This seems to be the only component revealed by <b>orcein</b> staining. The latter {{is considered to be a}} good marker of the surface antigen and to have certain advantages over immunostaining. It is suggested that suitability of conventional paraffin sections for the detection of HBAg has wide and important implications...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The histochemical {{demonstration}} of hepatic copper {{is important in}} the diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD). Conflicting results have been published with regard to the ability of different histochemical methods to demonstrate copper storage in the liver, Therefore, we evaluated the diagnostic value of three available histochemical methods in a large series of patients affected by WD. Methods and results: Seventy-nine consecutive liver needle biopsies, from 74 patients, 39 males and 35 females, aged 4 - 60 years (mean age 28. 5 years) were stained with <b>orcein,</b> rhodanine and using Timm's method. On the basis of the histological picture, liver biopsies were subdivided into three groups: group A, steatosis: group B, interface hepatitis; group C, chronic hepatitis with bridging fibrosis and/or cirrhosis, In group Al 30. 4 % of the cases were positive using Timm's method, vs 13. 2 % using the rhodanine and 17. 5 % using the <b>orcein</b> method. In group B, Timm's method was positive in 40. 1 % while rhodanine and <b>orcein</b> showed positivity in 26. 7 %. In group C, the Timm's method stained 58. 6 %, rhodanine 36. 6 % and <b>orcein</b> 29. 3 % positively, Conclusions: Our data show that: (1) Timm's silver stain is the most sensitive method for the {{demonstration of}} copper in all cases of WD; (2) rhodanine and <b>orcein</b> have minor value in the diagnosis of WD, especially {{in the early stages of}} the disease; (3) to increase the diagnostic value of histochemistry for copper multiple histochemical stains in serial sections are required: and (4) although hepatic copper concentration is highest in the early stages of WD, the histochemical demonstration fails in a large number of cases...|$|E
40|$|Liver copper {{concentrations}} in percutaneous biopsy specimens were measured by {{neutron activation analysis}} and compared with histological staining for copper by rubeanic acid and rhodanine, and with copper-associated protein stained by <b>orcein.</b> Liver copper concentrations were elevated in 31 of 35 biopsies from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and discrimination between normal and elevated liver copper was correct in 32 of the 35 biopsies by staining with rubeanic acid, and 31 of the 35 by staining with rhodanine. <b>Orcein</b> staining of copper-associated protein was positive in 33 of the 35 biopsies. All 17 biopsy specimens from patients with Wilson's disease had high liver copper concentrations, but only nine had positive staining for copper, and six were <b>orcein</b> positive. Similarly, histological stains gave little indication of the liver copper {{concentrations in}} tissue from 16 patients with chronic active hepatitis. Staining of liver sections {{can be useful in}} detecting elevation of liver copper in PBC, but not in Wilson's disease, where the absolute concentration must be measured.

40|$|Two {{varieties}} of Vigna mungo viz. Barimash- 1 and Barimash- 3 were cytologically studied after staining with <b>orcein</b> and CMA. Both the varieties {{were found to}} possess 2 n = 22 metacentric chromosomes. Total length of diploid complements and range of chromosome length {{were more or less}} same in the two varieties. The <b>orcein</b> stained interphase nucleus of Barimash- 1 had three big heterochromatic blocks, whereas Barimash- 3 possessed several small heterochromatins. The <b>orcein</b> stained prophase chromosomes of Barimash- 1 was darkly stained throughout the entire length. The gradual staining of prophase chromosomes were found in Barimash- 3. The CMA stained interphase nuclei and prophase chromosomes of these two varieties were different. Sixteen entirely CMA banded chromosomes were found in Barimash- 1. The percentage of GC-rich areas was 56. 20. In Barimash- 3, 11 entirely, 4 terminal and 4 centromeric fluoresced banded chromosomes were found. The percentage of GC-rich areas was 63. 40. Although the two varieties showed similar conventional karyotypes, mark differences exist in their fluorescent karyotypes and the properties of interphase nuclei and prophase chromosomes. Therefore, these two varieties could be characterized with the help of modern cytological techniques...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{describe}} the histological {{features of the}} liver in patients with a Fontan circulation. METHODS: Liver biopsies carried out as part of preoperative assessment prior to extracardiac cavopulmonary conversion of an older style Fontan were examined and scored semi-quantitatively for pertinent histological features. To {{support the use of}} the scoring, biopsies were also ranked by eye for severity to allow correlation with assigned scores. RESULTS: Liver biopsies from 18 patients with a Fontan circulation were assessed. All biopsies showed sinusoidal fibrosis. In 17 / 18 cases there was at least fibrous spur formation, with 14 / 18 showing bridging fibrosis and 2 / 18 demonstrating frank cirrhosis. In 17 / 18 cases {{at least some of the}} dense or sinusoidal fibrosis was <b>orcein</b> positive, although a larger proportion of the dense fibrous bands were <b>orcein</b> positive compared with the sinusoidal component. All biopsies showed marked sinusoidal dilation, and 14 / 18 showed bile ductular proliferation. 1 / 18 biopsy showed minimal iron deposition, 1 / 18 showed mild lobular lymphocytic inflammation. There was no cholestasis or evidence of hepatocellular damage. Similar appearances were observed in 2 patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation. Discussion: The histological features of the liver in patients with a Fontan circulation are similar to those described in cardiac sclerosis. Sinusoidal dilatation and sinusoidal fibrosis are marked in the Fontan series. The presence of a significant amount of <b>orcein</b> negative sinusoidal fibrosis suggests there may be a remediable component, although the dense fibrous bands are predominantly <b>orcein</b> positive suggesting chronicity and permanence. No inflammation or hepatocellular damage is evident, suggesting that fibrosis may be mediated by a non-inflammatory mechanism...|$|E

Our aim was to find discriminator histopathologic findings that help us to achieve definite diagnosis without using immunofluorescence study. The histopathologic findings in 77 cases of lichen planopilaris were compared with those of 26 cases of discoid lupus erythematosus with Hematoxylin & Eosin and especially staining (Alcian blue pH 2. 5, Periodic Acid Shiff, <b>Orcein).</b> Final histopathologic diagnosis was based on histologic findings, clinicopathological correlation, past medical history and immunofluorescence studies if were applied before. Then elastic fibers pattern in dermis and follicular sheath with <b>orcein</b> staining were described without having information about final diagnosis. New and subtle presentations of histologic changes were assessed. We compared all histopathologic finding for each staining method. Some histologic changes such as hypergranulosis, epidermal atrophy, mucin deposition, diffuse scar and some other patterns were not specific for any diagnosis. A setting of histopathologic findings and clinicopathological correlation were needed for accurate diagnosis. We had only one specimen for the vertical section, and we had no horizontal sections. Description of elastic fibers pattern in <b>orcein</b> staining may be helpful in achieving a specific diagnosis, but this is not completely reliable, and we had overlap features.
