500|$|In 1910, more partial fossils were {{discovered}} in Dera Bugti during an expedition by the British palaeontologist Clive Forster-Cooper. Based on these remains, Foster-Cooper moved A. bugtiense to the new genus Paraceratherium, meaning [...] "near the hornless beast", in reference to Aceratherium. His rationale for this reclassification was the species' distinctly down-turned lower tusks. In 1913, Forster-Cooper named a new genus and species, Thaumastotherium ("wonderful beast") osborni, based on larger fossils from the same excavations, but he renamed the genus Baluchitherium later that year because the former name was preoccupied, as {{it had already been}} used for a hemipteran insect. The fossils of Baluchitherium were so fragmentary that Foster-Cooper was only able to identify {{it as a kind of}} <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate,</b> but he mentioned the possibility of confusion with Paraceratherium. The American palaeontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, after which B. osborni was named, suggested it may have been a titanothere.|$|E

50|$|Schizotheriines make up an extinct clade of {{the family}} Chalicotheriidae, a group of herbivorous, <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> (perissodactyl) mammals. Unlike the gorilla-like {{proportions}} of other chalicotheres, schizotheriines had smaller body proportions, closer to those of Moropus. Analysis of dental microwear implies most Miocene Schizotheriinae fed on leaves, bark, and twigs.

They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic evidence places bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, with its sister taxon as Fereuungulata, which includes carnivorans, pangolins, <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> even-toed ungulates, and cetaceans.

50|$|Eggysodon is an extinct genus of <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate.</b> It was a small, ground-dwelling browser, and fossils {{have been}} found in Oligocene rocks of Germany. A closely related genus, but with a greater number of incisors and premolars, has been found in Oligocene rocks in Khazakhstan. The genus, Tenisia, was {{described}} in 1915. Eggysodon may have been related to Preaceratherium, and both had tusklike canines and smaller, and fewer, incisors. It is also related to Prohyracodon, and is synonymous with Allacerops.|$|E
50|$|In 1861, Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville (1777-1850) {{classified}} ungulates by {{the structure}} of their feet, differentiating those with an even number of toes from those with an odd number. He moved the horses as solidungulate over to the tapirs and rhinos as multungulate animals and referred {{to all of them}} together as onguligrades à doigts impairs, coming close to the concept of the <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> as a systematic unit. Richard Owen (1804-1892) quoted Blainville in his study on fossil mammals of the Isle of Wight and introduced the name Perissodactyla.|$|E
50|$|Tapirus kabomani (also {{known as}} the little black tapir or kabomani tapir) {{is one of five}} extant species of tapir, large {{browsing}} mammals similar in shape to a pig. It is the smallest tapir species, even smaller than mountain tapir (T. pinchaque), which had been considered the smallest. T. kabomani is found in the Amazon rainforest, where it appears to be sympatric with the South American tapir (T. terrestris). When it was announced in December 2013, T. kabomani was the first <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> discovered in over 100 years.|$|E
50|$|Diplacodon is a genus {{of prehistoric}} <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> {{in the family}} Brontotheriidae. A new species, D. gigan, was {{described}} by Matthew C. Mihlbachler in 2011, from the United States.|$|R
50|$|The other <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> in China are the Mongolian {{wild ass}} and the Tibetan wild ass (kiang). The former is {{endangered}} {{while the latter}} is not. Both are Class I protected species.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, the {{existence}} in the wild of almost all other <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> species has declined dramatically because of hunting and habitat destruction. The quagga is extinct and Przewalski's horse has been eradicated in the wild.|$|R
50|$|Chalicotheriines make up an extinct {{subfamily}} of {{the family}} Chalicotheriidae, a group of herbivorous, <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> (perissodactyl) mammals. Characteristics of this group included a horse-like long head, very long forelimbs, short hindlimbs, a partial knuckle-walking position and a relatively gorilla-like physique. Members of this subfamily were regarded as possessing {{one of the longest}} forelimbs and shortest hindlimbs in relation to each other out of all extinct animals. Analysis of dental wear implies most chalicotheriines fed on seeds and fruit. Their claws were most likely used in a hook-like manner to pull down branches, suggesting they lived as bipedal browsers. Presence of chalicotheriine fossils is generally regarded as an indicator of treed environments.|$|E
50|$|The horse (Equus ferus caballus) {{is one of}} two extant {{subspecies}} of Equus ferus. It is an <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> mammal {{belonging to}} the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication {{is believed to have been}} widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.|$|E
50|$|The present {{distribution}} of most perissodactyl species {{is only a}} small fraction of their original range. Members of this group are now found only in Central and South America, eastern and southern Africa, and cetral, southern, and southeastern Asia. During the peak of <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> existence, from the Eocene to the Oligocene, perissodactyls were distributed over much of the globe, the only exceptions being Australia and Antarctica. Horses and tapirs arrived in South America after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama in the Pliocene, around 3 million years ago. In North America, they died out around 10,000 years ago, while in Europe, the tarpans disappeared in the 19th century. Hunting and habitat restriction have reduced the present-day species to fragmented relict populations. In contrast, domesticated horses and donkeys have gained a worldwide distribution, and feral animals of both species are now also found in regions outside of their original range, such as in Australia.|$|E
50|$|Ungulata, {{which used}} to be {{considered}} an order, has been split into the following: Perissodactyla (<b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates),</b> Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), Tubulidentata (aardvarks), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Sirenia (dugongs and manatees), Proboscidea (elephants) and occasionally Cetacea (whales and dolphins).|$|R
50|$|Bats are placental mammals. They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic studies have now placed bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, along with carnivorans, pangolins, <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> even-toed ungulates, and cetaceans. One study places Chiroptera as a sister taxon to the clade Perissodactyla (which includes horses and other <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates).</b> However, the first phylogenomic analysis of bats in 2013 shows {{as shown in the}} cladogram that Chiroptera is not sister to Perissodactyla, but is the sister clade to a larger group that includes ungulates and carnivores.|$|R
50|$|In 1884, Othniel Charles Marsh (1831-1899) came up {{with the}} concept Mesaxonia, which he used for what are today called the <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> {{including}} their extinct relatives, but explicitly excluding the hyrax. Mesaxonia is now considered a synonym of Perissodactyla, but it was sometimes also used for the true <b>odd-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> as a subcategory (rhinos, horses, tapirs), while Perissodactyla stood for the entire order, including the hyrax. The assumption that hyraxes were Perissodactyla was held well into the 20th century. Only with the advent of molecular genetic research methods had it been recognized that the hyrax is not closely related to perissodactyls but rather to elephants and manatees.|$|R
