5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but on the <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation {{about the idea of}} re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the NFC East and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished on the <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E

To the author, what made Flagg interesting was [...] "the idea of the villain as somebody who was always on the <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in, and hated people who had good fellowship and good conversation and friends".|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the bombing the U.S. {{government}} enacted several pieces of legislation including the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings.

On November 29, it was announced that the band had signed to Fueled by Ramen. Vocalist Shaant Hacikyan said of the label: [...] "There's such an amazing sense of community about the label. ...

500|$|Cagney secured {{his first}} {{significant}} nondancing role in 1925. He played a young tough {{guy in the}} three-act play <b>Outside</b> <b>Looking</b> In by Maxwell Anderson, earning $200 a week. As with Pitter Patter, Cagney went to the audition with little confidence he would get the part. He had no experience with drama at this point. Cagney felt that he only got the role because his hair was redder than that of Alan Bunce, the only other red-headed performer in New York. Both the play and Cagney received good reviews; Life magazine wrote, [...] "Mr. Cagney, in a less spectacular role [...] makes a few minutes silence during his mock-trial scene something that many a more established actor might watch with profit." [...] Burns Mantle wrote that it [...] "...contained the most honest acting now {{to be seen in}} New York." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Will Hermes called Wildflower [...] "a welcome return" [...] {{and wrote}} that [...] "what still sets the Avalanches apart, besides their careful groove pacing, {{attention}} to detail, and {{uncanny ability to}} move you from inside a track to <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in, is their sweet sense of nostalgia." [...] Writing for Exclaim!, Daryl Keating called the album [...] "a real testament to the tenacity of the Avalanches, and one we're truly grateful for." [...] Tim Sendra of AllMusic felt that Wildflower [...] "falls short of expectations, but still ends up being a pretty good album anyway" [...] and considered the abundance of guest performers, {{with the exception of}} Jonathan Donahue, to be unnecessary, concluding that the group [...] "ended up making the best psychedelic Chemical Brothers album ever instead of making another classic Avalanches album." [...] Emily MacKay of NME was less favourable, asking how [...] "something that took so long [...] sound so, well, meh," [...] and ultimately called the album [...] "a faded snapshot of a cosier, very distant-seeming past." ...|$|E
500|$|Bustles Tracy Dye wrote that, in {{addition}} to [...] "7 Lessons About Life & Facing Fear", the song also reinforces the importance of pursuing other opportunities, the belief that [...] "material items don't lead to fulfillment", building new relationships and friendships, exploring new environments, {{and the concept of}} girl power. BuzzFeed's Aylin Zafar described [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as [...] "an anthem for anyone who has ever felt they were on the <b>outside,</b> <b>looking</b> into a place ... that they yearned to be a part of." [...] The Daily Dots Aja Romano believes that the ballad mirrors [...] "every young girl’s wish to get away from her over-protective parents and explore the world", a sentiment shared by Rebecca Rose of Cosmopolitan who dubbed it [...] "every young girl's lament about wanting to be part of something she idolizes." [...] Donna Dickens of HitFix concurred that the song's lyrics are about [...] "yearning to break free from suffocating parental expectations". Writing for Billboard, Taylor Weatherby identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a song about [...] "fantasizing over living a life you can’t," [...] to which he believes many people are able to relate. Derrick Gill of KXKX believes that the song is also based around the traditional saying [...] "Is the grass greener on the other side?" ...|$|E
