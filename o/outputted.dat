5|$|Waller was {{involved}} in the process of mining anthracite and owned large tracts of coal-containing land. In 1837, he invested jointly in an area of coal-containing land in Plymouth Township (now Larksville) with his uncle, Oristus Collins. He and Collins divided the land into their own parcels in 1840. He and several of his siblings also bought a piece of coal-mining land from his father for $10,000 in 1857. Waller gradually bought the coal-containing lots of his siblings until he had close to 250 acres of land with coal in 1872. In 1878, he purchased 28 acres of coal-mining land in Plymouth Township from Joseph Jaquish's heirs. Altogether his coal-mining lands <b>outputted</b> 50,000 tons (45,454 tonnes) per year, although this was {{only a small portion of}} the total coal output of the Wyoming Valley. After retiring as a minister he also purchased 2000 acres of coal-mining land near Chattanooga.|$|E

Vanessa Claire Smith won Best Actress for her gender-bending portrayal of Alex, the music-loving teenage sociopath. This production utilised three separate video streams <b>outputted</b> to seven onstage video monitors – six 19-inch and one 40-inch. In order to preserve the first-person narrative of the book, a pre-recorded video stream of Alex, [...] "your humble narrator", was projected onto the 40-inch monitor, thereby freeing the onstage character during passages {{which would have been}} awkward or impossible to sustain in the breaking of the fourth wall.|$|E

50|$|The {{size of a}} star as well as {{its energy}} output {{generally}} determine a star's thermal lifetime because the measurement is independent of the type of fuel normally found at its center.

50|$|Using recursion, a (post-order) depth-first {{traversal}} can {{be implemented}} by starting at the root node and recursively traversing each child subtree in turn (the subtree based at each child node) - the second child subtree does not start processing until the first child subtree is finished. Once a leaf node is reached or the children of a branch node have been exhausted, the node itself is visited (e.g., {{the value of the}} node itself is <b>outputted).</b> In this case, the call stack (of the recursive functions) acts as the stack that is iterated over.|$|E

The third generation received a minor facelift in 1990, with late models receiving the same engines as were seen in the subsequent generation.|$|E
50|$|When {{speaking}} about altering inputs, preprocessing is often misused. In computer science, a preprocessor and preprocessing are entirely different. When preprocessing {{is used in}} context, the usual intention is to portray the concept of input enhancement, and not that of utilizing a preprocessor. Implementing a preprocessor is the concept in which a program takes an input and processes it into an output {{to be used by}} another program entirely. This sounds like input enhancement, but the application of preprocessor applies to the generic program that processes the source input to be <b>outputted</b> in a format that a compiler can read and can then be compiled.|$|E

5000|$|When {{altering}} {{a signal}} with a filter, the <b>outputted</b> signal may differ in {{time from the}} signal at the input, which is called a change in phase.

This phase distortion can create the perception of a [...] "ringing" [...] sound around the filter band, or other coloration.

50|$|The {{proposed}} theory {{claims that}} the invisible hand {{is a symptom of}} the existence of another dimension of a market, which is of computational nature. A market and its agents are unaware of this, because only piece(s), or result(s) of this symptom can be observed. In this dimension, the nature of a market and agents creates a complete, programmable computer on the platform of brains of agents and the physical structure of the market. This computer is self-programming and since it exists and functions on the platform of market agents' brains, results of computations are <b>outputted</b> via the brains of agents and represent themselves as the behavior of a market.

Moreover, partial differential equations(PDEs) problems can be solved by parallel programs which are generated by P-NCAS supports. P-NCAS employs the Single Program Multi Data (SPMD) and uses a decomposition method for the parallelisation. These enable users of P-NCAS to input problems described by PDES, algorithm and discretisation scheme etc., and to view and edit all details through the visualisation and windows for edition. At last, parallel program will be <b>outputted</b> in C language by P-NCAS and also include documents which show everything has inputted in the beginning.|$|E
50|$|Artists {{working with}} CGI-Computer-generated imagery {{animation}} computers create pictures frame by frame.

SGI computers started the high-end CGI-Computer-generated imagery animation stystems, but with faster computers {{and the growth of}} Linux-based systems, many others are on the market now. Toy Story, and Tarzan are two samples of movies which were made in CGI and then film-out. The most CGI work is done in 2K Display resolution files (about the size of QXGA), but 4K Display resolution is on the rise.

In a column in the journal Nature, Philip Ball pointed out that since water is created by burning hydrogen, it cannot be used as a fuel by generating hydrogen from water and then burning it. Such process requires providing an equal or greater amount of energy than is <b>outputted.</b> This observation is one of the foundation principles of the laws of thermodynamics. Kanzius acknowledged that this process could not be considered an energy source, as more energy is used to produce the RF signal than can be obtained from the burning gas and stated in July 2007 that he never claimed his discovery would replace oil, asserting only that his discovery was [...] "thought provoking".|$|E

50|$|While she {{was known}} to have touched many {{different}} artists, she also touched {{the lives of millions}} of her listeners and fans.

The themes at the surface were about love yet with deeper interpretation of the lyrics as seen in the song Salue Qalbi, it questions political motives in times of political tension. Umm Kulthum's political rhetoric in her music is still influential today, not only in Egypt, but in many other middle eastern countries and even globally. For example, at the Baalbak Music Festival in Lebanon, many listeners are able to relate to her music that speaks out about the hardships of war and injustices.

5000|$|Before this, the {{director}} and cameraman controlled {{the production of the}} picture, but Ince put the producer in charge of the film from inception to final product.

By 1913, the concept of the production manager had been created. With the aid of George Stout, an accountant for NYMP, Ince re-organized how films were <b>outputted</b> to bring discipline to the process. After this adjustment the studio's weekly output increased from one to two, and later three two-reel pictures per week, released under such names as [...] "Kay-Bee" [...] (Kessel-Baumann), [...] "Domino" [...] (comedy), and [...] "Broncho" [...] (western) productions. These were written, produced, cut, and assembled, with the finished product delivered within a week.
