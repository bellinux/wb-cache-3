40|$|The use {{of audio}} in human-computer {{interfaces}} is gaining much attention nowadays. A neglected {{issue in this}} regard is the fact that human beings perceive sounds in a spatial context. Simulated spatial sound presented over headphones has many potential uses in a number of elds, such as virtual reality, visualization, and three <b>dimensional</b> <b>drawing</b> applications. This thesis presents the results of a study of literature on the spatial sound perception of human beings, as well as the state of a airs in spatial sound simulation. In addition, a simple experimental system for spatial sound simulation is presented, along with the results of several experiments that were conducted with this system. The system, called the SAGA system (Spatial Audio in Graphical Applications), was built to investigate the usability of spatial sound in three dimensional graphical applications such as visualization and three <b>dimensional</b> <b>drawing.</b> Two primary uses of spatial sound in such applications are envisioned: (1) the active localization of virtual sound sources in a three dimensional virtual environment, {{in order to be able}} to move the point of view or a three dimensional cursor towards this sound source, and (2) as an aid in the position determination of a cursor in a three dimensional virtual environment.

The construction lines projected from one drawing type to the next dissipated as the forms they buttressed emerged. Projections, which have been quietly guiding the geometry of architecture for centuries, have remained an untapped design resource for too long.

The construction lines frame potential represented space, which are projected from one drawing type to the next in order to clarify a proposed spatial construct.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{hierarchical}} force-directed method for drawing large graphs. The algorithm produces a graph embedding in an Euclidean space E of any dimension. A {{two or three}} <b>dimensional</b> <b>drawing</b> of the graph is then obtained by projecting a higher-dimensional embedding into a two or three dimensional subspace of E. Projecting high-dimensional drawings onto two or three dimensions often results in drawings that are "smoother" and more symmetric. Among the other notable features of our approach are the utilization of a maximal independent set filtration of the set of vertices of a graph, a fast energy function minimization strategy, efficient memory management, and an intelligent initial placement of vertices. Our implementation of the algorithm can draw graphs {{with tens of thousands}} of vertices using a negligible amount of memory in less than one minute on a mid-range PC...|$|R
40|$|<b>Drawing</b> three <b>dimensional</b> {{models of}} {{geological}} phenom-ena is today a process requiring training in specific pro-grams {{and can be}} very time consuming.

We propose an approach for making rapid geologic il-lustrations in 3 D. The novel idea for the approach consists of sketch based input on a cube {{in order to create}} a layered geological structure. Details can be added to the layers by sketching geological concepts such as rivers, mountains and valleys. Sedimentary deposits can be created through a procedural modeling approach. Awareness of the ge-ologic domain enables a sparse amount of input strokes to be interpreted into geological structures. Results from user-studies show that the proposed approach can be used with success to model geological scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Solid-state phase {{transformation}} kinetics between ferrite (α) and austenite (γ) phases in a C-Mn steel were {{investigated by the}} dilatometry and in-situ neutron diffraction methods, respectively. Dilatometry is commonly used to study the {{phase transformation}} kinetics. It infers the allotropic phase transformation from the <b>overall</b> <b>dimensional</b> changes, e. g., the diameter changes of the specimen, during heating and/or cooling. In this regard, it is an indirect measurement technique. Alternatively, neutron diffraction directly detects and measures the individual phases as they present during different stages of phase transformation. A comparative study was made in this work between the dilatometry and the in-situ neutron diffraction methods. The comparison shows that dilatometry analysis would cause the under-estimation of austenite phase evolution {{as a function of}} temperature due to the drastic deviation of linear expansion assumption of austenite as function of temperature...|$|R
40|$|Dimensional {{accuracy}} of workpart under machining is {{strongly influenced by}} {{the layout of the}} fixturing elements like locators and clamps. Setup or geometrical errors in locators result in overall machining error of the feature under consideration. Therefore it is necessary to ensure that the layout is optimized for the desired machining tolerance for a given deviation in the set up or geometry of the locator. Also, the locator layout should be capable of holding the workpart in a unique position during machining thus providing deterministic location. This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization method to arrive at a layout of error containing locators for minimum machining error satisfying the tolerance requirements and providing deterministic location. A three dimensional workpiece under the 3 - 2 - 1 locating scheme is studied. Results indicate that by optimally placing the error containing locators the geometric error component of the machining error can be substantially reduced thus enabling compliance to <b>overall</b> <b>dimensional</b> requirements...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that young children do not attempt to represent depth relationships between objects in their drawings. The present study, however, showed that when both objects are visible and the children’s attention is drawn to the depth relationship between them, most 5 -, 6 -, and 7 -year-olds do attempt to portray this relationship. The representation in a two <b>dimensional</b> <b>drawing</b> of a spatial depth relationship between two discrete objects (i. e. one behind the other) has been studied by Freeman, Eiser, and Sayers (1977). When asked to draw one apple behind another, 5 - and 6 -year-olds drew the objects separately, side by side; 7 -year-olds drew them with the further object vertically above the nearer one; children of 9 years and older drew one object partially obscuring the other to indicate depth. When the same children were asked to draw one apple in front of another the results were less clearcut; because the further object was drawn first, partial occlusion of the further object by the nearer one as a possible means of indicating the dept...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} novel {{hierarchical}} force-directed method for drawing large graphs. Given a graph G=(V,E), the algorithm produces an embedding for G in an Euclidean space E of any dimension. A {{two or three}} <b>dimensional</b> <b>drawing</b> of the graph is then obtained by projecting a higher-dimensional embedding into a two or three dimensional subspace of E. Such projections typically result in drawings that are “smoother” and more symmetric than direct drawings in 2 D and 3 D. In order to obtain fast placement of the vertices of the graph our algorithm employs a multi-scale technique based on a maximal independent set filtration of vertices of the graph. While most existing force-directed algorithms begin with an initial random placement of all the vertices, our algorithm attempts to place vertices “intelligently”, close to their final positions. Other notable features of our approach include a fast energy function minimization strategy and efficient memory management. Our implementation of the algorithm can draw graphs {{with tens of thousands}} of vertices using a negligible amount of memory in less than one minute on a 550  MHz Pentium PC...|$|R

This corresponds to a maximum relative variation of between 0. 6 % and 0. 9 %. Sidewall roughnesses were found to be in the range of 0. 02 {mu}m to 0. 03 {mu}m, an insignificant contribution to the total variation when compared to <b>overall</b> <b>dimensional</b> variation.

40|$|The {{world is}} (at least) three {{dimensional}} in our perception although {{when it comes}} to representation we have become used to the simplification of the ‘reality’ into two dimensions (2 D). Most situations in a cadastre can be represented in 2 D on a map without that this representation causes too many uncertainties or queries. However, with current developments in architecture, registration of apartment rights and underground cables and pipelines the representation of real estate objects in 2 D is often no longer adequate in representing unambiguously the ‘reality’ (Figure 1). In the case of apartment rights a three <b>dimensional</b> <b>drawing</b> is sometimes provided to furnish an idea where in the building these rights are located. Modern technologies, however, allow us increasingly to represent the ‘reality’ in three dimensions (3 D). Technologies for creating and managing 3 D geoinformation have matured while costs for such information and 3 D-tools have significantly decreased. These tools enable us to represent the ‘reality’ in an improved manner. Ongoing developments will allow us to represent the ‘reality’ in future even in 4 D (including time) (Van Oosterom et al. 2006) and 5 D (including time and scale dimensions) (Van Oosterom and Stoter 2010) ...|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional digital {{modeling}} of heritage {{works of art}} through optical scanners, has been demonstrated in recent years with results of exceptional interest. However, the routine application of three-dimensional (3 D) modeling to heritage conservation still requires a systematic investigation {{of a number of}} technical problems. The paper describes the process of acquiring a 3 D digital model of the Maddalena by Donatello, a wooden statue representing one of the major masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance which was swept away by the Florence flood of 1966, and subsequently restored. The paper reports all the steps of the acquisition procedure, from the project planning to the solution of the various problems due to range camera calibration and to optically noncooperative material. Since the scientific focus is centered on the 3 D model's <b>overall</b> <b>dimensional</b> accuracy, a methodology for its quality control is described. Such control has demonstrated how, in some situations, the ICP-based alignment can lead to incorrect results. To circumvent this difficulty, we propose an alignment technique based on the fusion of ICP (iterative closest point) with close-range digital photogrammetry and a noninvasive procedure in order to generate a final accurate model. Detailed results are presented, demonstrating the improvement of the final model, and how the proposed sensor fusion ensures a prespecified level of accuracy...|$|R
