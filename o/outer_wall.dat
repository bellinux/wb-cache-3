5|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> was 2m thick at its base, and {{featured}} arched chambers on {{the level}} of the peribolos, crowned with a battlemented walkway, reaching a height of 8.5–9m. Access to the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> from the city was provided either through the main gates or through small posterns on the base of the inner wall's towers. The <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> likewise had towers, situated approximately midway between the inner wall's towers, and acting in supporting role to them. They are spaced at 48–78m, with an average distance of 50–66m. Only 62 of the outer wall's towers survive. With few exceptions, they are square or crescent-shaped, 12–14m tall and 4m wide. They featured a room with windows {{on the level}} of the peribolos, crowned by a battlemented terrace, while their lower portions were either solid or featured small posterns, which allowed access to the outer terrace. The <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> was a formidable defensive edifice in its own right: in the sieges of 1422 and 1453, the Byzantines and their allies, being too few to hold both lines of wall, concentrated on the defence of the <b>outer</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
5|$|Structure 5D-96 is {{the central}} temple {{on the east side}} of the Plaza of the Seven Temples. It has been {{restored}} and its rear <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> is decorated with skull-and-crossbones motifs.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner and}} outer walls were {{constructed}} similarly with the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> measuring nine feet high and 18 inches thick, which was also coated in plaster. The <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> {{is believed to have}} been constructed during the fifteenth century. The construction of the inner wall has been attributed to the Portuguese presence along the coast in the sixteenth century, whilst the presence of gun ports has been used to infer that the walls were not constructed earlier. However, the practicality of the walls as defensive fortification is unclear, since according to Kirkman the walls and gates surrounding the town have no significant strength, which seems to conform to a proposal that the walls and the layout of buildings were used to maintain social barriers. Although the inner wall has a more obvious defensive function and despite the absence of gun ports and the questionable strength of the <b>outer</b> <b>wall,</b> it has nonetheless been credited as being a fortification.|$|E

5|$|Images of the parshvadevatas (attendant deities) {{are placed}} in the central niches of the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> (bada) on three sides: the eight-armed Durga slaying Mahishasura on the south; the six-armed goddess Chamunda {{standing}} on Shiva on the west and an empty niche on the north, which probably had a goddess figure that was stolen. The lintel of the attendant deity niche has Gaja Lakshmi figurines. The frames of the niches are decorated with scrollwork and kirtimukha motifs and two female attendants accompany each niche. The uppermost part of the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> has ten horizontal mouldings, ornate with scrollwork, kirtimukha and lotus and floral motifs. Within the vimana lies the garbhagriha (sanctum), which is topped with a pancharatha-style, curvilinear temple pinnacle.|$|E

5|$|The {{modified}} castle {{was completed}} by 1808, and held eight 24-pounder (11kg) guns along the <b>outer</b> <b>wall,</b> a gun {{on the roof of}} the southern bastion, and another on top of the keep itself. The new castle could hold a garrison of 40 men.|$|E
5|$|At {{the core}} of Craigmillar Castle is the 14th-century L-plan tower house, built on a rocky outcrop. Wrapped around this is the 15th-century {{courtyard}} wall, with ranges of buildings at the south-east, east, and west. Beyond the wall is a lower <b>outer</b> <b>wall,</b> enclosing a broad outer courtyard. This contained gardens and a chapel. Further gardens lay to the south, where {{the outline of a}} fish pond can be seen.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being divided by {{the inner and outer}} walls, which created an urban core occupied by the site's foremost buildings and areas of occupation between and outside of the <b>outer</b> <b>wall,</b> Gedi has a well-established infrastructure. Gedi's structures appear to be formally arranged in accordance with streets laid out in a grid pattern. Additionally the site contained sumps to collect storm water and lavatories in many of its primary buildings.|$|E

5|$|Spectra {{taken of}} this crater during the Clementine mission {{were used to}} perform mineral mapping. The data {{indicated}} that the central peak {{is a type of}} rock called anorthosite, which is a slow-cooling form of igneous rock composed of plagioclase feldspar. By contrast the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> is troctolite, a rock composed of equal parts plagioclase and olivine.|$|E
5|$|The Western Chalukya {{decorative}} inventiveness {{focused on}} the pillars, door panels, lintels (torana), domical roofs in bays, <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> decorations such as Kirtimukha (gargoyle faces common in Western Chalukya decoration), and miniature towers on pilasters. Although the art form of these artisans {{does not have any}} distinguishing features from a distance, a closer examination reveals their taste for decoration. An exuberance of carvings, bands of scroll work, figural bas-reliefs and panel sculptures are all closely packed. The doorways are highly ornamented but have an architectural framework consisting of pilasters, a moulded lintel and a cornice top. The sanctum receives diffused light through pierced window screens flanking the doorway; these features were inherited and modified by the Hoysala builders. The <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> decorations are well rendered. The Chalukyan artisans extended the surface of the wall by means of pilasters and half pilasters. Miniature decorative towers of multiple types are supported by these pilasters. These towers are of the dravida tiered type, and in the nagara style they were made in the latina (mono aedicule) and its variants; the bhumija and sekhari.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{is located}} on the top of an {{irregular}} plateau, whose southern, eastern and northern slopes are abrupt, with the softer western slope, towards the modern village of Kastro, offering the easiest access. The heart of the fortress consists of a large hexagonal keep, complemented towards the west, where the terrain is more accessible, by an additional <b>outer</b> <b>wall,</b> likewise of irregular polygonal outline, enclosing a second, much wider courtyard (the outer ward).|$|E
5|$|The outer {{gate of the}} {{fortress}} lies in the northwestern side of the outer ward, originally within a small recess in the outer curtain wall, protected by a portcullis. The recess was later filled by the Turks with a smaller set of walls, so as to preserve unbroken the outer wall's frontage. The Ottomans also added additional buttresses to the junctions of their wall with the original curtain wall, while {{the space between the}} original gate and the new, Ottoman entrance was left unroofed and open to the sky. From the gate, the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> continues east and then south, in three distinct stretches of walls, to the keep. The wall is built of limestone masonry, with little evidence of brick or tiles, topped by a small inner parapet and Ottoman-built crenellations, now largely ruined. From the beginning, buildings were built leaning on the <b>outer</b> <b>wall,</b> as evidenced by the remnant of their foundations, side walls joining the curtain wall's inner face, or the presence of fireplaces and lancet windows in the curtain wall. One of these buildings is largely preserved immediately next to the outer gate. Windows, fireplaces etc. display a uniformity of style that points to their construction {{at the same time as}} {{the fortress}} itself. At the point where the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> joins the keep, a small postern is located, as well as a stairway leading up to the outer wall's chemin de ronde.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the inner}} wall {{there are two}} mosques, a palace or Sheikh's house, four large houses, several {{clustered}} houses, and four large pillar tombs comprising the urban core. The inner wall also encloses four other houses and three other mosques. Between {{the inner and outer}} walls few stone structures have been identified with the exception of two mosques. Immediately beyond the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> there is one mosque and several other unidentified structures.|$|E

5|$|Angkor Wat is {{the prime}} example of the {{classical}} style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident {{in the use of}} sandstone (rather than brick or laterite) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested.|$|E
