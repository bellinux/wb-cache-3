40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to compare the essays of William Hazlitt and Cyprian Kamil Norwid. The {{comparative}} surface focuses on the issue, repeatedly touched by them, of tasks imposed on a nineteenth-century journalist. The social and political duties <b>of</b> the <b>nineteenth-century</b> <b>writings</b> are discussed on the faith of exclusively non-fictional texts of both authors. The result of the comparison is the reconstruction of demands placed by Hazlitt and Norwid on the nineteenth-century press...|$|R
40|$|For most <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> socialists, whose <b>writings</b> are {{examined}} in {{the scope of this}} paper, women’s equality with men was understood mainly in terms of their equal participation in the working collective. However, this concept of equality left unexamined the sexual division of labor by which men are central to production and women are central to reproduction. In the process of change towards a new socialist society, women were given the additional role of workers, but the bases of the unequal gender order were never contested...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the ways in which}} female same-sex desires were represented across a range <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> European medical <b>writings.</b> While recognizing the conceptual innovations of the late-nineteenth-century psychiatric idea of “sexual inversion,” it argues that the category of “sexual invert” was positioned alongside other medical representations of same-sex desires, such as gynecological descrip- tions of women with hypertrophy of the clitoris and socio-cultural analy- ses of the tribade-prostitute. These representations complicate current historical accounts of sexual inversion, which emphasize conceptual rup- tures within the history of medicine...|$|R
40|$|As has {{now become}} a {{familiar}} image in Hope’s writings, once again ttie idea of looking at a society from the position of an outsider and an exile forms the central theme of Darkest England (1996). In this satirical novel, the tradition <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> travel <b>writings</b> set in a colonial context is reversed, undermined, and then remarkably recreated to portray the present-day manifestation of encounters and relations between (black) Africa and the (white) West. Presenting the (fictional) journals of a Khoisan leader, David Mungo Booi, within a dynamic frame of reference to classical colonial texts by, among others, Livingstone and Stanley. Hope writes a new travel report. This essay discusses how, by the reversal of point of view, a change in time and space, and creating a satirical mood, the colonizer and the colonized are interchanged and the original texts are evoked to be rewritten. The notions of Self/Other, colonial /(post-) colonial and primitive/civilized are placed in new and disturbing contexts, adding to the complex structure of this fascinating text...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 8350 This thesis {{draws on}} the {{writings}} of a number <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> musical commentators, including Richard Pohl, Hermann Deiters, Selmar Bagge, Adolf Schubring, Franz Brendel, and Eduard Hanslick. These critics were writing for the Neue Zeitschrift fur Musik in the 1860 s, the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung in the 1860 s and 1870 s, and the Neue Freie Press from the 1860 s to {{the turn of the}} century. The major findings are that there are traces of the ?revisionist? views of recent commentators on Brahms in these <b>nineteenth-century</b> <b>writings.</b> Thus these writings can be understood as a significant part of Brahms Rezeptionsgeschichte...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the city of}} Rome as a primary context of British sociability and portrait identity {{during the period from}} 1740 to 1830. Part I considers the work of the portrait painter Pompeo Batoni. It {{examines the}} pictorial record of grand tourist sociability at Rome in the 1750 s, questioning the complex articulation of nationality among British visitors, and the introduction of overt references to antiquity in the portraiture of Pompeo Batoni. It subsequently interrogates Batoni's use of the partially nude Vatican Ariadne sculpture in five portraits of male grand tourists, dating from Charles John Crowle in 1762, to Thomas William Coke in 1774. Part II of this thesis considers the realities of viewing the sculpted body at Rome, recreating the studios of sculptors Christopher Hewetson and Antonio Canova. It postis the studio space as a locus of sociability for British visitors to Rome, drawing on the feminine gaze in the form <b>of</b> the early <b>nineteenth-century</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> Charlotte Eaton and Lady Murray. The final chapter moves from the focus on British sitters to examine sculpture by Antonio Canova, framing it within a wider discourse of masculinity and propriety. Thte reception of Canova's nude portrait sculpture of Napoleon Bonaparte and Pauline Borghese is considered as indicative of cultural anxieties stemming from new conceptions of gender...|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is 'British Perceptions of the Ottoman Empire (1876 - 1908). The thesis explores the 'cultural {{dimension}} 1 of relations between the Ottoman Empire and Britain in this period, involving an examination of ideas about and representations of Ottoman society and its peoples. The overall aim is to {{stress the importance of}} these representations in in influencing and affecting relations between Britain and the Ottoman Empire. <b>Nineteenth-century</b> <b>writings</b> about the Ottoman Empire produce strong images of Ottoman society and steroetypes of the Turkish and Christian populations. These images are reconstructed and their significance examined. The approach is contextual and perceptions are analysed in the historical, material and cultural framework of late Victorian Britain. Descriptions of Ottoman society are treated as representations of that complex reality, with varying degrees of accuracy and inaccuracy, reflecting or distorting conditions in the Empire. In addition the relationship between older ideas and ideas developing at a new historical conjuncture <b>of</b> late <b>nineteenth-century</b> imperialism are considered important factors in determining the overall image of the Ottoman Empire in the late Victorian mind. In these ways the conclusion stresses the importance of, and the relationship between ideas about the Ottoman Empire, and the concrete factors of inter-state relations of which they are part. As such the subject contributes {{to an understanding of the}} multi-dimensional nature <b>of</b> <b>nineteenth-century</b> relations between a weak and strong state in the International system, and the degree to which culture and ideas are informed by these relationships of power. The study contributes to a greater understanding of the Eastern question and sheds light on many of the ideas that have come to influence modern historiography about the Ottoman past and the appreciation of Ottoman and European diplomatic history. </p...|$|R
