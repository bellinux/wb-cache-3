5|$|Serbia's strongest {{exports to}} the United States include Fiat {{automobiles}} manufactured in Kragujevac. Fiat purchased Zastava Automobili in 2008 and subsequently managed the factory in Kragujevac {{so that it would}} produce new Fiat automobiles as opposed to Zastava models (the last Zastavas were produced in 2008); in May 2013 alone, 3,000 Fiat 500L units were shipped from Serbia to Baltimore for sale in the United States. The Fiat 500L is the first automobile to have been exported from Serbia to the United States since the Zastava Koral before 1992, and is proving to be a popular model with a large amount of advertising in the United States. Serbia is also the largest exporter <b>of</b> <b>raspberries</b> in the world (as of 2009), and much of the raspberries consumed in the United States are grown in Šumadija. In 2015, the two states discussed to find ways to increase investments in Serbia.|$|E
25|$|Cabernet Franc shares many of {{the same}} {{phenolic}} and aroma compounds as Cabernet Sauvignon but with some noticeable differences. Cabernet Franc tends to be more lightly pigmented and produces wines with the same level of intensity and richness. Cabernet Franc tends to have a more pronounced perfume with notes <b>of</b> <b>raspberries,</b> blackcurrants, violets and graphite. It is often characterized by a green, vegetal strike that can range from leaves to green bell peppers. It has slightly less tannins than Cabernet Sauvignon and tends to produce a wine with a smoother mouthfeel. New World examples of Cabernet Franc tend to emphasize the fruit more and may delay harvesting the grapes to try to minimize the green leafy notes.|$|E
2500|$|With over [...] planted under vine, the Loire Valley {{is about}} two-thirds {{the size of}} the Bordeaux wine region. Due to its {{location}} and marginal climate, the overall quality of a vintage has a dramatic effect {{on the quality of the}} region's winesmore so than with other French wine regions. The most common hazard is that the cool climate will prevent the grapes from ripening fully and developing the sugars needed to balance the naturally high acidity of the grapes. During these cool vintages the Sauvignon blanc based wines are lighter in color, less fruity and have more pronounced mineral notes. The Cabernet franc based wines are also lighter in color with more vegetal or [...] "weed"-like aromas. In riper vintages, a Loire Cabernet franc will develop aromas <b>of</b> <b>raspberries</b> and lead pencil shavings.|$|E

2500|$|As {{well as a}} comic device {{randomly}} {{inserted into}} different sketches to avoid silence, the blowing <b>of</b> <b>raspberries</b> entered the Goons as Harry Secombe's signal to the other actors {{that he was going}} to crack up; you would hear a joke from him, a raspberry, and a stream of laughter. [...] In the Goons' musical recording [...] "The Ying-Tong Song", Milligan performed a solo for raspberry-blower, as one might for tuba or baritone saxophone. [...] Milligan made much use of a rather surreal Columbia 78RPM sound effects disc, catalogue number YB20, which bears the innocuous title [...] "Donkey" [...] on the label. Approximating possibly to the most obscene and flatulent noise ever recorded, it appeared first in the show [...] "The Sinking of Westminster Pier" [...] as a sound to accompany an oyster opening its shell; it thereafter became known as Fred the Oyster, and appears as such in the scripts. [...] This recording was often used as a reaction to a bad joke. Examples include The Last Goon Show of All where Neddie shouts old jokes into a fuel tank in order to [...] "start the show".|$|E
