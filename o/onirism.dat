50|$|<b>Onirism</b> was a surrealist Romanian {{literary}} school {{most popular}} during the 1960s, {{in the wake}} of popular uprisings in Eastern Europe. One of the techniques it employed was automatic writing.|$|E
50|$|Theoretical texts, very {{important}} for the understanding of the aesthetical <b>onirism,</b> written by Leonid Dimov and Dumitru Țepeneag, can be found in Corin Braga Momentul oniric, Ed. Cartea Românească, 1997.|$|E
50|$|The son of Nadejda Dimov and Naum Mordcovici, {{he was one}} of {{the main}} representatives (together with, amongst others, Dumitru Țepeneag) of <b>onirism</b> in Romanian poetry, {{explorer}} of the dream as an absolute, objective reality.|$|E
5000|$|In psychiatry, <b>onirism</b> {{refers to}} a mental state in which visual {{hallucinations}} occur while fully awake. It {{is a symptom of}} some parasomnias (such as REM sleep behavior disorder and breakdown syndromes), but is more often associated with drug abuse.|$|E
5000|$|Ruxandra Cesereanu has a {{large number}} of {{contributions}} to literature, which, according to literary critic Paul Cernat, makes her [...] "one of the most creative literary women in post-revolutionary Romania". Much of her early work, Cernat argues, is characterized by [...] "mannerism", related to <b>Onirism</b> and using psychoanalytic techniques. The links with <b>Onirism</b> and Surrealism have also been noted by critic Matei Călinescu, who also noted that Cesereanu took inspiration from the tradition of fairy tales and legends, in particular in pieces where she reinterprets Arthurian legends and retells the mythical search for the Holy Grail. Cesereanu's collaborator and literary historian Doina Jela describes her prose as [...] "postmodern", while historian and civil society activist Adrian Marino calls her [...] "the most original, but also the most paradoxical writer from Cluj-Napoca".|$|E
50|$|The {{author of}} several prose and poetry volumes, Cesereanu became noted for her lyrical depictions of {{femininity}} and eroticism, many of which attracted critical acclaim in her native country. They are believed by several commentators to {{have been influenced by}} Surrealism and its Romanian successor, <b>Onirism,</b> and seen as examples of Postmodernism, while Cesereanu herself identified some of her writings with psychedelic experience and with the coined term delirionism. She is also noted for collaborating with Romanian-born American poet Andrei Codrescu on two poems, both of which were completed through e-mail exchanges.|$|E
50|$|Iordan Chimet (November 18, 1924 - May 23, 2006) was a Romanian poet, children's {{writer and}} essayist, whose work was {{inspired}} by Surrealism and <b>Onirism.</b> He {{is also known as}} a memoirist, theater, art and film critic, book publisher and translator. Chimet, who was an opponent of totalitarianism in general and of the Communist regime in particular, was persecuted by the latter as a dissident, and lived much of his life in obscurity. His experience as an employee of the cooperative society Centrocoop also {{made him one of the}} first professional copywriters in his country.|$|E
