2500|$|In the December 2004 ROC Legislative elections, {{although}} the then-ruling DPP party increased {{its share of}} votes in the legislature and remained the largest single party there, the pan-blue coalition maintained a razor-thin majority, which surprised many. However, this result may have been less a reflection of popular sentiment than {{a testament to the}} effectiveness of the KMT's more frugal nomination of candidates (116) compared with the DPP's <b>over-nomination</b> of candidates (122) and the KMT's rigid party rules for allotment of votes to its candidates within individual districts. [...] This election result ended most prospects of an immediate declaration of independence and also called into question whether there really had been an increase in Taiwanese independence sentiment. [...] Despite this, the PRC proceeded with the drafting of the law. [...] The main reasons given to Western interlocutors were that the PRC leadership believed that its Taiwan policy in the past had been reactive rather than proactive and that it was necessary for the PRC to show initiative rather than merely react to events. [...] Furthermore, Beijing expressed residual distrust for Chen Shui-bian. [...] Many Western experts have argued that the PRC's decision-making system was rigid, and that plans put into place to deal with a pan-green victory had simply developed too much momentum to be shut down.|$|E
40|$|Women {{who start}} college {{in one of}} the natural or {{physical}} sciences leave in greater proportions than their male peers. The reasons for this difference are complex, and one possible contributing factor is the social environment women experience in the classroom. Using social network analysis, we explore how gender influences the confidence that college-level biology students have in each other's mastery of biology. Results reveal that males are more likely than females to be named by peers as being knowledgeable about the course content. This effect increases as the term progresses, and persists even after controlling for class performance and outspokenness. The bias in nominations is specifically due to males over-nominating their male peers relative to their performance. The <b>over-nomination</b> of male peers is commensurate with an overestimation of male grades by 0. 57 points on a 4 point grade scale, indicating a strong male bias among males when assessing their classmates. Females, in contrast, nominated equitably based on student performance rather than gender, suggesting they lacked gender biases in filling out these surveys. These trends persist across eleven surveys taken in three different iterations of the same Biology course. In every class, the most renowned students are always male. This favoring of males by peers could influence student self-confidence, and thus persistence in this STEM discipline...|$|E
