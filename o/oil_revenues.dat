5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and the huge <b>oil</b> <b>revenues</b> it was {{generating}} enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve {{the standard of living}} of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As <b>oil</b> <b>revenues</b> fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on <b>oil</b> <b>revenues</b> and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> and the service GDP of Sudan for the period 2000 to 2012. To achieve this goal, {{secondary}} data were collected and analyzed using regression methods. The results reveal a causal relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> (independent variable) and service GDP (dependent variables). Regression analysis result suggests that <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> affects the service GDP positively. <b>Oil</b> <b>revenue</b> is estimated to have contributed to 78. 8 percent of variation in GDP between 2000 and 2012. Furthermore, a unit change in <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> will cause a. 0246 percent change in service GDP...|$|R
40|$|This study {{takes on}} the {{relationship}} between <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> and government expenditures on education in the country of Saudi Arabia during the period of 1975 - 2007. The study tried {{to find out if the}} fast increase in <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> caused a similar increase in government expenditures on education during the above period. The study used linear regression analyses between <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> on one hand and Saudi budget expenditures on education the other hand. <b>Oil</b> <b>revenue</b> was the independent variable in the linear regression analyses and the government expenditures on education was the dependent variables. The findings of the study suggest there is a valid positive relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> and government expenditures on education in Saudi Arabia during the period of 1975 - 2007. The study concluded that the increase in <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> in the this period had lead to a relatively strong increase in education expenditures.

40|$|The {{country of}} Saudi Arabia has been {{generating}} increasingly more {{revenue from sales}} of crude oil in recent years. As a result, the country’s economy has been growing at a rapid pace. Some economists and researchers argue that the economy of Saudi Arabia has not been growing at the same pace as the growth in <b>oil</b> <b>revenue.</b> This study tried to explore the effect that greater <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> has been having on one {{sector of the economy}} which is infrastructure. The study explored the relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> and government expenditures on infrastructure during the period of 1983 - 2007. The study tried {{to find out if the}} increase in <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> was associated with a similar increase in government expenditures on infrastructure during the period of 1983 to 2007. The findings of this study suggested that the increase in <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> was not associated with a similar increase in government expenditures on infrastructure...|$|R
5|$|Oil and gas {{were first}} landed in 1978 at Sullom Voe, which has {{subsequently}} {{become one of}} the largest terminals in Europe. Taxes from the oil have increased public sector spending on social welfare, art, sport, environmental measures and financial development. Three quarters of the islands' workforce is employed in the service sector, and the Shetland Islands Council alone accounted for 27.9% of output in 2003. Shetland's access to <b>oil</b> <b>revenues</b> has funded the Shetland Charitable Trust, which in turn funds a wide variety of local programmes. The balance of the fund in 2011 was £217 million, i.e., about £9,500 per head.|$|E

As a condition of its assistance, the World Bank insisted that 80% of <b>oil</b> <b>revenues</b> be spent on development projects. In January 2006 the World Bank suspended its loan programme when the Chadian government passed laws reducing this amount.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{resource}} curse {{with regards to}} Nigeria 9 ̆ 2 s development performance. Rejecting the orthodox approach, it defines development as a multidimensional concept that consists of economic, social and political indicators. It specifically examines the influence of <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> on GDP, unemployment rate, poverty rate, Corruption Perception Index, Foreign Direct Investment, total investment, Consumer Price Index {{and the percentage of}} electricity consumed. Relying on both descriptive and inferential statistical tools, it uses trend analysis, Pearson 9 ̆ 2 s correlation and OLS technique for data analysis. Data on variables that have been quantified and documented from 1970 - 2014 were used to evaluate the impact of <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> on Nigeria 9 ̆ 2 s development. Findings revealed that for 45 years, Nigeria generated 74237. 42 billion naira from oil production. This confers on her great potentials to promote development because of the revenue windfalls generated from oil sales. However, casual inference was found between <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> and unemployment rate, poverty index, corruption and total investment. While no casual inference was found between <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> and FDI, electricity utilized and consumer inflation. These results revealed that <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> triggers increase in poverty, unemployment and corruption which proves the existence of the resource curse in Nigeria. Nevertheless, the findings also revealed that <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> influenced increase in FDI and percentage of electricity utilized, and decrease in Consumer Price Inflation. This shows that with effective investments in the economy, <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> has the capacity to stimulate development. This research work strongly recommends diversification of the economy through investment of <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> in other growth enhancing sectors. This can propel growth in these sectors that will ultimately create more jobs and lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty...|$|R

5|$|The {{early and}} mid-1980s saw {{economic}} trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual <b>oil</b> <b>revenues</b> dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion. Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on Libya's {{largest and most}} expensive infrastructure project, the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished {{by the end of}} the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back. Libya's foreign debt rose, and austerity measures were introduced to promote self-reliance; in August 1985 there was a mass deportation of foreign workers, most of them Egyptian and Tunisian. Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a militia—linked either to the NFSL or the Muslim Brotherhood—and in the aftermath 5000 dissidents were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Williams' {{popularity}} {{increased when}} he fought with then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin over a campaign promise Martin had made {{that would lead}} to a revised Atlantic Accord. Martin proposed an eight-year deal that the province would keep 100 percent of offshore <b>oil</b> <b>revenues,</b> but with an expenditure a cap to keep the province from surpassing the per capita tax revenue of Ontario. Williams, supported by the other provincial leaders, walked out of talks with Martin, saying that cap would cost the provincial government billions of dollars in lost revenue over the life of its three oil fields. Williams along with Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm, who also wanted the same deal as Newfoundland and Labrador, met with the Prime Minister on several occasions but a deal between Ottawa and the two provinces could not be reached. Williams raised the temperature on December 23, 2004, when he ordered the removal of all Canadian flags from provincial government buildings. On January 10, 2005, Canadian flags started flying once again in the province, and several weeks later Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia reached a deal with Ottawa.

25|$|In the 1930s, {{the first}} oil company teams carried out {{preliminary}} surveys.

40|$|The {{study had}} set forth {{to explore the}} intertwining {{relationship}} that exist between <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> shock, non-oil export and industrial output in Nigeria. In achieving this objective the study utilized data spanning the period 1970 - 2010. This period captured the major era of regime shift (changes in governance) and policy administration in Nigeria. Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model and cointegration technique were {{used to examine the}} long run relationship, while the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) was used to analyze the short-run behavior of the variables. The Johansen cointegration analysis suggests that a long run behavior exist between <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> shock, non-oil export, policy/regime shift and industrial output in Nigeria. The short-run result showed that the speed at which industrial output will converge towards long-run equilibrium after experiencing shock from <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> is very slow. It therefore would take a very slow process for industrial output to recover from shock arising from variation in <b>oil</b> <b>revenue.</b> The long run result shows that <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> shock and policy/regime shift had negative impact on industrial output and non-oil export. The impulse response function and variance decomposition analysis suggest that the major drivers of industrial development in Nigeria are non-oil export, regime shift and <b>oil</b> <b>revenue.</b> Thus innovations from these variables impact severely on industrial growth in Nigeria. The study therefore suggest among other things that the panacea to industrial growth in Nigeria rest on diversifying the economy away from crude oil export and ensuring a stable government in Nigeria that will endure long enough to sustain industrial and other economic policies. ...|$|R

40|$|Libya {{experienced}} {{a substantial increase}} in <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> as a result of increased oil prices during the period of the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, and again after 2000. Recent increases in oil production and the price of oil, and their positive and negative macroeconomic impacts upon key macroeconomic variables, are of considerable contemporary importance to an oil dependent economy such as that of Libya. In this paper a dynamic macroeconomic model is developed for Libya to evaluate the effects of additional <b>oil</b> <b>revenue,</b> arising from positive oil production and oil price shocks, upon key macroeconomic variables, including the real exchange rate. It takes into consideration the impact of <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> upon the non-oil trade balance, foreign asset stock, physical capital stock, human capital stock, imported capital stock and non-oil production. Model simulation results indicate that additional <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> brings about: an increase in government revenue, increased government spending in the domestic economy, increased foreign asset stocks, increased output and wages in the non oil sector. However, increased <b>oil</b> <b>revenue</b> may also produce adverse consequences, particularly upon the non-oil trade balance, arising from a loss of competitiveness of non-oil tradable goods induced by an appreciation of the real exchange rate and increased imports stimulated by increased real income. Model simulation results also suggest that investment stimulating policy measures by government produce the most substantive benefits for the economy...|$|R
