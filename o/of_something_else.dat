25|$|At first, {{fine art}} photographers tried to imitate {{painting}} styles. This movement is called Pictorialism, often using soft focus for a dreamy, 'romantic' look.

25|$|Since none of {{the means}} of knowing were found to be worthy to {{establish}} the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths. Thus, to Charvakas, the step which the mind takes from the knowledge of something to infer the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> could be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being in error. Cases where inference was justified by the result were seen only to be mere coincidences.|$|E

25|$|It {{is inconceivable}} that inanimate brute matter should, without the {{mediation}} <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> {{which is not}} material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation {{in the sense of}} Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.|$|E
25|$|In the Women and Gender Equity Knowledge Network's Final Report to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health in 2007, {{health systems}} in many {{countries}} were noted to {{have been unable to}} deliver adequately on gender equity in health. One explanation for this issue is that many healthcare systems tend to neglect the fact that men and women’s health needs can be very different. In the report, studies have found evidence that the healthcare system can promote gender disparities in health through the lack of gender equity in terms of the way women are regarded - as both consumers (users) and producers (carers) of health care services. For instance, healthcare systems tend to regard women as objects rather than subjects, where services are often provided to women as a means <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> rather on the well-being of women. In the case of reproductive health services, these services are often provided as a form of fertility control rather than as care for women's well-being. Additionally, although the majority of the workforce in health care systems are female, many of the working conditions remain discriminatory towards women. Many studies have shown that women are often expected to conform to male work models that ignore their special needs, such as childcare or protection from violence. This significantly reduces the ability and efficiency of female caregivers providing care to patients, particularly female ones.|$|E

[...] Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor Bill Murray: [...] "He's been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in Ghostbusters, then {{the same sort of}} thing in Groundhog Day.

But I discovered an element <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> so in a sick kind of way I made myself a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic." ...|$|E

500|$|The book explores {{a tension}} between {{originality}} and monoculture {{by focusing on the}} artist's relationship with a commercialized world and its marketing of free art and consumer products. Critic Lisa Zeidner argues that the artist's [...] "loyalty and love" [...] involved with creating originality counters Bigend's assertion that everything is a reflection <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> and that the creative process no longer rests with the individual. Commercialism is portrayed as a monoculture that assimilates originality. The Tommy Hilfiger brand is used as an example, [...] "simulacra of simulacra of simulacra. A dilute tincture of Ralph Lauren, who had himself diluted the glory days of Brooks Brothers, who themselves had stepped on the product of Jermyn Street and Savile Row ... There must be some Tommy Hilfiger event horizon, beyond which it is impossible to be more derivative, more removed from the source, more devoid of soul." ...|$|E

500|$|Apart from {{anthropomorphic}} {{images of}} Shiva, {{he is also}} represented in aniconic form of a lingam. These are depicted in various designs. One common form is {{the shape of a}} vertical rounded column in the centre of a lipped, disk-shaped object, the yoni, symbolism for the goddess Shakti. In Shiva temples, the linga is typically present in its sanctum sanctorum and is the focus of votary offerings such as milk, water, flower petals, fruit, fresh leaves, and rice. According to Monier Williams and Yudit Greenberg, linga literally means [...] "mark, sign or emblem", and also refers to a [...] "mark or sign from which the existence <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> can be reliably inferred". It implies the regenerative divine energy innate in nature, symbolized by Shiva. Some scholars, such as Wendy Doniger, view linga merely as an erotic phallic symbol, although this interpretation is disputed by others, including Swami Vivekananda, Sivananda Saraswati, and S. N. Balagangadhara. According to Moriz Winternitz, the linga in the Shiva tradition is [...] "only a symbol of the productive and creative principle of nature as embodied in Shiva", and it has no historical trace in any obscene phallic cult.|$|E

500|$|The band {{released}} Deja Entendu through Razor & Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, being {{issued in}} Europe and Australia in October 2003. The album's title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the title's meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you can't put a record out without people saying it's derivative <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> So by saying the record's already been heard, it's kind of like saying, 'Yeah, you're right. We're doing something that's already been done before.'" [...] He reinforced, [...] "We're not trying to break new ground in music. We're {{just trying to make}} good music." [...] The album was described as a [...] "stylistic leap" [...] from Your Favorite Weapon, with a [...] "decidedly matured" [...] sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu does offer a different sound, the album [...] "doesn't seem like we're departing from anything, really. I think we always knew that {{we had a lot of}} potential and there's a lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make.

2500|$|Among Schoenberg's {{teaching}} {{was the idea}} that the unity of a musical composition depends upon all its aspects being derived from a single basic idea; this idea was later known as developing variation.

The Piano Sonata is an example—the whole composition is derived from the work's opening quartal gesture and its opening phrase.|$|E
2500|$|Jackpot: Some targets on the playfield {{increase}} the scoring value <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> {{which could be}} as simple as hitting a ramp, or a complicated sequence of targets. Upon their inception, the jackpot was the main goal of most pinball machines in the 1980s. Jackpots would often range from one to four million (back when this was a significant addition to the score), and their value would accrue between games until it was scored. Scoring it was usually a complicated task. Modern games often dilute the meaning of [...] "jackpot". Modern games give off several jackpots in each multiball mode, which is usually quite easy to attain, and the value of today's jackpots is far less significant. Many jackpots awarded during special modes often do not increase at all, but are instead simply fixed-value bonuses.|$|E

2500|$|In {{classical}} descriptions, {{an equivalent}} description of this mental faculty is eikasia, {{in the philosophy}} of Plato.
