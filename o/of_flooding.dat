40|$|Abstract- Analysis <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> routing due to Cengklik dam break {{intended}} to formulate empirical equation. This equation illustrated the inundation depth <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> peak and travel time <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> wave {{along the river}} to the downstream due to the dam break. Analysis of this study used Boss Dambrk Program for formulating the outflow hydrograph of dam and hydraulic flood routing along downstream of the dam. The output of program running was developed {{in order to produce}} empirical equation which presented the relations between travel time variable <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> wave (Tb) and travel time variable <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> peak (Tp) as well as the depth variable <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> peak (Hp) and distance variable towards downstream of dam. Formulation of the empirical equation was based on the linear and exponential regression model. This analysis produced an approached alternative which can easily and properly determine the travel time <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> wave (Tb), travel time <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> peak (Tp), and depth <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> peak (Hp) along the downstream river of Cengklik dam. The result is very useful for determining plan concept of emerging action or as eraly warning system...|$|R
