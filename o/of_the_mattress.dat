The bed was made from ash wood, held together {{with a variety of}} iron plates, cleats, staples, nails, stays, and decorative scrolls.

Traces of mineralised cloth and either grass or reed were found still attached to some of the nails, indicating the possible nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattress.</b> Two pieces of ironwork showed signs of repair and reuse, suggesting that the bed had been in use some time before the burial and was not specially made for the interment. This raises the possibility that the bed was either that of the deceased woman or a significant bed of some other person. It may have been dismantled elsewhere, brought to the cemetery and reassembled and repaired so that it could be used for the burial.|$|E

Method: Data were collected during four days in November, 2011 inside and outside of a cold chamber. All participants (n = 23) participated in two trials each.

30|$|Tickings perform {{differently}} in {{the presence or absence}} of fire barrier materials. A large majority (about 80 %) of mattresses with a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ticking pass the high occupancy dwelling open flame test (TB 129) without using a fire barrier material, because PVC tickings are active fire barriers that self extinguish. Approximately 20 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> with PVC coated tickings fail due to antagonistic reactions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highly plasticized PVC coated fabrics with other components of upholstery. Mattresses with cotton/fiberglass tickings also do not require an additional barrier fabric layer to protect the underlying cushioning layer. In this case, the cotton/fiberglass ticking acts as a passive fire barrier that physically prevents flame and heat transfer to the underlying cushioning layer. On the other hand, thermoplastic tickings used in modern residential mattresses do require a fire barrier in order to pass the open flame test. A study (Nurbakhsh & Mc Cormack [1998]) that investigated <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> cover fabrics and filling materials with and without fire barriers showed that polyester and polyester blend ticking perform poorly in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a barrier material. Furthermore, placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrier in <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> can be critical to the resulting fire performance. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> barrier materials is discussed in much greater detail in the following section.|$|R

Wound apposition is assessed by electron microscopy. <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> double loop <b>mattress</b> in vivo was confirmed using a series of 805 pediatric laparotomies/laparoscopies. <b>The</b> double loop <b>mattress</b> suture is 3. 5 times stronger than <b>the</b> loop <b>mattress</b> in muscle and 1. 6 times stronger in cartilage (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001). Additionally, <b>the</b> double loop <b>mattress</b> reduces tissue tension by 66 % compared with just 53 % for <b>the</b> loop <b>mattress</b> (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001). Wound gapping is equal, and wound eversion appears significantly improved (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001) compared with <b>the</b> loop <b>mattress</b> in vitro. In vivo, <b>the</b> double loop <b>mattress</b> performs as well as <b>the</b> loop <b>mattress</b> and significantly better than <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> stitch in assessments of wound eversion and dehiscence. There were no episodes of stitch extrusion in our series <b>of</b> patients. <b>The</b> mechanical advantage <b>of</b> its intrinsic pulley arrangement gives <b>the</b> double loop <b>mattress</b> its favorable properties. Wound dehiscence is reduced because this stitch type is stronger and exerts less tension on the tissue than <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> stitch. We advocate <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> this novel stitch wherever a high-strength, low-tension repair is required. These properties will enhance wound repair, and its application will be useful to surgeons of all disciplines...|$|R
60|$|When he had gone, Augustus freed {{both hands}} from the manacles and unfastened his feet. He then {{turned down the}} head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> on {{which he had been}} lying, and with his {{penknife}} (for the ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him) commenced cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks, as closely as possible {{to the floor of the}} berth. He chose to cut here, because, if suddenly interrupted, he would be able to conceal what had been done by letting the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> fall into its proper position. For the remainder of the day, however, no disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided the plank. It should here be observed that none of the crew occupied the forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the cabin since the mutiny, drinking the wines and feasting on the sea-stores of Captain Barnard, and giving no more heed than was absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig. These circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and Augustus; for, had matters been otherwise, he would have found it impossible to reach me. As it was, he proceeded with confidence in his design. It was near daybreak, however, before he completed the second division of the board (which was about a foot above the first cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his passage through with facility to the main orlop deck. Having got here, he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main hatch, although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of oil-casks piled nearly as high as the upper deck, there being barely room enough left for his body. Upon reaching the hatch he found that Tiger had followed him below, squeezing between two rows of the casks. It was now too late, however, to attempt getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing through the close stowage in the lower hold. He therefore resolved to return, and wait till the next night. With this design, he proceeded to loosen the hatch, so that he might have as little detention as possible when he should come again. No sooner had he loosened it than Tiger sprang eagerly to the small opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and then uttered a long whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious to remove the covering with his paws. There could be no doubt, from his behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and Augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put him down. He now hit upon the expedient of sending the note, as it was especially desirable that I should make no attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing circumstances, and there could be no certainty of his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended. After-events proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did; for, had it not been for the receipt of the note, I should undoubtedly have fallen upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the crew, and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence.|$|E

Here he selected the largest tree he could find, and threw down his bundle of food and blankets under the flat spreading branches thereof. Resting one of his snow-shoes against the stem of the tree, he proceeded to dig a huge hole in the snow, using his other snow-shoe as a shovel. The operation cost him much labour, for he had to dig completely down to the ground, and the snow in the woods was still between three and four feet deep. When a hole of ten feet long by five broad was thus cleared to the bottom, the natural walls were raised by the snow thrown out, to a total height of about six feet. This was Bellew's bedchamber. The spreading pine-branches overhead were its admirable roof. Next, the trapper cut down a young pine, with the tender branches of which he covered the floor of his chamber to a depth of ten or twelve inches. This was his mattress, and a soft, warm, elastic one it was, as the writer of this narrative can testify from personal experience. The head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> rested against the stem of the pine tree, and a convenient root thereof served Bellew for a pillow. At {{the foot of the bed}} he had left the floor of his chamber uncovered; this was his fireplace, and in the course of ten minutes or so he cut down and chopped into billets enough of dry wood to fill it with materials for a splendid fire. These being arranged, with a core of dry moss and broken twigs in the centre, the patient man struck a light by means of flint, steel, and tinder, and applied it. While the first few tongues of fire were crackling in the core of moss, he spread a thick blanket on his bed, and then stood up leisurely to fill his pipe and dreamily to watch the kindling of the fire.|$|E

For the rest, he is endowed with a vigorous frame, a particular warmth of imagination, and an uncommon strength of lungs. If you ever meet him, unless you happen to be arrested by his originality, you will either stuff your fingers into your ears or else take to your heels. Heavens, what a monstrous pipe! Nothing is so little like him as himself.

A month after, he is stout and sleek as if he had been sitting all the time at the board of a financier, or had been shut up in a Bernardine monastery. To-day in dirty linen, his clothes torn and patched, with barely a shoe to his foot, he steals along with a bent head; one is tempted to hail him and toss him a shilling. To-morrow, all powdered, curled, in a good coat, he marches about with head erect and open mien, and you would almost take him for a decent worthy creature. He lives from day to day, from hand to mouth, downcast or sad, just as things may go. His first care of a morning when he gets up is to know where he will dine; after dinner, he begins to think where he may pick up a supper. Night brings disquiets of its own. Either he climbs to a shabby garret he has, unless the landlady, weary of waiting for her rent, has taken the key away from him; or else he shrinks to some tavern on the outskirts of the town, where he waits for daybreak over a crust of bread and a mug of beer. When he has not threepence in his pocket, as sometimes happens, he has recourse either to a hackney-carriage belonging to a friend, or to a coachman of some man of quality, who gives him a bed on the straw beside the horses. In the morning he still has bits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> in his hair. If the weather is mild, he measures the Champs Elysées all night long.
