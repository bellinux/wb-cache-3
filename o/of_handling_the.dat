5|$|Accordingly, {{building}} a new oil terminal in Europe capable <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> largest vessels that were planned was judged appropriate. The intention was that oil coming from the Middle East would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for trans-shipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of}} the Six-Day War reinforced the economic viability of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the crossbar, teams could play without a goalkeeper. The first reference to a goalkeeper appears in the report of the Battle of Bramall Lane in 1862. The position, however, was used as an alternative to sending off a player. Although a recognised position goalkeeper sometimes was also referred to in the rules as the player nearest their own goal (allowing him the luxury <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> ball). Unlike its FA counterpart Sheffield Rules never restricted handling to one designated player. Despite this by the 1870s teams usually featured a single player in the position.|$|E

5|$|In March 2017 it was {{announced}} by the MCC that the law on handled the ball would be completely removed and subsumed into the law on obstructing the field. This means that the act <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> ball will still result in the batsman's dismissal, but will now always be recorded as obstructing the field. The new law is due to come into effect on 1 October 2017.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{new ways}} <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> agung have emerged, {{including}} grasping {{a portion of}} the boss rather than the flange to dampen or using regular strokes upon the busel while striking the surrounding gong surface with the opposite, wooden end of the beater. The latter technique, called katinengka, is used by downriver musicians to produce metallic sounds during kulintang performances.|$|E
5|$|The road {{over the}} pass was barely capable <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> {{massive amounts of}} silver ore coming out of Aspen's mines. At first {{they had to be}} taken to Leadville by mule train to be smelted. Plants were built in the city soon afterwards, but it was still {{difficult}} and expensive to transport the silver obtained. The market was growing {{in the wake of the}} Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the U.S. government to buy the metal on a regular basis.|$|E

5|$|The {{desert locust}} (Schistocerca gregaria) is {{probably}} the best-known species owing to its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent) {{and its ability to}} migrate over long distances. A major infestation covered much of western Africa in 2003-4, after unusually heavy rain set up favourable ecological conditions for swarming. The first outbreaks occurred in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Sudan in the autumn of 2003. The rain allowed swarms to develop and move north to Morocco and Algeria, threatening croplands. Swarms crossed Africa, appearing in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, the first time in those countries for 50 years. The cost <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> infestation was put at US$122 million, and the damage to crops at up to $2.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> divergent requirements was compounded when, in May 1963, shortly following on {{from the}} official issuing of Specification OR356/AW406, the option of having two distinct aircraft was rejected; the Secretary of State for Defence, Peter Thorneycroft, had insisted upon {{the development of a}} single common aircraft to meet the requirements of both services. According to Woods, Thorneycroft's decision had been influenced by the American General Dynamics F-111 multirole program, and had sought to duplicate this development concept for the P.1154. Despite a stated Navy preference for a swing-wing fighter, the services agreed that the aircraft would be completely common, with the exception of different radar systems. However, upon requests by various electronics manufacturers to the Ministry of Aviation to be issued with the requirements for the electronics fit, no response was ever issued; this lack of leadership proved disruptive to the overall programme.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Mole {{sides are}} sloped whilst the {{south-east}} face is vertically walled. Originally three {{sides of the}} Mole served coal hoists and their related rail sidings linking them and there were cranes on the south-east face, also rail-served. The former hoist brick-faced plinths are still present (2017) around the north-west and east faces as are those {{on the rest of}} the two docks. In the twilight years of tanker unloading for the William Cory (Powell Duffryn) oilworks, short footbridges were provided from the Mole for works staff to access the brick plinths for the purpose <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> flexible tanker oil discharge piping and supports and it was not unknown for rail tank wagons to be in use on the siding serving the north-west Mole face.|$|E

5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E

25|$|Isshin-ryū kusarigamajutsu is {{a school}} <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> chain and sickle weapon. The 24th {{unofficial}} headmaster of Shinto Musō Ryu, Shiraishi Hanjirō, received a full license (Menkyo) in Isshin-ryū from Morikata Heisaku in the late 19th century,.

40|$|Sickle is the {{agriculture}} traditional tools which made from hardness steel that usually used to cut grass, twig, clump, etc. In Yogyakarta many farmers still use sickle {{to cut the}} grass manually. This conventional sickle is made by small industry. The weakness of the conventional sickle is on the form and <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>handle.</b> <b>The</b> form and <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>handle</b> is different each other, because the form and <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>handle</b> is measured based on hand of blacksmith. During the survey was found the problem on the existing design <b>of</b> sickle <b>handle.</b> <b>The</b> conventional sickle <b>handle</b> tends to make deflection on the user hand. After do some analyses is {{need to be developed}} the new design <b>of</b> sickle <b>handle.</b> <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> this research is a new design <b>of</b> sickle <b>handle</b> which can reduce or eliminate the deflection on hand. <b>The</b> dimension <b>of</b> sickle <b>handle</b> is adjusted based on the anthropometry data which are measured from the farmer. So the new design <b>of</b> sickle <b>handle</b> can make <b>the</b> farmer work more comfortable. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} touch <b>the</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>the</b> robot {{has to decide}} the height and the moving {{direction}} of the tool first. A statistical analysis [15] of the most frequent size <b>of</b> <b>handles</b> shows that <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> is in a range from 99  cm to 103  cm. Based on this acknowledgement, the robot keeps the vertical rod of the tool in this range. Then the robot chooses right as its target direction to touch <b>the</b> <b>handle.</b> If <b>the</b> robot confirms that <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> {{is not in the}} current direction, it changes its direction to left and performs the process <b>of</b> locating <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> again. Here we present the process of the localization and confirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> in <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> right, and it is similar for left.|$|R

Part of the airport's South Terminal project, the concourse was designed by Carlos Zapata and M.G.E., {{one of the largest}} Hispanic-owned architecture firms in Florida. The concourse features 15 international-capable gates as well as the airport's only gate capable <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> Airbus A380 that has 3 jet bridges. The concourse added a third international arrivals hall to the airport, supplementing the existing ones at Concourses B (now closed) and E while significantly relieving overcrowding at these two facilities.|$|E
25|$|A {{central theme}} {{in most of}} these tales is the {{difficulties}} <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> new tolerance, open-mindedness and democratisation which are introduced by both the transition of society and by literature. Another theme is the conflict between the introverted and closed male nature and the vitality of the woman. Behind all this lies the classic naturalist theme of heritage and milieu against which man has to rebel without quite denying their existence. In his later works he sometimes seems to become a mixture of a castigator of society and a prophet of doom.|$|E
