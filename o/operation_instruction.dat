50|$|On 17 May, Alexander issued his <b>Operation</b> <b>Instruction</b> No. 1 {{setting out}} his broad plan and {{defining}} {{the tasks of}} the two armies. Broadly speaking, his intention was to establish his armies along a line from Catania to Licata preparatory to a final operation to reduce the island. He later wrote that at that stage it was not practicable to plan further ahead but that his intentions were clear {{in his own mind}} what the next step would be: he would drive north ultimately to Santo Stefano on the northern coast to split the island in two and cut his enemy's east-west communications. The Seventh Army was assigned to land in the Gulf of Gela, in south-central Sicily, with the 3rd Infantry Division and 2nd Armored Division to the west at Licata Mollarella beach, 1st Division in the center at Gela, and 45th Division to the east at Scoglitti. The 82nd Airborne Division was assigned to drop behind the defences at Gela and Scoglitti. The Seventh Army's beach-front stretched over 50 km. The British Eighth Army was assigned to land in south-eastern Sicily. XXX Corps would land on either side of Cape Passero, while XIII Corps would land in the Gulf of Noto, around Avola, off to the north. The Eighth Army's beach front also stretched 40 km, and there was a gap of some 40 km between the two armies.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSince {{the intakes}} outflow {{variations}} {{have an impact}} on network performance, it is necessary to evaluate the behavior of different types of intake structures in unsteady flow condition. In the present study, a computer model has been developed in which unsteady Saint–Venant flow equations have been discretized using finite difference and Crank–Nicolson method. Water surface elevation at junctions is calculated implicitly using matrix properties and influence line technique. After model verification, main channel of Miandarband irrigation network and its five branches were simulated. The result showed that without any <b>operation</b> <b>instruction,</b> a 10 % decrease in the upstream flow discharge will reduce the slid gate, Neyrpic single orifice Module and double orifice Module intakes outflows for about 17. 6 %, 3. 04 % and 2. 56 %, respectively.

Although the elevated interest in this sport has increased {{the magnitude of the}} TKD market, no systematic studies have been conducted to investigate the market demand variables associated with TKD schools in North America.

The result {{is that so many}} features and operation characteristics were not fully grasped before. Therefore, it was necessary to carry out the corresponding research work. The experimental study was carried out in this paper. This paper would research the simulation test method of split cooling system based on a 10 kV distribution transformer. The test device can realize the flexible regulation for the vertical and horizontal position. According to the temperature-rise test method of transformers, performance test of split type cooling system was carried out based on the change of oil flow or radiator location. Finally, the research results of different pipe diameter, height and horizontal distribution were proposed. The study would provide more references for <b>operation</b> <b>instruction</b> of large power transformer's split type cooling devices...|$|E

Unless a person has designed a demodulator, how much can a person know or understand about its <b>operation?</b> <b>Instruction</b> on how to set up a demodulator’s parameters to acquire a signal is found in a manual. An explanation of why parameters are set a certain way to handle particular input signal characteristics is often not provided in a manual. This paper is designed to be a tool to aid engineers, technicians, and operators who utilize demodulators. Its purpose is to relay the functionality of a demodulator to a user so that he or she can take advantage of its control parameters and status feedback. Knowing the reasons why a demodulator is set to certain parameters may greatly reduce confusion when a system is not working properly. On site troubleshooting may be accomplished without the need to call the manufacturer of the product. Another advantage of understanding the operation will be recognized when interfacing with the manufacturer. A person will be able to relay the information to a design engineer more easily, and will understand more of the engineer’s feedback on the potential problem. Utilizing this paper as an aid to enhance operation of a PSK demodulator will bring a user one step closer to understanding the complexity of its design...|$|E

At Guelph, we have around 2200 students in the fall semester of first year chemistry and around 1800 in the companion winter course. This past winter semester, we had 74 laboratory sections staffed by 21 different graduate students. The G. T. A. s graded the written laboratory reports for the students in their sections. In addition, we held a mid-term and final exam that included two pages of written answers. A group of about 28 G. T.

This past semester we developed a method to electronically capture the grading of each T. A. and have compared parameters such as speed, average grade assigned, variance, and accuracy. We will discuss these results and how they may impact our confidence in the final grade assigned to a particular student.

Several time series modelling such as AR (burg, least square, yule walker, geometric lattice, instrument variable) algorithm, ARX (arx, iv 4), ARMAX, ARMA, Box Jenkins, Output Error, recursive arx and recursive armax were analysed and compared with one another. As a result, arx, armax and iv 4 were proved very reliable algorithms for the calculation of the modal parameters(natural frequency and damping ratio) in endmilling <b>operation.</b> <b>INSTRUCTION</b> In this study, we have modelled several time series algorithms with spectral analysis comparing with conventional FFT (fast fourier transform) method and calculated the natural mode with each algorithm in endmilling operation. The natural mode estimations with several time series algorithms may be practiced for latter study of chatter. Also these results may be compared with FFT spectrum and the advantage and limitation of each algorithm were discussed. For this purpose two experiments were practiced to get the experimental data and these data were used for the modelling of each algorithm and the results were compared and discussed together. In the first experiment, we have practiced impact test for the FRF of the time series modelling which needs two senor signals in output/input FRF as accelerometer/impact hammer signals. Also, similar experiment for the output/input data of FRF was practiced using the accelerometer and the tool dynamometer sensor for the accelerometer/tool dynamometer FRF respectively.

Methods: the operation means and points for attention of the medical monitoring equipment, and some common ECG graphics judgmental contents, was compiled and printed into a unified standard format, i. e. it (13 cm x 20 cm) format sizes, a binder. 27 nurses {{who has been a}} nurse for 2 years or more was given a guidance book and trained based on its contents, and the proficiency of their theoretical and practical skills before and after training was compared. The authors considered the random selected 126 patients from Jan. 2013 to April 2013 under ECG monitor treatment as control group, and considered the random selected 138 patients from May 2013 to August 2013 under ECG monitor treatment as experimental group. Patients’ satisfaction at services in two groups were compared. Results: 27 nurses in application of ECG monitor operation were trained based on the manual book. The evaluations scores and operation efficiency before bad after training showed obvious difference (P < 0. 05). The nursing service quality increased significantly and reached the expected aim. Patients and families expressed the hope that they wanted such service. The clients’ service satisfaction before and after the training had obvious difference (P < 0. 05).
