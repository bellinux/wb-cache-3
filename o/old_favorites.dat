5|$|Modern cottage garden {{plants are}} {{typically}} flowers chosen for their old-fashioned and informal appeal. Many modern day gardeners use heirloom or 'old-fashioned' plants and varieties—even though these {{may not have}} been authentic or traditional cottage garden plants. In addition, there are modern varieties of flowers that fit into the cottage garden look. For example, modern roses developed by David Austin have been chosen for cottage gardens because of their old-fashioned look (multi-petaled form and rosette-shaped flowers) and fragrance—combined with modern virtues of hardiness, repeat blooming, and disease-resistance. Modern cottage gardens often use native plants and those adapted to the local climate, rather than trying to force traditional English plants to grow in an incompatible environment—though many of the <b>old</b> <b>favorites</b> thrive in cottage gardens throughout the world.|$|E

25|$|Dee Dee was {{initially}} the band's lead vocalist, though his (then) inability {{to sing and}} play bass {{at the same time}} resulted in original drummer Joey Ramone taking over the lead vocalist duties (however, he still sang lead vocals in the band on occasion). Dee Dee was the band's bassist and songwriter from 1974 until 1989, when he left to pursue a short-lived career in hip hop music under the name Dee Dee King. He soon returned to his punk roots and released three solo albums featuring brand-new songs, many of which were later recorded by the Ramones. He toured the world playing his new songs, Ramones songs and some <b>old</b> <b>favorites</b> in small clubs, and continued to write songs for the Ramones until 1996, when the band officially retired.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s AMT {{released}} brand new kits with new tooling {{for some of}} their <b>old</b> <b>favorites,</b> such as the 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air, 1966 Ford Fairlane GT, 1958 Edsel Pacer, 1960 Ford Starliner and 1957 Chrysler 300. These kits sold fairly well and can still be found on auction sites such as eBay at reasonable prices. The details in these kits far exceeded any from the 1960s. In the late 1990s AMT did something new in releasing pre-assembled and painted versions of these kits. These assembled models were sold as the Masterpiece Series and were nicely packaged in foam, similar to heavier diecast metal Franklin Mint or Danbury Mint models. Each had a Certificate of Authenticity enclosed. These models were beautifully finished and featured whitewall tires along with very detailed and authentically painted engines, suspensions and interiors, much more detailed than any promotional ever was, although these seem to be oriented to the adult collector and not the possible customer. Selections included a 1957 Chrysler 300C, 1960 Ford Starliner, 1962 Chevrolet Impala SS convertible, 1962 Pontiac Catalina SD421, 1966 Buick Riviera {{and a few others}} (Doty 2002b, p87). These ultra detailed models can still be had for less than $30.00 today on eBay and are one of the best bargains around. As assembled kits they were factory-glued together, but the glue used appears to be of high quality and when cared for properly they can be kept in good condition for years.|$|E
500|$|The {{new title}} {{immediately}} became successful, {{and demand for}} reprints of <b>old</b> <b>favorites</b> was such that Munsey decided to launch an additional magazine, Fantastic Novels, in July 1940, edited, like Famous Fantastic Mysteries, by Mary Gnaedinger. The two magazines were placed on bimonthly schedules, arranged to alternate with each other, though the schedule slipped slightly with the fifth issue of Fantastic Novels, dated April 1941 but following the January 1941 issue. [...] Fantastic Novels was suspended after that issue and merged with Famous Fantastic Mysteries. [...] The stated reason was that Famous Fantastic Mysteries [...] "is apparently the favorite title", but {{it seems likely that}} production difficulties caused by World War II played a part. [...] The June 1941 and August 1941 issues of Famous Fantastic Mysteries both carried the slogan [...] "Combined with Fantastic Novels Magazine" [...] on the cover.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} the eighth most-watched {{program of the}} week along with NBC's Sunday Night Football, with 11.4 million viewers, it {{received}} a 17 share in the ratings. Overall, the episode was well received by critics. Nina Hämmerling Smith of TV Guide quoted: [...] "Perhaps {{the best thing about}} the episode was the amount of screen time given to <b>old</b> <b>favorites</b> like Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). The show's most convincing writing has always been in the scenes when those two spar with House, and I was thrilled to see more of that". Most critics were surprised and interested by the performance of Chris Taub in this episode. Richard Keller of TV Squad, wrote that he was almost certain of the fact that Taub was going to be fired and he was glad that he wasn't. He also quoted, [...] "For some reason I like Taub. Maybe because he's not pretty like the rest of them. He's just an everyday schlub who's a pretty decent doctor".|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} was dated September/October 1939, and was edited by Mary Gnaedinger. [...] The {{magazine}} immediately became successful {{and went to}} a monthly schedule starting in November 1939. [...] Demand for reprints of <b>old</b> <b>favorites</b> was so strong that Munsey decided to launch an additional magazine, Fantastic Novels, in July 1940. The two magazines were placed on alternating bimonthly schedules, but when Fantastic Novels ceased publication in early 1941 Famous Fantastic Mysteries remained bimonthly until June 1942. [...] Munsey sold Famous Fantastic Mysteries to Popular Publications, a major pulp publisher, at the end of 1942; it {{appears to have been a}} sudden decision, since the editorial in the December 1942 issue discusses a planned February issue that never materialized, and mentions forthcoming reprints that did not appear. [...] The first issue from Popular appeared in March 1943, and only two more issues appeared that year; the September 1943 issue marked the beginning of a regular quarterly schedule. [...] It returned to a bimonthly schedule in 1946 which it maintained with only slight deviations until the end of its run.|$|E
500|$|Romance was {{credited}} by music critics to have renewed mainstream interest in bolero music. According to Chicago Tribune editor Monica Eng, [...] "Just as Harry Connick, Jr. re-popularized {{the sounds of}} Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Mexican platinum-selling heartthrob Luis Miguel brought back {{an appreciation for the}} music of Mexico's boleristas." [...] In The Wall Street Journal, Mary Talbot compared renewed interest in boleros to the revival of big band and swing music in the Anglo-American market, previously dominated by rock music (which had seized bolero's popularity during the 1960s). Elena Kellner of the Los Angeles Times noted the album's [...] "introducing <b>old</b> <b>favorites</b> to younger audiences" [...] while Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune documented Miguel's popularity with older listeners. In Latin Beat Magazine, Franz Reynold wrote that before Miguel, boleros were considered by young people the [...] "music of the ancients, something to be feared, since it seemed to signal the advent of senility". Mark Holston wrote in Américas magazine that the record's [...] "irresistible combination of classic songs, string-laden arrangements, and subtle contemporary influences proved to be the perfect formula to reawaken the bolero's slumbering passions once again." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the [...] "Baldwin era", {{new models}} were {{introduced}} throughout the 1970s and <b>old</b> <b>favorites</b> {{continued to be}} produced. As solidbody guitars rose to prominence in rock, with the harder styles of the era favoring Fender Stratocasters and Gibson Les Pauls, use of hollowbodies fell in popularity. In 1979, after Fred Jr's death, Chet Atkins withdrew his endorsement in response to quality problems and Gretsch's unwillingness to pursue his vision of a nylon-stringed electric guitar. Factory fires in the early 1970s caused serious problems, and production was finally halted by Baldwin in 1981.|$|E

2500|$|With the GameCube, Nintendo {{aimed to}} reverse the trend as {{evidenced}} by the number of third-party titles available at launch – the N64 had none.

High-profile exclusives such as [...] from Factor 5, Resident Evil 4 from Capcom, and [...] from Konami were very successful. Sega, which focused on third-party development following the demise of its Dreamcast console, offered a vast amount of support for the GameCube porting <b>old</b> <b>favorites</b> over such as Crazy Taxi and Sonic Adventure 2.

2500|$|On {{their debut}} album, Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666, HIM's sound {{was viewed as}} a {{combination}} of heavy metal and 1980s rock and goth music. These influences were further explored on Razorblade Romance, which featured less focus on guitar, in favor of a sleeker production and a more melodic sound. HIM continued to explore a more commercial sound on their third album Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights, which was met with mixed reactions. HIM's fourth album Love Metal is widely viewed by the band as the album where they found their own sound, taking inspiration from <b>old</b> <b>favorites,</b> such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Iggy Pop. Dark Light was the band's breakthrough album in the United States, and once again featured a glossier production. According to Valo, 2007's Venus Doom was written with the intent of creating a much heavier and darker follow-up, influenced by more early favorites such as My Dying Bride, Anathema and Paradise Lost. [...] took influences from bands of the 1980s, such as a-ha, Depeche Mode and The Cult, [...] while Tears on Tape saw HIM returning to their roots, combining elements from their sound on each song, as opposed to having [...] "a fast song followed by a slow song". Valo described Tears on Tape as a combination of Black Sabbath, The Smashing Pumpkins and Roy Orbison.|$|E
