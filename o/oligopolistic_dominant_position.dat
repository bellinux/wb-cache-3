40|$|The abuse {{use of a}} <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> {{constitutes}} an important form of manifestation of anti-competitive practices. Almost all competition laws have some provisions on the abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> Most European laws, including {{the one of the}} European Union, contain an express provision prohibiting the abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> However, they rarely include a definition of what constitutes abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position,</b> but most of them pass in review examples of behaviors that may be considered illegal. In countries with a developed market economy, the legal provisions regarding abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> were not so important and so widely used as the provisioning governing mergers and the cartel behavior. The explanation is that in a developed economy, the markets are larger, firms are more numerous, and the entry on the market is relatively easy. As a result, there are few markets where a firm with a <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> can exercise its market influence for longer periods without new entries being attracted.

5000|$|A <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> can {{generally}} {{be said to}} exist once a market share {{to the order of}} 40% to 45% is reached.

Although this share does not in itself automatically give control of the market, if there are large gaps between the position of the firm concerned and those of its closest competitors and also other factors likely to place it at an advantage as regards competition, a <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> may well exist.

40|$|Abuse of the <b>Dominant</b> <b>Position</b> by Prohibited Pricing Activities Abstract This thesis {{analyzes}} selected {{pricing practices}} of dominant undertakings namely predatory pricing, margin squeeze and excessive pricing. These practices may, under certain circumstances, constitute {{an abuse of}} the <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> The aim of the thesis {{is to focus on}} problematic aspects of each of these practices, on explanation of various legal and economic tests used to prove that certain pricing policy constitutes an abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> and on the description of conditions that have to be met in order to consider such practice contrary to the competition law of the Czech Republic and the European Union. The thesis is composed of four chapters. In Chapter One a brief introduction to the competition law itself and to the analyzed matter is given. Chapter Two describes basic terminology used when dealing with cases of abuse of a <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> such as basic legal concept of the abuse itself, definition of an undertaking and a competitor according to the EU law and the Czech law respectively, delimitation of a relevant market and finally definition of a <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> Chapter Three is oriented on the selected pricing practices of dominant undertakings.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to define the term "dominant position" of an {{undertaking}} under the EU Competition Law and to find out, what circumstances are decisive {{in order to be}} able to identify existence of a <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> The second part of the thesis focuses on actual problems connected with the dominant undertakings, namely the standardization and the effectiveness of the interventions of competition authorities into the actions of dominant undertakings on rapidly developing IT markets. The thesis deals with the concept of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> and does not address particular types of abusive behaviour enumerated in Article 102 (a) - (d) TFEU. The first chapter briefly describes the system of EU Competition Law. The focus is directed on agreements distorting competition (Art. 101 TFEU), abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> (Art. 102 TFEU) and control of concentrations between undertakings (Council Regulation No. 139 / 2004). The second chapter looks at the term "dominant position" of an undertaking and its delimitations. The subchapters describe definition of relevant market, market share, market power and other market conditions which shall be taken into account in the <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> analysis. Space is further devoted to the existing <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> on the neighbouring market and to the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Ports {{facilitate}} a waterborne transport {{which is the}} backbone of international trade, and thereby the global economy. This vital position in the international trade coupled with their nature as a limited capacity infrastructure enabled ports {{to be a significant}} market actor that is susceptible to possess market power. Port operators may acquire a <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> in the relevant markets concerned. The acquisition of a <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> may not be a concern in itself. However, this <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> may contain an inherent element of potential capacity of abusive behavior which may compromise effective competition in the port industry. Despite its obvious importance to the economy, the application of competition rules to port operators has always been complicated due to various factors. Considering the high significance of ports in facilitating the international trade of EU and the free movement of persons and goods within the Union, this study focuses on determining the extent of application of the EU competition rules for the sector of port operators. Under this general purpose, this thesis will analyze the rule prohibiting abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> in port operators; in particular, examining the core points of this rule such as ‘undertakings’, ‘relevant market’, ‘dominance’ and ‘abuse’; and finally, determining how and to what extent the rule against an abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> could be applicable to port operators...|$|R

This thesis aims {{to find out the}} effectiveness of article 25 of law no 5 of 1999 about the prohibition of monopolistic and unfair business competition in abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> the type of research in this thesis is a normative legal research.

40|$|The {{study of}} the present {{investigation}} consists on an initial approach to the general aspects {{of the concept of}} <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> on the European Competition Law, 5 whose assumptions are gathered on the analysis of several criteria referred to in Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Such article declares that “any abuse by one or more undertakings of a <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> within the internal market or in a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market in so far as it may affect trade between Member States. ” However, it is not given, nor in this article nor in any other from the above Treaty, a definition of <b>dominant</b> <b>position,</b> which in fact constitutes a problem. Thus, one will approach the concept of abuse of this <b>dominant</b> <b>position,</b> which dissuades itself on the abusive practices that compromise the Member States structural balance, and which at the end affect the consumers as potential direct victims of the exercise of market power. Nonetheless, one can point out, {{from the point of view}} of the Treaty, that the notion of abuse is itself contrary to any idea of contribution to the economic progress, and that the body of the article does not prohibit the existence of <b>dominant</b> <b>positions,</b> but only its abusive exploitation, as one will verify...|$|R
