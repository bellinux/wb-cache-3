5|$|Initially, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion among families with members serving in the army. It took several months for relations and friends to discover the fate of their relatives and name of casualties. Initially, <b>only</b> <b>very</b> few prisoners, usually those working in important civilian industries, were sent back to France.|$|E
5|$|<b>Only</b> <b>very</b> small {{allowances}} {{were made}} by the government to families of POWs, which was not sufficient to offset the economic difficulties caused. The large proportion of men in prisoner of war camps changed the gender balance in jobs. Many women took over running family farms and businesses, and others were forced to look for employment.|$|E
5|$|The dart is {{shot with}} some {{variation}} in force, and with considerable inaccuracy, such that {{one-third of the}} darts that are fired in Cornu aspersum either fail to penetrate the skin, or miss the target altogether.

5|$|After Indiana {{returned}} to active duty, she {{participated in the}} invasion of Hollandia in western New Guinea. The ship then {{returned to}} the central Pacific and bombarded Truk, and subsequently took part in operations off the Marianas Islands. On 19 June 1944 a Japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack the ship, but Indianas anti-aircraft gunners managed to destroy both the aircraft and the torpedo it had dropped, with no damage to the ship. Shortly thereafter, a second Japanese plane was shot down, but a third managed to crash into the ship. The aircraft disintegrated upon striking the side armor plates and scattered pieces of the plane across the stern. Five men were injured, but the ship suffered <b>only</b> <b>very</b> slight damage.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. <b>Only</b> <b>very</b> few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E

5|$|Cicero {{stated the}} twins {{objection}} (that with close birth times, personal outcomes {{can be very}} different), later developed by Saint Augustine. He argued that since the other planets are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have <b>only</b> <b>very</b> tiny influence compared to the moon's. He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or {{the effects of the}} weather on people.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the Allies {{landed at}} Arawe on New Britain on 15 December, while the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade, having {{commenced}} its advance {{up the coast}} from Gusika on 3 December, continued on passing through Bald Hill, Lakona and Kiligia {{on its way to}} Fortification Point as it led the opening phase of the Australian advance towards Sio. In late December, the 20th Infantry Brigade, which had largely been rested during the advance on Wareo, took over from the 4th. After sweeping up the coast quickly against light Japanese resistance, they captured Sio in early January 1944, having suffered <b>only</b> <b>very</b> light casualties.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{showed a}} modern {{appreciation}} for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, {{both in terms of}} conic sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be <b>only</b> <b>very</b> slight.|$|E

5|$|In Brown's {{arrangement}} of the genus, B.sphaerocarpa was placed between B.pulchella and B.nutans in taxonomic sequence; that is, an order that places related taxa next to each other. No subdivision of the genus was given, other than to separate a single distinctive species into a subgenus of its own. Swiss botanist Carl Meissner published a more detailed arrangement in 1856, placing B.sphaerocarpa in section Eubanksia because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed head, and in series Abietinae, whose members have inrolled leaf margins with no, or <b>only</b> <b>very</b> fine, serrations. Meissner also published a variety, B.sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens, based on specimens collected by James Drummond; this is now considered a synonym of B.incana.|$|E
5|$|In northeastern Honduras, low-lying {{areas were}} {{evacuated}} and numerous homes were destroyed. Rainfall peaked at 7.9in (200mm), resulting in widespread flooding. Waves up to 7ft (2.1m) affected the coastline. An American tourist drowned off Cozumel after succumbing to rough seas. <b>Only</b> <b>very</b> minor impacts were observed along the northeastern coastline of the Yucatán Peninsula. The outer bands of Paula affected Cuba, where rainfall peaked at 7.32in (186mm) and winds reached 68mph (109km/h). The strong winds downed many trees, blocking roadways, and damaged {{the roofs of}} several homes. The rain, however, was regarded as generally beneficial to crops and low reservoirs. Rough seas removed concrete from Havana's sea wall and submerged coastal streets under 1–2ft (0.3–0.61m) of water.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} contest of the {{primaries}} season, Clinton <b>only</b> <b>very</b> narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders, making {{her the first}} woman to win the Iowa caucuses. In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin. Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20, but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27. These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.|$|E

More than 120 bird species have been recorded as prey and individual Eurasian sparrowhawks may specialise in certain prey. The birds taken are usually adults or fledglings, though chicks in the nest and carrion are sometimes eaten.

5|$|<b>Only</b> <b>very</b> late on {{the night}} of 15 June was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the Duchess of Richmond's ball in Brussels, he {{received}} a dispatch from the Prince of Orange and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on Quatre Bras, where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.|$|E
5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and <b>only</b> <b>very</b> rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E

Smaller companies often fill in the void, offering {{a wide variety of}} recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa. Many small music industries are built around a core fanbase who may be based largely in one region, such as Tejano or Hawaiian music, or they may be widely dispersed, such as the audience for Jewish klezmer.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{category}} of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN, M2N, and M4N (although variable composition is perfectly possible), where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned {{in the gaps}} in a metallic cubic or hexagonal close-packed lattice. They are opaque, very hard, and chemically inert, melting only at very high temperatures (generally over 2500°C). They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals. They hydrolyse <b>only</b> <b>very</b> slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|The main {{breeding}} {{areas are}} located around the former Compiegne Stud and include {{the departments of}} Nord, the Pas-de-Calais, the Oise, the Aisne and Somme.
