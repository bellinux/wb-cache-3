5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{features}} prominently as a trickster {{figure in}} the folktales of America's indigenous peoples, alternately assuming {{the form of an}} actual coyote <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> As with other trickster figures, the coyote acts as a picaresque hero which rebels against social convention through deception and humor. The coyote was likely given its trickster role in light of the actual animal's intelligence and adaptability; pre-Columbian American people observed its behavior, and their folkloric representations reflected its attributes. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike the gray wolf, which has undergone a radical improvement of its public image, cultural attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.|$|E
5|$|The coyote is a {{prominent}} character in Native American folklore, {{mainly in the}} Southwestern United States and Mexico, usually depicted as a trickster that alternately assumes {{the form of an}} actual coyote <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> As with other trickster figures, the coyote uses deception and humor to rebel against social conventions. The animal was especially respected in Mesoamerican cosmology as a symbol of military might. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike wolves (gray, eastern, or red), which have undergone an improvement of their public image, attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.|$|E

This friendship {{would have been impossible}} had Elisha been an apostate <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of loose morals, as has been asserted.

500|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} when the advert {{first appeared on}} how it was made– whether the gorilla was real, animatronic, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> in a suit.

Can he sing too?"

500|$|Since poetry {{was highly}} stylized, it is {{difficult}} to determine when a poet speaking as a woman actually was a woman, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> speaking as a woman. This adds to the difficulty of attribution, especially of anonymous writers. There is some debate as to whether or not the poems by the trobairitz represent genuine feminine voices, since they worked within the highly circumscribed conventions of the troubadours. Matilda Bruckner suggests that the trobairitz [...] "spoke in her own voice as channeled through the voices of many others". By manipulating the strict constructs of troubadour lyric, the trobairitz were able to create their own [...] "fictions of the female voice".|$|E

500|$|As {{the trial}} had made {{headlines}} in the daily newspapers, so did Colt's death. [...] Theories were put forth that Colt had killed another prisoner and escaped during the fire. [...] One newspaper account said that Colt had fled to California with his wife, as did a book published by a former New York Chief of Police. A man named Samuel M. Everett claimed he met John Colt (<b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who looked identical) in the Santa Clara Valley in California in 1852, and the account was published in Pearson's Magazine. [...] Harold Schechter, a researcher and author of two books about John Colt dismisses this as [...] "an outlandish tale" [...] and a [...] "product of folklore, not fact". [...] A New York Times article written in 1880 said that Caroline Henshaw was watched by private detectives for years after Colt's death and no sign was ever seen of him alive. [...] None of these speculations of Colt's escape were proven to be true.|$|E
500|$|The men who defended {{their village}} from bad weather were {{referred}} to as dragons in eastern and southern Serbia, western Bulgaria, and Macedonia. In Serbia, they were also called zmajevit [...] "having a dragon's properties", from zmaj [...] "dragon". The mythological dragon was imagined as a fiery creature with wings, usually having a snake-like shape; he could also {{take the form of}} an eagle <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> Each dragon had his own territory, within which he dwelt by a forest spring or stream, in the hollow trunk of a beech tree, or in a mountain cave. He was benevolent toward the humans, and he took care that his territory received the right amount of rain at the right time, for good growth of the crops. His arch-enemy was a female demon named ala (plural: ale), whose main activity was to lead storm and hail clouds over fields to destroy crops. The ale also consumed the fertility of the fields. Whenever he noticed an ala approaching, the dragon would fly up into the clouds to fight against the demon and chase her away. He shot fiery arrows and stones at her, which produced lightning and thunder. In the regions where people believed in the zduhaći, the dragon was a highly regarded mythological being, but he was not associated with the crops and their protection from demons. Similar was the case in other than western regions of Bulgaria.|$|E

2500|$|Reaching back to {{the dozens}} and dirty blues, early rappers like Slick Rick {{established}} the bitch as a character: a woman, often treacherous, but sometimes simply déclassé.

However, the word bitch is also frequently used (by male rappers) towards other men in rap lyrics, usually to describe {{a man who is}} a subordinate or homosexual, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who is supposedly unmanly or inferior in some way.|$|E
