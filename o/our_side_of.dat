25|$|The theory {{contains}} only one half {{the explanation of}} man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on – man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine {{as well as a}} human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours – we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.|$|E
2500|$|The Engineering Department also {{established}} an aircraft salvage and repair facility in Building B-1 to salvage, reclaim and repair crashed airplanes retrieved from the front. All aircraft engine installation {{was done by}} this department, however engines salvaged from crashed aircraft were {{turned over to the}} Engine Overhaul Shop. When an aircraft was damaged in combat, or would crash on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the front line, a crew would be sent from the 1st Air Depot to dismantle the plane and bring it back to be repaired, if possible. [...] French aircraft were taken to Colombey, while American aircraft were sent to Romorantin. [...] Here if the aircraft could be repaired, it was, or it was placed on a salvage pile [...] where it could be cannibalized for usable parts.|$|E
2500|$|Grant {{was also}} {{concerned}} about the situation in neighboring Mexico, where 40,000 French soldiers propped up the puppet regime of Austrian Archduke Maximilian. He gave Sheridan permission to gather a large Texas occupation force. Sheridan assembled 50,000 men in three corps, quickly occupied Texas coastal cities, spread inland, and began to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border. The Army's presence, U.S. political pressure, and the growing resistance of Benito Juárez induced the French to abandon their claims against Mexico. Napoleon III withdrew his troops in 1866, and the following year Emperor Maximilian was executed for treason. Sheridan later admitted in his memoirs that he had supplied arms and ammunition to Juárez's forces: [...] "... which we left at convenient places on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the river to fall into their hands".|$|E
5000|$|According to Mukti Bodhananda finds, {{the second}} part {{introduces}} types of swaras arising out of Nadis, here three kind of swaras {{are said to be}} present. and each results of swaras are also noted here. [...] Swarodaya Yoga’ has three types of breathing systems - Ida (Inhaling & exhaling from <b>our</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the nostrils), Pingla (inhaling & exhaling from <b>our</b> right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the nostrils) and Sushmana (inhabling & exhaling from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the nostrils). We mostly breathe in & out from either Ida or Pingla but sometimes we breathe from both the nostrils Nadis.|$|R

60|$|We {{all know}} with how strong a bias we regard <b>our</b> own <b>side</b> <b>of</b> any question, and he {{regarded}} his side in this question {{with a very}} strong bias. Nevertheless he had refrained from a word, and would have refrained, had she not stopped him.|$|R

60|$|Fortunately for us, none {{attempted}} {{to come on}} <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the river; but all stood in something approaching a military formation as if expecting an immediate attack.|$|E
60|$|The board, {{according}} to red Martian custom, was triangular, for {{there were three}} in our family. Carthoris and I presided in the centre <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the table--midway <b>of</b> the third <b>side</b> Dejah Thoris' high-backed, carven chair stood vacant except for her gorgeous wedding trappings and jewels which were draped upon it. Behind stood a slave as {{in the days when}} his mistress had occupied her place at the board, ready to do her bidding. It was the way upon Barsoom, so I endured the anguish of it, though it wrung my heart to see that silent chair where should have been my laughing and vivacious Princess keeping the great hall ringing with her merry gaiety.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} I {{went off and}} found a village on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the island. I woke them up and told my story, and, to do 'em justice, though there were some who would have {{shielded}} the fellows we had caught, the best part were on <b>our</b> <b>side.</b> Some <b>of</b> 'em told me there had been suspicion upon these men, and that they bore a bad name. There was no magistrate in the island, and no one objected when I said we would take them across to Penzance and give them in charge there.|$|R

60|$|All {{this while}} there was no word of Blackwood or the doctor; and now the officer came to <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the ship and asked, over the hurricane-deck rails, if the doctor were not yet come. We told him not.|$|E
60|$|Returning to {{the main}} Fulham Road, and passing the Cancer Hospital, now in course of erection, we come to YORK PLACE, a row of twenty-two well-built and respectable houses on the south, or, {{according}} to <b>our</b> course, left-hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the road.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Allah destroy them! They are. They've {{come over}} to <b>our</b> <b>side.</b> After centuries <b>of</b> {{fighting}} they refuse to play fair any longer.

60|$|Now {{after this}} look at <b>our</b> own <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the world, let us {{turn to the}} other; for it is this very {{psychological}} fact that mental progression implies an ever-increasing individualization, and that imagination is the force {{at work in the}} process which Far Eastern civilization, taken in connection with our own, reveals. In doing this, it explains incidentally its own seeming anomalies, the most unaccountable of which, apparently, is its existence.|$|R
6000|$|... "What Jack {{said was}} true," [...] put in Fred quickly. [...] "I {{was on the}} back of our bobsled and watched you nearly all the time. You came over on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the road at least three {{different}} times." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If Lord Rintoul insulted the piper," [...] I suggested, {{giving the}} farmer {{a helping hand}} cautiously, [...] "it would be through inadvertence.

6000|$|... "Well, {{you know}} what we have to contend against, but we too, are not without strength.

In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are free to use them. We have self devotion in a cause and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not seek}} it," [...] exclaimed Jabez. [...] "I would {{that we might have}} Pharaoh's mouth and ear who soon will himself be Pharaoh upon <b>our</b> <b>side.</b> O Prince <b>of</b> Egypt, be not wroth with all the {{children}} of Israel because their wrongs have made some few of them stubborn and hard-hearted.

6000|$|Lucilla and I happened, on that evening, to be {{guests at}} the rectory table. It {{was one of the}} regular {{occasions}} on which we left <b>our</b> own <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the house, and joined the family at (what Mr. Finch called) [...] "the pastor's evening meal." [...] He had got his wife; he had got his eldest daughter; he had got your humble servant. A horrid smile of enjoyment overspread the reverend gentleman's face, as he surveyed us from {{the opposite end of the}} room, and opened his vocal fire on his audience of three.|$|R
6000|$|... "The false crop-eared hypocrites," [...] cried he, with {{a hearty}} oath, [...] "have had their {{turn of the}} good weather. The sun is on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the hedge now, and we will pay off old scores, as sure as my name is Richard Whitaker." ...|$|E

6000|$|Conrad {{turned to}} Delmar in mock surprise. [...] "South of the road! Your sheep must o' strayed over the line, Mr. Delmar. As they was on <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the range I don't see that I can do {{anything}} for you. If they'd been on the north side----" ...|$|E
60|$|YALLOBALLY RECORD.--"That incompetent shuffler, General Osbourne, {{has again}} put his foot into it. Blundering into Grierson {{with a lot}} of {{unsupported}} horse, he has got exactly what he deserved. The whole command was crushed by that wide-awake fellow, Potty, and a lot of guns and ammunition lie ignominiously deserted on <b>our</b> own <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the river. All this through mere chuckle-headed incompetence and the neglect of the most elementary precautions, within a day's march of two magnificent armies, either of which, under any sane, soldierly man, is capable of marching right through to Glendarule.|$|R
60|$|Joan {{set to work}} at once, and concerted a {{plan with}} Guillaume de Flavy, captain of the city--a plan for a sortie toward evening against the enemy, who was posted in three bodies on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Oise, in the level plain. From <b>our</b> <b>side</b> one <b>of</b> the city gates communicated with a bridge. The end of this bridge was defended on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the river by one of those fortresses called a {{boulevard}}; and this boulevard also commanded a raised road, which stretched from its front across the plain {{to the village of}} Marguy. A force of Burgundians occupied Marguy; another was camped at Clairoix, a couple of miles above the raised road; and a body of English was holding Venette, {{a mile and a half}} below it. A kind of bow-and-arrow arrangement, you see; the causeway the arrow, the boulevard at the feather-end of it, Marguy at the barb, Venette at one end of the bow, Clairoix at the other.|$|R

6000|$|On page 13, {{pamphlet}} edition, {{speaking of}} [...] "a hairy veil" [...] over {{the eyes of}} a species of bison, the author says: [...] "It immediately occurred to the acute mind of Dr. Herschel that this was a providential contrivance to protect the eyes of the animal from the great extremes of light and darkness to which all the inhabitants of <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the moon are periodically subjected." [...] But this cannot be thought a very [...] "acute" [...] observation of the Doctor's. The inhabitants of <b>our</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the moon have, evidently, no darkness at all, so there can be nothing of the [...] "extremes" [...] mentioned. In the absence of the sun they have a light from the earth equal to that of thirteen full unclouded moons.|$|E

60|$|I {{expected}} {{every moment}} that my master would accuse the Yahoos of those unnatural appetites in both sexes, so common among us.

You see, I am a rich man, Wilfrid--really a rich man, and I naturally wish that Marion should be made as happy as possible. I do not think she would be as happy as possible if she were in England with me, with a nice place in the country, and a town-house, and most things that money could bring her, if she knew that her father and mother were out here living a life which, although they have admirably adapted themselves to it, is yet very different to that to which they have been all their lives accustomed.|$|R
60|$|On our way home, and on <b>our</b> own <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Ponte Vecchio, {{we passed}} the Palazzo Guicciardini, the ancient {{residence}} of the historian of Italy, who was a politic statesman of his day, and probably as cruel and unprincipled as any of those whose deeds he has recorded. Opposite, across the narrow way, stands the house of Macchiavelli, who was his friend, and, I should judge, an honester man than he. The house is distinguished by a marble tablet, let into the wall, commemorative of Macchiavelli, but has nothing antique or picturesque about it, being in a continuous line with other smooth-faced and stuccoed edifices.|$|R
