40|$|Microgrids are {{becoming}} popular in commercial buildings {{due to the}} recent drive to achieve net-zero energy targets and improve energy efficiency and reliability in <b>building</b> <b>installations.</b> The commercial <b>building</b> microgrids depict unique characteristics due to generation mix and various types of loads connected to the commercial <b>building</b> <b>installations.</b> Therefore, the commercial building microgrids require special consideration during the operation and control stages. Dynamic models of a microgrid enable researchers to investigate their operational performance and control techniques before the control schemes are actually being implemented in the microgrid system. It is essential to develop more accurate dynamic simulation models of a microgrid in order to verify the fidelity {{and the effectiveness of}} control schemes. This chapter presents a dynamic modelling of a commercial building microgrid system and conducts a stability analysis of the microgrid under various operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{key role}} of the {{building}} envelope in attaining building energy efficiency and satisfactory indoor comfort has long been established. Nevertheless, until recent times, all efforts and attention have mainly been focused on increasing and optimizing the thermal insulation of the envelope components. This strategy was a winning approach for a long time, but its limitations became obvious when users and designers started to consider the overall energy demand of a building and started to aim for Zero Energy Building (ZEB) or nearly ZEB goals. New and more revolutionary concepts and technologies needed to be developed to satisfy such challenging   requirements. The potential benefits of this technological development are relevant since the building envelope {{plays a key role}} in controlling the energy and mass flows from outdoors to indoors (and vice versa) and, moreover, the facades offer a significant opportunity for solar energy exploitation. Several researches have demonstrated that the limitation of the existing facades could be overcome only by switching from ‘static’ to ‘responsive’ and ‘dynamic’ systems, such as Multifunctional Facade Modules (MFMs) and Responsive Building Elements (RBE). These components are able to continuously and pro-actively react to outdoor and indoor environment conditions and facilitate and enhance the exploitation of renewable and low exergy sources. In order to reduce the energy demand, to maximize the indoor comfort conditions and to produce energy at the site, these almost ‘self-sufficient’, or even ‘positive energy’ building skins frequently incorporate different technologies and are functionally connected to <b>other</b> <b>building</b> services and <b>installations.</b> An overview of the technological evolution of the building envelope that has taken place, ranging from traditional components to the innovative skins, will be given in this paper, while focusing on the different approaches that have characterized this development. Examples of innovative solutions for responsive and dynamic components and the future trends of development will also be described.  </span...|$|R
