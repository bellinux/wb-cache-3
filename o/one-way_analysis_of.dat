40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the {{profiles}} of physical self-concept between men and women high school Mexican students. A total sample of 709 participants, 324 women and 385 men, aged 13 - 19 years participated in this study. A quantitative approach with a descriptive and transversal survey design was used. All the participants completed the Physical Self-Description Questionnaire. Results <b>of</b> the <b>one-way</b> multivariate <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> variance, followed by the <b>one-way</b> univariate <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> variance, showed that in comparison among women, men obtained higher scores on the health, coordination, activity, sports competence, strength, flexibility, endurance, global physical self-concept and global self-esteem subscales. However, in the body fat and appearance subscales statistically significant differences were not found because of the differences between men and women in their perception of their physical self-concept, these findings suggest that in order to design any intervention for improving the perceived physical self-concept of the students, the variable gender should be taken into account...|$|R

Couples were categorized into four groups based on their scores on a psychological distress measure, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Husbands and wives completed the demographic questionnaire, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ 6), and the three subscales (domestic adjustment. sexual relationship, social adjustment) of the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS). In addition, husbands completed the Cardiac Symptoms List (CSL) and wives completed the Caregiving Involvement Questionnaire (CIQ).

50|$|In statistics, when a usual one-way ANOVA is performed, it {{is assumed}} that the group variances are {{statistically}} equal. If this assumption is not valid, then the resulting F-test is invalid. The Brown-Forsythe test is a statistical test for the equality of group variances based on performing an ANOVA on a transformation of the response variable. The Brown-Forsythe test statistic is the F statistic resulting from an ordinary <b>one-way</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> variance on the absolute deviations from the median.|$|E
