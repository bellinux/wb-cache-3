5000|$|Reverse payment patent {{settlements}} {{result from}} a peculiarity in US regulatory law arising from the Hatch-Waxman Act passed in 1984. The law encourages patent infringement litigation with incentives outside the patent system. [...] Under the Act, the first generic company to successfully challenge the patents of the innovative company, and that has its Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) accepted by the FDA, is awarded with six months of exclusivity. During that time that FDA {{is not allowed to}} approve any other company's ANDA, and only the <b>originator</b> <b>company</b> and the winning generics company can market the drug. Because of the lack of competition, the price that the generic company can charge during this period is much higher than it eventually will be when other generic companies are allowed to sell the drug as well. [...] In settling the litigation, the generics company can calculate the income it would get due to that 6 month administrative exclusivity, and the innovator can calculate the amount of money it would lose from sales to the generic company. The parties might agree that a cash payment from the innovator to the generic company is an arrangement in which both parties benefit more than they would if the litigation were to continue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{emergence}} of this severe side effect {{led to a}} wave of product liability litigation against generic manufacturers as well as Wyeth. [...] The litigation was complicated since {{there was a lack}} of clarity in jurisdiction between state laws, where product liability is determined, and federal law, which determines how drugs are labelled, as well as between generics companies, which had no control over labelling, and the <b>originator</b> <b>company,</b> which did. [...] The litigation yielded at least two important cases. In Conte v. Wyeth in the California state courts, the claims of the plaintiff against the generic companies Pliva, Teva, and Purepac that had sold the drugs that the plaintiff actually took, and the claims against Wyeth, whose product the plaintiff never took, were all dismissed by the trial court, but the case was appealed, and in 2008 the appellate court upheld the dismissal of the cases against the generic companies, but reversed on Wyeth, allowing the case against Wyeth to proceed. [...] This established an [...] "innovator liability" [...] or [...] "pioneer liability" [...] for pharmaceutical companies. [...] The precedent was not widely followed in California nor in other states. [...] Litigation over the same issues related to metoclopramide also reached the US Supreme Court in PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, in which the court held in 2011 that generic companies cannot be held liable for information, or the lack of information, on the originator's label. [...] As of August 2015 there were about 5000 suits pending across the US, efforts to consolidate them into a class action had failed, and [...] "companies have paid millions in compensation to those suffering from tardive dyskinesia after taking Reglan/metoclopramide." ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{intersection}} between competition law rules on abuse of a dominant position and switching strategies employed by pharmaceutical originator companies. Switching {{is also known as}} ever-greening, product hopping or product life cycle strategies. It {{is one of the most}} topical issues in the patent-antitrust intersection today and consists in launching a slightly modified, second generation pharmaceutical, 1 - 2 years before the patent exclusivity expires for a first generation product. In this window originators try to migrate patients to a reformulated product. If successful, this will shield the originator from the effects of generic substitution for the first generation product. In the AstraZeneca-case the EU General Court held that a selective redrawal of marketing authorizations for a first generation product was an abuse of a dominant position under article 102 TFEU. This article focuses on other components in a switching strategy, especially the timing and content of marketing efforts by an <b>originator</b> <b>company.</b> Marketing is pro-competitive in almost all cases, but due to the special regulatory context in the pharmaceutical industry, marketing by an <b>originator</b> <b>company</b> can be used in an excluding fashion in the pharmaceutical industry. The conclusion is reached that casting the quality or price of the originator’s first generation product in a bad light, in comparison with the second generation product during exclusivity for the first generation product, may be an abuse by a dominant firm falling foul of article 102 TFEU. It is in effect equivalent to negative comparative advertising messages concerning a competitor’s soon to be launched product...|$|E

40|$|In its Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry Report of 2009, the European Commission {{identified}} ‘defensive patent strategies’ as {{a potential}} anti-competitive abuse {{in the sense of}} Article 102 TFEU. Such strategies include in particular patent filings that may delay the market entry of generic drugs or obstruct innovation activity of other <b>originator</b> <b>companies.</b> Yet the Report refrains from a an in-depth legal analysis of such behaviour. With the objective of clarifying the legal implications of the Sector Inquiry Report, the article analyses the AstraZeneca judgment of the General Court of 2010 as a precedent for assessing the anti-competitive character of patent filings under EU competition law. Thereby, it is argued that patent law does not insulate filings against competition-law liability. Yet the judgment, which is limited to ‘static’ price competition between <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> and generics producers, does not provide sufficient guidance for analysing harm to ‘dynamic’ competition in innovation among <b>originator</b> <b>companies.</b> In this regard, the article advocates a cautious approach, according to which a violation of EU competition law requires anti-competitive intent for which the party arguing a violation should carry the burden of proof. The article also refers to the Boehringer case, which was settled by the Commission in Summer 2011, after Boehringer agreed to give up its allegedly anti-competitive blocking patents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Patent pools {{for second}} and third-line Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) {{antiretroviral}} drugs (ARVs) {{should not be}} delayed as they are instrumental to urgent public health needs in the under-served markets. Nonetheless, multinational <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> still seem to perceive patent pooling for ARVs as a minefield that would offer the generic competitors lots of deeply exploitable opportunities, {{to the detriment of}} patent owner’s rights. This paper analyses the brand industry concerns, while looking for a strategy up to a really equitable and free world market, without any discrimination between end-users in wealthy and resource-limited countries. This strategy would urge partnerships between <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> first to make newer FDC ARVs quickly available and allow patent pool agreements with generic counterparts to be negotiated straight afterwards. The patent pool strategy highlighted in this paper would assert the primacy of health over for-profit policies, while aligning with the 61 st WHO’s Assembly recommendations and G 7, G 8 and World Trade Organisation’s warnings and pledges against trade protectionism...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} patent filing {{strategies}} of foreign pharmaceutical companies in Chile distinguishing between "primary" (active ingredient) and "secondary" patents (patents on modified compounds, formulations, dosages, particular medical uses, etc.). There is prior evidence that secondary patents {{are used by}} pharmaceutical <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> in the U. S. and Europe to extend patent protection on drugs in length and breadth. Using a novel dataset that comprises all drugs registered in Chile between 1991 and 2010 {{as well as the}} corresponding patents and trademarks, we find evidence that foreign <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> pursue similar strategies in Chile. We find a primary to secondary patents ratio of 1 : 4 at the drug-level, which is comparable to the available evidence for Europe; most secondary patents are filed over several years following the original primary patent and after the protected active ingredient has obtained market approval in Chile. This points toward effective patent term extensions through secondary patents. Secondary patents dominate "older" therapeutic classes like anti-ulcer and anti-depressants. In contrast, newer areas like anti-virals and anti-neoplastics (anti-cancer) have a much larger share of primary patents...|$|R

40|$|The current HIV/AIDS {{scenario}} in India is quite grim {{with an estimated}} 2. 4 million people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in 2008, just behind South Africa and Nigeria. The anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) remain the main stay of global HIV/AIDS treatment. Over 30 ARVs (single and FDCs) available under six categories viz., NRTIs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), Protease inhibitors, the new Fusion inhibitors, Entry inhibitors-CCR 5 co-receptor antagonists and HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors. The major <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> for these ARVs are: Abbott, Boehringer Ingelheim (BI), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Merck, Pfizer, Roche, and Tibotec. Beginning with zidovidine in 1987, all the drugs {{are available in the}} developed countries. In India, about 30 ARVs are available as generics manufactured by Aurobindo, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh; Cipla Limited, Goa; Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Pune, Maharashtra; Hetero Drugs, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh; Macleods Pharmaceuticals, Daman; Matrix Laboratories, Nashik, Maharashtra; Ranbaxy, Sirmour, Himachal Pradesh; and Strides Arcolab, Bangalore, Karnataka. The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) set up in 1992 by the Govt. of India provides free ARVs to HIV positive patients in India since 2004. The drugs available in India include both single drugs and FDCs covering both first line and second line ARVs. Even while there are claims of stabilization of the disease load, there is still huge gap of those who require ARVs as only about 150, 000 PLHA receive the ARVs from the Govt. and other sources. Access to ARVs therefore is still a cause of serious concern ever since India became fully Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) -complaint in 2005. Therefore, the Indian pharmaceutical companies cannot make generics for those for drugs introduced post- 2005 due to product patent regime. Other concerns include heat stable, other better formulations and second line ARVs for adults and more drugs and formulations for paediatric groups, that are still to be widely available in India and other developing countries. To examine whether strong intellectual property (IP) protection systems are to be considered important barriers for the limited or lack of access to ARVs, we studied the patent profile of the ARVs of the <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> within and outside India. We could record 93 patents in the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). The <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> have been also aggressively filing and enforcing patents in India. There have been a few efforts by companies like Gilead and GSK to grant licenses to generic manufacturers in developing countries, ostensibly to promote access to ARVs through lower (two-tier) pricing. These steps are considered as too little and too late. There is an urgent need to look for alternative strategies to promote access to ARVs both linked to and independent of IPRs. Patent pooling as a viable strategy mooted by the UNITAID should be seriously explored to promote access to ARVs. India is ideally suited for trying out the patent pool strategy as most of the global requirement of affordable ARV drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment is sourced from Indian generic companies...|$|R

An investor-state dispute over high data disclosure can be imminent due to the significant role of foreign direct investment in the global pharmaceutical industry and substantial, exponentially increasing costs incurred by drug <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> in conducting clinical trials. The question is whether investor-state arbitration is an apt instrument to protect data against disclosure policy. The analysis highlights that the application of standards of investment protection depends on the specifics of information at issue, its value and functions in investor’s commercial operations.

30|$|The TRIPS Agreement {{includes}} {{specific rules}} on compulsory licensing, parallel importation {{and the application}} of patent law. For instance, Article 30 allows governments to make limited exceptions to patent rights provided certain conditions are met. The Agreement goes on to recognize that such exceptions must not “unreasonably” conflict with the “normal” exploitation of the patent and must not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, while taking the legitimate interest of third parties into account. Article 31 of the Agreement allows developed and developing countries to provide for compulsory licensing in their national legislation and does not limit the reasons for which governments may grant compulsory licences. Having said this, governments’ use of a patent without the authorization of the right holder can only be done only under a number of conditions that protect the legitimate interests of patent holders. There have, however, been instances when generic producers and <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> in developed and developing countries have disagreed on issues of patent linkage and/or the extent of data protection. A prominent case law example extraterritorial application of national laws under TRIPS is European Union-Seizure of Generic Drugs in Transit (WT/DS 408, May 2011). Yet another Article 30 interpretation is in case law Canada-Pharmaceuticals (WTO/DS 114) that allows countries to allow manufacturers of generic drugs to use the patented invention, without the patent owner’s permission and before the patent protection expires, for the purpose of obtaining marketing approval from public health authorities.|$|R

The 'Wet funding' type of warehouse credit is riskier in terms of possible fraud because the credit provider will not be aware of any potential problems until after the funds are sent to the loan originator. Measures that the warehouse lender can take to limit fraud can be a strong screening process for mortgage brokers and mortgage banking companies, making sure the loan originator itself has a strong internal screening process, limiting the amount available for 'wet funding', and having separate account for funds coming from sale of loans to investors.|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} at the {{controversial}} intersection of medicine patent protection and access to medicines at the international level. Advocates for medicine access argue that medicine patent protection may allow prices to become elevated, thereby frustrating medicine access. But advocates for medicine patent protection argue that the patent system incentivized {{the research and development}} to make the product possible in the first place. While this ideological debate is valuable, this doctoral project acknowledges the patent system’s existence and seeks to produce research to advance medicine access pragmatically within this context, especially in developing countries and especially for drugs appearing on the World Health Organization’s Model List of Essential Medicines (MLEM). In cooperation with the World Intellectual Property Organization, this project commenced with a legal study to assess the patent status of the entire MLEM (375 medicines) in 137 developing countries. Gathering these patent data and verifying them with global pharmaceutical suppliers was this project’s principal data collection. The patent data were further linked to development indicators of the countries implicated by our study and to economic data detailing medicine procurements made by those working with assistance from international organizations. Building upon the techniques refined during the MLEM study, three supplementary patent studies were performed to investigate very specific questions regarding medicine patenting and medicine access. With these patent data collected, we investigated companies’ medicine patent filing behaviours internationally. Various policy approaches to accelerating access at the international level were compared, including those that disregard patent protection and those are based on cooperation between medicine suppliers. Of the approaches considered, the cooperative approaches appeared to be the most efficient, especially voluntary licensing practices (i. e., <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> license generic manufacturers to supply the product to developing countries in exchange for royalties). We find that while patents may detour generic competition at times, we also find they may serve as springboards for collaborative endeavours and global medicine access campaigns, like the one for HIV drugs. This thesis concludes by arguing that improved international medicine patent transparency by pharmaceutical suppliers {{is one of the most}} powerful ways to foster such collaborations to improve medicine access...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Historically in Norway, {{pharmaceutical}} {{prices have}} been particularly high for originator drugs, which are produced by <b>originator</b> <b>companies</b> that have a monopoly through the patent system. However, once the patent expires, generic drugs are able to enter the market and cause a considerable decline in price. The Norwegian Medicine Agency (NoMA) is responsible for issuing market authorization (MA) and inclusion in the reimbursement scheme, for any new drugs in Norway. NoMA must evaluate the cost-effectiveness analysis of the originator drug provided by the pharmaceutical company. In order to predict cost- effectiveness, {{it is important to}} estimate how long the originator drug will stay in the market before generic competition is established. Objectives: Investigate how long it takes for a generic drug to enter the market after applying for MA, and what are the potential reasons for the time span used. Methodology: A combination of qualitative and quantitative study design. Empirically based and a single-case study. There were in-depth interviews conducted with executive officers at NoMA and representatives from generic and originator firms. The quantitative data was collected from the NoMA´s databases, namely Athene and P 360. The data was divided into four phases and a statistical description of each phase was created. Furthermore each phase was divided into two periods 2005 - 08 and 2009 - 12 for the purpose of running a Man Whitney U test in order to reveal the time differences between the two periods. Results: For quantitative analysis the following was found: (1) For a generic medicine to obtain MA it takes 357 days according to median. (2) A generic drug used 131 days (median) to enter the market after MA approval. (3) Additionally in the second period 2009 - 12 it took longer time to obtain MA and enter the market compared to the first period of 2005 - 08. For qualitative analysis the following was discovered: (1) Various obstacles which affect the MA process. (2) Patent obstacles and complications which affect the overall time span. (3) Norway is a relatively small market and therefore less attractive for some generic companies. (4) Production issues and challenges faced by generic firms. (5) In some cases, the substitution list and reimbursement scheme processes can cause delays to the overall time span. (6) Once the original drug patent expires, the original firms can choose to enter the stepped price system and create competition for generic firms, which causes a delay in entering the market...|$|R
40|$|IN 2008 AND 2009, the European Commission {{conducted}} its Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry {{based on}} a suspicion that a slower rate of approval for new drugs may have resulted from violations of European Union competition law. The Commission issued Preliminary and Final Reports detailing {{the findings of the}} Inquiry, which did not include any findings of the sort of competition law violations originally sought. Instead, one of its chief findings was that <b>originator</b> pharmaceutical <b>companies</b> engaged in business practices the Commission termed "tool-boxes" allegedly designed to deter or delay the entry of generic copies into the market. Both Reports concluded that these "tool-box" practices resulted in approximately (sic) 3 billion in losses to consumers and accordingly could be considered abuses of dominance under Article 82 EC (now Article 102 TFEU). However, the Commission did not consider whether such originator business practices were actually legitimate defenses by dominant undertakings against attacks by generic pharmaceutical companies of a sort the European Court of Justice holds justifiable under Article 82 EC. This lapse is difficult to understand, as the evidence in both Reports, as well as publicly available evidence, demonstrates that generic companies engage in similar business practices that may be termed "generic tool-boxes. ...|$|R

As the in-house production capacities of the <b>originators,</b> the pharmaceutical <b>companies</b> Smith, Kline & French and Glaxo, could not keep pace with the rapidly increasing requirements, both companies (now merged as GlaxoSmithKline) outsourced part of the manufacturing to chemical companies experienced in producing relatively sophisticated organic molecules.

40|$|There is no gainsaying {{the fact}} that access to {{affordable}} medicine {{is an issue that}} continues to elicit a considerable degree of concern all over the world albeit the effects of the problem are evidently more devastating in the developing countries. The international patent regime under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) is seen as {{a major part of the}} global access to medicine problem. Patents are exclusive ownership and exploitation rights granted in respect of inventions possessing a degree of novelty, some scintilla of inventiveness over what is already known and having significant utility value 2. Prior to the advent of the TRIPS Agreement, most developing countries did not extend patent protection to pharmaceutical products. As a consequence, in those developing countries that either excluded pharmaceuticals from patenting or did not yet have a patent system in force, and that had indigenous manufacturing capacity, generic firms were able to enter the market and sell medicines at considerably lower prices than the <b>originator</b> pharmaceutical <b>companies,</b> whilst also driving prices of the original drugs down by the competitive force they exerted in the market. 3 However with the advent of TRIPS, all WTO countries became bound to grant patents for pharmaceuticals to meet their obligations under TRIPS 4.

40|$|Background: Generic {{medicines}} {{result from}} expired intellectual property protection {{and the ability}} of pharmaceutical producers, other than <b>originator</b> <b>companies,</b> to manufacture analogous medicines containing identical active ingredients and to distribute them in relevant markets. Cost reductions associated with procurement of generics by national agencies, and subsequent savings for patients buying generic medicines from pharmacies, result in policies regarding generic medicines and reference pricing being promoted by governments internationally. In Ireland, however, generic medicines usage has been poor historically and attitudes of stakeholders, other than the Irish Government, have been relatively negative. In June 2013 the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act was signed into law, meaning that Irish patients are now more likely than ever before to receive a generic medicine. Objectives From 2013, general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists alike are likely to encounter greater patient awareness, and discussion, of generic medicines, their potential benefits and disadvantages. This thesis focused initially on providing a comprehensive description of generic medicines and their development and, at a time immediately preceding introduction of the Irish Act, on gaining insight into current stakeholder attitudes and awareness towards generic medicines in Ireland. In parallel, a novel tool based on principles of understandability and readability of text was developed. This was utilised to assess websites most likely to be accessed by patients seeking information regarding generic medicines across a number of English speaking regions, with emphasis on Ireland. Methods Mixed methods studies (in the format of 1 : 1 interviews) with GPs, pharmacists and patients from rural and urban settings in Ireland. Analysis of interviews was both qualitative and quantitative using SPSS (version 20) and NVivo (version 9), as appropriate. Evaluation of websites was completed with a novel Website Quality Assessment (WQA) tool, developed as part of this thesis. Websites most likely to be used by searchers looking for online information about generic medicines in five Englishspeaking geographical regions (US, UK, Ireland, Canada and Australia) were assessed for quality and accessibility (in terms of readability and understandability) of information provided. Results Analysis of survey data showed that there was a hierarchy of understanding and acceptance of generic medicines in Ireland. In summary, pharmacists had the greatest understanding of generic medicines and the processes associated with their regulation and safety, followed by GPs and then patients. Notably, GPs had less confidence in generics than pharmacists; indeed 5 / 34 (15 %) of GPs would prefer not to use a generic medicine if provided an originator alternative versus 3 / 44 (7 %) of pharmacists. Patients expressed the lowest level of confidence with 9 / 38 (24 %) stating a preference for the branded medication in addition to a belief that generics were of poorer quality than originator medicines. Use of the WQA tool, following peer review and validation of its design, demonstrated clearly that readability and understandability of healthcare information influenced the Google search ranking of generic medicine-related websites. In Ireland, analogous to other jurisdictions, none of the websites most likely to be seen by a searcher demonstrated the desired combination of scoring highly for both quality of information and readability. Conclusions: In summary, these investigations impart new insights regarding knowledge, attitudes and behaviours in Ireland towards generic medicines, determine and evaluate the Internet resources likely to be accessed by those seeking knowledge on this topic across a number of English-speaking regions, and provide a unique tool to enhance the promotion and provision of relevant information...|$|R
40|$|Securitization as a {{financial}} instrument has had an extremely {{significant impact on the}} world's financial system. First, by integrating capital markets and the uses of resources - such as mortgage <b>originators,</b> finance <b>companies,</b> governments, etc. - it has strengthened the trend towards disintermediation. Having been able to mitigate agency costs, it has made lending more efficient; evidence of this can be observed in the mortgage markets. By permitting firms to originate and hold assets off the balance sheet, it has generated much higher levels of leverage and, though arguably, greater economies of scale. Combination of securitization techniques with credit derivatives and risk transfer devices continues to develop innovative methods of transforming risk into a commodity and allow various market participants to tap into sectors which were otherwise not open to them. In its broadest sense, the term "securitization" implies a process by which {{a financial}} relationship is converted into a transaction. A financial transaction is the coming together of two or more entities; a financial relationship is their staying together. For example, a loan to a corporation is a financial relationship; once the loan is transformed into a tradable bond, it is a transaction. We find several examples {{in the history of the}} evolution of finance of relationships that have been converted into transactions. The creation of "stock," representing ownership in a corporation, is one of the earliest and most important examples of this process because of its impact on the growth of the corporate form of business organization. The process of converting loans to corporations of high credit quality corporate borrowers, and in the 1970 s expanding that opportunity to speculative-grade corporate borrowers, into publicly traded bonds is another example of this. Commercial paper is another example of securitization of relationships as it securitizes a trade debt.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} relationship between vertical integration and market structure formation. It does so by combining the empirical industrial organization literature on vertical integration with that on market entry. The first empirical essay, Chapter 2, explores the motives for vertical integration in the US generic pharmaceutical industry. The industry {{is made up of}} numerous drug markets that open up to competition among generic manufacturers at different points in time. Each market consists of an upstream segment that manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients, and a downstream segment that processes the active pharmaceutical ingredients into finished formulations and supplies them to final consumers. The econometric analysis shows that vertical integration in the generic drug industry is characterized by bandwagon behavior. While bandwagon effects have been widely discussed in the vertical integration literature, this study {{is one of the first}} to present empirical evidence on its existence. The analysis also indicates that vertical integration is partly driven by the need for a particular form of relationship-specific non-contractible investment [...] the early development of active pharmaceutical ingredients by upstream units. The relationship-specificity of such investments is greater in markets where generic firms try to enter by challenging the patents held by <b>originator</b> pharmaceutical <b>companies.</b> I find that in such markets, individual firms have a higher propensity to vertically integrate. The second empirical essay, presented as Chapter 3, introduces an econometric model of a vertical entry game. The model is used to estimate rival effects [...] the effect of rival entry on the post-entry profits of individual firms. These estimates allow us to make inferences about the competitive effects of vertical integration. Application of the model to the generic pharmaceutical industry yields the following result: vertical integration has significant efficiency effects that benefit unintegrated downstream firms. This implies that vertical integration is likely to be procompetitive from a static point of view. The parameter estimates are used to simulate the impact of a hypothetical policy that bans vertically integrated entry. The results indicate that such a ban tends to reduce the equilibrium number of downstream entrants. This suggests that the effect of vertical integration on market structure formation is also procompetitive...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{financial}} sector regulation and supervision in Bermuda {{in the context of}} the offshore financial center assessment program. The assessment reveals that the financial, regulatory, and supervisory framework is well developed in banking, the key areas of securities regulation, and antimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). Banking supervision is largely in conformity with the Basel Core Principles. The regulation of investment intermediaries and collective investment schemes, the main activities of the Bermudian securities industry, is working effectively. However, some deficiencies were noted in the assessment of insurance.
