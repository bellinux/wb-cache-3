As such, studio musicians use pro-grade guitar amplifiers that have ground lift switches, which can be toggled to remove ground loop hum. Similarly, whereas a working guitarist can use standard quality plastic case effect pedals and preamplifiers, session musicians typically use expensive boutique pedals which have heavy-gauge metal chassis (which prevent noise from nearby magnetic fields from affecting the sound), true bypass switching, studio-grade preamps, discrete Class-A signal paths, <b>opto-couplers</b> for noiseless switching, and isolated transformers to prevent buzz and hum.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} of an opto-isolator is to block such high voltages and voltage transients, {{so that a}} surge {{in one part of}} the system will not disrupt or destroy the other parts. Historically, this function was delegated to isolation transformers, which use inductive coupling between galvanically isolated input and output sides. Transformers and opto-isolators are the only two classes of electronic devices that offer reinforced protection — they protect both the equipment and the human user operating this equipment. They contain a single physical isolation barrier, but provide protection equivalent to double isolation. Safety, testing and approval of <b>opto-couplers</b> are regulated by national and international standards: IEC 60747-5-2, EN (CENELEC) 60747-5-2, UL 1577, CSA Component Acceptance Notice #5, etc. Opto-isolator specifications published by manufacturers always follow at least one of these regulatory frameworks.|$|E

Such adapters will ensure {{that there is no}} electrical connection of any kind between both sides of the adapter, including ground. They either use transformers or <b>opto-couplers</b> to transfer the trigger impulse from the camera to the flash. Their electronics cannot be powered from the flash and therefore needs a power supply in form of a small battery.As an example, Minolta offered the PC terminal adapter PCT-100 (8825-691) for this purpose, which worked as a galvanic isolator and could withstand 400 volts DC or AC. The similar Sony flash sync terminal and ISO hotshoe adapters FA-ST1AM and FA-HS1AM offer galvanic isolation as well, but can withstand voltages up to 60 volts DC or AC only.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{isolated}} {{switched mode}} power supplies (SMPSs) commonly utilise digital control methods over their classical analogue counterparts. These methods are now preferred {{for ease of}} programmability and implementation, scalability and they also accommodate advanced control techniques such as adaptive control. However in most digital implementations, inexpensive <b>opto-couplers</b> are still used to transmit analogue signals across the isolation barrier. It {{is well known that}} these types of <b>opto-couplers</b> suffer many drawbacks including variable gain due to ageing effects. The main research contribution in this thesis focuses on developing and implementing a full bi-directional digital data-link between both sides of the isolation barrier, i. e. all signals (feedback and auxiliary) are digitalised and transmitted as a single encoded data stream across the isolation barrier. A key advantage of this scheme is that only a single set of digital couplers is required to achieve bi-directional communication, when compared with its analogue counterpart which would require multiple <b>opto-couplers.</b> This proposed scheme is therefore a more cost-effective and efficient solution and does not suffer from performance degradation due to ageing effects. To reduce the size and improve power efficiency and loop response, switching frequencies are continually increasing. Higher switching frequencies reduce the transmission window and therefore the number of bits to be transmitted across the isolation barrier per switching cycle needs to be minimised. To achieve this objective for the bi-directional data-link proposed, a new state-dependent encoding scheme for the required analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) has been specifically designed. This state-dependent encoding scheme ensures a high resolution during the steady-state operation of the SMPS while still providing adequate accuracy during transients. Along with the state-dependent ADC, two digital pulse width modulators (DPWMs) for single- and multi-phase SMPSs have been designed for use with the proposed communication system. These DPWMs were implemented using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), but are also suitable for application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The DPWM designs only require a small number of logic elements while achieving high speed and high resolution, temperature independence and good scalability. This has been achieved using a hybrid approach which uses a novel fine-resolution block along with a coarse resolution block. This approach takes advantage of digital clock manager (DCM) blocks available on most commercial FPGAs available today. Manual placing and routing techniques result in high linearity and monotonic behaviour. For test purposes, the bi-directional communication scheme has been implemented on FPGAs and verified using a custom-built SMPS board...|$|E
