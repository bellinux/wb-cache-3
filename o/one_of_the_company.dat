Gunnery Sergeant Daly was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> to leave Fort Liberte, Haiti, for a six-day reconnaissance. After dark on the evening of 24 October, while crossing the river in a deep ravine, the detachment was suddenly fired upon from three sides by about 400 Cacos concealed in bushes about 100 yards from the fort. The Marine detachment fought its way forward to a good position, which it maintained during the night, although subjected to a continuous fire from the Cacos. At daybreak the Marines, in three squads, advanced in three different directions, surprising and scattering the Cacos in all directions. Gunnery Sergeant Daly fought with exceptional gallantry against heavy odds throughout this action.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{announcement}} was made that the implosion had been approved, {{it was reported that}} the demolition contractors considered putting the right to push the button for the implosion up for auction, with the proceeds going to charity. [...] "I've seen them go for $6,000" [...] is how <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> representatives was quoted, but the issue of liability needed to be worked through. The auction was set up on the internet auction website Trade Me and went live on Tuesday, 24 July, at 11am. It was set up with a $1 reserve (meaning that theoretically, the right to push the button could have been sold for just $1). The auction was hugely popular and within one hour, bidding had reached $6,000. Bidding reached $30,000, but some bids were considered illegitimate and Trade Me staff removed them, and in other cases, bidders themselves requested to be removed.|$|E

Astonishings first issue was dated February 1940; it was bimonthly, alternating monthly with Super Science Stories.

[...] At ten cents, the magazine was cheaper {{than any of the}} other sf magazines of the day, and it sold well, despite Pohl's limited resources. [...] It was certainly assisted by Popular's wide and effective distribution network, and the publisher soon increased Pohl's budget, to pay bonuses for popular stories. [...] Pohl later commented that he {{was uncertain}} whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions, although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine. [...] Some of the additional money went to long-time writer Ray Cummings, who was sufficiently well known that the young Pohl felt unable to reject his stories, even though he disliked his work. [...] Cummings came to see Pohl in person to submit his work, and refused to sell for less than one cent a word; since the first visit came on a day when Pohl had some extra money available, Pohl was never able to bring himself to tell Cummings that he could not really afford to pay that rate. [...] Pohl comments in his memoirs that [...] "for months he would turn up regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story; I hated them all, and bought them all." ...|$|E

This ball is called cnapan and is by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> hurling bolt upright into the air, and at the fall he that catches it hurls it towards the country he plays for, for goal or appointed place there is none neither needs any, for the play is not given over until the cnapan be so far carried that there is no hope to return it back that night, for the carrying of it a mile or two miles from the first place is no losing of the honour so it be still followed by the company and the play still maintained, it is oftentimes seen the chase to follow two miles and more..." ...|$|E
