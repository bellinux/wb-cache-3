6000|$|... [Footnote 17: We {{must not}} be so far deceived by the {{evidence}} before Parliament, relating to the want of connection between the prices of corn and of labour, as to suppose that they are really independent of each other. The price of the necessaries of life is, in fact, the cost of producing labour. The supply cannot proceed, if it be not paid; and though {{there will always be}} a little latitude, owing to some variations of industry and habits, and the distance of time between the encouragement to population and the period of the results appearing in the markets: yet it is a still greater error, to suppose the price of labour unconnected with the price of corn, than to suppose that the price of corn immediately and completely regulates it. Corn and labour rarely march quite abreast; but there is an obvious limit, beyond which they cannot be separated. With regard to the unusual exertions made by the labouring classes in periods of dearness, which produce the fall of wages noticed in the evidence, they are most meritorious in the individuals, and certainly favour the growth of capital. But no man of humanity could wish to see them constant and unremitted. They are most admirable as a temporary relief; but if they were constantly in action, effects of a similar kind would result from them, as from the population of a country being pushed to the very extreme limits of its food. There would be no resources in a scarcity. I own I do not see, with pleasure, the great extension of the practice of task work. To work really hard during twelve or fourteen hours in the day, for any length of time, is too much for a human being. Some intervals of ease are necessary to health and happiness: and the <b>occasional</b> <b>abuse</b> of such intervals is no valid argument against their use.] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{discusses}} {{the relation between}} corruption and accountability, showing that the more accountable a government is, the greater {{the ability of the}} voter to evaluate the true effectiveness of that government and inhibit and repress <b>occasional</b> <b>abuses.</b> Confidence in the political class is dependent on mechanisms that guarantee freedom and the preservation of that confidence, which is in direct relation to the need for accountability. A consequent issue is the effectiveness of what has been called vertical accountability, i. e., elections. This article argues that elections serve only to invest authority in politicians and do not reward or punish; therefore, elections are a weak mechanism for accountability. Finally, this article establishes the importance of accountability in representative democracies for good institutional functioning...|$|R

50|$|The Children's Aid Society (CAS), {{the best-known}} {{organization}} finding homes for children, made efforts to screen the host families and {{follow up on}} the welfare of placed children. By 1909, at the first White House Conference on Dependent Children, the country's top social reformers praised the CAS' emigration movement, but argued that children should either be kept with their natal families or, if they were removed {{as a result of}} parental neglect or abuse, every effort should be made to place the child in a foster home nearby. In a report in 1910, the Children’s Aid Society estimated that 87 percent of children placed by the Orphan Train program had done well. While there was <b>occasional</b> <b>abuse,</b> most people agreed that over all, the children were generally better off than on the streets of big cities without proper food, clothing and shelter.|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen breath {{tests are}} widely used to explore the {{pathophysiology}} of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and carbohydrate malabsorption are disorders detected by these tests that have been proposed to be of great importance for symptoms in, for instance, irritable bowel syndrome. However, conclusions drawn from these studies are highly controversial and divergent results exist. There is also an extensive use of these tests in clinical practice with difficulties regarding interpretation of the tests and sometimes erroneous conclusions. The limitations and pitfalls of these tests will be reviewed in this article, and hopefully the <b>occasional</b> <b>abuse</b> of these tests {{can be turned into}} proper clinical and scientific use instead in the future...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} acute myocardial infarction in a 19 -year-old woman reporting a history of <b>occasional</b> cocaine <b>abuse</b> with last exposure 4 days before symptom onset, otherwise at low cardiovascular risk. Coronary angiography showed thrombotic occlusion of anterior descending coronary artery without atherosclerotic plaques, and complete recanalization of the vessel after anticoagulation with enoxaparine. Hypercoagulability evaluation revealed the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. We suppose that cocaine abuse {{may have had a}} delayed effect as trigger of acute myocardial infarction. This action may be due to cocaine-induced endothelial activation and to a synergic prothrombotic activity of cocaine and antiphospholipid antibodies...|$|R

Although the chapel disappeared {{along with the rest of}} the medieval building following the cataclysm of 1666, archaeological investigations, pre-Fire illustrations and, most importantly, documentary evidence from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries provide invaluable evidence for the appearance of the chapel. This paper utilizes a range of evidence to suggest how the Jesus Chapel may have appeared on the eve of the Reformation; particular attention will be paid to the furnishings and fittings of the building, and to the use (and <b>occasional</b> <b>abuse)</b> of this remarkable place of worship.

50|$|Generally {{speaking}} {{the courts and}} police in Saint Kitts and Nevis are considered effective and corruption free, and the legal system is considered effective. However {{there is a lack}} of civilian oversight and interaction with the police department, as well as <b>occasional</b> reports of <b>abuse</b> perpetrated by the police. The biggest barrier to fighting crime is seen the country's outdated prison system, with many if not all prisons are old and overcrowded. Building new prisons and improving the relationships between the police and community are seen as the biggest improvements the government can make to combat crime.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} how {{personality traits}} {{are associated with}} <b>occasional</b> use, <b>abuse,</b> and dependence of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and hallucinogens in a large availability sample of adults via online questionnaires. Methods: The sample consisted of 8, 646 individuals (24. 7 % men and 75. 3 % women) who completed an anonymous web survey. Involvement with drugs and temperament/character traits were assessed through the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) and the Temperament and Character Inventory - Revised (TCI-R), respectively. Interactions among variables were analyzed using MANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment. Results: Novelty seeking was the trait most associated with increased involvement with alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine. There was a significant association between harm avoidance and benzodiazepine use. Persistence was lower in cannabis-, benzodiazepine-, and cocaine-dependent subjects, {{as well as in}} hallucinogen abusers. Self-directedness was reduced in dependents of all drug classes. No strong relationships were found between other temperament or character dimensions and the severity of drug use. Conclusions: Novelty seeking was associated with increased involvement with all drugs studied in this sample, although to a lesser extent with benzodiazepines and hallucinogens. The temperament and character profile for benzodiazepine use was different from that of other drugs due to the relationship with higher harm avoidance and self-transcendence and lower self-directedness...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Centre for drug- and {{addiction}} treatment and Centre {{for learning and}} coping at Oslo University Hospital arrange the course “Mestre Jobben – Mestre Livet”. This course aims to teach life coping mechanisms {{and the ability to}} master a process towards life-style change. Its intent develops from the demonstration that people struggling with dependence on alcohol and/or other substances and maintain an employer-employee relationship {{have a significant effect on}} society in terms of reduced work supply, sick absence, and reduced productivity. However, this population may only <b>occasional</b> attend substance <b>abuse</b> clinic services. Objective: This thesis investigates how participation in “Mestre Jobben – Mestre Livet” has led to a changed work supply, sick leave status and health related quality of life among participants. Method: The method of investigation uses descriptive statistics by comparing group means, correlation analysis and simple regression, and asking if participation has had desirable effects on life change. The data have been collected by a postal survey to all the participants of “Mestre Jobben – Mestre Livet” from the start-up in the fall of 2009 to the spring of 2011. Results: The fraction of participants maintaining a 100 % work position has increased from 60 to 65 %. The study showed no change in sick leave status was found. Results showed that quality of life (indicated by a mental health component scale variable) increased at a group level but is still lower than the score of a normal population. Conclusion: “Mestre Jobben – Mestre Livet” meets criteria which show the aim to be considered fulfilled. Although, because of limitations in the study design alongside limited data, there is some uncertainty related to the strength of these findings...|$|R
