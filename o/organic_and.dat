5|$|There are varying classifications of {{oil shales}} {{depending}} on their mineral content, type of kerogen, age, depositional history, and organisms from which they are derived. The age of the oil shale deposits ranges from Cambrian to Tertiary age. Lithologies range from shales to marl and carbonate rocks, all of which form a mixture of tightly bound <b>organic</b> <b>and</b> inorganic materials.|$|E
5|$|Under {{ultraviolet}} illumination, curium(III) ions exhibit {{strong and}} stable yellow-orange fluorescence {{with a maximum}} in the range about 590–640nm depending on their environment.

Broader threats are sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH changes from ocean acidification, all associated with greenhouse gas emissions. In 1998, 16% of the world's reefs {{died as a}} result of increased water temperature.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí {{is usually}} {{considered}} the great master of Catalan Modernism, but his works go beyond any one style or classification.

Some of his greatest inspirations came from visits to the mountain of Montserrat, the caves of Mallorca, the saltpetre caves in Collbató, the crag of Fra Guerau in the Prades Mountains behind Reus, the Pareis mountain in the north of Mallorca and Sant Miquel del Fai in Bigues i Riells.|$|E
5|$|IUPAC {{committee}} {{has a long}} history of officially naming <b>organic</b> <b>and</b> inorganic compounds.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a noble gas atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain <b>organic</b> <b>and</b> inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} can {{be divided}} into thermotropic, lyotropic and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of organic molecules, although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and concentration of the liquid-crystal molecules in a solvent (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both <b>organic</b> <b>and</b> inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.|$|E

By far, most hydrochloric acid is consumed captively by the producer. The open world market size is estimated at 5Mt/year.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of geostatistics {{to explore}} the spatial {{distribution}} and variability of soil properties has become an important tool to recognize soil properties. In this paper, we combined actual field sampling data with geostatistics to study the characteristic and spatial variability of soil <b>organic</b> matter <b>and</b> <b>organic</b> carbon content around Qinghai Lake. The {{results showed that the}} mean content of soil organic carbon is 5. 95 ± 3. 40 %, <b>and</b> <b>organic</b> matter is 3. 45 ± 1. 97 %, both are low. The variogram model of semi-variance function graph showed the models of soil <b>organic</b> carbon <b>and</b> matter are the exponential model. Isotropic ratio of nugget to sill of soil <b>organic</b> carbon <b>and</b> <b>organic</b> matter are 82. 9 % and 83 %, both variable range are 9300 m, all are in the range, here exists a correlation between <b>organic</b> carbon <b>and</b> <b>organic</b> matter content in the space. Fractal dimension can exhibit the higher spatial heterogeneity of soil <b>organic</b> carbon <b>and</b> <b>organic</b> matter content around Qinghai Lake. Anisotropy semi-variance analysis reveals that there does not exist any anisotropy structural characteristics of soil <b>organic</b> carbon <b>and</b> <b>organic</b> matter content in different directions in the study area; but there is spatial variability in the east - west as for organic matter content, while variability is very small in the other directions...|$|R

NILU also creates air samples annually to generate data for trend analysis. The weekly air pollution measurements are compared to equivalent measurements at Zeppelin. Ground measurements are taken of ozone and mercury, two of the greatest pollution threats in the polar regions.
