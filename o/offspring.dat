5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological <b>offspring.</b> The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological <b>offspring</b> may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological <b>offspring</b> develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the biological <b>offspring.</b> Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological <b>offspring</b> from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E

Materials and methods: In this study 20 female and 8 male rats were addicted by oral administration (32 mg/kg twice daily) of morphine for 5 days. Then the animals were exposed to 20 non addicted female, and 8 non addicted male rats In pubert offsprigs. Basal and electrical stimulated (700 µA and 10 Hz frequency) of extracellular glutamate concentration of dentate gyrus were collected by in vivo microdialysis technique and measured using flurometric HPLC. Findings: In male <b>offsprings</b> of sham control 1, sham control 2, test 1 and test 2 basal and electrical stimulated of extracellular glutamate concentration of dentate gyrus were: 0. 67 ± 0. 04, 1. 11 ± 0. 1, and in female <b>offsprings</b> were 0. 47 ± 0. 06, 0. 88 ± 0. 05 (n= 5). The basal and stimulated extra cellular glutamate concentration of dentate gyrus was decreased in both test 1 and test 2 <b>offsprings.</b> It was less in test 1 than test 2 <b>offsprings.</b> The glutamate concentration of dentate gyrus in female <b>offsprings</b> of test 1 group was {{less than that of}} the male <b>offsprings.</b> conclusion: The results suggest that parental morphine addiction may cause learning deficiency through reduction of extracellular glutamate concentration in dentate gyrus so the side effects of parental morphine addiction in <b>offsprings</b> must be considered...|$|R

5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{adjust the}} sex ratio of their <b>offspring</b> {{according}} to the food availability and population density. Male <b>offspring</b> usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex {{at the beginning of}} a breeding season when the food is abundant. Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with <b>offspring</b> that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in <b>offspring</b> sex ratio.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of <b>offspring</b> from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the <b>offspring</b> by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the <b>offspring</b> and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the <b>offspring</b> while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the <b>offspring</b> more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the <b>offspring</b> unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the <b>offspring</b> when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E

When incubating a nest, or when <b>offspring</b> are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack.

5|$|After the <b>offspring</b> are born, lemurs either {{carry them}} around or stash them while foraging. When transported, the infants either {{cling to the}} mother's fur or are carried in the mouth by the scruff. In some species, such as bamboo lemurs, infants are carried by mouth until {{they are able to}} cling to their mother's fur. Species that park their <b>offspring</b> include nocturnal species (e.g. mouse lemurs, {{sportive}} lemurs, and dwarf lemurs), bamboo lemurs, and ruffed lemurs. In the case of the ruffed lemurs, the young are altricial and the mothers build nests for them, much like the smaller, nocturnal lemur species. Woolly lemurs are unusual for nocturnal lemurs because they live in cohesive family groups and carry their single <b>offspring</b> with them rather than parking them. Alloparenting (multiple or group parenting) has been reported in all lemur families except the sportive lemurs and aye-aye. Allonursing is also known to occur in several lemur groups. Even males have been observed caring for infants in species such as the red-bellied lemur, mongoose lemur, eastern lesser bamboo lemur, silky sifaka, fat-tailed dwarf lemur, and ruffed lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her <b>offspring</b> depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male <b>offspring</b> (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce <b>offspring</b> biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{effect of}} {{arterial}} hypertension familial history on arterial stiffness in young <b>offsprings</b> {{has not been}} well documented yet. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the effect of arterial hypertension familial history on arterial stiffness and wave reflection in young <b>offsprings.</b> Materials and Methods: The study comprised 156 subjects, aged 14 to 30 years who were initially divided in three groups: Group A, 59 <b>offsprings</b> with normotensive parents, Group B, 70 <b>offsprings</b> with one hypertensive parent, and group C, 27 <b>offsprings</b> with both hypertensive parents. Arterial stiffness was evaluated using carotid-brachial (PWVc-r) and carotid-femoral (PWVc-f) pulse wave velocity. Concurrently, aortic pressures and augmentation index (AIx) corrected for heart rate were assessed by radial applanation tonometry. Arterial stiffness was evaluated by measuring central augmentation index (AIx) with the Sphygmocor device and pulse wave velocity carotid-brachial (PWVc-r) and carotid-femoral (PWVc-f) with the Complior device. Results: The three groups had no differences in age, peripheral arterial blood pressure (BP), lipid profile and smoking habits. Arterial stiffness indices and wave reflection were higher (p< 0. 001) in group C, followed by group B and group A (PWVc-f: 7. 03 ± 1. 28 vs 6. 45 ± 1. 05 vs 5. 81 ± 0. 85 m/s, PWVc-r: 8. 89 ± 0. 94 vs 8. 18 ± 1. 12 vs 7. 78 ± 1. 04 m/s, and AIx: 12. 04 ± 19. 05 vs 4. 83 ± 13. 52 vs - 3. 03 ± 13. 23 %).
