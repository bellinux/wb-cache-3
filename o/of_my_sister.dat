Portrait <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister,</b> Artje, painted in 1851, is numbered opus I, while {{two months before}} his death he completed Preparations in the Coliseum, opus CCCCVIII. Such a system would {{make it difficult for}} fakes to be passed off as originals.|$|E
25|$|This is not {{the first}} time girls have been burned alive in the city. Every week I must learn of the {{untimely}} death of one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> workers.

25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E

25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James {{had no right to}} summon him, and ought to be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by the faith that I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it.

On the same day, she released a recording titled Together We Stand, containing three songs: [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner", [...] "America the Beautiful" [...] and [...] "God Bless America". Evancho stated that profits from the release would go to LGBT [...] "charities in support <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> Juliet."

2500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Minogue {{has often been}} {{compared}} with her more successful sister, Kylie. Referring to the comparison, Minogue said: [...] "t is hard to be compared {{all the time to}} Kylie. On the other hand, however, people will always try to compare you to somebody. Look at Britney and Christina." [...] In an interview with Elle in April 2009, Kylie criticised X Factor judge Louis Walsh for his jibes at her sister: [...] "I'm so proud <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> and it annoys {{the hell out of me}} when comparisons between us are made. In England you lot don't know where she came from. She was on TV every week from 7 years old. It makes it harder for her when she gets Louis Walsh's rather pathetic jibes – one of which is she hasn't had a hit record and that's just not true." [...] She also denied rumours that she did not get on with Cheryl Cole or former judge Sharon Osbourne as [...] "so cheap".|$|E
2500|$|Through their {{interactions}} and their critiques of each other, Darcy and Elizabeth come to recognise their own faults {{and work to}} correct them. Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36: [...] "How despicably have I acted!" [...] she cried; [...] "I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister,</b> and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I {{could not have been}} more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."Other characters rarely exhibit this depth of self-reflection—or, at least, are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development. Tanner notes that Mrs. Bennet in particular, [...] "has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects." [...] Mrs. Bennet's behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they don't get married: [...] "The business of her life was to get her daughters married: it's solace was visiting and news." [...] This proves that Mrs. Bennet is only aware of [...] "material objects" [...] and not of her own feelings and emotions.|$|E
