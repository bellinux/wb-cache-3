5|$|The Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky {{reaction}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction or CCR) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of epoxides, aziridines, and cyclopropanes. It was discovered in 1961 by A. William Johnson and developed significantly by E. J. Corey and Michael Chaykovsky. The reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone, aldehyde, imine, or enone to produce the corresponding 3-membered ring. The reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry. The synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional epoxidation reactions of <b>olefins.</b>|$|E

50|$|Specific {{research}} Due to reasons explained {{earlier in}} the article, the bonding between a nucleophilic <b>olefin</b> and an electrophilic Palladium(II) leaves <b>olefin</b> susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

The authors of this research proposed that when the <b>olefin</b> π bond is aligned on the side of the square planar Pd complex, the π* backfilling of electron density from Pd to <b>olefin</b> is enhanced because the more electron withdrawing orbital of the π complex can overlap better with the electron donating orbital of Pd.|$|R

25|$|The trisubstituted enolate is {{considered}} the kinetic enolate, while the tetrasubstituted enolate {{is considered}} the thermodynamic enolate.
