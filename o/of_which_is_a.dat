5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|All {{elephants}} {{have several}} distinctive features, {{the most notable}} <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.|$|E

5|$|An immaculate inning {{occurs in}} {{baseball}} when a pitcher in a half-inning of play throws only nine pitches, each <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strike and thus strikes out three consecutive batters. Immaculate innings are uncommon, rarer than the better known individual gameplay feats of a batter's hitting for the cycle and a pitcher's no hitter. Currently 84 different Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers have accomplished this feat {{for a total}} of 89 immaculate innings. The first one was pitched by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters on June 4, 1889, in the third inning against the Philadelphia Quakers. Since then, only four players––Lefty Grove, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, and Sandy Koufax––have thrown an immaculate inning more than once in their careers. Koufax is the only pitcher to throw three of them. A record eight immaculate innings have been thrown in the 2017 MLB season through August 8.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of civic}} {{redevelopment}} {{of the market}} area and surrounding buildings in 1938, the cenotaph was moved to a site on Market Place, between the new City Hall and the castle. There it formed the centrepiece of a dedicated memorial garden by C.H. James and S.R. Pierce. The garden was opened by King George VI on 29 October 1938. The whole monument now stands on a terrace which runs parallel to the city hall, sloping towards Market Place with steps accommodating the gradient. A row of eight ornamental lamp-posts stands along {{either side of the}} memorial itself, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> later replacement. Two flagpoles stand at the corners, at the bases of which are low relief brass carvings of allegorical figures of Peace and Plenty.|$|E

Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it.

5|$|Beginning as Walworth Road, the A215 becomes Camberwell Road—much <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{conservation}} area—after {{entering the}} former Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell. Crossing the A202, the A215 becomes Denmark Hill, originally known as Dulwich Hill, but renamed in 1683 {{to commemorate the}} marriage of Princess Anne (later Queen Anne) to Prince George of Denmark. After passing Herne Hill railway station the road becomes Norwood Road, Knights Hill, and then Beulah Hill at its crossroads with the A214. Beulah Hill {{was the site of}} Britain's first independent television transmitter, built by the Independent Television Authority in 1955. Descending towards South Norwood the A215 becomes South Norwood Hill and then Portland Road, just after crossing the A213. A short section starting at the junction with Woodside Green is known as Spring Lane, leading to Shirley Road, the final section into Shirley, Croydon.|$|E
5|$|Benet's band program, {{practically}} nonexistent in {{the late}} 1950s, was revitalized by director Andy Marchese in the mid-1960s, who introduced new uniforms, regularly scheduled concerts, and marching band trophies. Participation in the marching band also increased after the school became coeducational, since there were more musicians willing to play instruments male students saw as feminine. Out of 1,275students at Benet in 1999–00, 130 were choir students and 115 were band students. Instrumental groups include two concert bands, a percussion ensemble, three jazz bands, a marching band, a pep band, and a string orchestra. In 1998 the pep band was one of eight schools chosen {{from a pool of}} 58 to perform at the state basketball tournament. In 2002, the school's symphonic band was one of three high school bands invited to play at the Illinois Music Educators Association All-State Conference in Peoria. Vocal music groups include five choirs, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> student-led mass choir that participates in school liturgies.|$|E

As the dancing commences, scenes of the two clashing armies are seen while Beyoncé writhes in sand. The females, now an even larger group, are shown dancing, using powerful and emphatic movements, in front of the male army with alternating costumes and several flags in the background. The video ends with the front line of females confronting the men face to face, raising their right arms and saluting to them as Beyoncé rips off the male general's badge, placing it on herself.|$|E

Both sides of the Province board have paths used by the players to move around the board. Located along the paths are the six Keystones for that colour Province, and three different game symbols: the black holes, the lighting bolts and the compasses.|$|E
5|$|If one removes from a 1-tree one of {{the edges}} in its cycle, {{the result is a}} tree. Reversing this process, if one augments a tree by {{connecting}} any two of its vertices by a new edge, the result is a 1-tree; the path in the tree connecting the two endpoints of the added edge, together with the added edge itself, form the 1-tree's unique cycle. If one augments a 1-tree by adding an edge that connects one of its vertices to a newly added vertex, the result is again a 1-tree, with one more vertex; an alternative method for constructing 1-trees is to start with a single cycle and then repeat this augmentation operation any number of times. The edges of any 1-tree can be partitioned in a unique way into two subgraphs, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cycle and the other <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> forest, such that each tree of the forest contains exactly one vertex of the cycle.|$|E

5|$|Most Hydrophiinae are {{completely}} aquatic and {{have adapted to}} their environments in many ways, the most characteristic <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> paddle-like tail that has improved their swimming ability.

This has often caused the ventral scales to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. Their lack of ventral scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, but as they live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they have no need to leave the water.|$|E
