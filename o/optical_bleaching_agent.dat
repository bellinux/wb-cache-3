40|$|Aim : The {{aim of this}} ex vivo {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of in-office bleaching agents,- 35 % and 38 % hydrogen peroxide containing <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents,</b> on the phosphate concentration of the enamel evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. Materials and Methods : Forty noncarious, craze-free human maxillary incisors, extracted for periodontal reasons, were used in this study. Baseline Raman spectra from each specimen were obtained before {{the application of the}} <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> to assess the phosphate content present in the teeth. The teeth were divided into two groups: Group A - bleached with pola office bleach (35 % hydrogen peroxide, potassium nitrate) (light activated). Group B - bleached with opalescence Xtra bleach (38 % hydrogen peroxide potassium nitrate and fluoride) (chemical activated). After the bleaching procedure, the treated specimens were taken to obtain Raman spectra to assess the phosphate loss after bleaching treatment. Results : The results showed that the chemically activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> showed less phosphate loss when compared with the light activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent.</b> Conclusion : Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the chemically activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> showed minimal phosphate loss when compared to light activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent.</b> The chemically activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> was better than the light activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> when values were evaluated statistically...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> on composite restorations.

The main characteristics of the composite resins were microhardness, roughness and color. The literature review revealed {{that most of the}} changes in the surface hardness of the composite occur due to the action of peroxides on the resin matrix of the restorative material. It was also observed that <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> increase the surface roughness of composite resin restorations, and this effect was dependent on the concentration and composition of the <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> used, the chemical characteristics of the composite resin and the period of the treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{in vitro}} study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} two 10 % carbamide peroxide <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> - a commercial product (Opalescence PF; Ultradent Products, Inc.) and a <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> prepared in a compounding pharmacy - on the chemical degradation of a light-activated composite resin by determining its release of ions before and after exposure to the agents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty composite resin (Filtek Z 250; 3 M/ESPE) samples were divided into three groups: group I (exposed to Opalescence PF commercial <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent),</b> group II (exposed to a compounded <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent)</b> and group III (control - Milli-Q water). After 14 days of exposure, with a protocol of 8 h of daily exposure to the <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> and 16 h of immersion in Milli-Q water, the analysis of ion release was carried out using a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. The values were analyzed statistically by ANOVA, Tukey's test and the paired t-tests. The significance level was set at 5 %. RESULTS: After 14 days of the experiment, statistically {{significant difference was found}} between group II and groups I and III, with greater ion release from the composite resin in group II.

Materials and methods: Opalescence PF with 20 % carbamide peroxide and Opalescence Quick with 35 % carbamide peroxide were used as at-home and in-office <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents,</b> respectively. Fifty samples from each composite resin, including Point 4 microhybrid, Premise and Filtek Supreme nanofilled composites resins were prepared and exposed to <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents.</b> For each composite resin the samples were randomly divided into five groups of 10 and designated as: control, two-week at-home, four-week at-home, one-time in-office and two-times in-office bleaching groups with two-week intervals. After the appropriate bleaching procedures on samples of each group, microhardness measurements were carried out on each sample. Data was analyzed using ANOVA and post hoc Tukey HSD test (p value < 0. 05). Results: There were significant differences in mean surface microhardness values of each composite resin type. No significant differences were observed in mean microhardness values of Point 4 between four-week at-home and one-time office, Filtek Supreme between two-week at-home and four-week at-home, and Premise between one-time in-office and two-time in-office bleaching groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of home-use <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> {{containing}} 10 % carbamide peroxide and 7. 5 % hydrogen peroxide on enamel microhardness and surface micromorphology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Enamel slabs (n= 10) received the <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> for 1 h/day and remained in artificial saliva solution for 23 h/day, during a total period of 21 days. Control group was composed of enamel slabs that were not subjected to treatment with the agents and were maintained in artificial saliva solution. Microhardness tests were performed before treatment application, 21 days of treatment and 14 days after the end of treatment. Scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed after 14 days after the end of bleaching treatment by 3 calibrated observers who attributed scores. RESULTS: The Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05) showed no significant differences in microhardness values among <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents,</b> at 21 days of treatment and a significant increase in microhardness for different agents after 14 days from the end of treatment.

40|$|Dental {{bleaching}} is {{a simple}} and conservative procedure for aesthetic restoration of vital and non-vital discolored teeth. Nevertheless, {{a number of studies}} have demonstrated the risk of tissue damage from the contact of these agents with the oral mucosa. In the current study, the genotoxic potential associated with exposure to dental <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> was assessed by the single cell gel (comet) assay in vitro. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in vitro were exposed to six commercial dental <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> (Clarigel Gold - Dentsply; Whitespeed - Discus Dental; Nite White - Discus Dental; Magic Bleaching - Vigodent; Whiteness HP - FGM and Lase Peroxide - DMC). The results pointed out that all dental <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> tested contributed to DNA damage as depicted by the mean tail moment, being the strongest effect observed with the highest dose of hydrogen peroxide (Whiteness HP and Lase peroxide, at a 35 % concentration). On the other hand, Magic Bleaching (Vigodent) induced the lowest level of DNA breakage. Negative and positive controls displayed absence and presence of DNA-damaging, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that dental <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> may be a factor that increases the level of DNA damage.
