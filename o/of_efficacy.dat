5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator {{is applied to}} the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports <b>of</b> <b>efficacy</b> with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E
5|$|Recommended therapies for {{first-line}} use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and topical or oral antibiotics. Procedures such {{as light}} therapy and laser therapy {{are not considered}} to be first-line treatments and typically have an adjunctive role due to their high cost and limited evidence <b>of</b> <b>efficacy.</b> Medications for acne work by targeting the early stages of comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions; improvement in the appearance of acne is typically expected between six and eight weeks after starting therapy.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} company Rexar reformulated their popular weight loss drug Obetrol following its mandatory {{withdrawal from the}} market in 1973 under the Kefauver Harris Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act due to the results of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program (which indicated a lack <b>of</b> <b>efficacy).</b> The new formulation simply replaced the two methamphetamine components with dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components of the same weight (the other two original dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components were preserved), preserved the Obetrol branding, and despite it utterly lacking FDA approval, it still made it onto the market and was marketed and sold by Rexar for a number of years.|$|E

5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates <b>of</b> <b>efficacy.</b>|$|E
5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss <b>of</b> <b>efficacy.</b> Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
