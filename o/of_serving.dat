40|$|High {{performance}} modern tennis is characterised by high dynamism, {{speed in}} thinking and action, precision and high technical and tactical skills. In this study, we used direct observation and statistical recording of nine matches during two competition {{years in the}} tennis players Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andre Agassi. In these tennis players, we studied mainly the return <b>of</b> <b>serve,</b> one <b>of</b> the most important shots in tennis, together with serve, as first shots in a point. We have chosen the three tennis players {{because they are the}} best example <b>of</b> return <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> as shown by the matches recorded and interpreted. The study we have carried out shows that return <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> makes Agassi a winner in most matches. The high percentage in Federer’s serves makes his adversaries have a lower percentage in return <b>of</b> <b>serve,</b> which prevents them to win against his serve. High percentage in return <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> results in more points on the adversary’s serve and an opportunity to start the offensive point. After comparing the three tennis players mentioned above, we can see that the highest percentage of points won on return <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> belongs to Agassi, which ranks him among the best return <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> tennis players in the world. The tennis player with the highest percentage in return of service is the one who wins the match, which shows, once again, the importance of the return <b>of</b> <b>serve.</b> Return <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> can be a strong counter-attack weapon if used at its highest level...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the reliability and validity of a coding system for measuring <b>serve</b> and return <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> locations in tennis. A notational analysis of mens and womens singles matches at the 2008 Australian Open was undertaken. The results revealed that the inter-rater reports were highly similar on first or second serve (r= 0. 972), serve landing location (r= 0. 999), returners impact location (r= 0. 990) and return <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> landing location (r= 0. 995). Hawk-Eye data were used to validate the coding measures for ball location. When comparing the coded ball location data of the researcher (n= 1) and tennis coaches (n= 4) to Hawk-Eye data, high correlations for the landing location <b>of</b> the <b>serve</b> (r= 0. 998), the impact location of the return (r= 0. 993) and the landing location of the return <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> (r= 0. 997) were registered. The match notation system analysed was shown to be reliable and valid for the study <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> and return <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> strategies and tactics in tennis. This system also provides a template for other researchers and coaches to evaluate game tactics in tennis. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} the <b>serve</b> toss <b>of</b> different types <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> when tennis players served from the ad-court. They used different {{spin on the}} ball and various ball placements in the opponent’s service box. Our aim was to compare the toss in different types <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> between a competitive (local tournament) player and a professional player, {{from the point of}} view of the receiving player, when they served from the ad-court. One professional and one competitive tennis player (both right handed) were observed while <b>serving</b> different types <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> to various locations of the opponent’s service box. We used a high-speed camera, which was placed opposite to the server in the position of a receiving player. The results showed that the players do not use the same toss for each type <b>of</b> <b>serve.</b> The professional player had a bigger range of racket-ball contact point on horizontal axis (32 cm) of the various types <b>of</b> first <b>serves,</b> compared to the competitive player (only 24 cm). The toss <b>of</b> the kick <b>serve</b> had similar characteristics between both players (the racket-ball contact point was observed to be mostly to the right, from the view of receiver). Neither the professional nor the competitive player showed a stable profile of toss. In some cases, the receiving players could anticipate the type <b>of</b> the <b>serve</b> from the server’s toss...|$|R

50|$|Specialty - Return <b>of</b> <b>Serves</b> Giraldo {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} and extreme returns <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> in the tour. Unlike traditional good returners such as Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic or Andre Agassi who use anticipation and footwork to take serves early and efficiently, Giraldo uses a different style. He usually stands further behind the base line, especially on second serves, and winds up a huge back swing on either wing and takes the ball later, injecting a sudden amount of pace. He is also adept at controlling serves such that he can hit them at acute angles with speed to finish off the point early. This makes his return <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> especially devastating to his opponents.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Kinesiology (Sport Performance)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012 Volleyball {{coaches and}} players go at great lengths to find {{competitive}} advantages against opponents. Many hours are spent practicing, studying game films, and strategizing {{in the hopes of}} finding valuable predictors of success. 	It is widely accepted that the primary predictor of team success lies in players ability to both serve effectively and receive serve effectively (McGown, Fronske, & Moser 2001; Papageorgiou & Spitzley 2003). Thus, it is imperative that players and coaches are aware <b>of</b> the best <b>serving</b> strategies to utilize {{during the course of a}} match. 	Though many studies have attempted to investigate serve success predictors such as mode <b>of</b> <b>serves,</b> force <b>of</b> <b>serves,</b> and rotational velocity <b>of</b> <b>serves,</b> there is a lack of research that identifies the success rates <b>of</b> <b>serves</b> to various locations on the court. 	This study investigated the success levels <b>of</b> <b>serves</b> to zones 1, 5, and 6. A total <b>of</b> 120 <b>serves</b> to each zone (total n= 360) were quality analyzed using a 0 - 3 scale (USA Volleyball, 2009). The results were then compared using an analysis of variance (p= 0. 05) to determine if there were significant differences among the means. It was found that serves to zone 6 (m= 2. 34) were received significantly easier than serves to zone 1 (m= 2. 11). Additionally, it was found that serves to zone 1 were received at a significantly lower percentage than serves to zones 5 and 6. Kinesiology (Sport Performance...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} defending players' positioning on the service outcomes. Thirty-nine sequences <b>of</b> play involving <b>serves</b> were selected from nine games of a Professional Championship of volleyball held in Brazil. They characterized three main situations: (a) aces (serves that the ball hit the ground of the opponent's court without being touched by any defending player) (n = 13), (b) serves which a defending player touched the ball but there was no continuity in the rally (n = 13), and (c) serves received successfully, that is, a defender received the ball and made possible the continuity of the rally (n = 13). These situations were compared by considering the following variables: (1) defender’s distance to the place <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> finalization, (2) velocity of defender's displacement to the place <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> finalization; (3) variability of defending player’s displacement; and, (4) serve velocity. Results showed that the defender’s distance to the place <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> finalization in the aces were greater than in the both other situations. The findings allowed us to conclude that in competitive performances in the sport of volleyball, the defender’s distance to the place <b>of</b> <b>serve</b> finalization determined the service outcomes.
