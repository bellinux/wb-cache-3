Made on a budget of $9 million, the film was shot on location in rural South Carolina in the fall of 2006. At the 2007 San Diego Comic Con, Bertino appeared with stars Tyler and Speedman, and premiered a teaser trailer promoting the film.|$|E
5|$|Despite the orders, a {{relatively}} small number of people evacuated for the hurricane. According to a telephone survey conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, the highest participation rate was for residents in the Northern Neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a Category2 hurricane, of which 41% in the survey stated they left their houses for a safer location. In Surry, only 9% of those in a Category2 hurricane storm surge zone left. 30% who participated in the survey along the Eastern Shore left. The primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of Isabel, its strength, or influence from the media. Most participants in the survey stated they did not hear any sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location, however. Of those who evacuated, about 64% left for the house of a friend or a relative, with about 24% evacuating to a hotel or a motel. Most of those in Hampton and Norfolk left for elsewhere in the state, while the majority of those in the Northern Neck evacuated to destinations in their <b>own</b> <b>neighborhood</b> or community. The evacuation destinations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were varied, with 23% leaving for Maryland and 46% staying in their <b>own</b> <b>neighborhood</b> or community. The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days, with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads. The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations. In all, more than 160,000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate, including 11,000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News. A total of about 16,325people evacuated to 67 shelters. Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies, unanticipated medical issues, overcrowding, and lack of security.|$|E
5|$|Evacuation orders {{began on}} September 16, when {{officials}} issued a voluntary evacuation for portions of four counties and one entire county. By around 24hours before landfall, mandatory evacuations were ordered for eight counties, {{all of which}} but one were for the entire counties. All coastal counties from Cape Fear northward were under a mandatory evacuation. A survey of 603 residents in northeastern North Carolina indicated 57% of residents along the Outer Banks and 77% of residents in storm surge-prone areas of the Pamlico Sound did not evacuate despite being under a mandatory evacuation. The two primary reasons stated for the residents' evacuation decisions were the hurricane's strength and track. The media and statements from officials were two other reasons. 70% of people along the Outer Banks heard the official evacuation notices, though only 30% of residents near the Pamlico Sound heard the notices. A {{majority of the respondents}} to the survey who heard the evacuation notices left the area. None of the surveyed evacuees from the Outer Banks went to a public shelter; 60% went to a friend or a relative's house and 24% went to a motel. Evacuees on the Outer Banks generally went elsewhere in North Carolina or to Virginia. For evacuees around the Pamlico Sound, only 9% left for a public shelter, while 75% left for a friend or relative's house. Most near the Pamlico Sound remained in their <b>own</b> <b>neighborhood</b> or own county. Of the 19 North Carolina counties issuing evacuation orders, the duration of the evacuation process varied between 3hours to 12hours in Dare County. Five counties reported heavy amounts of traffic, while traffic problems included stalled cars along roads, inadequate route signing, and flooded or damaged roads.|$|E

5|$|Officials {{recommended}} the citizens on Smith Island to evacuate {{on the day}} prior to the hurricane making landfall, the only evacuations for the Eastern shore of Maryland. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying and other specific areas in Calvert, St. Mary's, and Charles counties, and the residents in six homes were asked to leave in Howard County. Officials recommended residents in flood areas of Baltimore County to evacuate, and some {{in the city of}} Baltimore left spontaneously due to flooding. Evacuation rates were low throughout the Maryland coastline, with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore. The primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane. Between 20% and 33% of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived, with similar numbers expressing concern about being able {{to return to their homes}} if they evacuated. Of those who left, most went to the house of a friend or family member, with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their <b>own</b> <b>neighborhood</b> or county. Most did not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall. In most areas, the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast, with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal. The most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees, inadequate signage, flooded roads, or stalled cars. In all, 3,080people evacuated their homes in preparation for Hurricane Isabel. Boats, trucks, and school buses helped more than 1,000people evacuate the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{immigration}} of Persians to Bahrain {{began when the}} Greek Seleucid kingdom which was ruling Bahrain at the time fell and the Persian Empire successfully invaded Bahrain, but it is often believed that mass immigration started during the 1600s when Abbas I of Persia invaded Bahrain. After settling in Bahrain, some of the Persians were effectively Arabized. They usually settled in areas inhabited by the indigenous Baharna, probably because they share the same Shia Muslim faith, however, some Sunni Persians settled in areas mostly inhabited by Sunni Arab immigrants such as Hidd and Galali. In Muharraq, they have their <b>own</b> <b>neighborhood</b> called Fareej Karimi named after a rich Persian man called Ali Abdulla Karimi.|$|E

Like many other people of color, Bunche continued to struggle against racism across the United States and sometimes in his <b>own</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> In 1959, he and his son, Ralph, Jr., were denied membership in the West Side Tennis Club in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens. After the issue was given national coverage by the press, the club offered the Bunches an apology and invitation of membership. The official who had rebuffed them resigned. Bunche refused the offer, saying it was not based on racial equality and was an exception based only on his personal prestige.|$|E
25|$|George Ramos of the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that many Cypress Park residents were {{angered by the}} negative portrayal of their community in the media; the perceived {{lack of attention to}} gang issues from the municipal government and their council member, Mike Hernandez; and the Los Angeles Times for posting large images of Stephanie Kuhen and her brother {{on the front page of}} the newspaper, stating that the media does not do this with ethnic minority children. Ramos said that the editor of the newspaper had asked for the images of the children to be posted before learning that they were white. Ramos also stated that many Cypress Park residents believed that if one is not from Cypress Park, one should be concerned with crime in his or her <b>own</b> <b>neighborhood</b> rather than in Cypress Park.|$|E

25|$|Gullah {{culture has}} proven to be {{particularly}} resilient. Gullah traditions are strong in the rural areas of the Lowcountry mainland and on the Sea Islands, and among their people in urban areas such as Charleston and Savannah. Gullah people who have left the Lowcountry and moved far away have also preserved traditions; for instance, many Gullah in New York, who went North in the Great Migration {{of the first half of}} the 20th century, have established their <b>own</b> <b>neighborhood</b> churches in Harlem, Brooklyn, and Queens. Typically they send their children back to rural communities in South Carolina and Georgia during the summer months to live with grandparents, uncles, and aunts. Gullah people living in New York frequently return to the Lowcountry to retire. Second- and third-generation Gullah in New York often maintain many of their traditional customs and sometimes still speak the Gullah language.|$|E

[...] Sánchez said that when she was accosted on the street, [...] "The curious crowded around and I shouted, 'Help, these men want to kidnap us,' but they stopped those who wanted to intervene with a shout that revealed the whole ideological background of the operation, 'Don’t mess with it, these are counterrevolutionaries.'" [...] Sánchez said that she was put into the backseat of the car and received blows to her head, legs and buttocks as she was pinned down. [...] The incident was condemned by the U.S. administration and by Human Rights Watch.|$|E

2500|$|Capp and {{his family}} lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Harvard during the entire Vietnam War protest era. The turmoil that Americans were {{watching}} on their TV sets was happening live—right in his <b>own</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Campus radicals and “hippies” inevitably became one of Capp’s favorite targets in the sixties. Alongside his long-established caricatures of right-wing, big business types such as General Bullmoose and J. Roaringham Fatback, Capp began spoofing counterculture icons such as Joan Baez (in the character of Joanie Phoanie, a wealthy folksinger who offers an impoverished orphanage ten thousand dollars' worth of [...] "protest songs"). The sequence implicitly labeled Baez a limousine liberal, a charge she took to heart, as detailed years later in her 1987 autobiography, And A Voice To Sing With: A Memoir. Another target was Senator Ted Kennedy, parodied as [...] "Senator O. Noble McGesture," [...] resident of [...] "Hyideelsport."

In the 1980s, a significant number of Haitians immigrated to Mattapan, leading to the current demographic population. Mattapan has become an important center for the Haitian cultural, social, and political life in the state of Massachusetts. As of 2015, Mattapan also has a large population of African Americans, Jamaicans, and other Caribbean immigrants.|$|E
