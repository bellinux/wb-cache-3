Three-dimensional equations of static quilibrium are presented for a generic two-legged long-wall shield.

The resulting system of equations {{was found to be}} indeterminate to a very high degree. A three-dimensional solution to measurement of the resultant reaction on the canopy by the strata activity and shield response required the elimination of several forces or moments that were thought to be nonparticipating or to not significantly affect <b>overall</b> <b>shield</b> mechanics. Required measurements for solution of the equilibrium equations were leg, canopy capsule, and lemniscate link forces.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a study that}} examined load transfer mechanics in longwall shield supports {{as part of the}} Bureau of Mines research program to optimize support design and utilization. The objectives of this study were to determine the contribution of the leg cylinders and the caving shield-lemniscate assembly towards full shield vertical and hor-izontal load resistance capability and to determine how the interaction of these members affect <b>overall</b> <b>shield</b> response. Load-displacement characteristics of the leg cylinders and the caving shield-lemniscate assembly, independent of the full shield, were evaluated from controlled displacement tests in the Bureau's mine roof simulator and responses were compared with full shield responses to identify load transfer mechanics. It is concluded from this research that the participation of the caving shield-lemniscate assembly significantly affects the response of the shield support. It is likely that the caving shield-lemniscate assembly is not participating fully in current shield designs because of translational freedom in the numerous pin joints. It is also concluded that the shield will respond differently to different boundary condi-tions resulting from interaction with the strata.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of underground experiments looking for phenomena beyond the standard model substantially rely on environmental background reduction. Therefore {{it is crucial to}} any of these experiments to conduct a precise material selection in order to ensure high radio-purity near the detector volume. In many cases, this can be achieved by low level gamma-spectroscopy. This thesis summarizes the efforts contributing to the development of an advanced shielding against gamma rays, muons and induced neutrons for a new germanium detector by the means of experiments and simulations. After collecting basic experience of the various background components by optimizing an existing muon veto, a first experimental setup is aimed at measuring the neutron attenuation power of both pure and boronated hydrocarbonic material. In addition neutron flux reduction was being investigated within a real detector environment by inserting layers of boronated polyethylene into a surrounding lead shield. Both experiments indicate a high efficiency in preventing the neutron background when adding a boronated moderator into the <b>overall</b> <b>shield.</b> Furthermore, a computer simulation was developed, addressing the problem of finding the best readout configuration for organic scintillators. The results will be used for the installation of the upcoming veto system of the future spectrometer.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the shielding performance or shielding {{effectiveness of a}} board-level shield in function of its bonding method. Improved shielding performance at board-level in order to harden integrated circuits against unintentional and intentional electromagnetic interference, and this under harsh environmental conditions, is {{getting more and more}} important to achieve the desired levels of functional performance and operational reliability despite an ever more aggressive electromagnetic environment. High levels of operational reliability are increasingly being required to help control functional safety or other risks. As a board-level shield on its own only provides 5 of the 6 required walls to form a complete Faraday Cage, its <b>overall</b> <b>shielding</b> performance depends heavily on the way it is bonded to the printed circuit board's ground plane. It is shown by full-wave simulations that the shielding effectiveness can improve by more than 40 dB when bonded with the waveguide-below-cutoff principle compared to a classic perimeter bond of a single row of vias. And this even if the waveguides-below-cutoff are formed by rows of vias.

40|$|Radioactive {{materials}} are transported in hollow steel casks filled with lead. The lead in these casks can melt in an accidental fire during transportation {{leading to an}} increase in its volume. This plastically deforms the steel shell housing the lead. When the cask subsequently cools after the fire is extinguished, voids will form in the solidified lead. This work deals with the simulation of solidification with void formation in these transportation casks. In these simulations, one has to deal with solid-liquid and void-material interfaces. Solid-liquid movement during solidification is treated using a modified enthalpy method. The void that is formed in the solidified lead is assumed to be a vacuum. Consistent with this assumption, the boundary conditions of zero pressure and zero stress are imposed on the interface. The growth of the void is handled using the volume of fluid method. The methodology is first benchmarked by comparing the simulations with some experimental results available in the literature. Simulations are then performed for solidification in the transportation cask to study the effect of orientation on the void formation. A methodology is then developed to quantify the <b>overall</b> <b>shielding</b> effectiveness of the cask in terms of the total amount of radiation leaked...|$|R

40|$|The {{flexibility}} {{of the human mind}} is often studied using the task switching paradigm. Subjects are instructed to alternate between two or more tasks and typically perform worse on a task switch than on a repetition. Dreisbach and colleagues (Dreisbach et al., 2007; Dreisbach & Haider, 2008, 2009) investigated whether rule use is only associated with this detrimental effect – the cost of switching – or also offers benefits. They found that applying categorization rules instead of seemingly arbitrary stimulus-response mappings results in reduced susceptibility to distraction and termed this effect the shielding function of task sets. The present thesis addressed open questions regarding this shielding function. I investigated how shielding affects task-related distraction as compared to the irrelevant distracters Dreisbach and Haider had used. In addition, shielding was studied in the context of unpredictable and predictable task switching in order to further investigate its underlying mechanism. Results show that using task rules enables subjects to avoid distraction by focusing on task-related information. This was deduced from the facts that a) stimuli that fit the instructed categories were automatically categorized and b) a reduction of shielding did not result in an overall increased distractibility but led to attenuated interference by task-related distracters. <b>Overall,</b> <b>shielding</b> seems to be possible because – in contrast to arbitrary SR mappings – rules offer a single and common response-defining stimulus feature. The observed preference for such task-related information is modulated by task activation, as evidenced by a reduction of shielding on unpredictable but not on predictable task switches...|$|R
40|$|The space {{radiation}} environment poses {{risks to}} astronaut health from a diverse set of sources, ranging from low-energy protons and electrons to highly-charged, high-energy atomic nuclei and their associated fragmentation products, including neutrons. The low-energy protons and electrons {{are the source}} of most of the radiation dose to Shuttle and ISS crews, while the more energetic particles that comprise the Galactic Cosmic Radiation (protons, He, and heavier nuclei up to Fe) will be the dominant source for crews on long-duration missions outside the earth's magnetic field. Because of this diversity of sources, a broad ground-based experimental effort is required to validate the transport and shielding calculations used to predict doses and dose-equivalents under various mission scenarios. The experimental program of the LBNL group, described here, focuses principally on measurements of charged particle and neutron production in high-energy heavy-ion fragmentation. Other aspects of the program include measurements of the shielding provided by candidate spacesuit materials against low-energy protons (particularly relevant to extra-vehicular activities in low-earth orbit), and the depth-dose relations in tissue for higher-energy protons.
