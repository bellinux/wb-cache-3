5|$|Although many of {{the coins}} bear {{the name of a}} moneyer, there is no {{indication}} of the mint where each coin was struck. As a result, the number and location of mints used by Offa is uncertain. Current <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there were four mints, in Canterbury, Rochester, East Anglia and London.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of {{the work}} have become more ever common, with {{innovative}} stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007. Modern critical <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Agrippina is Handel's first operatic masterpiece, full of freshness and musical invention which have made {{it one of the}} most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival.|$|E
5|$|When {{a player}} is {{found by the}} umpire to have {{delivered}} the ball contrary to those rules, the umpire will call a no ball and {{he is said to}} have been called for throwing. Where public <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a player's bowling action appears to be that he routinely throws, he is said to have a 'suspect' or an 'illegal' action, or more derogatorily, is said to be a 'chucker'. The issue is often highly emotive with accusers considering that deliveries with an illegal action are akin to cheating.|$|E

5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly have expected to spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalent}} <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the church}} was constructed and painted in the early 14th century, which coincides with the lifetimes of the individuals most widely accepted as represented by the figures depicted in the church's frescoes. At the time, the village of Donja Kamenica, along {{with much of the}} Timočka Krajina region, belonged to the Vidin appanage of the Second Bulgarian Empire. However, alternative theories place the construction of the church in the mid-14th century, the mid-15th century or even the 16th century. The church and its frescoes were restored in 1958. The church was declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance in 1982, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E
5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E

5|$|On August 16, 2008, {{construction}} crews {{made the}} last major concrete pour to top off the Trump tower's concrete core, which was commemorated with an unofficial ceremony. To celebrate the milestone, a yellow tower crane raised a bucket full of concrete and an American flag to the rooftop of the skyscraper. Another ceremony occurred on August 19, when construction supervisors, structural engineers and company representatives from McHugh Construction made a minor concrete pour {{at the top of}} the Trump tower. Though Donald Trump was absent from both of these ceremonies, he, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump attended the topping off party on September 24, 2008. Original plans called for the windows to be completed and the spire erected in October 2008. However, the spire installation was delayed through high winds in December 2008, and was finally completed on January 3, 2009. Kamin's critical <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the spire is not aesthetically complementary.|$|E
25|$|A {{classical}} (and largely one-sided) {{debate in}} regards to al- is whether the hamza is volatile or not. The majority <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Sibawayh (d. ca. 797), who considers the hamza volatile. In his opinion, the hamza neither is part of al- nor contributes to the definiteness of the following word.|$|E

25|$|The common <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the nail}} enters inside the paronychium, but an ingrown toenail can simply be {{overgrown}} toe skin. The condition starts from a microbial {{inflammation of the}} paronychium, then a granuloma, which results in a nail buried inside of the granuloma. While ingrown nails can occur in the nails of both the hands and the feet , they occur most commonly with the toenails.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review {{concluded that there}} is insufficient evidence to determine {{the effectiveness of these}} clear aligners. <b>Opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they are likely useful for moderate front-teeth crowding. In those with teeth that are too far forward or backward, or rotated in the socket, the aligners are likely not as effective as conventional braces. More cases of relapse of the anterior teeth have been found with clear aligners compared with conventional braces. A 2013 Cochrane review found no high-quality evidence with respect to the management of the recurrence of lower-front-teeth misalignment following treatment.|$|E
25|$|The biggest {{criticism}} of the traditional zonal system based 5 member selection committee {{is that of the}} interest served by the committee members. The popular <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the selectors constantly engage in promoting the interests of players from their zone or vote on players based on cross-promotion from other zones instead of selecting the best available team. BCCI tried addressing the issue as part of its Shashank Manohar led constitution review committee in 2006. However, a lack of consensus and concerns by zonal heads scuttled any efforts to reduce the 5 member committee to a 3 or 4 member national committee.|$|E

25|$|Slab-pull: Current {{scientific}} <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the asthenosphere is insufficiently competent or rigid {{to directly}} cause motion by friction along {{the base of}} the lithosphere. Slab pull is therefore most widely thought to be the greatest force acting on the plates. In this current understanding, plate motion is mostly driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at trenches. Recent models indicate that trench suction plays an important role as well. However, the fact that the North American Plate is nowhere being subducted, although it is in motion, presents a problem. The same holds for the African, Eurasian, and Antarctic plates.|$|E
25|$|Southern Māori oral {{tradition}} tells of five successively arriving peoples {{and while the}} earliest, Kahui Tipua, appear to be fairy folk modern anthropological <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> nevertheless they represent historical people who have become encrusted with legend. Te Rapuwai were next {{and seemed to be}} succeeded by two Waitaha tribes but it has been suggested this was really one with 'Waitaha' also being used as a catchall name for all earlier peoples by some later arrivals. 'Te Rapuwai' may perhaps also have been used like this. Nevertheless, some middens, such as those on the peninsula, have been identified traditionally with Te Rapuwai. Anderson's later, or tribal Waitaha, arrived in the south in the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|One {{issue with}} trials is what {{to use as}} a placebo {{treatment}} group or non-treatment control group. Often this is patients on a waiting list, or people receiving some kind of regular non-specific contact or support. One issue {{is the best way to}} match the use of inert tablets or sham treatments in placebo-controlled studies in pharmaceutical trials. Several interpretations and differing assumptions and language remain. Another issue is the attempt to standardize and manualize therapies and link them to specific symptoms of diagnostic categories, making them more amenable to research. Some report that this may reduce efficacy or gloss over individual needs. Finagy and Roth's <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the benefits of the evidence-based approach outweighs the difficulties.|$|E

25|$|In sexual coercion, {{a form of}} male sexual {{intimidation}} {{which includes}} forced copulations, repeated mating attempts with the same female, and punishing resisting females. males forcibly mate with females; {{an example is the}} red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus). It has also been proposed as a third form of sexual selection, along with intersexual selection and intrasexual selection, even though prevailing scientific <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> sexual coercion is a manifestation of sexual conflict, stemming out of the natural discord between males and females. In some species of salamanders, females that are territorial and aggressive also intimidate males. Plethodon cinereus females aggressively punish males who are exhibiting social polygyny. Males have been shown to punish females that partake in mating polyandry, forcing them into mating monogamously.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that any of these assumptions are correct, or even likely. Linguistic <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> click consonants may well be a relatively late development in human language, that they are no more resistant to change or any more likely to be linguistic relics than other speech sounds, and that they are easily borrowed: at least one Khoisan language, ǁXegwi, is believed to have reborrowed clicks from Bantu languages, which had earlier borrowed them from Khoisan languages, for example. The Knight and Mountain article {{is the latest in a}} long line of speculations about the primitive origin of click consonants, which have been largely motivated by the outdated idea that primitive people speak primitive languages, which has no empirical support.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} Bretwalda {{originates}} in Bede's comment on {{who held the}} Imperium of Britain. From this concept, historians have inferred a formal institution of overlordship south of the Humber. Whether such an institution existed is uncertain, but Simon Keynes argues that the idea is not an invented concept. The Bretwalda concept is taken as evidence for a presence {{of a number of}} early Anglo-Saxon elite families. Whether the majority were early settlers, descendant from settlers, or especially after the exploration stage, were Roman-British leaders who adopted Anglo-Saxon culture is unclear, but the balance of <b>opinion</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most were migrants. Notable gaps include: no-one from the East or West Midlands is represented in the list of Bretwaldas, and there is some uncertainty about the dates of these leaders.|$|E
