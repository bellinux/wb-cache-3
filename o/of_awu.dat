40|$|It is {{generally}} said that, in mainland Honshu, the strong ties between hamlets and the O. I. M. support {{the operation of}} O. I. M., and preventing deterioration of agriculture. But in Hokkaido, it is {{pointed out that the}} ties are weak and the operation of O. I. M. is rather businesslike. This paper discusses the actual situation and activities of O. I. M. in paddy field areas where a cooperative work system is basically employed, focusing on the relationship between farm households and the AWU. The management unit（MU）is one of O. I. M. s in Hokkaido. The activities of MU include not only the irrigation management but also maintenance of the hamlel. In the area where OMI and AWU overlaping, the activities mentioned above are actually done by AWU, which shows strong ties between OIM and AWU. On the other hand, in the area where the relationship between them is weak, MU is in charge of only irrigation management, and the activities <b>of</b> <b>AWU</b> are sluggish. Although the situation differs depending on each area, the relationship between O. I. M. and MU in Hokkaido is not weak. It is obviously recognized that their relationship prevents agriculture from declination, using original functions of farm villages as same as the mainland. This is because activities <b>of</b> <b>AWU</b> have reflected on MU or the functions <b>of</b> <b>AWU</b> have been formed through the activity of MU. There may be a possibility that new types of communities are being formed, while MU, an administrative organization for irrigation facilities, and AWU are influencing each other...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Screening of {{patients}} with anterior abdominal penetrating trauma in need for laparotomy {{is an important issue}} in management of these cases. This study aimed to compare the accuracy of abdominal wall ultrasonography (AWU) and local wound exploration (LWE) in this regard. Methods: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on ≥ 18 year-old patients presenting to emergency department with anterior abdominal stab wound and stable hemodynamics, to compare the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>AWU</b> and LWE in screening {{of patients}} in need of laparotomy. Results: 50 cases with the mean age of 28. 44 ± 7. 14 years were included (80 % male). Sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve <b>of</b> <b>AWU</b> were 70. 58 (95 % CI: 44. 04 – 88. 62), 93. 33 (95 % CI: 76. 49 – 98. 83), and 81. 96 (95 % CI: 69. 91 – 94. 01), respectively. These measures were 88. 23 (62. 25 – 97. 93), 93. 33 (76. 49 – 98. 83), and 90. 78 (95 % CI: 81. 67 – 99. 89) for LWE, respectively. The difference in overall accuracy of the two methods was not statistically significant (p = 0. 0641). Conclusion: Based on the findings of the present study, AWU and LWE had the same specificity but different sensitivities in screening of anterior abdominal stab wound patients in need of laparotomy. The overall accuracy of LWE was slightly higher (91. 48 % versus 85. 1 %). </p...|$|E

This {{study investigated the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>AWU</b> with and without IMW upon 2. 4 km running time-trial performance while carrying a 25 kg backpack, a common task and backpack load in physically demanding occupations. Participants (n = 9) performed five 2. 4 km running time-trials with a 25 kg thoracic load preceded in random order by 1) IMW comprising 2 x 30 inspiratory efforts against a pressure-threshold load of 40 % maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), 2) 10 min unloaded running (AWU) at lactate turnpoint (10. 33 ± 1. 58 km·h- 1), 3) placebo IMW (PLA) comprising five min breathing using a sham device, 4) AWU+IMW and 5) AWU+PLA. Pooled baseline PImax was similar between trials and increased by 7 % and 6 % following IMW and AWU+IMW (P 0. 05). Time-trial performance was not different between any trials.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{decoupling}} elasticity model, {{this paper}} studies the decoupling relationships (DRs) of total water uses (TWU) and provincial GDP, agricultural water uses (AWU) and agricultural added value (AAV), {{as well as}} industrial water uses (IWU) and industrial added value (IAV) respectively in Yunnan and Guizhou during the first ten years {{for the implementation of}} the Great Western Development Strategy. The results indicate that the DRs of water uses and economic development are highly undesirable in both provinces. Among the three groups, the DRs <b>of</b> <b>AWU</b> and AAV are the worst of all, with strong or weak coupling in 5 of the 10 years; the DRs of IWU and IAV are slightly better with strong coupling respectively in 3 of the 10 years in Yunnan and in 2 of the 10 years in Guizhou; and the DRs of TWU and GDP are the best, with strong or weak decoupling in 7 of the 10 years in both provinces. The DRs have improved in the period of 2006 - 2010 if compared with that in the period of 2001 - 2005. It is concluded that slow economic growth, low efficiency and poor structure of water uses are the main reasons for the worse status of DRs, and the development of economy and water uses efficiency promotes the DRs getting better...|$|E

40|$|In 1913 one of {{the most}} {{significant}} events in the history of Australian industrial relations and Labor politics occurred - the amalgamation of several rural unions with the preexisting Australian Workers 2 ̆ 7 Union (AWU) to form a truly national AWU. Perhaps the most dominant branch of the newly amalgamated AWU was the Queensland Branch. Encompassing not only shearers and other workers within the pastoral industry the Queensland AWU represented numerous workers (mostly rural and semi or unskilled) in mining, construction, the sugar industry, transport and the hospitality and other service industries. At a stroke the Queensland AWU became far and away the most numerically strong industrial organisation in that state. That industrial strength soon manifested itself into political power through the close relationship that developed between the AWU and the Labor Party. This thesis will examine the rise of the Queensland Branch of the AWU and in particular its relationship with the Labor Party and the workers it sought to represent. Of particular interest will be the means by which the AWU attained, maintained and ultimately lost its dominance over the Queensland labour movement, the Labor party and more broadly the Queensland electorate. It will be the contention of this thesis that AWU was able to maintain its level of influence and power over such a sustained period due to the geographic, industrial, social and political peculiarities of Queensland that allowed for the rise of a rurally based, reformist yet economically and socially conservative organisation such as the AWU to emerge. Coupled with this was the AWU 2 ̆ 7 s ability to manipulate the mechanisms of the industrial and political labour movement in Queensland to ensure a steady flow <b>of</b> <b>AWU</b> nominees to the Labor Party and then Parliament. This in turn allowed for the passing of legislation beneficial to the interests of the AWU and its supporters. A mixture of strict control, numerical superiority and genuine industrial and economic progress for its members and sympathizers ensured that however ruthless its methods the AWU would continue to receive the necessary support. Only in the face of a changing economic and industrial climate and the potential threat to its power from within the labour movement did the AWU depart from its traditional policies and embrace militancy in order to preserve its power. Such actions were anathema to its supporters within the AWU and the Labor Party and the electorate as a whole. In an effort to maintain its power in the face of a largely imagined threat the leadership of the AWU willingly risked the security of the Labor government in Queensland to assert its power. The result was disastrous for both the AWU and the Labor Party in Queensland...|$|E
