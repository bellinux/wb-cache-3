He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, <b>on-screen</b> <b>text</b> reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E
5|$|Geneforges {{dialogue}} is delivered through <b>on-screen</b> <b>text.</b> Encounters with intelligent creations or humans {{result in the}} player being given a series of pre-determined questions or responses. Conversation options and the outcome of those conversations change according to the player's previous interactions. as well as which quests have been completed; which items the player has; which group the player belongs to and the player's leadership skill. The player can collect items from defeated enemies and the game environments to improve their own equipment. Non-player characters can trade with the player, buying most items regardless of type. The shopkeeper has a fixed amount of gold {{at the start of}} the game which does not replenish itself. It is possible for the player to drain all shopkeepers of their gold reserves, making it impossible to sell further items.|$|E

5|$|Much of Bloodlines {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical problems {{when it was}} released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted errors which closed the game and typographical errors in <b>on-screen</b> <b>text.</b> Others cited frequent, sometimes-lengthy load times encountered while moving between hubs and entering or exiting buildings and areas. GameSpot called the game's artificial intelligence poor, often causing enemies to rush at an armed player, fire at them from too great a distance to be effective or become immobilized {{while waiting for the}} player's next attack. IGN noted that stealth broke the AI, allowing traps to be triggered and leaving the assailants standing still, unable to locate a hidden player. GameSpy said that the Source engine was Bloodlines greatest weakness; although the RPG aspects were the game's strong suit, features of the Source engine, such as first-person shooting, were where it stumbled.|$|E

40|$|Accurate shot {{boundary}} detection techniques {{have been an}} important research topic in the last decade. Such interest is motivated {{by the fact that}} segmenting a video stream is the first step towards video content analysis and content-based video browsing and retrieval. In this paper, we present a new algorithm mainly focused on the detection of fades by using of a non-common feature in previous work: entropy, a scalar representation of the amount of information of each video frame. A survey of the properties of this feature is first provided where authors show that the pattern this series exhibits when fades occur is clear and consistent. It does not depend on the monochrome color used to fade and, besides, it is able to deal with <b>on-screen</b> <b>texts</b> remaining in the monochrome stage of them. A statistical model based algorithm to detect fades is proposed. Due to the clear pattern shown by fades in the entropy series and the accurate mathematical model used, motion and illumination changes do not severely affect precision as it normally happens with algorithms dealing with the detection of gradual transitions...|$|R

25|$|Video CDs do {{not come}} with closed caption (<b>on-screen</b> <b>text</b> to aid viewers with hearing problems). When {{watching}} a film that exceeds 74 minutes (nearly 1¼ hours), which is the maximum video capacity of one disc, a viewer has to change the disc upon reaching halfway (unless the discs are played on a VCD changer that can hold multiple discs and play them automatically in succession), whereas a single VHS can hold 3½ hours of continuous video (though as of 2014, 10-hour VHS tapes are available).|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another kind}} is actual video spam, giving the {{uploaded}} movie {{a name and}} description with a popular figure or event {{that is likely to}} draw attention, or within the video has a certain image timed to come up as the video's thumbnail image to mislead the viewer, such as a still image from a feature film, purporting to be a part-by-part piece of a movie being pirated, e.g. Big Buck Bunny Full Movie Online - Part 1/10 HD, a link to a supposed keygen, trainer, ISO file for a video game, or something similar. The actual content of the video ends up being totally unrelated, a Rickroll, offensive, or simply <b>on-screen</b> <b>text</b> of a link to the site being promoted. In some cases, the link in question may lead to an online survey site, a password-protected archive file with instructions leading to the aforementioned survey (though the survey, and the archive file itself, is worthless and doesn't contain the file in question at all), or in extreme cases, malware. Others may upload videos presented in an infomercial-like format selling their product which feature actors and paid testimonials, though the promoted product or service is of dubious quality and would likely not pass the scrutiny of a standards and practices department at a television station or cable network.|$|E

50|$|Another {{possible}} use of seamless branching {{is for the}} localisation (translation) of <b>on-screen</b> visible <b>text.</b> The Star Wars DVDs with their opening crawl are a prime example.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the Contentus use case was to manage and improve the {{technical}} quality of large digital multimedia collections in cultural heritage organizations. Generally, there are two causes for quality impairment of digitized multimedia items: errors during the digitization process and a poor condition of the analog original. While digitization errors may be corrected by re-digitization, any deterioration of analog materials can only be counteracted by digital restoration in post-processing after digitization. This article showcases a unique technique developed in Contentus to restore digitized hectograph archive documents that typically display yellowed paper and faded printing ink. The documents used in this restoration showcase belong to the archive of the Music Information Center the Association of Composers and Musicologists (MIZ) of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), and were produced between 1960 and 1989. The hectography method was widely adopted in the GDR to copy documents at a large scale. The showcased restoration method enhances the readability of <b>on-screen</b> <b>texts</b> and, as shown by evaluation, lowers the error rate of optical character recognition. In turn, the latter improvement is expected to improve the automated extraction of semantic information entities like persons, places and organizations. The technology {{presented in this article}} {{is an example of how}} corpora consisting of visually impaired analog media can be prepared for semantic search applications based on automatic content indexing - another major goal of the use case Contentus...|$|R

500|$|Dave Cummins {{wrote the}} {{dialogue}} for the game. The tone of Revolution's early games was born from {{a tension between}} Cummins and Cecil. Cummins wanted to be more flippant with dialogue, while Cecil wanted to be more serious. Their goal was to find the middle ground between Sierra's [...] "ridiculously earnest" [...] stories and the slapstick comedy of LucasArts games. For the voice acting, which is only included in the CD-ROM version, Revolution used actors from the Royal Shakespeare Company. Only two days were spent recording over five thousands lines of dialogue. Not pleased with the results, however, Revolution decided on a lengthy re-recording, and realized that voice actors should be used, rather than stage actors. As a result of this, the speech doesn't always match the <b>on-screen</b> <b>text,</b> with English terms being Americanized. Cummins was also responsible for the score of the game, writing a specific tune {{for each of the}} main locations.|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} review of literature concerning the biological determination of sex and genderised behaviours, theoretical accounts {{of the development of}} gender role identity and the debatable extent of gender differences {{in a wide range of}} physical, intellectual, emotional, moral, linguistic and occupational areas is presented A brief history of the development of the computer and Internet is outlines. Demographic data on Internet users are discussed and historical, educational, media, employment and financial factors which may contribute to the current female underrepresentation on the Internet are examined. A theoretical framework is presented which accounts for the gernderisation of activities, occupations and technologies. This mechanism is then applied to new technologies and the Internet in particular. The results of six experimental and investigative studies are presented. Study (A) examined the ability of 126 subjects to identify the gender of the authors of <b>on-screen</b> <b>texts.</b> The results indicate that the subject identification scores are compatible with the scores expected from random guessing. Study (B) examined age and gender differences in perceived risk-taking strategies adopted by 354 subjects when participating in a computerised card game. The results showed that males took greater risks than females and older subjects took more optimal risks than younger subjects. Study (C) involved a re-examination of Jean Piaget's 1932 data on reciprocity in revenge. The results confirmed that male subjects took more perceived risks than female subjects.

40|$|Presentation of {{information}} in combined perceptual modalities could facilitate both the learning of complex concepts and procedures. There is an important amount of studies on this subject related to several school curriculum areas. Although, {{this is not the}} case in music education, despite the visual helps might have the potential to facilitate aural discrimination and memory by means of associative processes, as well as the enhancement of motor skills. This study have tried to discover if there is an effect of unimodal presentation mode (three exclusive modes) versus bimodal presentation mode (two crossed modes) in the reproduction of musical rhythm patterns. To do this, two experiments were carried out with Middle School children in Valencia, Spain. In the first experiment (N 50; 21 boys; 29 girls; 14 - 16 years old) a contrast pretest-posttest design was adopted. Subjects were grouped in five conditions, each having information in one different mode: only static images (I) flashing the rhythm according to the proposed rhythm patterns; only sounds (A); only <b>on-screen</b> <b>texts</b> (T) that represented the rhythm pattern when reading; sounds and static images together (AV) and sounds and texts together (AT). In the second experiment a repeated measures design was adopted (N= 10; 3 boys and 7 girls; 16 - 18 years old). Each subject had to do the tests in all experimental conditions aforementioned. Some intervening variables were measured: previous rhythm skills, previous musical experiences, school achievement of last year, preferences on modes {{of information}} presentation and gender. Test tasks were to hear in turn 10 proposed rhythm patterns, memorized them, and imitate them by means of a computer key. The computer ran an ad hoc computer program that provided stimuli, data gathering and assessment of responses. Results of both experiments show statistical differences in favor of groups AV, AT (bimodal) and A (unimodal). It is suggested the advantage of presenting rhythm information with sound together with other means in the teaching and learning music processes...|$|R
