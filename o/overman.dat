5|$|Louise Bryant (December 5, 1885 – January 6, 1936) was an American feminist, {{political}} activist, {{and journalist}} {{best known for}} her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. Bryant, who married writer John Reed, her second husband, in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky. Her news stories, distributed by Hearst during and after her trips to Petrograd and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following World War I. A collection of articles from her first trip was published in book form as Six Red Months in Russia in 1918. During the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the <b>Overman</b> Committee, a Senate subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States. Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce armed U.S. intervention in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Twelve years later, {{the snow}} shark {{has become a}} town legend. The town's mayor, Shawn <b>Overman,</b> is {{informed}} when two residents are killed by the shark, and he and Sheriff Donald Chapman hold a town meeting. During the meeting, one of the residents, Mike Evans, claims that the killings were caused by the shark, despite him having said to have killed the creature seven years earlier. Against Chapman's warnings, he sets out to kill the beast once more. That night, Chapman and his son Ethan argue about Ethan finding a job and they mention Ethan's mother's death. Ethan leaves to drink beer outside with his friend Doug, and is killed by the shark while urinating. The next day, {{with the rest of}} the police force already at the scene, a distraught Chapman sees Ethan's corpse and questions Doug about the incident. When Doug claims that Ethan's death was caused by a shark, Chapman believes him and prepares to set out to kill it.|$|E

25|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the notion of eternal return is related to the <b>overman,</b> since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the <b>overman</b> is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the <b>overman,</b> in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the <b>overman</b> in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the <b>overman</b> will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.|$|E
50|$|<b>Overmans</b> {{maintains}} that his research project taking a statistical {{sample of the}} records of the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) found that the German military casualty reporting system broke down during the war and that losses were understated.

25|$|Zarathustra {{contrasts}} the <b>overman</b> {{with the}} last man of egalitarian modernity (most obvious example being democracy), an alternative goal humanity might set for itself.
