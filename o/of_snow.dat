Several areas received over 115inches (over 2.5m) <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> in a ten-day period just before the large winter storm as northwesterly winds and unfrozen lake surfaces due to the early winter warm weather favored the heavy snowfall.

5|$|Cloud seeding {{was first}} {{attempted}} by Vincent Schaefer and Irving Langmuir.

5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such.

Every year the annual feast was celebrated on 5 August.

5|$|In addition, Disney began reissuing the {{previous}} features, beginning with re-releases <b>of</b> <b>Snow</b> White in 1944, Pinocchio in 1945, and Fantasia in 1946.

5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b> In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E

40|$|The case <b>of</b> John <b>Snow</b> {{has long}} been {{important}} to epidemiologists and public health officials. However, {{despite the fact that}} there have been many discussions about the various aspects <b>of</b> <b>Snow’s</b> case, there has been virtually no discussion about what guided Snow’s reasoning in his coming to believe his various conclusions about cholera. Here, I want to take up this question in some detail and show {{that there are a number}} of specific principles of reasoning that played a crucial role for Snow. Moreover, these principles were epistemologically important to Snow, a fact about which Snow is explicit in many places. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>Snow’s</b> case suggests that, because of the epistemic role such principles of reasoning can play, health care practitioners ought to understand their practices to be theoretically informed in these ways, and not just data driven.
