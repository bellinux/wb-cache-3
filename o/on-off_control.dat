[...] The panel was unable to conclusively establish the cause but it decided the most likely cause was that the automatic pilot was inadvertently engaged shortly after takeoff while the gyroscope was caged. [...] The Department of Civil Aviation took action to ensure that operation of the automatic pilot <b>on-off</b> <b>control</b> on Douglas DC-3 aircraft was made distinctive from operation of any other control in the cockpit, and that instructions were issued impressing on pilots that gyroscopes should be un-caged prior to takeoff.|$|E

A 16 x 16 array of individually addressable pixels are <b>on-off</b> <b>controlled</b> through parallel logic signals.

The linearity {{of the device}} is assessed, and data transmission using pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is performed. Error-free transmission at a symbol rate of 100 MSamples/s is demonstrated with 4 -PAM, yielding a data rate of 200 Mb/s. For 8 -PAM, encoding is required to overcome the baseline wander from the receiver, reducing the data rate to 150 Mb/s.

500|$|John Watkins, {{chairman}} of the investigation panel, told the inquiry the evidence supporting the theory that inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot caused the accident was that its control box was recovered from the wreckage and its gyroscope was still caged. The speed valve unit was also recovered and it indicated the automatic pilot was operating {{at the time of}} impact. [...] Inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot with the gyroscope caged could explain a sudden descent by a DC-3. Watkins also said the panel's report to the Director-General made several recommendations and they were already being actioned. [...] These included one recommendation that operation of the automatic pilot <b>on-off</b> <b>control</b> on Australian-registered DC-3 aircraft should be made distinctive from operation of any other control in the cockpit.|$|E

40|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{is one of}} the major energy consuming items in many non-domestic buildings. Using appropriate energy-efficient light fittings with dimming controls and proper daylighting schemes can help reduce the electrical demand and contribute to visual comfort and green building development. This paper presents a study on the energy and lighting performances for energy-efficient fluorescent lamps associated with electronic ballasts and high frequency photoelectric dimming controls installed in a school building. Electricity expenditures and indoor illuminance levels for a workshop and a classroom employing high frequency dimming controls were analyzed. Simple prediction methods were used to illustrate the lighting savings. The findings provide the operational and performance information, which would be applicable to other spaces with similar building layouts and lighting schemes.

40|$|Broad Funding Opportunity Announcement Project: Delphi is {{developing}} power converters that are {{smaller and more}} energy efficient, reliable, and cost-effective than current power converters. Power converters rely on power transistors which act like a very precisely <b>controlled</b> <b>on-off</b> switch, <b>controlling</b> the electrical energy flowing through an electrical circuit.
