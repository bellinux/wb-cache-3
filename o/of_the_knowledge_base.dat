2500|$|Meta-representation. This is {{also known}} as the issue of {{reflection}} in computer science. It refers to the capability of a formalism to have access to information about its own state. An example would be the meta-object protocol in Smalltalk and CLOS that gives developers run time access to the class objects and enables them to dynamically redefine the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base</b> even at run time. Meta-representation means the knowledge representation language is itself expressed in that language. For example, in most Frame based environments all frames would be instances of a frame class. That class object can be inspected at run time so that the object can understand and even change its internal structure or the structure of other parts of the model. In rule-based environments the rules were also usually instances of rule classes. Part of the meta protocol for rules were the meta rules that prioritized rule firing.|$|E

50|$|So {{why was the}} {{distinction}} introduced? The primary {{reason is that the}} separation can be useful when describing and formulating decision-procedures for various DL. For example, a reasoner might process the TBox and ABox separately, in part because certain key inference problems are tied to one but not the other one ('classification' is related to the TBox, 'instance checking' to the ABox). Another example is that the complexity of the TBox can greatly affect the performance of a given decision-procedure for a certain DL, independently of the ABox.
