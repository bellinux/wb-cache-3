5|$|Bush portrayed {{himself as}} a {{compassionate}} conservative, implying he was more centrist than <b>other</b> <b>Republicans.</b> He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing {{the size of the}} United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities. By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2007 session, Roberts {{was named}} by House Republican {{leadership}} {{to the newly}} formed Criminal and Juvenile Justice Commission. In November 2007, she was named a Legislator of Merit by the Colorado Behavioral Health Council. She joined with <b>other</b> <b>Republicans</b> to criticize an executive order issued by Governor Bill Ritter allowing collective bargaining with government employee unions as a betrayal of Ritter's promise of bipartisan cooperation on major issues.|$|E
5|$|Rivalry between Brooks and Clayton predated the 1868 election. Clayton saw Brooks as {{his strongest}} {{competitor}} for preference and distinction {{and did not}} want him to become too entrenched with the party leadership. Brooks felt that his ability and service to the party were not being recognized or appreciated, and he grew bitter and resentful of the <b>other</b> <b>Republicans,</b> including Clayton.|$|E

5|$|His {{political}} reputation {{rose with}} his professional plaudits. Hayes declined the Republican nomination for a judgeship in 1856. Two years later, some Republicans proposed Hayes {{to fill a}} vacancy {{on the bench and}} he considered accepting the appointment until the office of city solicitor also became vacant. The city council elected Hayes as city solicitor to fill the vacancy, and he won a full two-year term from the voters in April 1859 with a larger majority than <b>other</b> <b>Republicans</b> on the ticket.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Tydings–Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several <b>other</b> <b>Republicans</b> in the 1950 elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now {{regarded as one of}} the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Nunn {{served on}} the boards of regents of Morehead State University and Kentucky State University. He served as a {{lecturer}} at Western Kentucky University, and received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Louisville in 1999. During the late 1980s, he criticized Senator Mitch McConnell, one of the emerging leaders of the state's Republican party, for not doing more to support <b>other</b> <b>Republicans</b> in their bids for office; McConnell maintained that he had to focus on his own reelection campaign in 1990. In 1988, Nunn unsuccessfully challenged Congressman Jim Bunning in his bid to retain his position as Kentucky's Republican national committeeman.|$|E

5|$|For {{his first}} run for Governor of Oregon in 1958, the Republican Party opposed his {{candidacy}} {{going into the}} primary election. The large political base he had cultivated allowed him to win the party's primary despite the party's opposition. In the primary he defeated Oregon State Treasurer Sig Unander for the Republican nomination. In July 1958, after the primary election, Hatfield married Antoinette Kuzmanich, a counselor at Portland State College (now Portland State University). The marriage during the campaign drew some attention as the Catholic Kuzmanich converted to Hatfield's Baptist religion. The couple would have four children: Elizabeth, Mark Jr., Theresa and Vincent ("Visko"). He continued his campaign for the governor's office after the wedding, but avoided most public appearances with fellow Republican candidates for office and did not mention them during his campaign, despite requests by <b>other</b> <b>Republicans</b> for joint appearances.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, Adams {{was elected}} Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts {{and served in}} that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting {{governor}}. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, {{the first of four}} annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's Jeffersonian Republicans, who were opposed to the Federalist Party. Unlike some <b>other</b> <b>Republicans,</b> Adams supported the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion. Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the Jay Treaty in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist. In that year's U. S. presidential election, Republicans in Virginia cast 15 electoral votes for Adams {{in an effort to make}} him Jefferson's vice-president, but Federalist John Adams won the election, with Jefferson becoming vice-president. The Adams cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 {{campaign}} season, in {{an effort}} to offer an alternative to Democratic policies and to unite distant wings of the Republican Party, Gingrich and several <b>other</b> <b>Republicans</b> came up with a Contract with America, which laid out ten policies that Republicans promised to bring to a vote on the House floor during the first hundred days of the new Congress, if they won the election. The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and a balanced budget law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|E

5|$|McKinley {{increasingly}} {{became a}} significant figure in national politics. In 1880, he served a brief term as Ohio's representative on the Republican National Committee. In 1884, {{he was elected}} a delegate to that year's Republican convention, where he served {{as chair of the}} Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside. By 1886, McKinley, Senator John Sherman, and Governor Joseph B. Foraker were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio. Sherman, who had helped to found the Republican Party, ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s, each time failing, while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade. Hanna, once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor, supported Sherman's ambitions, {{as well as those of}} Foraker. The latter relationship broke off at the 1888 Republican National Convention, where McKinley, Foraker, and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman. Convinced Sherman could not win, Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee, Maine Senator James G. Blaine. When Blaine stated he was not a candidate, Foraker returned to Sherman, but the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was elected president. In the bitterness that followed the convention, Hanna abandoned Foraker, and for the rest of McKinley's life, the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions, one aligned with McKinley, Sherman, and Hanna and the other with Foraker. Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him. Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting <b>other</b> <b>Republicans,</b> in the years after 1888, he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinley's political career.|$|E
