5|$|Asma is a {{professional}} Emirati puppeteer, storyteller and creative drama specialist. A graduate of the United Arab Emirates University, Asma earned her BA in English Literature, minoring in drama and theater. Through a Summer Master’s Degree Program in Applied Drama at the City University of New York, Asma distinguished herself as a creative drama specialist, {{with a focus on}} puppetry and early childhood education. This led her to be chosen by the Zayed Higher Organization in 2012 to work with children with special needs. As a result of her training with the ‘Kids on the Block’ program, which uses special puppets crafted with different disabilities, Asma has opened up a new field <b>of</b> <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> intervention; one that uses the dynamics of puppetry and creative drama to enhance education for the most impressionable audience in the UAE.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was a {{critical}} analysis on impact <b>of</b> centralized <b>Early</b> <b>Childhood</b> Development (ECD) Policy on quality service delivery in <b>Early</b> <b>Childhood</b> Development centers in Kenya. As much as <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> education has been devolved, the Centralized <b>Early</b> <b>Childhood</b> Development Policy is still under the mandate of the National government. This has made many to still misunderstand the policy, leading to inequalities in resource distribution, quality teacher recruitment and recruitment and funding of these centers. This study was solely to critically analyze impact <b>of</b> centralized <b>Early</b> <b>Childhood</b> Development (ECD) policy on quality service delivery, impact of teacher training and recruitment, impact of resources allocation and distribution, and impact of government involvement and funding of schools on quality service delivery in <b>Early</b> <b>Childhood</b> Development centers in Kenya. This study employed qualitative research design that was used to conduct a critical analysis. This study constituted recommendations to the national government, county government, and stakeholders in <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> education on centralized <b>Early</b> <b>Childhood</b> Development policy, leading to equality in distribution of resources, recruitment of quality teachers, and better remuneration of the teachers.

25|$|The {{research}} on maternal sensitivity follows earlier work in psychoanalytics and is especially rooted in attachment theory. As {{the focus of}} psychoanalytics shifted from individuals (particularly adults) to children, research studies on mother–infant dyads, on the effects <b>of</b> <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> on development, and on pregnancy became wider. A psychologist named John Bowlby eventually developed the attachment theory in 1969. Mary Ainsworth, who worked with Bowlby, along with her colleagues created the concept of maternal sensitivity in 1978 in order to describe early mother–infant interaction observed in her empirical studies.|$|E

25|$|Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections <b>of</b> <b>Early</b> <b>Childhood</b> (also {{known as}} Ode, Immortality Ode or Great Ode) is {{a poem by}} William Wordsworth, {{completed}} in 1804 and published in Poems, in Two Volumes (1807). The poem was completed in two parts, with the first four stanzas written among a series of poems composed in 1802 about childhood. The {{first part of the}} poem was completed on 27 March 1802 and a copy was provided to Wordsworth's friend and fellow poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who responded with his own poem, , in April. The fourth stanza of the ode ends with a question, and Wordsworth was finally able to answer it with 7 additional stanzas completed in early 1804. It was first printed as Ode in 1807, and it was not until 1815 that it was edited and reworked to the version that is currently known, Ode: Intimations of Immortality.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} year, the social psychologist Gerhard Vinnai (University of Bremen), came to similar conclusions. When writing his work Hitler – Scheitern und Vernichtungswut (2004; “Hitler – Failing and rage of destruction”), Vinnai had a psychoanalytic point of depart; he first subjected Hitler’s book Mein Kampf a depth psychological interpretation {{and tried to}} reconstruct how Hitler had processed his experiences in World War I {{against the background of}} his childhood and youth. But similar to Dorpat, Vinnai explains the destructive potential in Hitler's psyche {{not so much as a}} result <b>of</b> <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> experiences, but rather due to trauma that Hitler had suffered as a soldier in World War I. Not only Hitler, but a substantial part of the German population was affected by such war trauma. Vinnai then leaves the psychoanalytical discourse and comments on social psychological questions, such as how Hitler’s political world view could have emerged from his trauma and how this could appeal to large numbers of people.|$|E
25|$|Amrita Sher-Gil {{was born}} on 30 January 1913 in Budapest, Hungary, to Umrao Singh Sher-Gil Majithia, a Sikh aristocrat and a scholar in Sanskrit and Persian, and Marie Antoniette Gottesmann, a Hungarian-Jewish opera singer who came from an {{affluent}} bourgeois family. Her parents first met in 1912, while Marie Antoinette was visiting Lahore. Her mother came to India as a companion of Princess Bamba Sutherland, the granddaughter of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Sher-Gil was the elder of two daughters; her younger sister was Indira Sundaram (née Sher-Gil), born in March 1914), mother of the contemporary artist Vivan Sundaram. She spent most <b>of</b> <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> in Budapest. She was the niece of Indologist Ervin Baktay. Baktay noticed Sher-Gil's artistic talents {{during his visit to}} Shimla in 1926 and was an advocate of Sher-Gil pursuing art. He guided her by critiquing her work and gave her an academic foundation to grow on. When she was a young girl she would paint the servants in her house, and get them to model for her. The memories of these models would eventually lead to her return to India. Her first teachers were Major Whitmarsh, who was later replaced by Beven Pateman. She attended Santa Annuciata, Florence.|$|E
