5|$|John Verbruggen {{was one of}} the {{original}} rebels and had been offered a share in the actors' company, but became disgruntled when his wife Susanna, a popular comedian, was not. For Rich, it was a stroke <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> get Susanna and John back into his depleted and unskilled troupe. John's availability to play Loveless remained precarious, however. In September, when The Relapse had still not been staged after six months of trying (probably because Rich was still parleying with Cibber about his availability as Lord Foppington), John was still complaining about his employment situation, even getting into a physical fight over it at the theatre. This misbehaviour caused the Lord Chamberlain to declare his contract void {{and at the same time}} order him to stay with the Patent Company until January 1697, to give Rich time to find a replacement. The original Loveless was thus finally guaranteed for an autumn season run of The Relapse. Since the loyal Verbruggen couple always moved as a unit, Susanna's services were also assured.|$|E
500|$|During a Hurricanes' {{residency}} at Butlins, Lennon and McCartney {{drove from}} Liverpool to Skegness, on 15 August 1962, to ask Starr {{to join the}} Beatles. Shortly before, Starr had agreed to join Kingsize Taylor in Hamburg, as Taylor was offering £20 a week (equivalent to £ in [...] ), but Lennon and McCartney offered £25 a week (equivalent to £ in [...] ), which Starr accepted. Lennon and McCartney offered Storm to swap drummers (with Best replacing Starr) but Best rejected the idea. According to Epstein in his autobiography, Storm was, [...] "One of the liveliest and most likable young men on the scene ... was very annoyed when Ringo left and he complained to me. I apologized, and Rory, with immense good humor said, 'Okay. Forget it. The best <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> the lot of you'". The Hurricanes then became known for having a succession of drummers, including Gibson Kemp, Brian Johnson, John Morrison, Keef Hartley (August 1963), Ian Broad and Trevor Morais, who all stayed with the group {{for a short period}} before leaving.|$|E
2500|$|While Georgia {{still held}} an overall {{advantage}} in the series, Florida enjoyed a 10–2 streak from 1952 to 1963 under head coaches Bob Woodruff and Ray Graves. [...] That changed {{with the arrival of}} Vince Dooley as the new head coach of the underdog 1964 Georgia Bulldogs. [...] In a game where the Bulldogs' quarterback failed to complete a single pass and was intercepted twice, Dooleys' 'Dogs relied on their running game, a staunch second-half defense, and a little bit <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> beat Graves' tenth-ranked Florida Gators. [...] With the game tied at 7–7 in the fourth quarter, Bulldogs placekicker Bob Etter lined up for a potential game-winning field goal. [...] Instead, in a wild broken play, the Bulldogs' center and placeholder mishandled the snap, but Etter picked up the bobbled ball and ran it for a touchdown to win the game 14–7.|$|E

2500|$|On 14 April, Grahame {{was voted}} in the top two of who Canada wanted to see become the Head of Household for the week, but {{ultimately}} lost a competition <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> fellow HouseGuests Nick & Phil Paquette. On 24 April, Grahame was nominated for eviction by HoH Cassandra as a [...] "Pawn" [...] to evict a bigger target. On 28 April, she survived this eviction when Jared Kesler was evicted in a 3-1 eviction vote. However, in a Double Eviction twist, Grahame was nominated once again for eviction alongside Dormer by the HoH Nick & Phil. [...] Dormer was vetoed off the block {{and was replaced by}} Joel Lefevre. Grahame then became the tenth houseguest to be evicted in a 3-0 eviction vote, and received a standing ovation from the studio audience. Grahame was evicted on her 34th birthday, on Day 63. As a result of her eviction, Grahame was the 5th member of the nine person Jury who voted to decide the winner of the season on Finale Night. She along with 6 other jurors voted for Nick & Phil to be the winners of the series.|$|E
2500|$|The Browns {{broke into}} the ranks of the NFL's elite—particularly on defense—with a 12–4 showing in [...] Behind Kosar's 3,854 yards passing and one of the league's stingiest {{defenses}} featuring five Pro Bowlers (Chip Banks, Hanford Dixon, Bob Golic, Clay Matthews, and Frank Minnifield), the Browns dominated the AFC Central with {{the best record in the}} AFC and clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Browns needed some serious heroics (and a bit <b>of</b> <b>luck)</b> <b>to</b> overcome the New York Jets. The Jets were leading 20–10 with less than four minutes to play, with the Browns in a dire third and 24 situation. Mark Gastineau was called for roughing the passer, which gave Cleveland a first down. The drive ended with Kevin Mack running into the end zone for a touchdown. After going three-and-out, the Jets went back on defense, but allowed the rejuvenated Browns to again drive the ball deep into their end of the field. With 11 seconds remaining in regulation, Mark Moseley kicked a field goal to tie the game. In the first of two ensuing overtime periods, Moseley missed his next attempt, but later redeemed himself by ending what had become the second-longest game in NFL history, a 23–20 victory for the Browns.|$|E
2500|$|In reply, the Sixers {{had trouble}} {{of their own}} keeping wickets in hand. With regular opener Michael Lumb out for the game, Stephen O'Keefe partnered Nic Maddinson {{at the top of}} the order. Both looked to move the scores on but fell cheaply. Then when Moises Henriques and Marcus North both {{returned}} to the pavilion without troubling the scorers the Sixers were 4/20. Scorchers bowler Tim Behrendorff was the destroyer with 3/21 from his four overs. Steve Smith and Jordan Silk did some rebuilding of their own before Silk gifted Voges an easy return catch. Smith continued scoring runs and looked in fine form as he reached his half century. The Sixers seemed like they would now easily make the runs. However, the game turned on its head once more when Dan Smith attempted to play a reverse sweep only to scoop the ball to fine leg. With the Scorchers eyeing off the Sixers tail-enders, Steve Smith took it upon himself to finish the game. A mistimed shot of the bowling of Yasir Arafat saw him caught at short third man by Voges with the Sixers 7/131. Lyon quickly departed and the Scorchers looked destined to win. However, the nineteenth over by Thomas saw some big hitting by Lee and Chris Tremlett leaving the Sixers with just 7 runs of the final over by Arafat to win. Neither side could quite find the slice <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> get the win in ordinary time. With Lee out bowled, Tremlett faced the final delivery needing two runs to win. He dug out the ball from Arafat who couldn't quite hold onto out bumping it out to cover. The Sixers scampered through for a single leaving the scores tied.|$|E

They keep us worthy of ourselves; and when we are alone, we are only nearer to the absent.|$|E

60|$|How {{important}} that card {{was to become}} he did not dream, yet he {{decided that it was}} a pretty good card. In turn, he doubted. Maybe it was a trick <b>of</b> <b>Luck</b> <b>to</b> bring calamity and disaster upon him. Suppose Dede wouldn't have him, and suppose he went on loving her more and more, harder and harder? All his old generalized terrors of love revived. He remembered the disastrous love affairs of men and women he had known in the past. There was Bertha Doolittle, old Doolittle's daughter, who had been madly in love with Dartworthy, the rich Bonanza fraction owner; and Dartworthy, in turn, not loving Bertha at all, but madly loving Colonel Walthstone's wife and eloping down the Yukon with her; and Colonel Walthstone himself, madly loving his own wife and lighting out in pursuit of the fleeing couple. And what had been the outcome? Certainly Bertha's love had been unfortunate and tragic, and so had the love of the other three. Down below Minook, Colonel Walthstone and Dartworthy had fought it out. Dartworthy had been killed. A bullet through the Colonel's lungs had so weakened him that he died of pneumonia the following spring. And the Colonel's wife had no one left alive on earth to love.|$|E

60|$|Happily Lydgate {{had ended}} by losing in the billiard-room, and brought away no {{encouragement}} {{to make a}} raid on luck. On the contrary, he felt unmixed disgust with himself {{the next day when}} he had to pay four or five pounds over and above his gains, and he carried about with him a most unpleasant vision of the figure he had made, not only rubbing elbows with the men at the Green Dragon but behaving just as they did. A philosopher fallen to betting is hardly distinguishable from a Philistine under the same circumstances: the difference will chiefly be found in his subsequent reflections, and Lydgate chewed a very disagreeable cud in that way. His reason told him how the affair might have been magnified into ruin by a slight change of scenery--if it had been a gambling-house that he had turned into, where chance could be clutched with both hands instead of being picked up with thumb and fore-finger. Nevertheless, though reason strangled the desire to gamble, there remained the feeling that, with an assurance <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> the needful amount, {{he would have liked to}} gamble, rather than take the alternative which was beginning to urge itself as inevitable.|$|E
6000|$|March 4th. Mary Mallinson {{came down}} to my room to take {{a cup of tea}} with me.

60|$|It {{was very}} {{apparent}} that Martin's secret {{had not been}} well kept, and that the fact of his intended marriage with Anty Lynch was soon likely to be known to all Dunmore. The truth was, that Moylan had begun to think himself overreached in the matter--to be afraid that, by the very measure he had himself proposed, he would lose all share in the great prize he had put in Martin's way, {{and that he should}} himself be the means of excluding his own finger from the pie. It appeared to him that if he allowed this, his own folly would only be equalled by the young man's ingratitude; and he determined therefore, if possible, to prevent the match. Whereupon he told the matter as a secret, to those whom he knew would set it moving. In a very short space of time it reached the ears of Father Connel; and he lost none in stepping down to learn the truth of so important a piece <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> one of his parishioners, and to congratulate the widow. Here, however, he was out in his reckoning, for she declared she did not believe it,--that it wasn't, and couldn't be true; and it was only after his departure that she succeeded in extracting the truth from her daughters.|$|E
