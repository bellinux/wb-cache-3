5|$|Zhou has {{appeared}} in various kinds of media including novels, comic books, and movies. Apart from The Story of Yue Fei and Iron Arm, Golden Sabre, he appears in a novel based around his older martial arts brother, Jin Tai. A recent graphic novel of The Story of Yue Fei, deletes all mythological elements from the storyline and presents it in a historical manner. Instead of traveling from Hebei to Hubei to inspect land, Zhou travels from Shaanxi to Kaifeng City in Henan to visit an old friend who had been promoted to General. While {{en route to the}} capital city, Zhou takes note of a great famine plaguing the peasantry and even hears stories <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> resorting to Cannibalism. However, when he arrives in Kaifeng, he sees the empire is wasting money on the construction of large imperial gardens, the court officials Cai Jing and Wang Pu have extravagant residencies, and hears that even eunuchs are rich because they are given high government posts. Upon locating his friend, Zhou is distressed to find him in stocks and shackles and being escorted to the farthest reaches of China by imperial guards. He later learns that the General had accidentally offended some court officials and was sentenced to permanent exile on some trumped up charges. Apparently having little or no money, Zhou decides to visit Wang Ming in Hubei (mistakenly called Hebei) and becomes the estate's tutor.|$|E

More deliberations resulted in the hiring of the Rev. Moses Mather (born in 1719), a Yale graduate (Class of 1739) originally from Lyme, where his father was a sea captain. He was hired for a two-year probationary period, officially became minister in 1744 while still in his mid-20s, and spent his entire 64-year career at the post, until his death in 1806.|$|E

25|$|Goncharov's first novel, A Common Story, was {{published}} in Sovremennik in 1847. It dealt with {{the conflict between the}} excessive romanticism of a young Russian nobleman who has recently arrived in Saint Petersburg from the provinces, and the sober pragmatism of the emerging commercial class of the capital. A Common Story polarized critics and made its author famous. The novel was a direct response to Vissarion Belinsky's call for exposing a new type, that of the complacent romantic, common at the time; it was lavishly praised by the famous critic {{as one of the best}} Russian books of the year. The term aduyevschina (after the novel's protagonist Aduyev) became popular with reviewers who saw it as synonymous with vain romantic aspirations. Leo Tolstoy, who liked the novel, used the same word to describe social egotism and the inability <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> to see beyond their immediate interests.|$|E

A similar sentence can be found in Psalm 37 : 29 : צַדִּיקִים יִֽירְשׁוּ־אָרֶץ וְיִשְׁכְּנוּ לָעַד עָלֶֽיהָ. A comparison between these verses would illustrate that “صالح” is the Quranic equivalent of the Hebrew word “צַדִּיקִ”. This equivalence would allow us to compare usages of “صالح” in Quran and “צַדִּיקִ” in the book of Psalms. This comparative study will show that: (a) on the one hand, “צַדִּיקִ” has been used in Psalms either as an attribute of God or as a description <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>peoples</b> and on the other, “صالح” has been used in Quran for describing either <b>some</b> <b>peoples</b> or their acts, (b) These two words have similar usages in Psalms and Quran {{to the extent that they}} have been used for the description <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>peoples</b> and (c) the Quranopsalmic use of this notion can be linked with the concept of “divine selection(istifā) ”...|$|R
