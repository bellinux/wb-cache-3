25|$|The reason I didn't {{review the}} book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My {{appreciation}} <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> diverse and that complicated... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me {{the sense of the}} fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.|$|E

Abrupt walls overlook the Pacific, and great longitudinal and transversal channels and fjords run right {{through the heart of}} the range, cutting it generally in a direction more or less oblique to its axis, the result of movements of the Earth's crust. This region is not fully explored, and all that is known <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is principally composed of the same rocks as the Fuegian Andes, and that the greater part of its upper valleys is occupied by glaciers that reach down to the sea amid dense forest.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{indications}} that Hipparchus knew spherical trigonometry, {{but the first}} surviving text <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Menelaus of Alexandria in the 1st century, who on that basis is now commonly credited with its discovery. (Previous to the finding of the proofs of Menelaus a century ago, Ptolemy was credited with the invention of spherical trigonometry.) Ptolemy later used spherical trigonometry to compute things like the rising and setting points of the ecliptic, or {{to take account of}} the lunar parallax. Hipparchus may have used a globe for these tasks, reading values off coordinate grids drawn on it, or he may have made approximations from planar geometry, or perhaps used arithmetical approximations developed by the Chaldeans. He might have used spherical trigonometry.|$|E
25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really.

2500|$|With {{both sides}} having good batsmen and weak bowling attacks an {{exceptional}} number of runs were made, especially by Australia {{in the last}} two Tests when they fielded seven specialist batsmen and an all rounder.

According to social media reports, on July 11, 2014, Zao went into the studio, after a five-year unofficial hiatus and working on side projects like Lonely Ghost Parade and Young Fox, is currently, tracking and recording their 11th album.

25|$|The richest {{and most}} {{significant}} category available is {{the writings of}} the fathers. This library has yielded a great number of manuscripts, preserving texts of the composition of Egyptian writers, as well as Coptic translation of Greek writings of Church Fathers. The most significant part <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the remarkable works of Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite. Other writings includes those of Saint Wissa's sermons, the writings of Saint Pachomius and his disciples, and the Apophthgamata Patrum. Other texts of original Coptic composition include those of Constantine of Asyut, John of Burulus, and Rufus of Shotep. The group of Coptic translations of Greek writings includes those of Saint Peter of Alexandria, Saint Athanasius, Saint Theophilus, Saint Cyril the Great, and Saint Dioscorus. The Greek translations of non-Coptic Fathers include Saint Cyril of Jerusalem, Saint John Chrysostom, and Saint Severus of Antioch. Works of other authors are also found in that collection.|$|E

[...] However, there was some negative fan feedback concerning the pregnancy storyline. In reaction to this, Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our interpretation <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people desperately want to see Olivia and Peter together. And that Fauxlivia having a baby makes Olivia’s life that much harder and people are angry because of that. Anything that makes Olivia’s life harder, people seem to be angry at. Olivia is a hero, she will conquer all. She’ll deal." [...] After [...] "Immortality" [...] aired, Joshua Jackson expressed sympathy for fans of the Olivia-Peter relationship, commenting that they [...] "have been taken for quite a ride.

[...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as I found out, I thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, {{and when he saw}} Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but we think they do.

2500|$|HK {{included}} several design {{features that are}} essential in modern military firearms. For example, the bolt locks back after the last round is spent (this can be deactivated), and at {{the front end of}} the trigger guard there is a bolt catch button. The cocking handle can be switched from either end, folds in, and unfolds from a spring so the shooter need not unfold it by hand [...] before firing. Another feature <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it doubles as the forward assist, which is used in the instance that the spent cartridge ejected but the next one did not properly extract and go into battery. In addition, the ejection port has a brass deflector to mitigate the amount of casings that may strike the face of left-handed operators. Instead of a dust cover which has the need to be flipped back up when the gun isn't in use, the bolt acts as the seal from dirt.|$|E

There was no excuse. I was feeling in {{particularly}} good form; and the worst <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she handicapped herself in the latest game with what in anyone else would be insolent severity. Murder on the Nile (sic) was entirely brilliant; Appointment with Death, while lacking the single stroke of murderer's genius which provided the alibi in the former story, must be counted mathematically nearly twice as brilliant, since the number of suspects is reduced by nearly half. Indeed, though we begin our story in Jerusalem and meet our murder in Petra, the Red Rose City, {{we might as well}} be in a snowbound vicarage as far as the limitation of suspicion is concerned. And it is in this respect that Agatha Christie repeats her Cards on the Table triumph and beats Steinitz with a single row of pawns." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Cool Wall", {{the segment}} focused on an {{argument}} {{between two of}} the presenters over which cars are cool and which are not, placing photographs of these on various sections of a large board divided into a serious of categories: [...] "Seriously Uncool", [...] "Uncool", [...] "Cool", and [...] "Sub Zero". This segment was purely designed for comedy, as it was mainly handled by both Clarkson and Hammond since its introduction in the sixth episode of the first series, and both presenter often argued and attempted to put a car they liked into a category that the other refused to let it be a part of, with Clarkson basing some of his arguments by how the cars would impress actress Kristin Scott Thomas, and later, BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce. Cars were placed into a specific category depending on certain attributes, which, according to Andy Wilman, were not necessarily related {{to the quality of the}} car itself. An example of this is that a car considered to be [...] "fashionable" [...] may be deemed uncool if the impact it has is massive but short-lived and the perception <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it looks ridiculous. A notable rule of this segment was that the car becomes [...] "Seriously Uncool" [...] if a presenter buys one.|$|E

Assistant manager Graham Rodger was promoted to manager. Isaiah Rankin who had a short stay with the club in 2004, was re-signed from Brentford and other signings such as veteran Peter Beagrie and Sheffield United goalkeeper Phil Barnes were brought in. Former Mansfield Town manager Stuart Watkiss was appointed as the club's assistant manager. The Mariners got {{off to a slow start}} and the club's main strike partnership of Rankin and Michael Reddy never got going due to injury woes and Reddy harbouring the desire to play at a higher level. Grimsby found themselves near the foot of the table, and by November the poor start had basically destroyed any chances of promotion. On 6 November 2006 John Fenty sacked Graham Rodger.
