Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the <b>other</b> <b>halogens</b> and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E

25|$|The carbon–fluorine bond {{is one of}} {{the strongest}} in organic {{chemistry}} (an average bond energy around 480 kJ/mol). This is significantly stronger than the bonds of carbon with <b>other</b> <b>halogens</b> (an average bond energy of e.g. C-Cl bond is around 320 kJ/mol) and {{is one of the}} reasons why fluoroorganic compounds have high thermal and chemical stability.|$|E
25|$|The {{elements}} in group 13 are also capable of forming stable compounds with the halogens, usually with the formula MX3 (where M is a boron-group element and X is a halogen.) The only {{exception to this}} is thallium(III) iodide. Fluorine, the first halogen, is able to form stable compounds with every element that has been tested (except neon and helium), and the boron group is no exception. It is even hypothesized that nihonium could form a compound with fluorine, NhF3, before spontaneously decaying due to nihonium's radioactivity. Chlorine also forms stable compounds {{with all of the}} {{elements in}} the boron group, including thallium, and is hypothesized to react with nihonium. All of the elements will react with bromine under the right conditions, as with the <b>other</b> <b>halogens</b> but less vigorously than either chlorine or fluorine. Iodine will react with all natural elements in the periodic table except for the noble gases, and is notable for its explosive reaction with aluminium to form 2AlI3. Astatine, the heaviest halogen, has only formed a few compounds, due to its radioactivity and short half-life, and no reports of a compound with an At–B, –Al, –Ga, –In, –Tl, or –Nh bond have been seen, although scientists think that it should form salts with metals.|$|E

25|$|Another {{factor that}} {{contributes}} to the ability of an acid to lose a proton is the strength of the bond between the acidic hydrogen and the atom that bears it. This, in turn, is dependent {{on the size of the}} atoms sharing the bond. For an acid HA, as the size of atom A increases, the strength of the bond decreases, meaning that it is more easily broken, and the strength of the acid increases. Bond strength is a measure of how much energy it takes to break a bond. In other words, it takes less energy to break the bond as atom A grows larger, and the proton is more easily removed by a base. This partially explains why hydrofluoric acid is considered a weak acid, while the other hydrohalic acids (HCl, HBr, HI) are strong acids. Although fluorine is more electronegative than the <b>other</b> <b>halogens,</b> its atomic radius is also much smaller, so it shares a stronger bond with hydrogen. Moving down a column on the periodic table, atoms become less electronegative but also significantly larger, and the size of the atom tends to dominate its acidity when sharing a bond to hydrogen. Hydrogen sulfide, H2S, is a stronger acid than water, even though oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur. Just as with the halogens, this is because sulfur is larger than oxygen and the H—S bond is more easily broken than the H—O bond.|$|E

500|$|Hydrofluoric acid {{was used}} in glass etching from 1720 onwards.

In 1810, the French physicist André-Marie Ampère suggested that hydrogen and an element analogous to chlorine constituted hydrofluoric acid. Sir Humphry Davy proposed that this then-unknown substance be named fluorine from fluoric acid and the -ine suffix of <b>other</b> <b>halogens.</b> This word, with modifications, is used in most European languages; Greek, Russian, and some others (following Ampère's suggestion) use the name ftor or derivatives, from the Greek φθόριος (phthorios, destructive) [...] The New Latin name fluorum gave the element its current symbol F; Fl {{was used in}} early papers.|$|E

500|$|Iodine is {{the fourth}} halogen, {{being a member of}} group 17 in the {{periodic}} table, below fluorine, chlorine, and bromine; it is the heaviest stable member of its group. (The scarce and fugitive fifth halogen, the radioactive astatine, is not well-studied due to its expense and inaccessibility in large quantities, but appears to show various unusual properties due to relativistic effects.) Iodine has an electron configuration of 4d105s25p5, with the seven electrons in the fifth and outermost shell being its valence electrons. Like the <b>other</b> <b>halogens,</b> it is one electron short of a full octet and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell, although in keeping with periodic trends, it is the weakest oxidising agent among the stable halogens: it has the lowest electronegativity among them, just 2.66 on the Pauling scale (compare fluorine, chlorine, and bromine at 3.98, 3.16, and 2.96 respectively; astatine continues the trend with an electronegativity of 2.2). Elemental iodine hence forms diatomic molecules with chemical formula I2, where two iodine atoms share a pair of electrons in order to each achieve a stable octet for themselves; at high temperatures, these diatomic molecules reversibly dissociate a pair of iodine atoms. Similarly, the iodide anion, I−, is the strongest reducing agent among the stable halogens, being the most easily oxidised back to diatomic I2. (Astatine goes further, being indeed unstable as At− and readily oxidised to At0 or At+, although the existence of At2 is not settled.) ...|$|E
