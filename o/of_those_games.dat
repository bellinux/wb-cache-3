5|$|Archibald Campbell MacLaren (1 December 1871– 17 November 1944) was an English cricketer who captained the England cricket team {{at various}} times between 1898 and 1909.

In 1895, he scored 424 runs in an innings against Somerset which was the highest individual score in first-class cricket until 1923 and remained a record in English cricket until 1994. Opinions were divided over his captaincy. He was a deep thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced, but his pessimism, clashes with the selectors and inability to get the best out of his players led most commentators to rate him a poor leader.|$|E
