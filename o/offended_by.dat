5|$|Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941– August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a {{white woman}} said she was <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> him in her family's grocery store. The {{brutality}} of his murder {{and the fact that}} his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the King and his {{marriage}} came from several directions. Edward's desire to modernise the monarchy {{and make it}} more accessible, though appreciated by many of the public, was distrusted by the British Establishment.

As a result of his involvement in Strauss' election, Ford was elected chair of the Democratic Governors' Conference from 1973 to 1974. He also served as vice-chair of the Conference's Natural Resources and Environmental Management Committee.|$|E

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about deaf sex offenders. This {{descriptive}} study of a population of 41 deaf sex offenders incarcerated by the state of Texas provides information about the prevalence of sexual offenders in the deaf prison population, the educa-tional achievement and IQ scores of deaf offenders, and the in-cidence of secondary disabilities in this population. The rate of sexual <b>offending</b> <b>by</b> deaf offenders was 4 times the rate of sexual <b>offending</b> <b>by</b> hearing offenders with 30 % recidivism in the population. Sexual <b>offending</b> <b>by</b> deaf adults is discussed in relation to the sexual abuse of deaf children. Sixty-two percent of deaf sex offenders were functionally illiterate, a literacy rate considerably below the average for deaf adults who remained in school until age 18 or above. However, the performance IQs of deaf sex offenders were comparable to those of the overall prison population. Little is known about deaf sex offenders. Existing stud-ies have limitations such as small, nonrepresentative samples and samples that come from specialized fa-cilities such as maximum security psychiatric facilities.

5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
5|$|However, Newcastle and his Lieutenant General, Lord Eythin, {{were opposed}} to any pitched battle and {{possibly}} <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> Rupert's high-handed attitude.

Newcastle's soldiers in York then refused to fight unless given their delayed payment, a dispute which Eythin may have fomented. A number were also absent, pillaging the abandoned allied siege works and encampments outside the city, and had yet to return.|$|E

5|$|Scandal {{continued}} to plague Clements as highway commissioner. In March 1960, news broke that the highway department {{was about to}} lease 34 used dump trucks at a very favorable price from Louisville Ford dealer Thurston Cooke, who had served as finance chairman for Combs' gubernatorial campaign. Some charged that this amounted to a political payoff by Clements. Combs, already under fire for appointing Clements, canceled the lease bid on April 19. Clements was <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> this action and considered it a public rebuke. The incident caused a rift between Combs and Clements that never fully healed, although Clements did not resign immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to tour {{in support of}} the album was made before it was even complete. Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason and Wright were completely out of practice, and realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters, and threatened to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs (Mason, separated from his wife, used his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral). Some promoters were <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> Waters' threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in Toronto, selling out within hours.|$|E

5|$|When Edward II {{left the}} country early in 1308 to marry the French king's {{daughter}} Isabella, he appointed Gaveston regent in his place. This was a responsibility that would normally be given to a close family member of the reigning king. There is no sign that Gaveston exploited the regency for personal gains, but the other nobles were still <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> his arrogant behaviour. This behaviour continued at the coronation feast after the King's return, during which the King largely ignored his new wife in favour of Gaveston. The collective grievances first found expression in the so-called 'Boulogne agreement' of January 1308, in which the earls of Warenne, Hereford, Lincoln and Pembroke expressed concern about oppression {{of the people and}} attacks on the honour of the crown. Though not mentioned by name, Gaveston was the implied target of this document. Later that year, in the April parliament, the so-called Declaration of 1308 demanded the renewed exile of Gaveston, again without explicitly mentioning the favourite by name. The King initially resisted, but had to give in to the demand once {{it became clear that the}} barons had the support of King Philip IV of France, who was <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> Edward's treatment of his daughter. On 18 May, Edward consented to sending Gaveston into exile.|$|E

The company also considered a remake of the film starring Clint Eastwood, which eventually evolved into a largely unrelated project by Universal Pictures, Joe Kidd.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that the audience would not be <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> any elementary language, {{but the most important}} parts were clear and easily understood.|$|E

40|$|Two {{hundred and}} three male remanded prisoners were interviewed {{with respect to}} their current offence, mental state, and social and {{psychiatric}} histories. All but nine of the sub-group of 121 psychotic men showed active symptoms at the time of committing a criminal offence; 20 % of the actively ill psychotics were directly driven to <b>offend</b> <b>by</b> their psychotic symptoms, and a further 26 % probably so. If some of the indirect consequences of the psychosis were taken into account, 82 % of their offences were probably attributable to the illness. Among the normal and neurotic men, none claimed psychotic motives for offending, but motives suggesting high emotional arousal such as panic or retaliation triggered the greatest violence. Within the psychotic group, those driven to <b>offend</b> <b>by</b> their delusions were most likely to have been seriously violent, and psychotic symptoms probably accounted directly for most of the very violent behaviour...|$|R

5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds a bowling ball and decides to buy it for her. During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hervik {{said that}} the cartoon {{controversy}} must {{be seen in the}} context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002. Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that Jyllands-Posten and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate. Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews and}} several commentators have {{described it as}} a classic South Park episode. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was viewed by about 2.2 million households during its original broadcast, which at the time was roughly eight times Comedy Central's average viewership. Parker and Stone said they were unhappy with the turkey subplot, which they wrote only because they felt obligated to include a B story. Sally Struthers was reportedly deeply <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> her portrayal in the episode. In addition to Starvin' Marvin, who became a popular minor character, the episode introduced regular characters Kyle's father Gerald Broflovski and Kenny's family members Stuart, Carol and Kevin McCormick.|$|E
50|$|However, {{juvenile}} offending can {{be considered}} to be normative adolescent behavior. This is because most teens tend to <b>offend</b> <b>by</b> committing non-violent crimes, only once or a few times, and only during adolescence. Repeated and/or violent offending is likely to lead to later and more violent offenses. When this happens, the offender often displayed antisocial behavior even before reaching adolescence.|$|R
40|$|<b>Offending</b> <b>by</b> women differs in {{a number}} of {{important}} ways from <b>offending</b> <b>by</b> men: it is less common, less frequent and less serious (Burman 2004; McIvor 2007; Gelb 2010; Schwartz and Steffensmeier 2007)). Women are typically convicted of relatively minor crimes that pose less public risk and, because they are usually convicted of offences that are less serious than those committed by men, they are less likely than men to receive custodial sentences. However, female imprisonment has increased dramatically in many western jurisdictions over the last 15 - 20 years as evidenced by significant increases in the numbers given sentences of imprisonment, in daily female prison populations, and in the rate of imprisonment of women (McIvor 2010). Indeed, in many countries, including Australia, England and Wales, New Zealand, Scotland and the US, the female prison population has increased at a faster rate than the male prison population in recent years (Walmsley 2012) ...|$|R
40|$|Locus {{of control}} has been implicated as an {{important}} construct that is related to treatment outcome for several groups of offenders, including sexual offenders. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to how this construct is related to sexual <b>offending</b> <b>by</b> people with intellectual disabilities. Given this, 41 participants with intellectual disabilities were recruited into three groups: sex offenders who had undergone psychological treatment, sex offenders who had no history of treatment, and nonoffenders. All participants completed measures of locus of control and distorted cognitions. There was a significant difference between those who had and had not completed treatment in terms of cognitive distortions relating to sexual offending. There was no significant difference between the three groups on the measure of locus of control, with all three groups endorsing an external locus of control. Three possible explanations for how locus of control relates to sexual <b>offending</b> <b>by</b> people with intellectual disabilities is explored and discussed...|$|R
