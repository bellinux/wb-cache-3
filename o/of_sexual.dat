From 1978 to 1982, the median age <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> maturity in males declined by 2.5 years from 7.1 to 4.6 years. This resulted in the males becoming sexually mature before females. In 2008, the median age <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> maturity in males had risen to 5.9 years. Females of the species also exhibit low reproductive ability after becoming sexually mature, instead increasing with age and their sexual maturity has varied {{to a lesser extent}} then the male population across the years.|$|E

Results suggests quality <b>of</b> couples <b>sexual</b> communication {{was positively related to}} frequency <b>of</b> parent-child <b>sexual</b> communication and negatively related to quality <b>of</b> parent-child <b>sexual</b> communication.

40|$|In 20 {{colonies of}} Apis cerana in {{northern}} Vietnam, colony growth, production of drones and queens (sexuals), and swarming and supersedure {{were related to}} available flower forage and climate. Despite the tropical setting of the study with year-round forage, production <b>of</b> <b>sexuals</b> was restricted to two periods from March to July and from September to December. Most swarming occurred in May when forage was most abundant. Positive correlations between available forage, colony growth, and production <b>of</b> <b>sexuals</b> suggest that the synchronized production of drones and queens is defined by nutrient flow into the colony. If flow is high, the colony starts growing; when the colony is large enough drones and queens are produced, and eventually the colony swarms. Production <b>of</b> <b>sexuals</b> is synchronized because foraging conditions are sufficient to allow growth for {{only part of the}} year. Patterns in drone and queen rearing by A. cerana are similar to patterns found in Apis mellifera. Variation may reflect differences in environment and between specie...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The article {{consists}} of six sections written by separate authors that review female genital anatomy, the physiology <b>of</b> female <b>sexual</b> function, and the pathophysiology <b>of</b> female <b>sexual</b> dysfunction but excluding hormonal aspects. Aim: To review the physiology <b>of</b> female <b>sexual</b> function and the pathophysiology <b>of</b> female <b>sexual</b> dysfunction especially since 2010 {{and to make}} specific recommendations according to the Oxford Centre for evidence based medicine (2009) "levels of evidence" wherever relevant. Conclusion: Recommendations were made for particular studies to be undertaken especially in controversial aspects in all six sections of the reviewed topics. Despite numerous laboratory assessments <b>of</b> female <b>sexual</b> function, genital assessments alone appear insufficient to characterise fully the complete sexual response.
