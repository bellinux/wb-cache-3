5|$|Euan MacKie has {{supported}} Thom's analysis, {{to which he}} added an archaeological context by comparing Neolithic Britain to the Mayan civilization to argue for a stratified society in this period. To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. Kintraw is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed {{that this was a}} foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on Jura. This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at Maes Howe and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> Barrow Lozenge led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.|$|E

25|$|USC Drift was a United States Coast Survey {{schooner}} {{built in}} 1876 specifically to anchor in offshore waters to undertake current measurements.

25|$|Despite the growth, {{the area}} was still {{isolated}} and access was restricted to a wagon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> track from Gosford or by a ferry from Wyong. The area was popular among fishermen and prior to 1908 the majority of boats that travelled to The Entrance used Tuggerah Jetty, the remains of which, still exists {{on the shore of}} Tuggerah Lake between the entrances to Wyong River and Ourimbah Creek. When Wyong River was dredged in 1908, the boats would take their catch into Wyong.|$|E
25|$|During the Reagan Administration, Caputo helped {{support the}} president's agenda in Central America. He worked with Oliver North to foment {{propaganda}} {{as part of}} Reagan's public relations efforts in South America and in Central America. After his work for the Reagan Administration, he worked for President George H.W. Bush for his campaign in the 1992 United States presidential election. His position was director of media services on the 1992 Bush campaign. Prior to his work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> campaign, he served the United States House of Representatives as {{assistant director of the}} Radio and Television Correspondents' Association.|$|E
25|$|Zelikow was {{appointed}} {{executive director of the}} 9/11 Commission, whose work included examination of the conduct of presidents Clinton and George W. Bush and their administrations. Zelikow's prior involvement with the administration of George W. Bush led to opposition from the 9/11 Family Steering Committee, citing the obvious conflict of interest of having previously worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> transition team. The Commission's Republican chair and Democratic vice—chair strongly defended Zelikow, both at the time and later. In response to the concerns, Zelikow had agreed to recuse himself from any investigation matters pertaining to the National Security Council's transition from the Clinton to Bush administrations, which Zelikow had helped manage.|$|E

25|$|On February 1, McCain won a 49–30% {{victory over}} Bush in the New Hampshire primary. Gary Bauer dropped out. After coming in third in Delaware Forbes dropped out, leaving three candidates. In the South Carolina primary, Bush soundly {{defeated}} McCain. Some McCain supporters blamed it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> campaign, {{accusing them of}} mudslinging and dirty tricks, such as push polling that implied that McCain's adopted Bangladeshi-born daughter was an African-American child he fathered out of wedlock. While McCain's loss in South Carolina damaged his campaign, he won both Michigan and {{his home state of}} Arizona on February 22. The primary election that year also affected the South Carolina State House, when a controversy about the Confederate flag flying over the capitol dome prompted the state legislature to move the flag to a less prominent position at a Civil War memorial on the capitol grounds. Most GOP candidates said the issue should be left to South Carolina voters, though McCain later recanted and said the flag should be removed.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{embarked}} on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as [...] "Conversations on Social Security", {{in an attempt to}} gain public support. Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda. The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from Hurricane Katrina. After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress {{as a result of the}} 2006 midterm elections, there was no prospect of further congressional action <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> proposal for the remainder of his term in office.|$|E
500|$|While Mayor Corning {{supported}} the largest purchases of Pine Bush land {{as a city}} preserve, he also approved placing the Albany landfill in the Pine Bush, {{the construction of the}} Washington Avenue Extension, and authorizing much of the development that occurred during his 42 years in office as mayor. These all had adverse environmental effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush.</b> In 1967, a portion of Albany's waterworks/Pine Bush property in the town of Colonie along Central Avenue was sold to developers who built the Northway Mall. Two years later the city moved its dump to the Pine Bush. The Dunes, a single-family housing development {{in the middle of the}} Pine Bush off the Washington Avenue Extension, was built in the mid-1970s.|$|E
60|$|The head of {{the valley}} had that half-tamed, ancient aspect that {{reminded}} me of the Romans. I could only expect the Roman legions to be encamped down there; and the white goats feeding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> belonged to a Roman camp.|$|R
50|$|A linear bushing is {{not usually}} pressed into a housing, but rather secured with a radial feature. Two such {{examples}} include two retaining rings, or a ring that is molded onto the OD of <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> that matches with a groove in the housing. This is usually a more durable way to retain <b>the</b> <b>bushing,</b> because <b>the</b> forces acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> could press it out.|$|R

500|$|While Rage Against the Machine's {{music was}} {{politically}} influenced, Audioslave's music was mostly not. Cornell stated {{he did not}} want to become the new singer of Rage Against the Machine or any political band, but he would play benefits the other band members wanted to play. Despite his reluctance to write political lyrics, he himself never discounted the possibility; he already touched upon political issues in Audioslaves [...] "Set It Off"—a song inspired by 1999's WTO riots (the [...] "Battle of Seattle")—then later wrote an anti-war song, [...] "Sound of a Gun," [...] and what Morello called [...] "the most political song Audioslave's ever written," [...] "Wide Awake" [...] for Revelations. [...] "Wide Awake" [...] was an attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration's perceived failures over the consequences of Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

2500|$|Waiting for the Barbarians, {{an opera}} from J. M. Coetzee's novel (with the {{libretto}} by Christopher Hampton), had its premiere performance in September 2005. Glass defined {{the work as}} a [...] "social/political opera", as a critique <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration's war in Iraq, a [...] "dialogue about political crisis", and an illustration of the [...] "power of art to turn our attention toward the human dimension of history". While the opera's themes are Imperialism, apartheid, and torture, the composer chose an understated approach by using [...] "very simple means, and the orchestration is very clear and very traditional; it's almost classical in sound", as the conductor D. Russell Davies notes.|$|E
2500|$|The September 11 Attacks in the United States led to {{demands from}} the public that US {{president}} George Bush take actions that would prevent further attacks. This pressure led to {{the launch of the}} War on Terror. The fact that the perceived enemies in the War on Terror were stateless individuals, and the perceived threat of extreme strategies including suicide bombing, led to a pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration to act decisively. In addition, these tactics created the perception that the [...] "legitimate" [...] techniques used in the cold war would not be of much use. US vice-president Dick Cheney stated, for example, that the US [...] " [...] to work sort of on the dark side", and that it had to [...] "use any means at [...] disposal".|$|E

2500|$|On the {{edition of}} 27 October 2006 of Real Time with Bill Maher, he {{described}} conservatives and Republicans {{who refused to}} admit they had been wrong to support the Iraq War as [...] "cowards." [...] On 26 February 2008, he wrote on his blog: [...] "After 9/11, I was clearly blinded by fear of al Qaeda and deluded by the overwhelming military superiority of the US and the ease of democratic transitions in Eastern Europe into thinking we could simply fight our way to victory against Islamist terror. I wasn't alone. But I was surely wrong." [...] His reversal on the Iraq issue and his increasing attacks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration caused a severe backlash from many hawkish conservatives, who accused him of not being a [...] "real" [...] conservative.|$|E
2500|$|The Bush Doctrine {{resulted}} in criticism and controversy. [...] Peter D. Feaver, who worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> national security strategy {{as a staff}} member on the National Security Council, said he has counted {{as many as seven}} distinct Bush doctrines. One of the drafters of the National Security Strategy of the United States, which is commonly mistakenly referred to as the [...] "Bush Doctrine," [...] demurred at investing the statement with too much weight. [...] "I actually never thought there was a Bush doctrine," [...] said Philip D. Zelikow, who later served as State Department counselor under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. [...] "Indeed, I believe the assertion {{that there is such a}} doctrine lends greater coherence to the administration's policies than they deserve." [...] Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, said he thought there was no [...] "single piece of paper" [...] that represents the Bush doctrine.|$|E
2500|$|During George W. Bush's first term, {{the blog}} {{frequently}} discussed {{foreign policy and}} was especially critical of administration policy towards Iraq and North Korea. After the 2004 election, posts began to focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration's proposal to privatize Social Security. In addition to criticizing {{the substance of the}} proposals, Marshall argued that a unified front in the Democratic Party would deny Republicans political cover and force a loss for them on Social Security. Talking Points Memo closely tracked the positions of members of Congress on the issue throughout 2005. It asked readers to monitor local media for comments from their own members of congress, and public categories were created for politicians on this issue: wavering Democrats were the [...] "Faint-hearted Faction" [...] and Republicans who doubted the President's plan were the [...] "Conscience Caucus". [...] Marshall also coined the term [...] "Bamboozlepalooza", in reference to President Bush's 60-day (it was extended) tour promoting social security privatization. Other terms that Marshall has coined while criticizing the Bush administration include [...] "Up-is-downism" [...] and [...] "Mumbojumbocrats".|$|E
