This experiment was first performed successfully in France On May 10, 1752, and later repeated several more times throughout Europe. Franklin proved by this sentry-box experiment that lightning and electricity were one and the same.|$|E

An initial delivery of 62 SBs was made in September–October 1937, with combat operations by Soviet forces starting in December with attacks on Japanese ships on the Yangtze River.

The Yongle Emperor laid <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and extensive plan to strengthen and stabilise the new economy, but first he had to silence dissension. He created an elaborate system of censors to remove corrupt officials from office that spread such rumors. The emperor dispatched some of his most trusted officers to reveal or destroy secret societies, bandits, and loyalists to his other relatives. To strengthen the economy, he fought population decline by reclaiming land, utilising the most he could from the existing labour force, and maximising textile and agricultural production.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the last}} couple of years he has been honing his craft as a record producer, putting <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> array of music {{projects}} along the way. His goal has been to spearhead the EDM movement in Africa while at the same time doing his part in spreading the gospel of Afro beats music to the rest of the world. Therefore, his mash-ups and remixes infuse both contemporary African rhythms and vocals with the piercing synth sounds of electronic dance music giving birth to a completely new refreshing high. His productions however, though geared towards certain genres still remain highly experimental, reminiscent of early Diplo. His mash-up series “Mash-Up Mondays” where he releases a brand new mash-up every Monday is currently hosted on The Beat 99.9 FM radio station during the Morning Rush show.|$|E
25|$|Mussolini {{had sought}} to delay a major war in Europe until at least 1942, but Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. This {{resulted}} in declarations of war by France and the UK {{and the start of}} World War II. On 10 June 1940—with the Fall of France imminent—Italy officially entered the war on the side of Germany, though he was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity and resources to carry <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> war with the British Empire. Mussolini believed that after the imminent French armistice, Italy could gain territorial concessions from France and then he could concentrate his forces on a major offensive in North Africa, where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. However, the UK government refused to accept proposals for a peace that would involve accepting Axis victories in Eastern and Western Europe, plans for an invasion of the UK did not proceed and the war continued. In the summer of 1941, Mussolini sent Italian forces to participate in the invasion of the Soviet Union and war with the United States followed in December.|$|E

25|$|The {{invasion}} of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual {{declaration of war}} against Germany that was deemed the aggressor {{in the war in}} Poland, resulting in the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II {{on the side of the}} Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> war with France or the United Kingdom and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from the German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse. Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in Egypt where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the Battle of Britain. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. The war became prolonged—contrary to Mussolini's plans—resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance.|$|E
25|$|In 1490 he {{received}} his Doctorate in Theology, though he never made any original contribution to Theology. He just {{was not interested in}} this abstract speculation. Indeed, in the disputations that he is recorded as having carried out, with other University Doctors, he always comes off second best. He was more interested in the practical means of salvation—in his terms, a return to poverty and complete self-denial—and these he preached, in a Flemish accent, but in powerful French. He followed the rule of Francis of Paola very strictly and preached that all priests and monks should do so too. By 1493, there were 80 students at the College. They only left when they went to a monastery or to become a parish priest. Standonck hoped by this means to reform the church. In the same year, the King had set up a Commission to examine abuses in the church and he was asked to give a lecture to them, which he did on 12 November at Tours. In this he set <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> list of demands. Most of these were familiar to church reformers—only fit and proper persons should be priests, there should be no money charged for their services, or for accepting a post. There should be free election (by fit and proper priests) of their bishops, or monks of their abbots, and all other religious positions (including teachers at the University). He added demands that the priests and monks should lead exemplary lives. This meant his by now well known strictly ascetic life—including enforcing celibacy among the clergy.|$|E

It was later passed into formal law by the Long Parliament in 1641 and became one of the three constitutional documents of English civil liberties, along with the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689.|$|E
