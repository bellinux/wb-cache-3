25|$|While the CRIME {{attack was}} {{presented}} as a general attack that could work effectively against {{a large number of}} protocols, including but not limited to TLS, and application-layer protocols such as SPDY <b>or</b> <b>HTTP,</b> only exploits against TLS and SPDY were demonstrated and largely mitigated in browsers and servers. The CRIME exploit against HTTP compression has not been mitigated at all, even though the authors of CRIME have warned that this vulnerability might be even more widespread than SPDY and TLS compression combined. In 2013 a new instance of the CRIME attack against HTTP compression, dubbed BREACH, was announced. Based on the CRIME attack a BREACH attack can extract login tokens, email addresses or other sensitive information from TLS encrypted web traffic in as little as 30 seconds (depending on the number of bytes to be extracted), provided the attacker tricks the victim into visiting a malicious web link or is able to inject content into valid pages the user is visiting (ex: a wireless network {{under the control of the}} attacker). All versions of TLS and SSL are at risk from BREACH regardless of the encryption algorithm or cipher used. Unlike previous instances of CRIME, which can be successfully defended against by turning off TLS compression or SPDY header compression, BREACH exploits HTTP compression which cannot realistically be turned off, as virtually all web servers rely upon it to improve data transmission speeds for users. This is a known limitation of TLS as it is susceptible to chosen-plaintext attack against the application-layer data it was meant to protect.|$|E
2500|$|The terms Internet and World Wide Web {{are often}} used interchangeably in {{everyday}} speech; {{it is common to}} speak of [...] "going on the Internet" [...] when using a web browser to view web pages. However, the World Wide Web or the Web is only one {{of a large number of}} Internet services. The Web is a collection of interconnected documents (web pages) and other web resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs. As another point of comparison, Hypertext Transfer Protocol, <b>or</b> <b>HTTP,</b> is the language used on the Web for information transfer, yet it is just one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet. The term [...] is a portmanteau of Internet and World Wide Web typically used sarcastically to parody a technically unsavvy user.|$|E

5|$|However, in non-technical {{contexts}} and in {{software for the}} World Wide Web, the term URL remains widely used. Additionally, the term web address (which has no formal definition) often occurs in non-technical publications as a synonym for a URI that uses the scheme <b>http</b> <b>or</b> <b>https.</b> Such assumptions can lead to confusion, for example {{in the case of}} XML namespaces, which have a visual similarity to resolvable URIs.|$|R
