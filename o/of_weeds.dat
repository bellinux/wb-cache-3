Treatments consisted of different times <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> control beginnings (20, 30, 40, and 50 days after corn emergence), different duration <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> control periods (10, 20, and 30 days), a weedy check, and a weed-free check {{during the period of}} corn growth.

40|$|A {{concept of}} {{critical}} period <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> competition {{has been introduced}} for more than 40 years ago. The concept {{is based on the}} assumption that weeds are not equally harmful to a crop during the whole season and that there is a period in crop development in which weeds impact on the yield is the biggest. This period is called critical period <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> competition (CPWC), critical period <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> interference, or critical period <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> control. There is a difference in CPWC between crops, but CPWC for a certain crop can vary a lot because it depends on many factors which can affect the crop or weeds competition ability.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Weed {{resistance}} is usually diagnosed after a weed control practice has lost efficacy and weed populations begin to increase rapidly. Prediction and validation {{in the field}} {{at a very early}} stage of resistance development is a promising method for preventing an uncontrollable problem. Pattern-thinking helped individuals connect their experience <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> infestations with development <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> resistance. Field representatives connected early verification with immediate management to reduce the potential problem <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> resistance. A method for rapid detection <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> resistance by microcalorimetry was developed to distinguish between herbicide resistant and susceptible biotypes. This general method was used to test three different weed species and three different herbicide modes of action. Heat evolution as a product of plant respiration by samples of meristematic tissue was compared between resistant and susceptible biotypes. The procedure readily distinguished between biotypes. Since microcalorimetry provided quick and accurate results, all field representatives stated that the combination of pattern-thinking and rapid assay would improve management <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> resistant populations. The combination would improve visual detection based on the standard growth and development model for weed resistance and population growth. Also, biological verification using microcalorimetry provides immediate feedback and validation <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> resistance. Thus, early detection <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> {{resistance is}} a very important tool which will assist farmers in dynamically managing weed infestations...|$|R

40|$|To further {{understand}} the importance of row spacing as an agronomic practice, a study was conducted to evaluate how levels of row spacing determines the critical period <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> control (CPWC) in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). The experiment was laid out as a split-plot design with eight periods <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> interference as the main plots and three row spacing (60, 75 90 cm) as the subplots with three replications of each treatment combination. Period <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> interference consisted <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> removal for 14, 35, 54, and 77 days after emergence (DAE), and weed infestation for 14, 35, 54, and 77 DAE. Results indicated that the mean yield of cowpea was higher at narrow spacing (60 cm) than at wide spacing (90 cm) under season-long weed infestation plots but no difference in yield was found among the row spacing in the season-long weed removal plots. There was no difference {{in the beginning of the}} CPWC among the row spacing. However, 90 cm row spacing requires longer period <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> removal to avoid unacceptable yield loss when compared to 60 cm row spacing. The end of the CPWC coincides with the period of canopy closure by the crop. This finding suggests that it took the crop longer time to close canopy at wide row spacing (90 cm) compare to reduced row spacing. The differences in the duration <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> control intervention in crop row spacing suggest the importance of integrating decisions regarding row spacing and period <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> control in weed management strategies...|$|R

25|$|Wastewater {{may contain}} {{high levels of}} the {{nutrients}} nitrogen and phosphorus.

This may cause an algal bloom, a rapid growth in the population of algae. The algae numbers are unsustainable and eventually most of them die. The decomposition of the algae by bacteria uses up so much of the oxygen in the water that most or all of the animals die, which creates more organic matter for the bacteria to decompose. In addition to causing deoxygenation, some algal species produce toxins that contaminate drinking water supplies. Different treatment processes are required to remove nitrogen and phosphorus.|$|E
25|$|The open {{canopy of}} cumin is another problem. Only a low {{proportion}} of the incoming light is absorbed. The leaf area index (LAI) of cumin is low (about 1.5). This might be a problem because weeds can compete with cumin for essential resources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. The slow growth and a short stature of cumin favours weed competition additionally. Two hoeing and weeding sessions (30 and 60 days after sowing) are needed for the control <b>of</b> <b>weeds.</b> During the first weeding session (30 days after sowing), thinning should be done, as well, to remove excess plants. The use of preplant or pre-emergence herbicides is very effective in India, but this kind of herbicide application requires soil moisture for a successful weed control.|$|E
