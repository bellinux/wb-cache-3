The text which due to the topic tends to descriptiveness, points out also some vagueness and dubiousness of objektive legislation as well as it's plausible solutions offered by <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> courts. In my opinion this topic is very topical and established at the same time. Also the private legal status of many subjects, especially but not exclusively <b>the</b> owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>estates,</b> is affected by <b>the</b> matter <b>of</b> proprietary registration. <b>The</b> thesis consists <b>of</b> six chapters.

5|$|By the 1990s {{crime rates}} started to drop {{dramatically}} due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic {{and its associated}} drug-related violence came under greater control. The outflow of population turned around, as the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel the growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in Manhattan's economy.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, New York's {{metropolitan}} area surpassed London's as the world's most populous {{metropolitan area}}. New York City's metropolitan area exceeded ten {{million by the}} early 1930s. The economic boom of the 1920s and the great speculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market fostered {{a new wave of}} skyscraper projects in the city. The 1916 Zoning Resolution restricted the height that the street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings could rise before they needed to incorporate setbacks that recessed the buildings' exterior walls away from the streets. This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant setbacks, large volumes, and striking silhouettes that were often decorated elaborately.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{building}} skyscrapers became more sophisticated, starting with the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> needed for the site. Brokers working on commission would secretly acquire the individual lots of land required for a project, operating {{under a variety of}} names to avoid having the price increase once a planned build became known. The properties {{at the front of the}} site would typically be bought first, so if news broke of the skyscraper then those owning property at the back of the plot would have little choice but to sell anyway. The funding for skyscraper developments was normally lent by banks, insurance companies, or raised through bonds sold through a specialised bond house, with the latter becoming increasingly popular after World War I.|$|E

5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire land from the proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but their {{attempts}} to set in motion the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, {{many of the}} proprietors pulled out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market and voluntarily sold their property to the government so that sale to the land's occupiers could be facilitated. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation. One {{of the terms of}} the Island joining the Confederation was the sale of the estates of land to their occupiers. The agreement to join the Confederation contained a clause outlining the possibility that the federal government of Canada could provide a grant of up to CA$800,000 to the provincial government to facilitate the purchase of the land from the proprietors. In 1875, through 'The Commissioners Appointed Under The Provisions of The Land Purchase Act, 1875' all of the outstanding proprietor-owned land was compulsorily purchased by the provincial government, at rates decided by a 'Commission of Enquiry'.|$|E

25|$|Real estate trade groups, in response, {{claim that}} the {{abatement}} program makes it feasible to build residential housing in the first place. John Banks, president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> Board of New York, claimed that the high construction costs, expensive land, and tax increases would make construction unfeasible without the tax break. One developer also claimed {{that they would be}} more likely to construct condos instead of rentals without the tax abatement because the differential would make condos comparably more profitable. The developer claimed that affordable rental units would take a hit without the 421-a program.|$|E
