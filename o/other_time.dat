5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance {{north of the}} Bahamas showed signs of having a well-defined surface circulation and sufficient wind velocity, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tammy at 7:30a.m. EDT (1130 UTC) October 5 east of Florida, skipping tropical depression status. This marked {{only the second time}} that the 'T' name has been used to name an Atlantic storm since alphabetical naming began in 1950; the <b>other</b> <b>time</b> was for Tanya in 1995 (later on there would be Tomas in 2010 and Tony in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Fausto's {{regeneration}} {{north of}} Hawaii was unusual but not unprecedented. The <b>other</b> <b>time</b> this happened since 1966 {{was in the}} 1975 season. That time, another TUTT absorbed the remnant of Hurricane Ilsa, {{which led to the}} formation of an unnamed hurricane at high latitude. Other tropical cyclones have strengthened north of Hawaii, but the actual formation of one is rare.|$|E
5|$|Ostracods, a {{class of}} small {{crustaceans}} that were prevalent in the upper Maastrichtian, left fossil deposits {{in a variety of}} locations. A review of these fossils shows that ostracod diversity was lower in the Paleocene than any <b>other</b> <b>time</b> in the Cenozoic. Current research cannot ascertain, however, whether the extinctions occurred prior to, or during, the boundary interval.|$|E

5|$|The name {{of local}} time {{typically}} changes when DST is observed. American English replaces standard with daylight: for example, Pacific Standard Time (PST) becomes Pacific Daylight Time (PDT). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is British Summer Time (BST), and British English typically inserts summer into <b>other</b> <b>time</b> zone names, e.g. Central European Time (CET) becomes Central European Summer Time (CEST).|$|E
5|$|The {{truth is}} that Puerto Rican liberal {{interests}} benefited directly from the Cánovas assassination, since by Cánovas' death a pact made (previous to the event) between the new Spanish prime minister, Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, and Puerto Rican liberals headed by Luis Muñoz Rivera would come into effect soon after. It allowed {{the establishment of a}} new autonomy charter for the island territory, which gave Puerto Rico broader political powers than at any <b>other</b> <b>time</b> before or since.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{as active}} in routine business, Johnson still took an {{interest}} in political events. For example, he spearheaded the efforts of the booksellers of London and Westminster to appeal a new copyright law in 1808. Moreover, although Johnson did not publish controversial political works after his imprisonment, he still undertook important publishing ventures. For example, he administered the publication of a forty-five volume work entitled The British Essayists, edited by Alexander Chalmers; the complete works of Samuel Johnson; and a ten-volume set of Shakespeare. Johnson published in more congers during the last decade of his life than at any <b>other</b> <b>time.</b> He also occasionally published important new authors, such as the political economist Thomas Malthus, whose Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) sparked a long debate between idealists and pragmatists. His emphasis on educational books continued or even increased as his interest in publishing contentious political works diminished. He also continued to support his friends, as with Godwin, who needed financial rescue after his play, Faulkener, cost him £800.|$|E

5|$|As Benaud's deputy, Harvey helped {{materially}} in Australia's surprise 4–0 series {{victory to}} reclaim the Ashes. Harvey's form was modest, though. He scored 296 runs at 42.29, {{with more than half}} coming in one innings—a brilliant 167 in the Second Test at Melbourne, more than half his team's 308, which helped secure an eight wicket victory in the match. Otherwise, a 41 in the Fourth Test was the only <b>other</b> <b>time</b> he passed 25 in the series. Outside the Tests, he scored 92 in the second match of the season between New South Wales and England, and ended the season with 949 runs at 49.95. It was season of two-halves; in the latter two months, he scored only 339 runs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the {{following}} season, McCabe appeared with the New South Wales Colts team in one match against Queensland, before being selected for the New South Wales Second XI to play their Victorian counterparts. McCabe scored 60 not out in the second innings and took a total of 6/100 for the match. He was selected to represent New South Wales in his first-class debut against Queensland in the 192829 Sheffield Shield season while the Test players competed against England. He made 60 and 34, and bowled 17 overs without success, but was later omitted when the Test players returned from international duty. In four first-class matches in his debut season, McCabe scored 197 runs at 32.83 and took a total of 1/111. McCabe played twice against the touring England cricket team led by Percy Chapman, once in a match at Goulburn for the Southern Districts of New South Wales, and the <b>other</b> <b>time</b> for his state, but managed only 24 runs in three innings.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Trigger {{takes place}} in a world {{familiar}} to Earth, with eras such as the prehistoric age, in which primitive humans and dinosaurs share the earth; the Middle Ages, replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the post-apocalyptic future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently travel through time to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year ∞), which serves as a hub to travel back to <b>other</b> <b>time</b> periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the Wings of Time, nicknamed the Epoch. The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.|$|E

5|$|Favre {{spent his}} early adult years among the natives along the Tombigbee River, being {{initially}} {{employed by the}} French as an interpreter of the Choctaw language, but soon coming into the employ of the British and later the Spanish. Favre also understood the Chickasaw language, but at one point his translation was challenged by James Colbert (grandfather of Holmes Colbert), who had married into the Chickasaw tribe, replaced Favre as interpreter. which {{was not a problem}} earlier for Spain during the Treaty of Natchez in 1793, nor at any <b>other</b> <b>time</b> in the long history of his duties for France. Favre was said to be a confidante and personal friend of the celebrated Choctaw Indian chief Pushmataha. Genealogist Heitzmann relates that at one point Favre acted as the interpreter between Pushmataha and the military commanders Andrew Jackson and General Thomas Hinds.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Orange Bowl had {{the fourth}} and sixth {{selections}} from eligible Bowl Alliance teams. The Sugar Bowl had the top two picks, while the Fiesta Bowl, which had the top picks in 1995, received the third and fifth picks. Due to Bowl Alliance restrictions, the Orange Bowl {{at the end of}} the 1996 season had to be played on December 31, marking the first time in the history of the Orange Bowl that the game was not played in January and that there were two Orange Bowls in the same year—one {{at the end of the}} 1995 season, and the other at the conclusion of the 1996 season. The only <b>other</b> <b>time</b> was in 2014, the first year of the college football playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{the horse}} {{population}} of Finland vastly diminished in both numbers and quality. At {{the beginning of}} the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry was larger than at any <b>other</b> <b>time</b> in history, and almost every usable horse of Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan Jennings was {{the first}} Governor to have an {{attempted}} impeachment brought against him {{in response to his}} actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The evidence of his role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped. The only <b>other</b> <b>time</b> was when the General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor James B.

5|$|Meanwhile, in 1942 the Australian {{military}} {{was reinforced by}} units recalled from the Middle East and {{an expansion of the}} Militia and RAAF. United States military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea, and in April 1942 command of Australian and US forces in the South West Pacific was consolidated under an American commander, General Douglas MacArthur. After halting the Japanese the Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942, with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943. From 1944 the Australian {{military was}} mainly relegated to subsidiary roles in holding or mopping-up operations, but continued to conduct large-scale operations {{until the end of the}} war with a larger proportion of its forces deployed in the final months of the conflict than at any <b>other</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Naval Academy {{would not}} produce another {{football}} team until the 1882 season. The 1882 {{team would be}} the first with a coach, being supported by Academy officials. The 1879 season was the last time that a Navy squad would play the Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14–12–2, with one of those ties being the game against the Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy would outscore their opponents 292–231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54–19–3. The lack of a coach for the 1879 season was one of the two times the Naval Academy squad lacked one, the <b>other</b> <b>time</b> being from 1883 through 1891.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{had always}} won the 4100m medley relay since the event's {{inception}} at the Olympics in 1960 with comfortable margins.

In the five previous times the event had been contested, Australia's best result had come in the inaugural race in Rome, where the team of David Theile, Terry Gathercole, Neville Hayes and Geoff Shipton out-touched Japan to claim silver. The only <b>other</b> <b>time</b> that Australia had won a medal was in Tokyo in 1964, when Peter Reynolds, Ian O'Brien, Kevin Berry and David Dickson finished behind the United States and Germany. The following two Games saw a fourth placing and an elimination in the heats. The previous outing in 1976 in Montreal had seen Australia come sixth.
