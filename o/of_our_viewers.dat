40|$|There exist many viewers for single-modal medical {{images that}} are {{efficient}} and are equipped with powerful analysis tools. However, there is a distinct lack of efficient image viewers for multi-modality images, particularly for displaying multiple follow-up studies that depict a patient's response to treatment over time. Such viewers {{would be required to}} display large amounts of image data. In this study, we present the TAGIGEN viewer - a web-based image viewer designed specifically for the visualisation of multi-modality follow-up studies. We innovate by defining a series of dynamically generated image grid layouts that display sets of related images together in order to improve the ability to compare and assimilate the myriad images. We adopted a web-based client-server image streaming technology, thus enabling interactive navigation of the images in a computationally efficient manner. Furthermore, our web-based approach is interoperable and requires no software installation. We evaluated the ability <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>viewer</b> in displaying and understanding a patient's follow-up images in a case study with combined positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) follow-up scans. We conducted a usability survey on 10 participants to measure the usefulness <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>viewer,</b> used as an outpatient viewer e. g. viewer designed for use by the patients, in tracking a patient's disease state across four PET-CT studies.

5000|$|The channel's {{emphasis}} on archive programming caused considerable annoyance to many British expatriate viewers, who had much preferred {{the mix of}} BBC One and Two previously offered by BBC TV Europe and BBC World Service Television.

5000|$|When {{the music}} video of [...] "All the Things She Said" [...] was {{released}} in August 2002, it created an immediate media storm due to the lesbian kiss between the members.

Media outlets, including MuchMusic, FHM Music TV, Virgin Media and The Guardian have regarded it as either a [...] "sexy" [...] or [...] "controversial" [...] music video. William Leith, a publicist from The Guardian, published a separate article on how lesbianism never fails to appeal upon men. Leith commented; [...] "the BBC ban on tATu's video, the fact that their manager, Ivan Shapovalov, has said some dodgy things about his marketing strategies, and that Richard and Judy have advised people not to buy the record. But the thing that really starts the conversation going is the mention of lesbianism." [...] He revealed that [...] "So, here we go again. Lesbians! Phwoar! Eyebrows are raised. Sly grins are exchanged. The subject, clearly, is fascinating to us. We approve of it." [...] It caused massive petitions to ban the single in the United Kingdom, with TV presenters Richard and Judy to back this, accusing the record label to create a lesbianism imagery. They stated that [...] "We are being told that these girls actually have underage lesbian sex in real life and we are being told by their manager that he spotted a gap in the market - a paedophile gap in the market ... That's sick and it's wrong and personally I think Polydor should not be selling the record in this country. I think they should ban it, I think radio stations should take it upon themselves to ban it. This is going way too far. I think people should boycott the song and 90% <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>viewers</b> have said they will." [...] His wife, who supported the cause, did not find the song itself or the girls the problems, but the marketing scheme. BBC, who reacted to the scheme, did not ban the video or music.After their manager admitted to portraying the girls as lesbians to market their music and aimed t.A.T.u. to create a sexual imagery for men who enjoy pornography, media outlets had criticized him and t.A.T.u.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of {{scientific}} computing, the computational steering consists in the coupling of numerical simulations with 3 D visualization systems through the network. This allows scientists to monitor online the intermediate results of their computations in a more interactive way than the batch mode, and allows them to modify the simulation parameters on-the-fly. While most of existing computational steering environments support parallel simulations, they are often limited to sequential visualization systems. This may lead to an important bottleneck and increased rendering time. To achieve the required performance for online visualization, we have designed the EPSN framework, a computational steering environment that enables to interconnect legacy parallel simulations with parallel visualization systems. For this, we have introduced a redistribution algorithm for unstructured data, that is well adapted to {{the context of}} M × N computational steering.

40|$|Despite {{improvements}} in automatic processing, analysts are still {{faced with the}} task of evaluating gigapixel-scale mosaics or images acquired by telescopes such as Pan-STARRS 1. Displaying such images in "ideal" form is a major challenge even today, and the amount of data will only increase as sensor resolutions improve. In our opinion, the ideal viewer has several key characteristics. Lossless display - down to individual pixels - ensures all information can be extracted from the image. Support for all relevant pixel formats (integer or floating point) allows displaying data from different sensors. Smooth zooming and panning in the high-resolution data enables rapid screening and navigation in the image. High responsiveness to input commands avoids frustrating delays. Instantaneous image enhancement, e. g. contrast adjustment and image channel selection, helps with analysis tasks. Modest system requirements allow viewing on regular workstation computers or even laptops. To the best <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge, no such software product is currently available. Meeting these goals requires addressing certain realities of current computer architectures. GPU hardware accelerates rendering and allows smooth zooming without high CPU load. Programmable GPU shaders enable instant channel selection and contrast adjustment without any perceptible slowdown or changes to the input data. Relatively low disk transfer speeds suggest the use of compression to decrease the amount of data to transfer. Asynchronous I/O allows decompressing while waiting for previous I/O operations to complete. The slow seek times of magnetic disks motivate optimizing the order of the data on disk. Vectorization and parallelization allow significant increases in computational capacity. Limited memory requires streaming and caching of image regions. We develop a viewer that takes the above issues into account. Its awareness of the computer architecture enables previously unattainable features such as smooth zooming and image enhancement within high-resolution data. We describe our implementation, disclosing its novel file format and lossless image codec whose decompression is faster than copying the raw data in memory. Both provide crucial performance boosts compared to conventional approaches. Usability tests demonstrate the suitability <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>viewer</b> for rapid analysis of large SAR datasets, multispectral satellite imagery and mosaics...|$|R

In contrast, an “implicit ” advertisement includes pictures and text neither of which are directly related to the product. In two experiments, eye movements were measured during the viewing of advertisements containing a large pictorial element, a headline and a fictitious product name. Items targeting on identical products were designed in an explicit and an implicit version. Participants were asked to view the stimuli item-by-item in preparation for an evaluation on scales of valence and interestingness or for a short paraphrasing of ad content. In support <b>of</b> <b>our</b> hypothesis, <b>viewers</b> spent significantly more time on implicit advertisements and also rated them as more positive and interesting.
