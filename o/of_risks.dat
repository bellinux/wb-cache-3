In the model with efficient risk - sharing and two agents (e. g. a household) with isoelastic preferences we show that an increase of the level <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> tolerance <b>of</b> one of the agents might have an ambiguous impact on the aggregate level <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> tolerance; the latter increases for some levels of aggregate wealth while it decreases for other levels of aggregate wealth.
