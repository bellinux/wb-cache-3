40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to verify the seroprevalence of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies, identify the most frequent serovars and the risk factors associated with the infection in Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brazil. A total of 334 <b>ovines</b> blood samples were collected in 12 farms from Uberlândia municipality to be evaluated by means the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) against 22 serovars of Leptospira spp. and an epidemiologic questionnaire was applied for each farm in order to correlate with risk factors of leptospirosis: sex, age and breed as well as contact with cattle, contact with dogs and presence of rodents. The prevalence of seropositive to MAT was found in seventy four <b>ovines</b> (22. 2 %; CI 95 % 17. 6 - 26. 4 %), with titers ranging from 100 to 3200. The most frequent serovars identified were: Hardjo, Autumnalis, Hardjo and Wolffi association and Grippotyphosa. Statistically significant differences were found in males, pure breeds and presence of rodents (p< 0. 05). The prevalence of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies found in the present study demonstrated that this bacterium occurs in <b>ovines</b> of Uberlândia municipality, MG, Brazil.

5|$|<b>Ovine</b> {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ovine</b> {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the study was}} {{describe}} the distribution of the renal arteries of the renal parenchyma and the proportional area of the arterial vascular system. The renal arterial vascularization in Santa Ines <b>ovines</b> was analyzed in fifteen pairs of organs of male adult animal, after attainment of vascular models through the techniques of corrosion and arteriography. The renal artery always appeared single, and before reaching the renal hilus, it bifurcated into sectorial dorsal and ventral arteries, giving rise to the segmentary arteries which varied from 6 to 10 in number in the right kidney and 7 to 11 in the left kidney. These vessels vascularized independent areas in each renal sector, the renal arterial segments, separated by non-vascularized planes. Bilateral symmetry of the arterial segmentation was found in 13. 33 % of cases.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{field study}} on the prevalence of Dicrocoelium dendriticum was performed in the Emmental. The study included 211 bovines, 170 equines, 20 <b>ovines,</b> 46 caprines and 23 rabbits (from 119 farms). In addition, laboratory routine diagnostic data obtained from 2. 840 animals [...] all originating from the same area of investigation [...] were assessed in the same way. The infection extent concerning the different animal species were the following: bovines 46 %, equines 12 %, <b>ovines</b> 30 %, caprines 48 % and rabbits 9 %. Univariate analyses of baseline epidemiological data identified no significant risk factors, {{with the exception of}} the type of stable used. Bovines kept in a modern free ranging stable had a significantly lower chance of infection with D. dendriticum than cattle in conventional tie stalls. The epidemiological data characterizing the area of investigation suggest the following procedure to reduce the problem of dicrocoeliosis: Pasturing animals of all ages should be regularly dewormed (e. g. every six week during pasture) using a compound effective against D. dendriticum. A treatment is especially indicated at the time after pasture in autumn or before housing the animals in winter. In spring, only animals having pastured the year before need to be treated prior to pasture in the new year. However, it is recommended to perform an economic analysis comparing costs of treatment versus putative costs of damage prior to the initiation of a strategic campaign: animal welfare aspects have to be considered. The laboratory routine diagnostic data showed infection extent similar to those of the cross-sectional study: bovines 60 %, equines 24 %, <b>ovines</b> 26 %, caprines 31 %, rabbits 32 %. Atypical hosts such as dogs and cats exhibited low infection extent (3 % and 1 %, respectively), rather reflecting a gastro-intestinal passage of parasite eggs ingested by consumption of infected livers or by coprophagy of ruminant faeces...|$|R

25|$|Researches on the <b>ovine</b> sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep {{demonstrate}} that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (rams). Homosexual rams (roughly 8% of the population) {{have been found to}} have oSDNs that are about half the size of those in heterosexual rams. In one study conducted by Roselli, et al., 4 heterosexual rams and 9 homosexual rams were exposed to 2 estrous ewes and 2 rams, with their sexual behaviors (mounts and ejaculations) being recorded. Heterosexual rams displayed significantly more mounts and ejaculations with ewes than with stimulus rams, whereas homosexual rams showed the opposite. Then series of brain sections, including hypothalamic, temporal lobe and diencephalon tissues, were imaged. Also, in situ hybridization was conducted to examine the level of the expression of cytochrome P450 aromatase in these brain sections. The results showed that the volume of oSDN in heterosexual rams is approximately 2 times greater than that in homosexual rams. The number of neurons within oSDN is significantly greater in homosexual rams than in heterosexual rams, so it is with the mean length of the oSDN. But the neuron density is similar in both kinds of rams. In addition, aromatase mRNA levels are also tested, showing that the level of aromatase mRNA is significantly greater in heterosexual rams than in homosexual rams.|$|E

500|$|The {{dromedary}} {{is prone}} to trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by a parasite transmitted by the tsetse fly. The main symptoms are recurring fever, anaemia and weakness; the disease is typically fatal for the camel. Brucellosis is another prominent malady. In an observational study, the seroprevalence of this disease was generally low (2 to 5%) in nomadic or moderately free dromedaries, but it was higher (8 to 15%) in denser populations. Brucellosis is caused by different biotypes of Brucella abortus and B. melitensis. Other internal parasites include Fasciola gigantica (trematode), two types of [...] cestode (tapeworm) and various nematodes (roundworms).

500|$|In {{addition}} to natural insemination by rams, artificial insemination and embryo transfers {{have been used}} in sheep breeding programs for many years in Australia and New Zealand. These programs have become more commonplace in the United States during the 2000s as the number of veterinarians qualified to perform these types of procedures with proficiency have grown. However, <b>ovine</b> AI is a relatively complicated procedure compared to other livestock. Unlike cattle or goats, which have straight cervices that can be vaginally inseminated, ewes have a curved cervix which is more difficult to access. Additionally, breeders were until recently unable to control their ewe's estrus cycles. The ability to control the estrus cycle is much easier today because of products that safely assist in aligning heat cycles. [...] Some examples of products are PG600, CIDRs, Estrumate and Folltropin V.

Throughout history, {{much of the money}} and labor of sheep husbandry has aimed to prevent sheep ailments. Historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm. In some developed countries, including the United States, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for <b>ovine</b> use. However, extra-label drug use in sheep production is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions. [...] In the US, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 530.

Eid al-Adha is a major annual festival in Islam in which sheep (or other animals) are sacrificed in remembrance of this act. Sheep are occasionally sacrificed to commemorate important secular events in Islamic cultures. Greeks and Romans sacrificed sheep regularly in religious practice, and Judaism once sacrificed sheep as a Korban (sacrifice), such as the Passover lamb [...] <b>Ovine</b> symbols—such as the ceremonial blowing of a shofar—still find a presence in modern Judaic traditions.

40|$|Abstract Background Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is {{the cause}} of Johne’s disease, an enteric granulomatous disease. Recently, MAP has been {{associated}} with different autoimmune diseases such as Crohn’s disease, type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) and multiple sclerosis. Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma transport protein for thyroid hormone and forms a complex with retinol-binding protein. Reduced TTR plasma levels in MAP infected <b>ovines</b> have been reported. TTR exerts also a functional role in the pancreas promoting insulin release and protecting β-cells from death. Our objective was to identify a protein that {{could be used as a}} diagnostic marker of T 1 D for determining disease progression and monitoring at-risk patients. We postulate that serological TTR levels would be reduced in T 1 D MAP exposed patients. Our hypothesis is based on the observation of cases of T 1 D patients with decreased TTR levels beside the reduced TTR plasma levels in <b>ovines</b> with Johne’s disease. We quantified the plasma protein levels of TTR in 50 people with T 1 D and 51 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Findings Our pilot study showed that plasma TTR levels were not significantly lower/higher in T 1 D Sardinian cases compared to the HCs. Conclusion These preliminary data indicate that plasma TTR may not be a good candidate biomarker for T 1 D diagnosis and further studies to elucidate the possible link are needed. </p...|$|R
