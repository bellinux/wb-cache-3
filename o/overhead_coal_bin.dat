5000|$|A <b>coal</b> <b>bin,</b> <b>coal</b> {{store or}} coal bunker is a storage {{container}} for coal awaiting use or transportation. This {{can be either}} in domestic, commercial or industrial premises, or on a ship or locomotive tender, or at a coal mine or processing plant. Domestic coal bunkers {{are associated with the}} use of coal in open fires or for solid-fuel central heating. Free-standing bunkers were commonly made of wood or concrete and are currently sold in materials including plastic or galvanised metal. [...] <b>Coal</b> <b>bins</b> or bunkers could also form an outhouse or be partly or fully underground.|$|R
5|$|The {{group was}} {{struggling}} to find space to rehearse and perform by 1989. The Students' Building where Philaletheis had once performed had been transformed into the All Campus Dining Center and the old performance space was neither replaced nor replicated elsewhere on campus. To rememdy this, in 1993 and 1994, Vassar invested in the renovation {{of one of its}} disused buildings, a former functioning <b>coal</b> <b>bin,</b> into the <b>Coal</b> <b>Bin</b> Theater to be used by Philaletheis and the other student theatre and comedy groups that had been created by this time.|$|R
50|$|Further north {{along the}} main line, near the {{locomotive}} shed, are the concrete foundations of the diesel fuel tank. There {{is no sign of}} the <b>coal</b> <b>bins</b> or the station master's house.|$|R
50|$|Immediately to {{the north}} and south of the boilers are low brick structures, {{approximately}} 1m in height. These comprise the remains of a <b>coal</b> <b>bin,</b> (north) and the condensers and brick flue associated with the boilers (south).|$|R
6000|$|... "Here we are," [...] said Baxter, as {{he paused}} {{in front of}} {{what had once been}} a stone <b>coal</b> <b>bin.</b> [...] "Dump him in there and shut the door on him. I don't believe he'll get out in any hurry." ...|$|R
50|$|Since the Class 19B {{was heavy}} on coal, a {{ground-level}} concrete <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> was built at Graaff-Reinet especially to replenish these locomotives on through runs while {{standing in the}} platform road. There was no standpipe alongside the platform road, however, so even though coal was taken here, through-working engines took water at Charlwood and Pretoriuskloof.|$|R
60|$|He was {{now free}} {{so far as}} his bodily {{movements}} went, but he soon discovered that the <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> was without any opening but a long, narrow chute covered with an iron plate, and that the heavy door was securely bolted. With all force he threw himself against the door, but it refused to budge.|$|R
50|$|By February, 1914, a Ferro-cement {{building}} 80 by 40 ft, {{with an iron}} {{roof and}} a 40 ft smokestack was completed. Inside was the main refining chamber, two assay offices, weighting room, accounting room, engine and dynamo rooms, two officers' bedrooms, sitting room and bathroom. Detached from the main building was a store room and <b>coal</b> <b>bin.</b>|$|R
25|$|Coal {{provided}} {{the bulk of}} the US energy needs well into the 20th century. Most urban homes had a <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> and a <b>coal</b> fired furnace. Over the years these were replaced with oil furnaces, not because of it being cheaper but because it was easier and safer. Coal remains far cheaper than oil. The biggest use of oil has come from the development of the automobile.|$|R
50|$|A 64-year-old painter, Andy Johnson, {{was working}} as the {{custodian}} and superintendent of a local building and had converted a basement <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> into his art studio and painted by light bulb. His work was soon discovered by Dwyer. Johnson went on to receive many awards and international acclaim, most notably from his home country, Sweden; his works were also collected by Jacqueline Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson for the White House.|$|R
50|$|The Types FT and JV tenders {{were similar}} in appearance, but not identical, the {{difference}} being visible on their left sides when comparing the folded-in upper sides {{to the right of}} the fourth strap between tender sides and <b>coal</b> <b>bins.</b> The Type JV was the larger of the two with larger coal and water capacities. It was tested behind a manually-stoked Class 15F locomotive, but it is unclear whether it was used again afterwards.|$|R
50|$|The name is Aboriginal in origin, being a {{word for}} hail or hailstone. The heritage-listed Caron Coal Stage, built in {{the golden age of}} steam locomotives, and the {{associated}} railway dam are located close to the town. The stage is a simple example of an elevated concrete <b>coal</b> <b>bin,</b> constructed in 1930 or 1931 to provide fuel to the trains of the era, and is the only remaining trace of the Caron siding.|$|R
50|$|Andy Johnson (born Anders Johannson, 1893 in Hyssma, Sweden - 1971) was a Swedish-American painter. He started {{painting}} at age 64 in a <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> {{by the light}} of a 75-watt bulb. He was discovered by Sylvia Dwyer while working as the custodian and superintendent of a local Brooklyn Heights building, and appeared in multiple exhibits in the Brooklyn Arts Gallery. As his career continued, his art and story became the subject of many international expatriate newspapers.|$|R
5000|$|The Company's {{base camp}} at the Mississippi Landing became a village. A machine and repair shop and an eight stall engine house were built. It was a company town, {{equipped}} with a company office, general manager's house, ice house, boarding house, railroad boarding house, turntable, roundhouse, machine shop, car shop, casting house, harness room, cattle barn, hog pen, sawmill, warehouses, <b>coal</b> <b>bins,</b> roothouse, store, school house, coal dock, pumping house, water tank, boathouse, sand house, and several cottages.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} woodwork is unchanged {{except for}} the changes to add bathrooms and steam heat. There are four rooms {{on the first floor}} with an open stairway to the second floor. There are four large rooms on the second floor, which match those on the first. A closed stairway leads to the attic. The basement has a furnace and laundry area with a fruit cellar, and a <b>coal</b> <b>bin.</b> Two rooms were used as office and recreational area for the sheriff deputies.|$|R
50|$|Gathings College had a {{sharp decline}} in {{enrollment}} after the Civil War because of the general turmoil resulting throughout the entire South during the reconstruction era. However, some type of school apparently continued at the site as part of the original college was incorporated into the Covington Public School at some point. The two-story red brick school that so many ex students are familiar with still had the original college <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> and part of the auditorium in it when it cease to be used in 1966.|$|R
50|$|The main (ground level) floor {{has a large}} entry foyer with {{a curved}} oak staircase. The dining room is to the right, with a butler's pantry and the kitchen. The living room and a sun porch {{are also on the}} ground floor. The second floor {{contains}} four bedrooms and two bathrooms. The third floor consists of a full-height, floored attic. A separate stairway leads to this level. The basement has a boiler room, <b>coal</b> <b>bin,</b> wine and canning cellar, storage room and a laundry.|$|R
50|$|Additional coal storage {{was located}} {{at the rear of}} the cabin in two <b>coal</b> storage <b>bins.</b> In between these storage bins a door was located that allowed access.|$|R
50|$|The <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> {{is a large}} box-like {{structure}} with an open top raised on stumps about three metres above the ground. It has exposed studs and bracing with wooden board infill and flooring. Extending from {{the west of the}} bin on an incline {{from the top of the}} bin to the ground is a tramway supported on a wooden frame. The tramway consists of three steel rails: two are laid quite close together with respect to the third. Towards the top of the tramway, running alongside the rails are the remains of a ladder.|$|R
2500|$|The Anderson {{it turned}} out {{had run out of}} coal {{in the middle of the}} storm. [...] Her lazy crew had not fully coaled the ship at Kodiak and had simply hidden the sacks that they were {{supposed}} to haul on board and heave into the <b>coal</b> <b>bins.</b> [...] The crew and passengers were forced to burn the wooden coal bunkers, and eventually the cabin furniture and even the cabin partitions. [...] Passengers were writing notes to loved ones and tossing them overboard in bottles, of which there was an ample supply since most of the boatâ€™s stock of whisky had been consumed in an effort to keep up morale.|$|R
50|$|Lone Star has a wood frame hull 90 ft long, with pointed bow, {{flat bottom}} and hard chine. With the sternwheel added, the total vessel length is 105 ft. She has {{a beam of}} 24.5 ft and a hold depth of 4.1 ft. The {{internal}} hogging truss system is typical of boats of the period. The hull is divided internally into three watertight compartments. It has a two-deck superstructure, with the main deck housing the propelling machinery and steam boilers, with <b>coal</b> <b>bins</b> forward, boilers in the center, and engines aft. An upper deck above the boilers that houses the pilot house and crew quarters.|$|R

5000|$|Coal {{was carried}} in side-dump cars, {{from which it}} was dumped into a hopper below each customer's boiler room. A {{conveyor}} then carried the coal up from the trackside hopper to the customer's boiler room. [...] The details of the latter connection depended on {{the depth of the}} building's basement. Chicago's new City building on the corner of Washington and LaSalle had a subbasement 38 ft below sidewalk level, so the tunnel connection was made by a 10 ft trench. [...] The Commercial National Bank's <b>coal</b> <b>bins</b> were under the sidewalk on Clark Street. There, coal was lifted from the tunnel by a vertical bucket conveyor running in a small shaft.|$|R
5000|$|The extant {{shaft and}} many of the surface {{structures}} on the site date from the second phase of operations that commenced in 1944 at tunnel seven. The headframe and <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> were constructed in [...] of local timber, {{with the exception of the}} four main timber legs. The main legs were 78 ft long turpentine poles from Fraser Island. A large part of the headframe collapsed in 1993. The workshop, electrical and drill store, and winder house were probably built about the same time as the headframe. The compressor house was added to the winding house probably in [...] The extant screening and crushing plant remains date to the early 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|The Lathers {{bought the}} house in 1935. The {{property}} the house was on originally had 8 lots, which also included a garage and barn. The house basement is a Michigan cellar. The round brick walls of the cellar stored potatoes and apples. Lathers' wife canned hundreds of jars of fruit and vegetables each summer that were stored in the cellar to feed their family during the winter months. There is a spiral staircase from the first floor to the basement. The sand floor basement has <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> for the [...] "octopus" [...] furnace. A telephone was never installed in the home. The Lathers communicated long distance through letters.|$|R
25|$|River North was {{previously}} named Smokey Hollow, {{at the turn}} of the 20th century, due to the many factories and forges in the area. Smoke from the factories was often so thick that it blocked the sunlight. At the time, Smokey Hollow was a major transportation hub, with railroad tracks linking the ports along the Chicago River to the surrounding areas. The now mixed-use Merchandise Mart was once a major storage warehouse for goods, and it still has railroad tracks underneath its sprawling structure. Former major retailer Montgomery Ward also had a major transportation and storage facility in River North. Massive <b>coal</b> <b>bins</b> were formerly located throughout the neighborhood, for storage of coal transported by ship.|$|R
50|$|Free Library of Philadelphia {{operates}} its Roxborough Branch, serving Wissahickon, at 6245 Ridge Avenue at Hermitage Street. A prior library, the Wissahickon Branch, {{located at}} Manayunk Avenue and Osborn Street, opened in 1909 and {{was built on}} land donated by the Pencoyd Iron Works. It was the ninth Andrew Carnegie-funded Free Library branch designed by the architectural firm of Whitfield and King and featured a main reading room, a children's room which {{also served as a}} lecture room seating 100, and a basement consisting of a boiler room, <b>coal</b> <b>bin,</b> staff room, a small magazine room, and two toilets. The Wissahickon Branch served the Wissahickon neighborhood until it closed in 1969. Sometime soon after, the building burned down.|$|R
50|$|Next to {{the visitor}} center is the large John N. Janes ranch house, which was {{purchased}} in 1915 for $2,763.53 as an Aladdin mail order (or kit house) and shipped to Muleshoe via rail. The house, which has a full basement and two complete stories, was built for Janesâ€™ bride, Anna, whom he met in Kansas City, Missouri. The house had steam heat, electricity, the previously unknown luxury of two bathrooms, and running water provided by a windmill. On the second floor is a ballroom, presumably to permit Anna to hold grand parties for distant ranch families. The basement housed Janesâ€™ office, a game room, steam boiler, <b>coal</b> <b>bin,</b> fireplace, and even a laundry chute.|$|R
