5|$|As Southern {{states were}} subdued, {{critical}} decisions {{had to be}} made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.|$|E

I-205 also serves to connect the Bay Area with popular weekend destinations such as Yosemite, Reno, and Lake Tahoe.

5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners.

Despite the convenience <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the speed of the return trip. By the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E

In addition, overall, the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions have fewer daytime levels than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 counterparts.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Favaloro began {{to consider the possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He put his ideas into practice {{for the first time in}} May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called bypass or transmyocardial revascularization surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of coronary disease. In 1970 he published one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment of Coronary Arteriosclerosis.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, {{with the}} area around Woking by this time heavily populated, rental income from the LNC's land {{holdings}} was an extremely valuable asset, and in May 1955 the Alliance Property Company launched a hostile takeover bid with the aim <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> cemetery's land for property development. The bid failed, but prompted the LNC to secure {{the passing of the}} London Necropolis Act 1956, allowing the sale of all remaining surplus land. A new company, the Brookwood Estates Realisation Company, was founded to oversee the disposal of the remaining unsold lands as well as the cemetery reserve, finally formally recognising that Brookwood Cemetery would never expand beyond its original boundaries.|$|E
5|$|By the 2005–06 season, {{clubs in}} England were {{increasingly}} in favour <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> 4–5–1 system. Wenger, having earlier suggested {{he would never}} resort to a negative system, later adopted the formation for Champions League matches. The decision to pack the midfield and play a lone striker resulted in Arsenal reaching the final. With Fábregas breaking into the first team, Wenger chose to deviate from their counter-attacking style, to a more possession based one. In 2009–10, he instituted a fluid 4–3–3 formation to benefit from Fàbregas' creativity, and since the player's departure, had remodelled the system to 4–1–4–1 and 4–2–3–1. During {{the latter half of}} the 2016–17 Premier League season, Wenger switched to a 3-4-3 formation first used against Middlesbrough in a 1-2 win.|$|E

5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent.
