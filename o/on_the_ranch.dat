5|$|The younger Del Valle and {{his family}} did not live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> initially, instead {{settling}} in a house on what is now Olvera Street in Los Angeles. The Del Valle family did not move back to Camulos, which he had expanded, until 1861. During this time, the ranch was overseen by José Antonio Salazar, Del Valle's majordomo. Although the rancho was associated with Ramona and Mexican California, the house was not constructed until after the United States acquired the territory and California was admitted as a state. The Del Valle family never lived there under Mexican rule.|$|E
5|$|Ramona, {{published}} in 1884, {{was based in}} part on experiences that Helen Hunt Jackson had had during her visit to Rancho Camulos in 1882. Jackson spent only two hours <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> and did not meet Ysabel del Valle, but she had a keen eye for details and used many of her observations in the novel. For example, the altar cloth in the rancho's chapel had a small tear in it which had been mended. In the novel, the character Margarita accidentally tears the altar cloth, and Ramona sews it back together. The book became extremely popular and inspired a great deal of tourism, which was stimulated by the improved access possible due to the opening of Southern Pacific railroad lines in Southern California.|$|E

5|$|Anna Louise Mohan {{was born}} in 1885 in San Francisco, California. Her father, Hugh Mohan, born in Pennsylvania, became a {{journalist}} and stump speaker involved in labor issues and Democratic Party politics. Moving to San Francisco, he continued to write for newspapers, and in 1880 he married Louisa Flick, who grew up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> of her stepfather, James Say, near Humboldt Lake in Nevada. The Mohans had two children, Barbara (1880) and Louis (1882), before the birth of Anna Louise. Later in 1885, {{the family moved to}} Reno, where Mohan continued his journalistic career but drank heavily. One day he departed and never returned to his wife and children. Louise's mother divorced him in 1889 and married Sheridan Bryant, a freight conductor on the Southern Pacific railway. The couple had two children, Floyd (1894) and William (1896). Although the family lived in Wadsworth, Nevada, Louise accepted an invitation from James Say to live at his ranch. She remained there for three or four years, returning to Wadsworth at her mother's insistence at the age of 12. Bryant adopted her stepfather's last name, but never changed it legally from Mohan.|$|E

25|$|George Allan Hancock had {{inherited}} Rancho La Brea {{and made his}} fortune in oil but had developed a scientific interest {{as a result of}} excavations at the La Brea Tar Pits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> and, after exploring the pools <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> with his first boat, going to sea and eventually earning his master's papers. He had a number of boats with two earlier ones named Velero and Velero II. Captain Hancock took the first Velero from Los Angeles on January 30, 1921 on a cruise that was not scientific but later took Velero II as far as Panama with an amateur marine biologist that deepened his interest in scientific voyages. A Hancock owned and captained vessel following Velero II, Oaxaca, had carried twelve passengers including two representatives of the California Academy of Sciences on a voyage as far as the Galápagos Islands in 1927. In 1931 Hancock had a new vessel constructed and returned to the name Velero with that being the third of the name.|$|E
