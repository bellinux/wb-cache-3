40|$|<b>The</b> focus <b>of</b> {{this thesis}} is <b>the</b> {{derivation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American <b>jury</b> system from <b>the</b> English <b>jury</b> <b>of</b> Henry II. To this end, a {{short history of}} English law and <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English <b>jury</b> is given. <b>The</b> method <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English <b>jury's</b> development is used to show <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early American <b>jury</b> into <b>the</b> American <b>jury</b> <b>of</b> today. <b>The</b> American <b>jury</b> still resembles <b>the</b> English <b>jury</b> from which it evolved. The American system has a grand jury to indict criminals and a petit <b>jury</b> to try <b>the</b> case. <b>The</b> practice <b>of</b> taking an oath was begun by the English jurors and is still in practice in American today as well as <b>the</b> challenging <b>of</b> potential jurors for bias. The American system differs from <b>the</b> <b>juries</b> <b>of</b> old in its inability to determine matters of law and in its move away from unanimity in verdicts and <b>the</b> twelve-man <b>jury.</b> Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical English <b>jury</b> are still in use in <b>the</b> American <b>jury</b> system <b>of</b> today, but some differences have been created through case law and legislation. It will come to no surprise, however, {{that the most important}} characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical English <b>jury</b> are still present in the American system today.

5|$|Before {{the trial}} began, public defender Blane Williams had urged Bell {{to accept a}} plea bargain. At trial he rested the defense case without calling any {{witnesses}} or offering any evidence. The six members of Bell's jury were all white. The 150-person jury pool included black citizens, who make up 10percent of the parish's population, {{but none of the}} 50potential jurors who showed up was black. Williams did not challenge the composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>jury</b> in Hayes' {{case was}} {{composed}} of seven women and five men. Following <b>the</b> completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> deliberated for about four hours to reach its guilty verdicts.|$|R
50|$|A {{second set}} of trials was then held in Decatur, Alabama. In spite of lack <b>of</b> evidence, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> convicted Patterson {{to death in the}} {{electric}} chair. Judge James Edwin Horton overturned the verdict, and a third trial was held in 1933. The third trial also resulted in a death penalty verdict. No African Americans were present in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>juries,</b> nor were any ever considered for jury duty in Alabama. This decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, on the basis that <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> African Americans from <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool denied <b>the</b> defendants due process.|$|R

50|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury's</b> {{historic}} function <b>of</b> tempering {{rules of}} law by common sense {{brought to bear}} upon <b>the</b> facts <b>of</b> a specific case, for this reason Justices Black and Douglas indicated their disapproval of special verdicts even in civil cases.|$|R
40|$|In stark {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> transparency <b>of</b> most procedures characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> justice system, decisions by juries are made in private {{and the reasons for}} their decisions are kept secret. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> secrecy rule is considered essential to <b>the</b> proper administration <b>of</b> justice in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> trial by jury. This paper is focused on <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rule after <b>the</b> delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury’s</b> verdict and <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rule on investigations into allegations of juror misconduct. It responds to the recent suggestion from the New Zealand Law Commission that a statutory offence applying to persons who disclose matters relating to jury deliberations be established and with a corresponding defence that would allow disclosure after delivery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury’s</b> verdict in circumstances where juror misconduct may have resulted in a miscarriage of justice...|$|R
25|$|Critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury's</b> not-guilty verdict {{contended that}} the {{deliberation}} time was unduly short in comparison to <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial.

5|$|On 22 May 2007, {{the trial}} of Jamila M'Barek and Mohamed M'Barek opened at the Palais de Justice in Nice, two-and-a-half years {{after the death of}} the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury. The {{presiding}} judge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> trial was Nicole Besset, with Jean-Louis Moreau serving as the state prosecutor. Shaftesbury's widow was represented by attorney Franck De Vita, while her brother was represented by Melanie Juginger. The Ashley-Cooper family was represented by attorney Philippe Soussi.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 trial {{defendants}} {{appealed to}} the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1950. In the appeal they raised issues {{about the use of}} informant witnesses, the impartiality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> and judge, the judge's conduct, and free speech. Their free speech arguments raised important constitutional issues: they asserted that their political advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.|$|E
5|$|The Artistic Director {{from its}} {{inception}} until 2015 was Warren Thomson, who also served as Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> from 1992 until 2012.

50|$|After the U.S. Supreme Court's {{reversal}} of Griffin's conviction, he was tried again for murder, and a mistrial was declared when <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> was deadlocked 2 to 10 {{in favor of}} a second-degree murder conviction. In his third trial, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> found Griffin guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. Upon automatic appeal (because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury's</b> recommendation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> death penalty), the court reversed the trial court's judgment of conviction and imposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> death penalty.|$|R
