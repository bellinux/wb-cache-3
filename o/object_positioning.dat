500|$|To {{solve the}} issues of {{transferring}} information from the original game's engine to the Saber engine, the developers looked at how they used the third-party Havok physics engine to handle <b>object</b> <b>positioning,</b> velocities, and collisions. Saber created a proxy of every object in the Halo engine to transfer into the Saber engine, meaning that the game's original programming remained unchanged. [...] The game's ability to alternate between the legacy and remastered graphics engines in the campaign {{was made possible by}} the rendering engine developed by Saber Interactive. The technology allowed the developers to update Halo: Combat Evolveds visuals and preserve the original gameplay. Originally, players would have chosen which graphical presentation to play from the main menu. The in-game toggle feature quickly became a talking point among the developers, who pushed for it to be available to other players. Since the ability to switch between classic version and remastered version was provided to players, both engines work simultaneously to retain the spontaneity of game. This approach caused several problems, including collision issues—because objects and environments in the original game were of a lower resolution with fewer polygons, higher-resolution visuals in the Saber engine could deviate from the original significantly. As the original game's geometry was used as the basis for collisions, in some cases characters could appear to walk through or above terrain, weapons could drop through the ground, and bullets would appear to be deflected by nothing. The sheer number of these issues, combined with the desire to keep the original gameplay intact, forced Saber to use a variety of approaches to fix the problems, including making tools for artists to visualize height differences and creating intermediate geometry. In some cases, the artists developed other ways of keeping to the same collision data while updating the visuals by changing the actual object—turning a blocky, low-polygon rock into an angular Forerunner structure avoided the collision issues.|$|E

Traffic with similar operational characteristics is a necessary component of both high and low fidelity driving simulators. Simulation of autonomous vehicles, often called a micro-simulation, requires some model of the road network. This model must provide information about all elements of an environment that affect the driving task, such as the road layout, traffic control devices, and other autonomous vehicles or objects that exhibit reactive behavior. This representation must encompass not only the physical aspects of the environment (i. e. the road layout, or the position of other vehicles) but the logical aspects as well. Logical aspects include information about passing lanes, lane direction, <b>object</b> <b>positioning</b> relative to the road (i. e., on or off the lane) or <b>object</b> <b>positioning</b> relative to another object (i. e., ahead of vehicle X on road Y).
