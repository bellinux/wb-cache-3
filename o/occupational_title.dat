The most famous was Guman Chand's third son, Jorawar Mal Bapna. He branched out from Brocade business into Banking and established around 300 branches across India, the Middle East and China in early 19th century. Jorawar Mal Bapna became one of the wealthiest persons in India and also became a prominent diplomat who acted as a go between the British and the local Rajput Princes.

To investigate occupational cognition, focusing upon how occupations (considered as complex social objects) are perceived, compared, represented, and are given meaning. In addition, the content and structure of beliefs about occupations are examined, looking especially at {{the degree to which}} the processes involved are socially shared. Subjects were sampled from a fourfold typology of occupations defined by the factors of 'socio-economic status' and 'people orientation'. Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions None of the techniques used was variable-oriented. The datasets on the tape include: 1. Pairwise Similarities Pairs of <b>occupational</b> <b>titles</b> are presented to the subject, and he is asked to assess how similar each pair is. 2. and 3. Rankings and Ratings of <b>Occupational</b> <b>Titles</b> Ranking and rating have been the routine and standard methods of investigating the perception of occupations in general, and occupational prestige in particular. Rating was either 'Direct', e. g., marks out of 100, or by sorting into ordered categories. 4. Sentence Frame Data Respondents were asked to fit each of 25 <b>occupational</b> <b>titles</b> into 15 sentence frames forming a set of 375 statements. For each statement the subject was to tell how often it held true (always, usually, seldom or never). 5. Summary Data on Individual Pairwise Similarities Matrices 6. Triadic Similarities Data In the method of triads, the subject is presented with subsets of three <b>occupational</b> <b>titles</b> and asked to make a specified judgement about them. 7. Hierarchical Clustering Data This method stems from Rapoport and Fillenbaum.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} was to {{describe}} the structure and content of a job-exposure matrix (JEM) for historical asbestos exposure in The Netherlands. The JEM contained 309 occupational job title groups in 70 branches of industry during 10 periods of 5 years during 1945 – 1994, resulting in 3090 evaluations. Dutch sources on asbestos exposure measurements provided quantitative guidance for 69 evaluations (2. 2 %) in 25 <b>occupational</b> <b>title</b> groups. In addition, three databases from the UK Health and Safety Executive contributed to 222 evaluations (7. 2 %) and several other sources aided in another 133 evaluations (4. 3 %). These evaluations resulted in seven categories of exposure levels for all 3090 combinations of <b>occupational</b> <b>title</b> groups and periods. A verification process with five experts was used to adjust the assignments of exposure categories. The trends in exposure patterns over time were described in relation to production activities, operational control measures and the presence of dust control measures. For the majority of asbestos-related diseases in the past decades, reliable information on their historical exposure patterns was lacking. The limited availability of exposure measurements in the past illustrates the need for a structured assessment of historical asbestos exposure through a JEM.
