5|$|Historic {{districts are}} {{generally}} {{two types of}} properties, contributing and non-contributing. Broadly defined, a contributing property is any property, structure or object which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a historic district, listed locally or federally, significant. Different entities, usually governmental, at {{both the state and}} national level in the United States, have differing definitions <b>of</b> <b>contributing</b> property but they all retain the same basic characteristics. In general, contributing properties are integral parts of the historic context and character of a historic district.|$|E

5|$|Kesler {{is known}} as a two-way forward, capable <b>of</b> <b>contributing</b> both offensively and defensively. In his first few years in the NHL, he {{established}} his role as a shutdown forward, playing on the penalty kill and against opposing teams' top players. He also earned a reputation as an agitator, trash-talking and engaging opponents physically in between play. During the 2008–09 season, Kesler began adding a more offensive component to his game and was moved up to the Canucks' second line from third. With an increased points total, he earned league recognition with his first Selke Trophy nomination as the NHL's best defensive forward. He has since continued to improve his offensive skills while remaining defensively responsible.|$|E

5|$|The black elite in {{the towns}} donated to the settlers' {{patriotic}} funds and organisations, and also set up their own. A war fundraising tea organised by black Salisburians in early March 1915 boasted entertainment {{in the form of}} a black choir, as well as the presence of Taylor and a junior native commissioner, each of whom gave speeches in English, Sindebele and Shona. Rural black people, by contrast, did not generally understand the concept of donating money to war funds, and misinterpreted encouragement to do so as being threatened with a new tax. When the Matabele chief Gambo began collecting war donations from his people in early 1915, also urging other chiefs to do the same, he took care to thoroughly explain the war fund's purpose and the voluntary nature <b>of</b> <b>contributing,</b> but some villagers still misunderstood and came to believe they would have livestock confiscated if they did not give money. The Company ultimately sent officials around the countryside to clarify the matter.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} historically pioneered {{research and}} training collaborations between academia, industry and government. In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm. In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities <b>of</b> <b>contributing</b> to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses. On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration {{with the federal government}} on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940. MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.|$|E
5|$|Katharine Hepburn {{joined the}} cast in mid-April 1942 after Stewart {{sent her a}} copy of the {{unfinished}} script. Hepburn was fascinated by the character of Christine, and felt that doing the film would be a way <b>of</b> <b>contributing</b> to the war effort. MGM executives did not want Hepburn attached to the picture, feeling it was an inappropriate follow-up for her (first) previous pairing with Tracy in Woman of the Year (1942), but Hepburn insisted, and MGM relented. Hepburn showed some concerns with Stewart's redrafting of the script, in that he toned down the novel's love story, placing more emphasis on the character of O'Malley role and the action. She asked for more romance in the film. Although Hepburn had spent much of the prior year searching for scripts with equally strong male and female parts for her and Tracy, she now requested that the O'Malley role be restored to the function it served in the novel (where O'Malley is impotent, troubled, and despairing of love) and her own part expanded. Film producer Victor Saville threatened to resign if the changes were made, and Spencer Tracy supported him, which led to the changes being rejected.|$|E

5|$|Matching, also {{referred}} to as “cost sharing”, is a requirement for the recipient to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received. In other words, when the recipient participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives federal assistance) and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require the recipient to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program’s operations. The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, the recipient must still cover a portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually the recipient decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses, so long as the contribution is verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered in the operating budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form <b>of</b> <b>contributing</b> the recipient’s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of in-kind contributions, which are donations of non-monetary objects such as services, materials, property, etc.|$|E

40|$|Landshypotek {{is today}} Sweden’s largest lending {{institution}} for land and forest owners with loan assets around 50 billion SEK. “Landshypotek AB” {{is owned by}} an economic association consisting of 52 000 members and has 19 offices all over Sweden. Its market share of first mortgage loans to land and forest owners is 38 percent. To be a member in Landshypotek ownership of land or forest are compulsory and the members have to place their mortgage in Landshypotek. Landshypotek’s equity for 2010 was barely 3, 4 billion SEK which has been built up through patronage refunds on the borrowers (members) interest payments. The members’ contributed capital constitutes just over 1 billion of the equity and the rest (2, 4 billion) is Landshypotek’s unallocated equity. The equity is enough to balance today’s lending but since the market is expanding a demand for capital and Landshypotek’s future growth strategy more equity is needed. Landshypotek is therefore considering introducing {{a change in the}} financial model {{at the beginning of the}} year 2012. In comparison with investor-owned firms, cooperatives are at a disadvantage in raising equity capital. The cooperative equity is not marketable because the distribution of earnings in cooperatives is based on patronage and not investment. As a result there are no incentives for non patrons to invest in a cooperative and cooperatives are therefore restricted to its members to raise equity. But members may be reluctant to increase their illiquid stake in a cooperative because of the non marketability of the equity. The possibility to raise equity through retained earnings may also be met with resistance from the cooperative’s members because it translates into higher costs and lower revenues for the patrons. The aim of the study is to answer the following questions, hence the issue is if Landshypotek’s members be negative towards increasing their illiquid stake? Is the intended change <b>of</b> <b>contributed</b> capital likely to reduce the risk of free-rider problems? Are members with a long time left in Landshypotek likely to be more positive towards the intended change <b>of</b> <b>contributed</b> capital than those with a short time left? Will members terminate their business relationship with Landshypotek due to the intended change <b>of</b> <b>contributed</b> capital? How will the intended change <b>of</b> <b>contributed</b> capital affect a member’s cost of capital? The thesis is conducted as a qualitative case study. The empirical material consists of qualitative research interviews with twelve members in Landshypotek and a study of four scenarios regarding the members’ cost of capital. The conclusion is that Landshypotek’s members will not be negative towards increasing their illiquid stake. The members, regardless of their expected time horizon, are also positive towards the intended change <b>of</b> <b>contributed</b> capital and the members with long time left in Landshypotek are more positive towards the possibility to actively contribute with capital. The intended change <b>of</b> <b>contributed</b> capital is likely to reduce the risk of free-rider problem. It is also revealed that the members will not terminate their business activities with Landshypotek due to the intended change <b>of</b> <b>contributed</b> capital as long as Landshypotek is meeting the objective of ten percent dividend on contributed capital. Finally, the intended change <b>of</b> <b>contributed</b> capital tends to increase the cost of capital for non investing members and decrease it for investing members...|$|R
