5|$|In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed P.parienti, P.electromontis, and P.pallescens as endangered, and P.furcifer as vulnerable. Before this assessment, it {{was assumed}} that their {{population}} was in decline due to habitat destruction for the creation of pasture and agriculture. Measures of their population density vary widely, from 50 to 550 individuals per square kilometer (250acres), but these numbers are thought to reflect <b>only</b> <b>small,</b> gum-rich areas, and therefore <b>only</b> <b>small,</b> clustered populations with an overall low population density.|$|E
5|$|Phlorizin is a {{flavonoid}} that {{is found}} in apple trees, particularly in the leaves, and in <b>only</b> <b>small</b> amounts if at all in other plants, even other species of the Malus genus or related plants such as pear trees.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} very similar in form to Iris dichotoma but <b>only</b> <b>smaller.</b>|$|R

5|$|While a {{wind farm}} may cover {{a large area}} of land, many land uses such as {{agriculture}} are compatible with it, as <b>only</b> <b>small</b> areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure are made unavailable for use.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{few other}} areas also fenced in, but <b>only</b> <b>smaller</b> and {{temporary}} to save the young trees.|$|R

5|$|In Mexico, spiny {{lobsters}} {{are an important}} commercial resource, representing the fifth most valuable fishery, worth US$18 million. Three species are exploited along the Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula, but the catch of 744t of the California spiny lobster makes up 95%–97% of the total, with <b>only</b> <b>small</b> quantities of Panulirus inflatus and Panulirus gracilis. The fishing rights are held by 26 local co-operatives.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{historian}} David Tal {{agreed with}} this view; Yoav Gelber, {{when asked about}} this, commented that {{the significance of the}} attack, along with two other major tactical failures—Latrun and Jenin—was {{in the fact that the}} initiative passed to the Israeli side, and the Arabs conducted <b>only</b> <b>small</b> assaults after these operations. Scholar Fawaz Gerges noted that the Egyptians originally assumed that the further their army advances, the weaker the Israeli resistance would become.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids {{alternately}} {{feed and}} ruminate throughout the day. While those that feed on concentrates feed and digest in short intervals, the roughage feeders take longer intervals. <b>Only</b> <b>small</b> {{species such as}} the duiker browse {{for a few hours}} during day or night. Feeding habits are related to body size; while small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed upon high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands.|$|E

5|$|New {{walls were}} built by Tarade and Vauban in the 17th century. They {{were in their}} turn {{destroyed}} in 1874. <b>Only</b> <b>small</b> portions survive: two bastions and the Porte de Strasbourg ("Strasbourg gate"), {{a good example of}} French architecture under Louis XIV. Sélestat still has two old arsenals, Sainte-Barbe on the main square (1470) and Saint-Hilaire (1518). The first, with a large crenelated gable, is a fine example of Gothic architecture.|$|E
5|$|Religion in Jersey has {{a complex}} history, drawn largely from {{different}} Christian denominations. In 2015, Jersey's first ever {{national survey of}} religion found that two fifths of Jersey people have no religion, with <b>only</b> <b>small</b> handfuls of Jersey people belonging to the non-Christian religions. In total, 54% said they had some form of religion, and 7% were not sure.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the Government has {{increasingly}} called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While {{most of these}} deployments involved <b>only</b> <b>small</b> numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989, Cambodia between 1992 and 1993, Somalia in 1993, Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and Bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards.|$|E

5|$|Somerset {{today has}} only two small cities, Bath and Wells, and <b>only</b> <b>small</b> towns in {{comparison}} with other areas of England. Tourism is {{a major source of}} employment along the coast, and in Bath and Cheddar for example. Other attractions include Exmoor, West Somerset Railway, Haynes Motor Museum and the Fleet Air Arm Museum as well as the churches and the various National Trust and English Heritage properties in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|The PSA Group, {{formed in}} 1976 when Peugeot bought out its competitor, Citroën, {{took over the}} former Chrysler Europe in 1979; one of its first {{decisions}} was to rebrand all of the models manufactured in the French and British factories to Talbot. Among the models inherited from Chrysler was the Scottish-built rear-wheel drive Talbot Sunbeam, the <b>only</b> <b>small</b> car in the lineup.|$|E
5|$|A {{defensible}} barracks made of brick, {{faced in}} Kentish ragstone on the fort's exterior, closes off the gorge. Its line is indented to facilitate small arms fire from loopholes and windows with armoured steel shutters. The {{first floor of}} the barracks had a veranda facing towards the fort's interior and supported on cast-iron pillars. The barracks provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 NCO and men, though in peacetime <b>only</b> <b>small</b> maintenance detachments occupied the fort. It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients. Although much of the barracks is now in poor condition, two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War.|$|E

5000|$|Gradually trees became fewer, smaller, {{and less}} important. By {{the time the}} last fruit-bearing adult palm tree was cut, palms had long since ceased to be of {{economic}} significance. That left <b>only</b> <b>smaller</b> and smaller palm saplings to clear each year, along with other bushes and treelets. No one would have noticed the felling of the last small palm.|$|R
50|$|Functional Cpf1 doesn’t {{need the}} tracrRNA, therefore, only crRNA is required. This {{benefits}} genome editing because Cpf1 is not <b>only</b> <b>smaller</b> than Cas9, but also {{it has a}} smaller sgRNA molecule (proximately half as many nucleotides as Cas9).|$|R
5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience <b>only</b> <b>small</b> changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|A report {{into the}} {{experience}} of refugees resettled in Brighton and Hove under the scheme between October 2006 and October 2007 was published by the Sussex Centre for Migration Research at the University of Sussex in December 2007. The report found that the refugees had struggled to gain employment and English language skills. Another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that <b>only</b> <b>small</b> numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment, noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs.|$|E
5|$|After {{resuming}} production, Navarro {{questioned the}} methods of the Chili Peppers' recording procedures. He wondered why such {{a considerable amount of}} jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable for the band. Months went by, and <b>only</b> <b>small</b> amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where his family realized he'd resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month.|$|E
