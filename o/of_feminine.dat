5|$|Feminist {{literary}} critics see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak's wife, for example, {{are the most}} powerful characters in the poem—Morgan especially, as she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain's scar {{can be seen as}} symbols <b>of</b> <b>feminine</b> power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.|$|E
5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea <b>of</b> <b>feminine</b> touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
5|$|Police {{raids on}} gay bars were frequent—occurring on average {{once a month}} for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to {{facilitate}} resuming business {{as quickly as possible}} if alcohol was seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces <b>of</b> <b>feminine</b> clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused mainly on formation <b>of</b> <b>feminines</b> in the Czech language. The paper {{is divided into}} two parts. Theoretical part pays attention to the general information about gender inflection and laws related to this problematic. Essential part engages in the theoretical familiarization with formation <b>of</b> <b>feminines</b> rules and declension of one-word and multi-word surnames. The end of this thesis contains some linguists´ opinions to this problematic as well as a brief description of spelling of foreign first names and their integration to the Czech language. The second part of this thesis is practical and is processed via quantitative survey using nameless questionnaire which has been distributed to three age categories. The aim {{of this paper is to}} find out whether respondents agree with the formation <b>of</b> <b>feminines</b> or not and also whether the relation between attitude and age exists...|$|R

25|$|Other verses in Yasht 5 have {{masculine}} instead <b>of</b> <b>feminine</b> pronouns, {{and thus}} again {{appear to be}} verses that were originally dedicated to other divinities. Boyce also suggests that the new compound divinity of waters with martial characteristics gradually usurped the position of Apam Napat, the great warlike water divinity of the Ahuric triad, finally causing the latter's place to be lost and his veneration to become limited to the obligatory verses recited at the Ab-Zohr.|$|E
25|$|In the Septuagint, the Greek {{version of}} the Hebrew scriptures, the word Abyssos is treated as a noun <b>of</b> <b>feminine</b> {{grammatical}} gender, even though Greek nouns ending in -os are typically masculine. Abyssos is equivalent in meaning to Mesopotamian Abzu as the dark chaotic sea before Creation. The word also appears in the Christian scriptures, occurring six times in the Book of Revelation, where it is conventionally translated not as “the deep” but as “the bottomless pit” of Hell. Barb argues that in essence the Sumerian Abzu is the “grandmother” of the Christian Devil.|$|E
25|$|That {{a goddess}} evoked in war and for {{political}} reasons receive the homage of women and that women {{continue to have a}} role in her cult is explained by Palmer as a foreign cult <b>of</b> <b>feminine</b> sexuality of Etruscan derivation. The persistence of a female presence in her cult through the centuries down to the lectisternium of 217 BC, when the matronae collected money for the service, and to the times of Augustus during the ludi saeculares in the sacrifices to Capitoline Juno are proof of the resilience of this foreign tradition.|$|E

25|$|Author Margaret Atwood recalls reading Graves's The White Goddess {{at the age}} of 19. Atwood {{describes}} Graves' {{concept of}} the Triple Goddess as employing violent and misandric imagery, and says the restrictive role this model places on creative women. Atwood says that it put her off being a writer. Atwood's work has been noted as containing Triple Goddess motifs who sometimes appear failed and parodic. Atwood's Lady Oracle has been cited as a deliberate parody of the Triple Goddess, which subverts the figure and ultimately liberates the lead female character from the oppressive model <b>of</b> <b>feminine</b> creativity that Graves constructed.|$|E
25|$|Masks {{may also}} {{indicate}} a culture's ideal <b>of</b> <b>feminine</b> beauty. The masks of Punu of Gabon have highly arched eyebrows, almost almond-shaped {{eyes and a}} narrow chin. The raised strip running {{from both sides of}} the nose to the ears represent jewellery. Dark black hairstyle, tops the mask off. The whiteness of the face represent the whiteness and beauty of the spirit world. Only men wear the masks and perform the dances with high stilts despite the masks representing women. One of the most beautiful representations of female beauty is the Idia's Mask of Benin in present-day Edo State of Nigeria. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask on his hip during special ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|Known in Przemyśl as the {{beautiful}} Rosenbach daughter, Helene {{was given the}} title of most 'brilliant {{enough to be a}} son.' It was in early childhood when Helene and her father began to experience tension in their relationship. Spurred by her thirst for education and her disdain for the life her mother planned for her, Helene turned to her father, only to find him unwilling to help her further her education past the age of fourteen. In her work, The Psychology of Women, Deutsch connects one aspect <b>of</b> <b>feminine</b> masochism with her attachment to her father and the possible consequences of such an identification. She writes that a father will sometimes break his relationship with his daughter when she approaches the age of sexual maturity. Helene later attributed her father's resistance to his subservience to his wife and desire for peace at home.|$|E
25|$|Kierski's {{research}} {{claimed that}} men do acknowledge that male fear <b>of</b> the <b>feminine</b> can have a strong influence on both hetero- and homosexual men.

In addition, this research has identified four possible groups of experiences that lead to male fear <b>of</b> the <b>feminine,</b> which relate to internal and external triggers.

2500|$|A later {{contributor}} is Chris Blazina, a psychodynamic {{psychologist and}} professor based at Tennessee State University. Blazina considers that [...] "the fear <b>of</b> the <b>feminine</b> helps define what is masculine" [...] (1997). In 1986, James O'Neil et al. theorized {{that the male}} fear <b>of</b> the <b>feminine</b> is a core aspect of the male psyche.
