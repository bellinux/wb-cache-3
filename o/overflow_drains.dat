50|$|As {{the roof}} was completed, the {{reflecting}} pool was constructed on top of it. The landscape architects Clarke and Rapuano designed the 22 in deep, 80 by 300 ft pool. The pool walls were 4 ft thick at the base, and tapered as they rose. A sheet of monel (a rustproof nickel alloy metal) was embedded in the wall, rising to within 5 in {{of the top of}} the wall. The entire wall was coated in epoxy as a waterproofer. Nine 118.5 ft steel girders acted both to support the pool above and the ceiling of the main exhibition hall below. These steel girders were nearly 8 ft below ground to accommodate the pool's construction. On top of the girders were double-tongued, prestressed, precast concrete T-beams. The tongue of each T-beam was 3 in thick, and the height of the T-beam 19 in. A 2 in thick layer of concrete was laid atop the T-beams, forming the floor of the pool. Five layers of roofing felt were laid atop the concrete floor, followed by a 6 in layer of perlite. A grid of concrete beams, each 6 by 13 in and over 30 ft long, was laid in the perlite to support the layers above. Inverted U-shaped drainage tiles were inserted between the beams to help remove any water which leaked from above. A 0.006 in thick sheet of polyethylene formed a moisture barrier above the perlite, and 6 in thick layer of concrete laid atop the moisture barrier. The bottom of the pool consisted of another five layers of roofing felt, on top of which were laid a 1.5 in thick layer of gravel. The gravel-impregnated grout was laid down in alternating grey and white sections (each section separated by a brass rail), to add visual distinctiveness {{to the bottom of the}} pool.

40|$|Leakage of {{contaminants}} to the subsurface {{is a potential}} threat to groundwater and {{is a major problem}} with storage tanks. When the contaminant reaches the groundwater, it can be subjected to subsurface flow due to which a contaminant plume may form and the contaminant can spread. In this research, it was investigated if a horizontal layer of reduced permeability can be engineered by using the SoSEAL (Soil Sealing by Enhanced Aluminium and DOM Leaching) concept to prevent leakage. Within SoSEAL, Aluminium-Dissolved Organic Matter complexation is used to clog the pore space with a reduction in permeability and hydraulic conductivity as a result. The concept is based on the natural process of podsolization in which a layer of reduced permeability (a hardpan) is formed by decades of organic matter leaching to the subsurface while complexing with metal cations. In this research, the complexation reaction using Aluminium-Chloride Hexahydrate and HUMIN-P 775 (Organic Matter) was investigated. The study roughly consisted of two parts, one concerning a situation of ideal mixing and one where the chemicals mixed inside a porous medium. When considering ideal mixing, eleven samples were created with 40 mL of Organic Matter solution and Aluminium solution in the range of 0 to 4 ml was added. These samples were created with an initial OM pH of 5, 7 and 9 to investigate the pH effect. The precipitation was quantified on the basis of measured pH, EC, UV 254 and weight. With UV 254 measurements it was found that 85 % of the organic matter is able to form precipitates by binding aluminium ions. Depending on the pH, the amount of aluminium which needed to be added to reach this 85 % varies. At a lower pH, less aluminium salt is needed to be added to form complexes with the available organic matter. The precipitation {{as a result of the}} complexation was also formed in the three-dimensional experimental set up. The chemicals were injected via horizontal drains and a flow was created towards an overflow drain. A narrow precipitation band of a few millimetres thick was formed at the contact interface of the aluminium and organic matter solutions. The Al-DOM precipitation was visualized with a 3 D interpretation of photographs of horizontal cross-sections in Matlab. The results of this interpretation showed that it was difficult to form an area-covering layer of precipitates. Most precipitation was shown near the injection- and <b>overflow</b> <b>drains,</b> this assumes that due to separation of flow no Al-DOM precipitation took place in the middle of the set-up. Due to the lack of an area-covering layer, a significant reduction of hydraulic conductivity could not be measured. An average reduction of about 25 - 30 % was measured. In COMSOL it was assumed that in ideal situations the precipitation band could cause a reduction in permeability of about two order of magnitude. The results of this research show that the SoSEAL concept, using HUMIN-P 775 and aluminium hexahydrate, can be used to form a horizontal layer of reduced permeability, but that it is challenging to create an area-covering layer due to separation of flow and preferential flow paths.

The approach has been designed to meet the challenges of fast growing urban areas around the world. Urban infrastructure systems, wastewater planning, Hanoi, semicentralised...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{professors in}} the study, the <b>overflowing</b> {{groundwater}} <b>drains</b> {{out of the}} old mine shafts, and flows down the stream channel. The drainage waters are more acidic than vinegar, with pH values around 2, and carry large loads of metals, including copper, zinc, and iron. In other areas of the country, similar acid-mine drainage from former coal or gold mines can mobilize additional undesirable contaminants. Researchers stress, however, that there is no threat to the local environment or the area's water supply, because the iron sulfide in the Davis mine contains few hazardous impurities. This makes the site an ideal subject for examining the natural processes that are contained in the drainage.Researchers say their findings may enable quicker natural cleanups not just at the Davis mine, but at others throughout the country and the world. The project has received a $1.59-million grant from the [...] "Biocomplexity in the Environment" [...] program of the National Science Foundation.|$|R
50|$|The wetland of the BaÃ±ados de Izozog in the Bolivian {{department}} of Santa Cruz receives {{most of its}} water from the ParapetÃ­ River, but also has other smaller tributaries from a predominantly western direction. Much {{of the water in}} the BaÃ±ados de Izozog eventually evaporates due to the high year-round temperatures. However, in wet years during the rainy season, the marshes <b>overflow</b> and <b>drain</b> into both the Quimome River which flows into ConcepciÃ³n Lake, and via the Itonomas River into the Amazon River, and a large proportion via surface flow and infiltration takes a southeasterly direction and enters the catchment area of the Paraguay River in the RÃ­o de la Plata Basin. On 17 September 2001, the wetlands of the ParapetÃ­ River and the BaÃ±ados del Izozog were designated under the Ramsar Convention and received international protection. Part of the wetlands was included within the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area.|$|R
50|$|The Shire Brook {{was heavily}} {{polluted}} for many years, as storm <b>drain</b> <b>overflow</b> took raw sewage into the brook {{and then into}} the River Rother which was {{known as one of the}} most polluted rivers in Europe in the early 1990s. In 2005/6 much work was done to control the overflow with several storm flow storage tanks built in the Shire Brook valley. Yorkshire Water were fined Â£5,000 plus costs when pumps failed at the Linley Bank Sewage Pumping Station, Hackenthorpe on 30 and 31 March 2006 allowing untreated sewage to affect a 800 m stretch of the brook.|$|R
