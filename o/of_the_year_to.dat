5|$|Some of Palairet's {{early success}} can be {{attributed}} to his father, who paid the professionals Frederick Martin and William Attewell, both later Wisden Cricketers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Year,</b> <b>to</b> bowl at his two sons during the Easter holidays, to help them prepare for the upcoming cricket season. During the later part of the 1889 season, Palairet made his first appearances for Somerset County Cricket Club. At the time, Somerset were a second-class county, and their fixture list that summer was against a variety of first- and second-class opposition. Although a Lancastrian by birth, Palairet's family home was at Cattistock in Dorset, and it was in the south west that he chose to play his cricket. On completion of his studies at Repton, he attended Oriel College, Oxford.|$|E
