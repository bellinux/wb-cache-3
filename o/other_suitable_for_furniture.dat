5000|$|By 1941 it {{had become}} {{apparent}} {{that the combination of}} a severe lack of timber <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>furniture</b> making (in which Britain was not self-sufficient) and the increased demand <b>for</b> new <b>furniture</b> due to the losses of housing caused by bombing and to the continuing establishment of new households after marriage, had created a severe furniture shortage.|$|R
25|$|Moderately {{refractory}} woods: These timbers show {{a moderate}} tendency {{to crack and}} split during seasoning. They can be seasoned free from defects with moderately rapid drying conditions (i.e. a maximum dry-bulb temperature of 85°C can be used). Examples are Sydney blue gum (E. saligna) and other timbers of medium density (Bootle, 1994), which are potentially <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>furniture.</b>|$|R
50|$|The wood of T. madagascariense is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>furniture,</b> and the sap {{yields a}} red dye. Its roasted seeds are eaten {{and it is}} {{sometimes}} cultivated. A methanol extract, fractions and isoliquiritigenin from T. madagascariense stem bark {{has been shown to}} possess antidiarrheal activities, and previously unknown trilepisflavan and trilepisuimic acid compounds were isolated from it in 2012. T. madagascariense is a larval foodplant for the butterfly Cyrestis camillus sublineata. On the Seychelles the seeds are likely dispersed by frugivorous birds and fruit bats, but the pollinators are unknown.|$|R
50|$|Madhuca motleyana is {{a tree in}} the Sapotaceae family. It {{grows up}} to 28 m tall, with a trunk {{diameter}} of up to 50 cm. The bark is greyish brown. Inflorescences bear up to 12 flowers. The fruits are ellipsoid, up to 2.5 cm long and ripen yellow then reddish. M. motleyana produces nyatoh timber, <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>furniture</b> making. The tree is named for the engineer and naturalist James Motley who {{lived and worked in}} Borneo in the 1850s. Habitat is swamps and forests from sea-level to 800 m altitude. M. motleyana is found in Thailand, Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo.|$|R

50|$|Lower grade timber is {{converted}} to pulp to make newsprint. Higher grade timber is used in house construction. Radiata is used chipped to make particle board sheets, commonly used in flooring. Other sheet products are hardboard, softboard and ply. Most ply is structural and available in 7-22 mm sizes. A small amount of higher grade ply is used to produce thinner (4 and 7 mm) ply <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>furniture,</b> cabinet work and boat building. This is knot and crack free and glued with resorcinol waterproof glue. Since the 1990s finger jointed joinery-grade wood has become available in up to 6 m lengths {{in a wide range}} of profiles.|$|R
50|$|It is {{harvested}} for its wood, {{which is}} light, soft, and whitish gray or pink-tinged in color. Its popularity rose after World War II when plywood was in demand, {{and during the}} mid-20th century {{it was one of}} the more valuable timbers in Central Africa. It is not very durable and tends to warp, but it is easy to cut and work and can be used for many purposes. It is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>furniture,</b> and in house construction as panelling, siding, roof shingles, and framing. It is used for fuel and paper pulp. The wood can be vulnerable to termites, powderpost beetles, and other pests.|$|R
50|$|Wicker {{is a kind}} of {{furniture}} woven from any one of a variety of cane-like materials, including rattan, willow, reed and bamboo. As such, it is not an actual material, but a technique. The word wicker is believed to be of Scandinavian origin: vika which means to bend in Swedish, and vikker meaning willow. Wicker is traditionally made of material of plant origin, but plastic fibers are now also used. Wicker is light yet sturdy, making it <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>furniture</b> that will be moved often like porch and patio furniture. A variety of plants are used such as reeds, grasses (including bamboo), creepers (including rattan), and thin tree branches (especially willow). Rushwork and wickerwork are terms used in England.|$|R

50|$|During the dynastic period, {{which began}} in around 3200 BC, Egyptian art {{developed}} significantly, and this included furniture design. Egyptian furniture was primarily constructed using wood, but other materials were sometimes used, such as leather, and pieces were often adorned with gold, silver, ivory and ebony, for decoration. Wood found in Egypt was not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>furniture</b> construction, so had to be imported into the country from other places, particularly Phoenicia. The scarcity of wood necessitated innovation in construction techniques. The use of scarf joints to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam was one example of this, as well as construction of veneers in which low quality cheap wood {{was used as the}} main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.|$|R
50|$|Both {{these species}} are sources of firewood, but the wood is also valued for its {{prominent}} veins, {{similar to that}} of the European olive though finer in texture. As hardwoods they are considered <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> flooring, <b>furniture,</b> carving, turning and veneers. The leaves have been used in folk medicine as an antibacterial, a property which has found some support in the laboratory.|$|R

40|$|The {{finiteness}} {{of fossil}} feedstock forces us today to tap bio-renewable sources for {{raw materials for}} the future chemical industry. The environmental consciousness leads to the usage of bio-renewable ingredients and substitution of solvent-borne coatings by water-borne products. Mini-emulsion polymerisation technique offers different advantages {{for the production of}} such water-borne binders. Acrylic dispersions with high amount of novel biobased monomers and synthesized by mini-emulsion are being investigated in cooperation with industrial partners at Fraunhofer WKI as binders for waterborne clear coats for wood and wood-based materials. From low-molecular saccharides as starting material radically polymerisable sugar methacrylates were copolymerised with commercial and renewable acrylic monomers by means of different emulsion polymerisation techniques and their properties were determined. The sugar based acrylic dispersions exhibit equal and also novel characteristics compared to the commercial petrochemical products and make them <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> example <b>for</b> <b>furniture</b> lacquers...|$|R

50|$|A {{synthetic}} varnish, cellulose nitrate, {{was developed}} in the 1850s but was not available in a formulation <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> commercial <b>furniture</b> until the late 1920s. Unfortunately, cellulose nitrate discolors and becomes brittle as it ages, so over time, the coating on furniture can turn yellow and opaque. It can also crisscross in some places by a fine network of cracks or the varnish can fall off completely. The early date and rarity of this original coating makes it important to retain the varnish on furniture despite these problems.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate basic and drying properties of three wood species from Indonesia, i. e. kuda (Lannea coromandelica Merr.), waru (Hibiscus tiliaceus L. and mindi besar (Melia dubia Cav.). The basic properties include density, shrinkages, modulus of rupture (MOR), compression parallel to grain (C//), wood strength and anatomical structures. Meanwhile, the drying properties included drying time and drying defects. The initial-final temperature and humidity for each species was based on defects that resulted from high temperature drying trial. The results showed that the drying properties were significantly affected by wood anatomical structure. The initial-final drybulb temperature and wetbulb depression for kuda wood are 50 - 70 ºC and 3 - 30 ºC respectively, while the corresponding figures for waru wood are 65 - 80 ºC and 6 - 30 ºC, and for mindi besar wood are 55 - 80 ºC and 4 - 30 ºC. These drying schedules, however, still need further trial prior to their implementation in the factory-scale operation. All wood species studied have density and considerable strength recommended in their use for light medium construction purposes.
