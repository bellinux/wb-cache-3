50|$|The USMC is {{the only}} {{component}} of the U.S. Armed Forces to currently have lance corporals. Promotion to lance corporal is based on time in grade, time in service, and {{the conduct of the}} Marine. Further promotion to the NCO ranks (Corporal and above) is competitive and takes into account the individual service record of the Marine. There can only be a certain number <b>of</b> <b>corporals</b> and sergeants in each MOS, so even with a qualifying score, promotions may be delayed due to an excessive number <b>of</b> <b>corporals</b> occupying billets in a certain MOS.|$|R
5|$|Many of the {{prisoner}}s were marched {{to the city of}} Trier, with the march taking as long as 20 days. Others were marched to the river Scheldt and were sent by barge to the Ruhr. The prisoners were then sent by rail to prisoner of war camps in Germany. The majority (those below the rank <b>of</b> <b>corporal)</b> then worked in German industry and agriculture {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Infantry Division, {{as part of}} the U. S. Seventh Army {{under the}} command of Lieutenant General George S. Patton, sailed from Tunisia on 7 July,1943, for the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily, landing at Licata on 10 July. Murphy was promoted to the rank <b>of</b> <b>corporal</b> on 15 July.

5|$|Because he {{was unable}} to afford {{university}} tuition, Truman had thought of going to the costless United States Military Academy at West Point, but he was refused an appointment because of poor eyesight. He enlisted in the Missouri Army National Guard in 1905, serving until 1911 in a Kansas City-based artillery battery and attaining the rank <b>of</b> <b>corporal.</b> At his induction, his eyesight had been an unacceptable 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness). The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.|$|E
5|$|Below centurion/decurion rank, junior {{officers}} in the Roman army were known as principales. An auxiliary cohort's ranks appear {{the same as in}} a legionary centuria. These were, in ascending order: tesserarius ("officer of the watch"), signifer (standard-bearer for the centuria), optio (centurion's deputy) and vexillarius (standard-bearer for the whole regiment, from vexillum). In the turmae of cohortes equitatae (and of alae?), the decurion's second-in-command was probably known as a curator, responsible for horses and caparison. As in the legions, the principales, together with some regimental specialists, were classified in two pay-scales: sesquiplicarii ("one-and-a-half-pay men") and duplicarii ("double-pay men"). These ranks are probably most closely resembled by the modern ranks <b>of</b> <b>corporal</b> and sergeant respectively.|$|E
5|$|Both Brown and {{his younger}} brother Tim set their sights on {{attending}} West Point, but their father advised taking a year of college first. Therefore, {{after graduating from high school}} in 1936, Brown enrolled in engineering at the University of Missouri where he joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon. A fine horseman, he played polo. He also enlisted in the 128th Field Artillery Battalion of the Missouri National Guard, rising to the rank <b>of</b> <b>corporal.</b> His father was able to secure a congressional appointment to the United States Military Academy from Kansas for him, and Brown entered on 1 July 1937.|$|E
50|$|In the Portuguese Army, the {{equivalent}} <b>of</b> a lance <b>corporal</b> rank {{used to be}} that of anspeçada. The rank of anspeçada was replaced, in the end of the 19th century, by the present rank <b>of</b> segundo-cabo (second <b>corporal),</b> the former rank <b>of</b> cabo (<b>corporal)</b> being renamed primeiro-cabo (first corporal).|$|R
50|$|At {{this meeting}} AFC Moodie was {{informed}} {{that he was being}} appointed acting officer in command of 101 ASP; three personnel staff files were handed to him, his own and those <b>of</b> <b>corporals</b> Van Heerden and Goosen.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Forces {{abolished}} the Canadian Army rank <b>of</b> lance <b>corporal</b> on their creation {{as a unified}} force in 1968. The rank of trained private equates to OR-3 and wears the single chevron, but has no command authority. In terms of actual authority, the current appointment <b>of</b> Master <b>Corporal</b> equates most directly to the pre-unification appointment <b>of</b> lance <b>corporal.</b> In both cases, this rank was granted to the second-in-command of an infantry section.|$|R
5|$|Chenevix-Trench {{was known}} for his {{substantial}} tenures as headmaster of Bradfield College, Eton College and Fettes College; he had also taught at Shrewsbury School. He died in 1979. In 1994, a book by Tim Card, a former Vice-Provost of Eton, revealed {{for the first time that}} Chenevix-Trench had not left his position as headmaster of Eton of his own accord. There followed some newspaper articles critical of Chenevix-Trench's use <b>of</b> <b>corporal</b> punishment, and numerous letters to the editor in response, most of which were positive about Chenevix-Trench's legacy. Peel, a teacher at Fettes College at the time, published The Land of Lost Content two years later.|$|E
5|$|Cleburne {{was born}} in Ovens, County Cork, Ireland, the second son of Dr. Joseph Cleburne, a middle-class {{physician}} of Anglo-Irish ancestry.

5000|$|Leading rating (or leading rate) is {{the most}} senior of the junior rates in the Royal Navy. It is equal in status to {{corporal}} although as the Royal Navy is the [...] "Senior Service", a leading rate, of any branch CAN take charge <b>of</b> <b>corporals</b> <b>of</b> {{any of the other}} two services. The rate was introduced under the authority of Admiralty Circular No. 121 of 14 June 1853.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1989, {{the first}} of 5 trials for the murder <b>of</b> <b>Corporals</b> Derek Wood and Robert Howes, often {{referred}} to as the Corporals killings, was held. Henry Maguire and Alex Murphy denied a total of nine charges including the assault, causing of grievous bodily harm, false imprisonment and murder <b>of</b> the <b>corporals.</b> Ronald Appleton, QC, for prosecution said that it was the Crown's case that Maguire and Murphy [...] "were part of a smaller crowd...that were engaged in a joint enterprise to kill".|$|R

5|$|On 6 August 1915, Whittle {{transferred}} to the Australian Imperial Force {{in order to see}} active service overseas during the war. Allotted as a reinforcement to the 26th Battalion as a private, he embarked from Melbourne on 27 October aboard HMAT Ulysses bound for Egypt. Appointed acting corporal soon after arrival, he was reallocated to the 12th Battalion with the rank of private on 1 March 1916, following a period of divisional reorganisation and expansion to the Australian forces which were now stationed in Egypt.

5|$|On November 6/7, 1917, Pegahmagabow {{earned a}} Bar to his Military Medal {{for his actions}} in the Second Battle of Passchendaele. During the fighting, Pegahmagabow's {{battalion}} was given the task of launching an attack at Passchendaele. By this time, he had been promoted to the rank <b>of</b> <b>corporal</b> and during the battle he was recorded playing an important role as {{a link between the}} units on the 1st Battalion's flank. When the battalion's reinforcements became lost, Pegahmagabow was instrumental in guiding them and ensuring that they reached their allocated spot in the line.|$|E
5|$|Quintilian {{provides}} the most extensive theory of primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, each child has in-born ingenium, a talent for learning or linguistic intelligence that {{is ready to be}} cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and imitate. The child incapable of learning was rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also recognized the importance of play in child development, and disapproved <b>of</b> <b>corporal</b> punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children with a cane (ferula) or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.|$|E

5|$|The Faraway Trees Dame Slap, {{who made}} regular use <b>of</b> <b>corporal</b> punishment, {{was changed to}} Dame Snap who no longer did so, {{and the names of}} Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie. Characters in the Malory Towers and St. Clare's series are no longer spanked or {{threatened}} with a spanking, but are instead scolded. References to George's short hair making her look like a boy were removed in revisions to Five on a Hike Together, reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal. Anne of The Famous Five stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girl's dolls was removed.|$|E
