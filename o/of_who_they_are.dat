Walter redeems himself and black pride at the end by changing his mind and not accepting the buyout offer, stating that the family is proud <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> and will try to be good neighbors.

25|$|Burns v. Hickenlooper is a {{same-sex}} marriage case filed on July 1, 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs are six same-sex couples {{who have been}} legally married in another state but whose marriage Colorado does not legally recognize or who have been refused a Colorado marriage license, solely because <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> The main defendants, the state governor and attorney general, agree with the plaintiffs insofar as having the court issue an injunction declaring the {{same-sex marriage}} ban unconstitutional, but they want a stay and swift resolution by the U.S. Supreme Court {{in order to avoid}} costly litigation.|$|E
25|$|Understanding {{consumer}} {{personality and}} how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of {{the harmful effects of}} binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends.|$|E

2500|$|Hindu {{philosophy}} has {{the concept of}} a third sex or third gender (tritiya-prakriti – literally, [...] "third nature"). This category includes a wide range of people with mixed male and female natures such as effeminate males, masculine females, transgender people, transsexual people, the intersexed, androgynes, and so on. However, the original nature of third-gender {{has nothing to do with}} sexual orientation as is reported by the sects of modern LGBT and contemporary west. Third-genders have no connection with sex among men (which is universal). Third-genders are of a different gender from males and females because they have a female inside regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> sexually attracted to. Many MTF third-genders are not attracted only or at all to men, but are attracted either exclusively to women or are bisexual. Many FTM transgender people are attracted to men. [...] Such persons are not considered fully male or female in traditional Hinduism, being a combination of both. They are mentioned as third sex by nature (birth) and are not expected to behave like ordinary men and women. They often keep their own societies or town quarters, perform specific occupations (such as masseurs, hairdressers, flower-sellers, domestic servants, etc.) and are generally attributed a semi-divine status. Their participation in religious ceremonies, especially as crossdressing dancers and devotees of certain temple gods/goddesses, is considered auspicious in traditional Hinduism. Some Hindus believe that third-sex people have special powers allowing them to bless or curse others.|$|E
