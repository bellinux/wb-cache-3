5|$|As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Schuman was {{instrumental}} in turning French policy away from the Gaullist policy of permanent occupation or control <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> German territory such as the Ruhr or the Saar. Despite stiff ultra-nationalist, Gaullist and communist opposition, the French Assembly voted a number of resolutions in favour of his new policy of integrating Germany into a community. The International Authority for the Ruhr changed in consequence. Schuman's guiding principles were moral, based on the equality of states (international democracy), not the power politics of domination.|$|E

5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the mouth.

Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in 1375, the See of Sis {{experienced}} decline and disarray. The Catholicosate of Aghtamar and the locally influential Syunik bishops enhanced the importance of the region around Etchmiadzin. In 1441 a general council of several hundred religious figures met in Etchmiadzin and voted to reestablish a catholicosate there. The cathedral was restored by Catholicos Kirakos (Cyriacus) between 1441 and 1443. At that time Etchmiadzin was {{under the control of the}} Turkic Kara Koyunlu, but in 1502, Safavid Iran gained control <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Armenia, including Etchmiadzin, and granted the Armenian Church some privileges.|$|E
