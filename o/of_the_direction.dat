5|$|At the time, {{immunology}} {{was becoming}} more sophisticated, with the increasing role of molecular biology and biochemistry. Burnet was suspicious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> in which immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude {{was a factor in}} his decision to turn the institute's focus to immunology.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} the whim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of the winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow to move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was {{the design of a}} large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E
5|$|Orientation {{behaviour}} {{studies have}} been traditionally carried out using variants of a setup known as the Emlen funnel, which consists of a circular cage with the top covered by glass or wire-screen so that either the sky is visible or the setup is placed in a planetarium or with other controls on environmental cues. The orientation behaviour of the bird inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves {{on the walls of}} the cage. Other approaches used in pigeon homing studies make use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> in which the bird vanishes on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|On 12 October 1917, the 34th Battalion—as {{a member}} of the 9th Brigade—was {{to take part in the}} 3rd Australian Division's attack on Passchendaele, Belgium. Subject to several days of heavy rain, the {{battlefield}} had been transformed into a boggy marsh on which the attack was to commence. Jeffries commanded B Company during the attack, which he halted at the entrance to Broodseinde railway cutting, as many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> tapes leading to the starting position had been destroyed or swallowed up by the mud. To avoid any mishaps, Jeffries and another of the battalion's company commanders, Captain T.G. Gilder, pushed on alone as far as Keerselaarhoek cemetery to find the tapes marking the battalions starting line for the attack. Thus, by 03:00 the 34th Battalion was formed up on the line of attack.|$|E
5|$|On October22, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for the island of Hispaniola and {{a tropical storm}} watch for Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. The tropical storm watch was quickly upgraded to a tropical storm warning. In the Dominican Republic, authorities ordered the evacuation of at least 30,000people living in areas where flooding was possible. On October22 and 23, the Haitian government ordered level 1 and then level 2 alerts for the county in anticipation of Tropical Storm Alpha's rainfall. Haiti was already experiencing flooding from Hurricane Wilma's passage between October8 and 19, so the threat of more rainfall was particularly dire. The country's Centre National de Meteorologie issued weather bulletins through existing media distribution channels with clear instructions on how residences should prepare for floods and landslides. The local government of Sud-Est ordered the evacuation of its capital city, Jacmel. The national government mobilized personnel and resources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Direction</b> of Civil Protection, the Secrétariat Permanent de Gestion des Risques et des Désastres (SPGRD), and the National Police to pre-arranged Emergency Operation Centres.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1758, the French and Indian War {{had gone}} very poorly for the British, whose {{military}} met few of its objectives. Following {{a string of}} French victories in 1757 in North America, coupled with military setbacks in Europe, William Pitt gained full control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of British military efforts in the Seven Years' War. Embarking on a strategy that emphasized defense in Europe, where France was strong, and offense in North America, where France was weak, he resolved to attack New France (the colonial holdings of France in North America) in three strategic campaigns. Large-scale campaigns were planned to capture Fort Duquesne on the Pennsylvania frontier and the fortress at Louisbourg (on Île-Royale, now known as Cape Breton Island). The third campaign, assigned to General James Abercrombie, was to launch an attack against Canada through the Champlain Valley. Pitt probably {{would have preferred to}} have George Howe, a skilled tactician and a dynamic leader, lead this expedition, but seniority and political considerations led him to appoint the relatively undistinguished Abercrombie instead. Howe was appointed a brigadier general, and placed as Abercrombie's second in command.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate {{the direction of the}} wind. At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} destruction caused to {{the city}} by the tornado was to the town's business district, a three-block stretch of Main Street between First and Fourth Street lined with stores, offices and tenements built of brick and stone. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> the storm had approached the city from and the angle at which it entered the city, the tornado virtually swallowed the entire business district. It was here that {{a large majority of}} the fatalities occurred, as many of those who thought they would be safe {{within the confines of the}} reinforced structures were killed by cascades of falling debris as the buildings on Main Street were swept away. A 1.5-ton safe from the city bank was thrown a full block away. Probably one of the greatest demonstrations of the tornado's strength was seen at the Nicollet Hotel, a newly constructed three-story brick building located adjacent to the Willow River. The tornado swept the building clean down to the foundation, killing at least five people. Almost simultaneously, the town's Methodist Church was completely obliterated, the only remnant being the 1.1-ton cast iron bell, which was found nearly 200 feet from the church foundation. As the tornado cleared Main Street, it tore the iron-frame bridge spanning the Willow River from its fitting and onto the adjacent riverbank in a twisted heap. The City Hall was completely flattened, the adjacent water tower sent toppling to the northeast and dumping its contents into First Street and transforming it into a muddy deluge. The tornado then moved into the east side of New Richmond, where many of the city's working class residents lived. As many as forty homes in this neighborhood were completely obliterated, leaving the neighborhood virtually unrecognizable. Within a period of roughly seven to ten minutes, over half of New Richmond was laid to ruins.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} life was {{improved}} with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century AD had invented the papermaking process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the wheelbarrow aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime junk ship and stern-mounted steering rudder enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the grid reference for maps and raised-relief map allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. In medicine, they used new herbal remedies to cure illnesses, calisthenics to keep physically fit, and regulated diets to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of sudden earthquakes with {{the invention of the}} seismometer that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive pendulum device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese used two variations of the lunisolar calendar, which were established due to efforts in astronomy and mathematics. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of square roots, cube roots, the Pythagorean theorem, Gaussian elimination, the Horner scheme, improved calculations of pi, and negative numbers. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and pontoon bridges. Han ruins of defensive city walls made of brick or rammed earth still stand today.|$|E
