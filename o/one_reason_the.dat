5|$|Fearing {{retribution}} {{for their}} actions, the mutineers decided {{to navigate the}} ship toward Spanish waters. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> master's life was spared was that Turner could not navigate the ship properly without his help. The Hermione sailed to La Guaira, where they handed the ship over to the Spanish authorities. The mutineers claimed they had set the officers adrift in a small boat, as {{had happened in the}} mutiny on the Bounty some eight years earlier. The Spanish gave the mutineers just 25 dollars each in return, and presented them with the options of joining the Spanish army, heavy labour, or refitting their ship. The Spaniards took Hermione into service under the name Santa Cecilia; her crew included 25 of her former crew, who remained under Spanish guard.|$|E
5|$|Peckham laid {{stress on}} discipline, which often {{resulted}} {{in conflict with}} his clergy. His first episcopal act was calling a council at Reading in July 1279 to implement ecclesiastical reform, but Peckham's specifying that a copy of Magna Carta should be hung in all cathedral and collegiate churches offended the king as an unnecessary intrusion into political affairs. Another ruling was on non-residence of clergy in their livings. The only exception Peckham was prepared to make on non-residence was if the clerk needed to go abroad to study. At the Parliament of Winchester in 1279, the archbishop compromised and Parliament invalidated any regulation of the council dealing with royal policies or power. The copies of Magna Carta were taken down. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> archbishop may have backed down {{was that he was}} in debt to the Italian banking family of the Riccardi, who also were bankers to Edward and the pope, and Peckham was under threat of excommunication from the pope unless he repaid the loans.|$|E
5|$|The Story of Seasons {{video game}} series was {{originally}} produced by Victor Interactive Software (acquired by Marvelous Interactive in 2002), with Natsume handling the English translation and distribution in North America. The series debuted in Japan on August 9, 1996 with , which later {{was released in}} the North American and PAL regions as Harvest Moon. Story of Seasons {{is a series of}} farm simulation/role-playing video games where the main objective is to maintain a farm over a period of time, tending the crops and livestock throughout the seasons, while befriending the nearby townsfolk and getting married in some games. Story of Seasons titles have been released on numerous different video game consoles and handheld game consoles. Several titles have been re-released on multiple platforms as special editions which include an updated gameplay. Fourteen spin-off titles have been released, featuring related elements. One of these titles, , was released to mark the 10th anniversary of the Story of Seasons series. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> Story of Seasons series has remained popular is because of the unchanged core system of the games. According to Yasuhiro Wada, Story of Seasons lead designer, it has been the development team's response to the audience's requests which have allowed the series to maintain its popularity.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> banking {{industry}} {{has not been}} fully globalized {{is that it is}} more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals.

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> {{high cost}} of health care yields disappointing results is because only 0.05 percent of health care dollars are spent on {{assessing}} how well new health care technology works. This is largely because health care lobbyists oppose such research. For example, when the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research found that there was little evidence to support common back operations, orthopedic and neurosurgeons lobbied to cut funding for such research.|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} Highway9 between Kincardine and the {{junction}} with Yonge Street in Walkerton was built originally as the Durham Settlement Road or Durham Road for short. The Durham Road was surveyed and constructed between 1849 and 1851. It {{extended from the}} border between present-day Grey Highlands, Grey County and Clearview, Simcoe County, south of Singhampton, through Flesherton (on the then Toronto–Sydenham Settlement Road, today Highway10), Durham (on the Garafraxa Settlement Road, today Highway6, and <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> road took its name), Hanover and Walkerton to Kincardine.|$|E

25|$|The Loebner Prize {{provides}} an annual platform for practical Turing Tests {{with the first}} competition held in November 1991. It is underwritten by Hugh Loebner. The Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies in Massachusetts, United States, organised the prizes {{up to and including}} the 2003 contest. As Loebner described it, <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> competition was created is to advance the state of AI research, at least in part, because no one had taken steps to implement the Turing Test despite 40 years of discussing it.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of operating in Sicily, most of the First Punic War was fought at sea, including the most decisive battles. But <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> war bogged down into stalemate on the landward side was because ancient navies were ineffective at maintaining seaward blockades of enemy ports. Consequently, Carthage was able to reinforce and re-supply its besieged strongholds, especially Lilybaeum, on the western end of Sicily. Both sides of the conflict had publicly funded fleets. This fact compromised Carthage and Rome's finances and eventually decided the course of the war.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008, a {{slowdown}} in passenger traffic led the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority to curtail spending plans, including deferring multimillion-dollar construction projects. The weak economy continued to affect the airport in 2010, with figures showing a 6% decline in passengers {{for the fiscal year}} ending June 30. The slowdown is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> airport authority scrapped plans to spend $4 million to erect barriers at the west end of the runway. In 2000, a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 flight with 142 persons aboard overshot the runway and went through the fence, coming to a stop on Hollywood Way near a Chevron gas station.|$|E

25|$|An {{innovative}} use of {{the diamond}} anvil cell is testing the sustainability and durability of life under high pressures.

When panspermia occurs, there is high pressure upon impact and the DAC can replicate this pressure. Another reason the DAC is applicable for testing life on extrasolar planets is that planetary bodies that hold the potential for life may have incredibly high pressure on their surface.|$|E
25|$|The Black Bike Week rally, {{originally}} {{called the}} Atlantic Beach Memorial Day BikeFest, {{was founded in}} Atlantic Beach by the Flaming Knight Riders motorcycle club in 1980. The first rally drew about 100 participants. Though <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> Flaming Knight Riders worked with the City of Atlantic Beach to create the event was to make money for the town, it was not actually franchised by Atlantic Beach, and the city did not benefit financially; instead, bikers would, over the years, congregate {{more and more in}} Myrtle Beach rather than Atlantic Beach. In 1982 the Flaming Knight Riders was renamed the Carolina Knight Riders motorcycle club.|$|E
25|$|The Tomlinson coupler was {{developed}} by the Ohio Brass Company for mass transit applications, but eventually found use in some mainline railroad vehicles as well. It consists of two squared metal hooks that engage with each other in a larger rectangular frame with air line connections above and below. Since the coupler's development the manufacturing arm of Ohio Brass was purchased by WABCO which now manufacturers the line along with the N-type. The Tomlinson coupler is the most widely used fully automatic heavy rail coupling in North America having been adopted by the DC Metro, MBTA, PATCO Speedline, SEPTA Broad Street Subway, LA Metro, Baltimore Metro, Miami Metro, MARTA Rail and the New York City Subway for its R44/R46 fleet and all modern classes starting with the R142. For applications outside of rapid transit the coupler had to be significantly enlarged to meet the increased strength requirements first appearing in this capacity on the Budd Metroliner and later on the Illinois Central Highliner fleet. Its relative lack of strength is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> N-Type has been more successful in the mainline railroad arena.|$|E

500|$|Coal for {{the steam}} locomotives, the power station at Neasden and local {{gasworks}} {{were brought in}} via Quainton Road.

Fish to Billingsgate Market via the Met and the District joint station at Monument caused some complaints, leaving the station approaches in an [...] "indescribably filthy condition". The District suggested a separate entrance for the fish, but nothing was done. The traffic reduced significantly when the GCR introduced road transport to Marylebone, but the problem remained until 1936, being <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> LPTB gave for abolishing the carrying of parcels on Inner Circle trains.|$|E

500|$|The {{change from}} full motion video to {{computer}} generated characters in End of Ages was well received.

IGN's Juan Castro said that the characters felt more real than the full motion video actors of previous games; <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>the</b> reviewer stated, was because the actors spoke their lines with real conviction. Gamezone credited each character's individualized body language as contributing to their realism. GameSpot stated that Esher moved and acted like a real person, and that the voice of David Ogden Stiers brought [...] "this interesting character to life"; the reviewer did feel that the revelation of Esher and Yeesha's motivations was a letdown, as the character's true motivations were revealed [...] "with all the unpleasant abruptness of turning on bright, fluorescent lights in a dark room."

500|$|WWE 2K Games (formerly WWF SmackDown!, WWE SmackDown!, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw, and WWE Games) is {{a series}} of {{professional}} wrestling video games based on the American professional wrestling promotion WWE. The series was first published by THQ until 2013, when Take-Two Interactive's 2K Sports took over. Games in the series are primarily developed by the Japanese based company, Yuke's. The series was published by Yuke's and known as Exciting Pro Wrestling in Japan until 2005. Following SmackDown vs. Raw 2007, THQ took over as the Japanese publisher and the series adopted the western name. Initially, the series was exclusive to PlayStation video game consoles, and was featured in all of the seventh generation consoles by 2008. The SmackDown! series is among the best-selling video game franchises with 47 million copies shipped as of 2009. The game engine for the series is based on that used by the Japanese professional wrestling video game series, Toukon Retsuden and Rumble Roses, a fictional professional wrestling series, both developed by Yuke's. THQ and Yuke's Future Media Creators consider <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> series has remained so popular is due to series bringing [...] "WWE programming to life through a host of key new features, extensive rosters with WWE's most popular Superstars, incredible graphics and engaging action in and beyond the ring." ...|$|E
