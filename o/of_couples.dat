5|$|The quadrille is a {{dance form}} {{that is an}} {{important}} symbol of French Antillean culture, not just in Dominica, but also Martinique, Guadeloupe and other Francophone islands. Dominican quadrilles are traditionally performed by four sets <b>of</b> <b>couples</b> in subscription picnics or dances, and in private parties.

5|$|According to the 2006 Canadian census, {{there were}} 10,994 {{people living in}} 4,650 {{households}} within the city (the official provincial estimate was 11,093 people). Of the federally surveyed households, 33% were one-person households, slightly above the 28% average provincewide; households consisting <b>of</b> <b>couples</b> with children, at 26%, were {{very close to the}} provincial average; and households <b>of</b> <b>couples</b> without children, at 24%, were below the provincial average of 30%. Among its 3,000 census families, Dawson Creek had a smaller proportion of married couples than the province, 62% compared to 73%, but the same average number of persons per family, 2.9. With 92% of Dawson Creek residents being Canadian-born, and 93% speaking only English, the city has few visible minorities. Only 17% of residents aged 35–64 had a university certificate or diploma, compared to the provincewide rate of 29%. Among those aged 25–64, 20% did not have a high school certificate or equivalent, much higher than the 12% provincewide rate.|$|E

5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} methods involve {{determining the}} most fertile {{days of the}} menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse. Techniques for determining fertility include monitoring basal body temperature, cervical secretions, or {{the day of the}} cycle. They have typical first-year failure rates of 24%; perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4% to 5%. The evidence on which these estimates are based, however, is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early. Globally, they are used by about 3.6% <b>of</b> <b>couples.</b> If based on both basal body temperature and another primary sign, the method is referred to as symptothermal. Overall first-year failure rates of <2% to 20% have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method.|$|E
5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% <b>of</b> <b>couples</b> who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E
5|$|While less {{used in the}} {{developed}} countries than the developing world, the number of women using IUDs as of 2007 was more than 180million.

As of 2005, 12% <b>of</b> <b>couples</b> are using a male form of birth control (either condoms or a vasectomy) with higher rates in {{the developed}} world.
