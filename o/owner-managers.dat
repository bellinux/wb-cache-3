50|$|Lifestyle {{businesses}} {{typically have}} limited scalability and potential for growth because such growth {{would destroy the}} lifestyle for which their <b>owner-managers</b> set them up. However, lifestyle businesses can and do win awards and provide satisfaction to their owners and customers. If sufficient high-quality creative producers begin to naturally cluster together, such as in Brighton, England, during the 1990s, the perception of a place can be radically changed (see Porter's cluster).|$|E
30|$|In the <b>owner-manager</b> category, the {{individual}} characteristics, the technical abilities, the weak social links, {{the motivation for}} the business starting and the owner’s values, are essential during the life cycle stages, and {{will have an impact}} on the <b>owner-manager’s</b> life and business’ project. The growth demands new know-hows and abilities and requires changes on the organizational structure, increasingly moving the <b>owner-manager</b> away from the operational activities.|$|R
30|$|Managerial {{knowledge}} {{becomes increasingly}} more important throughout the OLC and gains the highest relevance during the survival stage (2), mainly because the <b>owner-manager</b> needs {{to decide between}} increasing the business size or keeping it at its current size. During the two first stages (0 and 1), the amount of resources is still low and an <b>owner-manager’s</b> personal control can be enough and efficient. However, as the business evolves, it becomes more complex, demanding the <b>owner-manager</b> to acquire new abilities on finances, performance standards and efficient mobilization of the available resources, among other ones (Greiner 1998; Steinmetz 1969). The development of organizational competence will also depend on the <b>owner-manager</b> and his/her team’s know-how.|$|R
30|$|Risk taken, as an {{important}} part of individual characteristics, was mentioned by just one <b>owner-manager</b> (EB) during interviews. Although fear was part of decision-making when it comes to expand the business (reaching out stage 2) this <b>owner-manager</b> felt secure because of the financial support of her physician husband. Risk taken is inherent in business activity (Duchesneau and Gartner 1990; EL Kalak and Hudson 2016; Seppa 2014), but it has to come along with a financial backup, as said by EB <b>owner-manager.</b>|$|R

50|$|Researchers {{and analysts}} of small or owner-managed {{businesses}} generally behave as if nominal organizational forms (e.g., partnership, sole-trader, or corporation), {{and the consequent}} legal and accounting boundaries of owner-managed firms are consistently meaningful. However, <b>owner-managers</b> often do not delineate their behavior to accord with the implied separation between their personal and business interests. Lenders also often contract around organizational (corporate) boundaries by seeking personal guarantees or accepting privately held assets as collateral. Because of this behavior, researchers and analysts may wish to be cautious {{in the way they}} assess the organizational types and implied boundaries in contexts relating to owner-managed firms. These include analyses that use traditional accounting disclosures, and studies that view the firm as defined by some formal organizational structure.|$|E

Isaac Pennock, a son or grandson of Joseph, started in the iron business in the 1790s. The business expanded under his son-in-law, Dr. Charles Lukens, and after Lukens's death in 1825, under Isaac's daughter, Rebecca Pennock Lukens. She {{was one of the first}} women <b>owner-managers</b> of a major industrial enterprise in the United States. After Rebecca's retirement in 1847, the business was run by her son-in-law Dr. Charles Huston. Stewart Huston, Charles's grandson, was a long-time executive of Lukens Steel and the last occupent of Primitive Hall, with ownership of the house never having left the family.

5000|$|Though the {{district}} court considered it [...] "unfair and a waste of judicial resources" [...] for the defendant to raise the issue after trial had already been conducted, the court nevertheless ordered both parties to conduct post-trial discovery on the issue, because objections to subject matter jurisdiction could be raised at any stage of litigation. [...] After converting the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment, {{the district}} court determined that the employer criteria were not satisfied, because Y&H's delivery drivers, <b>owner-managers,</b> and their shareholder wives were not [...] "employees" [...] for Title VII purposes, and the company could not meet the requirement without their inclusion. The court vacated its prior judgment in favor of Arbaugh, dismissed her Title VII claim with prejudice, and her state-law claims without prejudice.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem for}} many small {{businesses}} is termed the 'Entrepreneurial Myth' or E-Myth. The mythic {{assumption is that}} an expert in a given technical field will also be expert at running that kind of business. Additional business management skills are needed to keep a business running smoothly. Some of this misunderstanding arises from the failure to distinguish between small business managers as entrepreneurs or capitalists. While nearly all <b>owner-managers</b> of small firms are obliged to {{assume the role of}} capitalist, only a minority will act as entrepreneur. The line between an owner-manager and an entrepreneur can be defined by whether or not their business is growth oriented. In general, small business owners are primarily focused on surviving rather than growing; therefore, not experiencing the five stages of the corporate life cycle (birth, growth, maturity, revival, and decline) like an entrepreneur would.|$|E
5000|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of Portugal's loss of managerial resources is contained in Harry M. Makler's follow-up surveys of 306 enterprises, conducted in July 1976, and again in June 1977. His study makes clear that nationalization was greater in the modern, large, and technically advanced industries than in the traditional ones such as textiles, apparel, and construction. In small enterprises (50-99 employees), only 15 percent of the industrialists left as compared with 43 percent in the larger organizations. In the largest firms (1,000 or more employees), more than half left. Makler's calculations show that the higher the socioeconomic class of the person, the greater the likelihood that they had left the firm. He also notes that [...] "the more upwardly mobile also {{were more likely to}} have quit than those who were downwardly socially mobile." [...] Significantly, a much larger percentage of professional managers (52 percent) compared with owners of production such as founders (18%), heirs (21%), and <b>owner-managers</b> (32%) had left their enterprises.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates how {{a strong}} personal relationship (strong tie) between {{a small business}} <b>owner-manager</b> and his professional or informal advisor affects {{the relationship between the}} advisor's recent performance and the <b>owner-manager's</b> perceptions of the advisor's trustworthiness in terms of ability, benevolence and integrity. A negative moderating effect could point to a 'tie that blinds': the <b>owner-manager</b> may be less critical in evaluating the advisor's perceived trustworthiness in light of their recent performance, because of the existing personal relationship. A conceptual model is constructed and examined with survey data comprising 153 young Finnish businesses. The results show that strong ties increase the <b>owner-manager's</b> perception of the advisor's integrity, disregarding their recent performance. For professional advisors, strong ties reduce the impact of recent performance in the <b>owner-manager's</b> evaluation of their ability. For informal advisors, a strong tie makes it more likely that their benevolence will be evaluated highly in light of their recent performance. While the results show that 'ties can blind' under certain circumstances, the limitations of the study raise the need for further research to specify these contextual factors and examine the causal link between the choice of advisor and business performance...|$|R
50|$|Chain was {{a member}} of the Earth First! {{environmental}} advocacy group and was engaged on a campaign of tree sitting in order to stop what they considered was illegal logging, in breach of California Forest Practices Act, in the Headwaters Forest, 350 miles north of San Francisco, near Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park. Headwaters was the largest private holding of old-growth forest in the world. Following a hostile takeover of Pacific Lumber Co., the Murphy family (the largest minority stock holders at the time) and countless previous stockholders, mostly company employees, were relieved of their stock by Charles Hurwitz and his Maxxam, Inc. corporation of Texas. Between a desire to turn a higher profit and the need to start paying off the debt incurred from acquiring the company, Hurwitz's Maxxam replaced the sustainable growth policy of the previous <b>owner-managers</b> with one of clearcutting. The new practices led to the so-called Redwood Summer campaign by environmentalists, and ultimately forced the 140-year-old company to declare bankruptcy.|$|E

In this paper we use a unique dataset and investigate how Swedish <b>owner-managers</b> invest remaining wealth conditional on a major investment in their own firm.

Instead some <b>owner-managers</b> invest remaining wealth in the industry where they already have a substantial capital investment.

30|$|The <b>owner-manager</b> {{represents}} {{the core of}} the business, the main supplier of energy, direction and capital for the company (Adizes 1997; Churchill and Lewis 1983), requiring from him/her unlimited dedication (Adizes 1997; Greiner 1998), mainly during the first two stages. During the third stage, the dedication tends to be more moderate, with other people arriving to “help the <b>owner-manager</b> carry the weight”. The availability factor for the hard work shows a behaviour that is similar to the dedication one. During stages zero and 1, the company is heavily dependent on the <b>owner-manager,</b> demanding from him/her the availability to carry out any kind of task.|$|R

30|$|Two main {{mortality}} factors {{appears in}} the literature: the first one focused on internal and external aspects and the second related to the small business <b>owner-manager,</b> the SME itself and environmental aspects (Arasti et al. 2014; Bruderl et al. 1992; Bumgardner et al. 2011; Carter and Van Auken 2006; Franco-Ángel and Pulido 2010; Garcia-Posada and Mora-Sanguinetti 2013; Machado and Espinha 2005, 2007, 2010; Rogoff et al. 2004; Santini et al. 2015; Sten, Sten 1998; Zacharakis et al. 1999).

40|$|URL] audienceGiven the {{economic}} importance {{of small and}} medium enterprises (SMEs), public authorities are seeking ways to improve support for SME <b>owner-managers.</b> Each year, considerable funds are budgeted to help small businesses, {{and the number of}} SME support organizations has steadily grown. Despite all these efforts, however, SME survival rates have barely improved, if at all. There may be a good reason for this: entrepreneurs and SME <b>owner-managers</b> do not make maximum use of the services available. Results from a survey of 70 SME <b>owner-managers</b> show that the main barrier is lack of knowledge about the agencies providing the services. On the one hand, many <b>owner-managers</b> do not seem to understand the utility or relevance of the services, while on the other they do not seem to know enough about the agencies working in their region. However, most of the <b>owner-managers</b> who had used the agencies felt the services they had received were appropriate to their needs. At first glance, the problem thus appears to lie more with the perceptions of certain <b>owner-managers</b> than with the nature or quality of the services themselves...|$|E

40|$|Public {{authorities}} {{throughout the}} world, recognizing both {{the importance and}} fragility of SMEs, have over the years created agencies and set up numerous venture development support and assistance measures. Despite all these efforts, SME <b>owner-managers</b> {{do not appear to}} make maximum use of the services available. Results from a survey of 70 SME <b>owner-managers</b> show that the likelihood of an SME using public support services increases as the perceived usefulness of public agencies and their services increases, and as the level of knowledge of public agencies increases. Furthermore, the probability of using public support services decreases as the experience of the owner-manager increases. On one hand, many <b>owner-managers</b> do not seem to understand the utility or relevance of the services the agencies provide, while on the other, they do not seem to know enough about the agencies working in their region.

30|$|During stage 1, {{supervision}} {{is direct}} and during stage 2, hierarchy is initiated, with the <b>owner-manager</b> coordinating the supervisors’ activities (Churchill and Lewis 1983; Scott and Bruce 1987); the business grew and the <b>owner-manager</b> needs {{to share some}} tasks, as he/she is unable to solve all problems alone. From stage 2, control increases, and is exercised by the owner, by the market and by the formal processes which start to appear, even timidly, during {{this stage of the}} life cycle. As observed by Galbraith (1982), inadequate structure represents one of the main problems that lead to the closure of businesses. In most cases, the <b>owner-manager</b> is not prepared or does not wish to have the organizational structure redesigned.|$|R
30|$|Managerial {{abilities}} (technical, {{human and}} conceptual) are influential {{during the three}} stages. As the <b>owner-manager</b> {{plays the role of}} the main actor, he/she will need the three abilities simultaneously. However, the <b>owner-manager’s</b> technical abilities for producing, buying and selling are the ones that give life to the business and are essential during the existence stage (Churchill and Lewis 1983). As the business grows and new people arrive to take part in it, the <b>owner-manager</b> will be more required from the human and conceptual abilities. Whereas during stage zero he/she is the commander attacking, during stage 1 he/she plays more the role of a player and less of a trainer, and during stage 3, a better balance is achieved between the two roles (Galbraith 1982).|$|R

40|$|This article {{integrates}} typically separate SME {{research on}} e-commerce, business networking, and knowledge management into a model explaining factors influencing {{the willingness of}} SME <b>owner-managers</b> to share knowledge online in business networks in rural districts.

Entrepreneurial factors such as <b>owner-managers</b> 2 ̆ 7 expectations of rapid growth, trading outside the district, and seeking information about customers/competitors were indirectly associated with online sharing via intensity of Internet use only.

Research purpose: To identify non-relational-based conditions for effective mentoring of black small business <b>owner–managers.</b> Effective mentoring can help enhance business management skills and improve the survival of small businesses in South Africa. Motivation for the study: Previous research on mentoring mainly focused on relational conditions required for mentoring. It is equally important to investigate non-relational conditions required for mentoring and provide recommendations to help achieve effective mentoring of small business <b>owner–managers.</b> Research design, approach and method: An interpretivism paradigm and qualitative research methodology were followed. The experiences of participants were obtained through semi-structured interviews. Main findings: Conditions surrounding the accessibility of the mentoring location, accessibility of mentoring resources, capacity of mentors, financial support, marketing strategies and practical arrangements for the mentoring process are essential during mentoring of black small business <b>owner–managers.</b> Practical and managerial implications: Investigating the experiences of mentors, mentees and board members or managers provides insight into non-relational conditions required for effective mentoring of black small business <b>owner–managers.</b> Recommendations are provided to help enhance mentoring facilities and ultimately the success and longevity of small businesses. Contribution and value-add: Knowledge of non-relational conditions required for effective mentoring could result in successful skills development of <b>owner–managers.</b> Ultimately, the decision-making of <b>owner–managers</b> could be improved, and the success and longevity of their businesses could be enhanced...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} {{of small businesses}} is inhibited by a cocktail of problems of which inaccessibility to finance is pre-eminent. This problem {{is linked to the}} lenders’ risk estimation, often based on financial indicators which small businesses are not adept at using to signal their performance ability. This situation, especially in South Africa, with a history of a people who were previously disadvantaged does not aid the development of small businesses that may well be the antidote for overcoming the strain of poverty and unemployment in the country. This study stems from the human capital theory and investigated possible relationships between <b>owner-manager</b> characteristics and loan default propensity. The aim being to unveil non-financial variables, associated with the <b>owner-manager</b> which could be relied upon by lenders’ to estimate the loan default propensity of the small business borrower. Primary data collected in South Africa were empirically analysed for possible associations between <b>owner-manager</b> characteristics and loan default propensity. Results revealed business size-dependent differences in the association between certain <b>owner-manager</b> characteristics and business loan default propensity.
