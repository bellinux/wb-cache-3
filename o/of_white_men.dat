5|$|Though {{it was one}} of the few {{combatant}} territories not {{to raise}} fighting men through conscription, proportional to white population, Southern Rhodesia contributed more manpower to the British war effort than any other dominion or colony, and more than Britain itself. White troops numbered 5,716, about 40% <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>men</b> in the colony, with 1,720 of these serving as commissioned officers. The Rhodesia Native Regiment enlisted 2,507 black soldiers, about 30 black recruits scouted for the Rhodesia Regiment, and around 350 served in British and South African units. Over 800 Southern Rhodesians of all races lost their lives on operational service during the war, with many more seriously wounded.|$|E
5|$|Two expeditions between 1860 and 1869 by Charles Francis Hall, {{who lived}} among the Inuit near Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island and later at Repulse Bay on the Canadian mainland, found camps, graves, and relics on the {{southern}} coast of King William Island, {{but none of the}} Franklin expedition survivors he believed would be found among the Inuit. Though he concluded that all of the Franklin crew were dead, he believed that the official expedition records would yet be found under a stone cairn. With the assistance of his guides Ebierbing and Tookoolito, Hall gathered hundreds of pages of Inuit testimony. Among these materials are accounts of visits to Franklin's ships, and an encounter with a party <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>men</b> {{on the southern}} coast of King William Island near Washington Bay. In the 1990s, this testimony was extensively researched by David C. Woodman, and was the basis of two books, Unravelling the Franklin Mystery (1992) and Strangers Among Us (1995), in which he reconstructs the final months of the expedition.|$|E
5|$|After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son Lobengula {{replaced}} him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; {{according to the}} South African big-game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king". Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining concessions and hunting licences to white visitors in return for pounds sterling, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what he had said, Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed {{by one of the}} whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>men,</b> at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation.|$|E

25|$|The Democratic Party, proclaiming {{itself the}} party <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>men,</b> north and south, {{supported}} Johnson. However the Republicans in Congress overrode his veto (the Senate {{by the close}} vote of 33:15, the House by 122:41) and the Civil Rights bill became law. Congress also passed a toned-down Freedmen's Bureau Bill; Johnson quickly vetoed {{as he had done}} to the previous bill.

25|$|Black labor {{played a}} crucial role in Miami's early development. During the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, migrants from the Bahamas and African-Americans constituted 40 percent of the city's population. Whatever their role in the city's growth, their community's growth was limited to a small space. When landlords began to rent homes to African-Americans in neighborhoods close to Avenue J (what would later become NW Fifth Avenue), a gang <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>men</b> with torches visited the renting families and warned them to move or be bombed.|$|E
25|$|Historians have {{emphasized}} that the sense of honor was a central concern of upper-class white Southerners. The idea of being treated like a second-class citizen was anathema {{and could not be}} tolerated by an honorable southerner. The abolitionist position held that slavery was a negative or evil phenomenon that damaged the rights <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>men</b> and the prospects of republicanism. To the white South this rhetoric made Southerners second-class citizens because it trampled what they believed was their Constitutional right to take their chattel property anywhere.|$|E

Truman's making civil rights a {{priority}} of his administration. Although the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated the crime, they were unable to prosecute.

25|$|Intending to {{give the}} {{appearance}} of Native American aggression, the militia's plan was to arm some Southern Paiute Native Americans and persuade them to join with a larger party of their own militiamen—disguised as Native Americans—in an attack.

Eventually fear spread among the militia's leaders that some emigrants had caught sight <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>men</b> and had likely discovered the identity of their attackers. As a result militia commander William H. Dame ordered his forces to kill the emigrants.|$|E
