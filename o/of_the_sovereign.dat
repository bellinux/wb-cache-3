5|$|In Commonwealth realms {{other than}} the UK, royal assent is granted or {{withheld}} either by the realm's sovereign or, more frequently, by the representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sovereign,</b> the governor-general. In federated realms, assent in each state, province, or territory is granted or withheld by the representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sovereign.</b> In Australia, this is the governors of the states, administrators of the territories, or the governor-general in the Australian Capital Territory. For Canada, this is the lieutenant governors of the provinces. A lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general, and the governor general may defer assent to federal bills to the sovereign.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{controversially}} {{married the}} commoner Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced {{the couple to}} leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic Barbary macaque and died of sepsis. The sudden death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sovereign</b> led to questions over the monarchy's survival {{and contributed to the}} fall of the Venizelist regime. After a general election and a referendum, Constantine I was restored to the throne.|$|E

In 1801 his arms altered with the royal arms, however the marks of difference remained the same.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preceding}} Tang dynasty, {{the civil service}} examinations did not yet produce {{the high number of}} officials as they would during the Song dynasty; a hereditary aristocracy remained dependent on the court for attaining rank and holding office. Song rulers, particularly Emperor Huizong, encountered a great deal of political opposition despite attempts to attain the ideals of the sage kings of antiquity. The inability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sovereign</b> to monopolize political authority was linked to the rise of a new class of gentry and scholar-official who filled the bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|George was {{succeeded by}} his son, George Augustus, {{who took the}} throne as George II. It was widely assumed, even by Walpole for a time, that George II planned to remove Walpole from office but was {{prevented}} from doing so by his queen, Caroline of Ansbach. However, Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George II {{had little choice but}} to retain him or risk ministerial instability. In subsequent reigns the power of the prime minister increased further at the expense of the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sovereign.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1659, {{shortly before}} the {{restoration}} of the monarchy, the Protector's Council was abolished. Charles II restored the Royal Privy Council, but he, like previous Stuart monarchs, chose to rely on a small group of advisers. Under George I even more power transferred to this committee. It now began to meet in the absence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sovereign,</b> communicating its decisions to him after the fact.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century, with the Hoysala power {{remaining}} unchallenged, {{the first of}} the Muslim incursions into South India began. After over two decades of waging war against a foreign power, the Hoysala ruler at the time, Veera Ballala III, died in the battle of Madurai in 1343. This resulted in the merger <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sovereign</b> territories of the Hoysala empire with the areas administered by Harihara I, founder of the Vijayanagara Empire, located in the Tungabhadra region in present-day Karnataka. The new kingdom thrived for another two centuries with Vijayanagara as its capital.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Real Madrid was {{widely seen as}} the {{embodiment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sovereign</b> oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond: Santiago Bernabéu, the former club president for whom their stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War.

50|$|In 1852, the Government Assay Office in Adelaide issued gold pound coins. These weighed {{slightly}} more than <b>sovereigns.</b> From 1855, <b>the</b> Sydney mint issued half sovereigns and <b>sovereigns,</b> with <b>the</b> Melbourne mint beginning production in 1872. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sovereigns</b> minted in Australia were for use in India {{as part of a}} plan that <b>the</b> gold <b>sovereign</b> should become <b>the</b> imperial coin.

5|$|The Prince's Palace of Monaco is the {{official}} residence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign</b> Prince of Monaco. Built in 1191 as a Genoese fortress, during its long and often dramatic history it has been bombarded and besieged by many foreign powers. Since {{the end of the}} 13th century, it has been the stronghold and home of the Grimaldi family who first captured it in 1297. The Grimaldi ruled the area first as feudal lords, and from the 17th century as sovereign princes, but their power was often derived from fragile agreements with their larger and stronger neighbours.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{principal}} councils <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sovereign.</b> The other three are the courts of law, the Commune Concilium (Common Council, or Parliament) and the Magnum Concilium (Great Council, or the assembly of all the Peers of the Realm). All are still in existence, or at least have never been formally abolished, but the Magnum Concilium has not been summoned since 1640 and was considered defunct even then.|$|E
5|$|The Sovereign has {{historically}} {{had the power}} to choose Knights of the Order. From the eighteenth century onwards, the Sovereign made his or her choices upon the advice of the Government. George VI felt that the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been used only for political patronage, rather than to reward actual merit. Therefore, with the agreement of the Prime Minister (Clement Attlee) and the Leader of the Opposition (Winston Churchill) in 1946, both Orders returned to the personal gift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sovereign.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Sovereign is {{traditionally}} advised by various counsellors, including the peers of the realm. After the Norman conquest of England, peers were summoned {{to form the}} magnum concilium, or Great Council, {{which was one of}} the four councils belonging to the Sovereign.
