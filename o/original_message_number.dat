The strength of an encryption algorithm depends on the difficulty of cracking the <b>original</b> <b>message.</b> A <b>number</b> of symmetric key encryption algorithms like DES, TRIPLE DES, AES, BLOWFISH has been developed to provide greater security affects one over the other. Although the existing algorithms have their own merits and demerits but this paper presents a new approach for data encryption based on Blowfish algorithm. The blowfish algorithm is safe against unauthorized attack and runs faster than the popular existing algorithms. With this new approach we are implementing a technique to enhance the security level of blowfish algorithm and to further reduce the time for encryption and decryption...|$|R
40|$|We survey {{two recent}} {{signature}} constructions that support signature aggregation: Given n signatures on n distinct messages from n distinct users, {{it is possible}} to aggregate all these signatures into a single signature. This single signature (and all n <b>original</b> <b>messages)</b> will convince any verifier that the n users signed the n <b>original</b> <b>messages</b> (i. e., for i = 1,..., n user i signed <b>message</b> <b>number</b> i). We survey two constructions. The first is based on the short signature scheme of Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham and supports general aggregation. The second, based on a multisignature scheme of Micali, Ohta, and Reyzin, is built from any trapdoor permutation but only supports sequential aggregation. Aggregate signatures are useful for reducing the size of certificate chains (by aggregating all signatures in the chain) and for reducing message size in secure routing protocols such as SBGP...|$|R
50|$|Codewords are {{generated}} from the <b>original</b> <b>message</b> using an algorithm that introduces {{a certain amount of}} redundancy into the codeword; thus, the codeword is always longer than the <b>original</b> <b>message.</b> This redundancy is distributed across the codeword and allows the <b>original</b> <b>message</b> to be recovered with good probability even in the presence of errors. The more redundant the codeword, the more resilient it is against errors, and the fewer queries required to recover a bit of the <b>original</b> <b>message.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} science, online {{codes are}} {{an example of}} rateless erasure codes. These codes can encode a <b>message</b> into a <b>number</b> of symbols such that knowledge of any fraction of them allows one to recover the <b>original</b> <b>message</b> (with high probability). Rateless codes produce an arbitrarily large number of symbols which can be broadcast until the receivers have enough symbols.|$|R
50|$|The {{equation}} above {{shows that}} by multiplying the modulated signal by the carrier signal, {{the result is}} a scaled version of the <b>original</b> <b>message</b> signal plus a second term. Since , this second term is much higher in frequency than the <b>original</b> <b>message.</b> Once this signal passes through a low pass filter, the higher frequency component is removed, leaving just the <b>original</b> <b>message.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{an e-mail}} reply, it is {{sometimes}} appropriate to include a full or partial copy of the <b>original</b> <b>message</b> that is being replied to. As opposed to in-person conversations and Internet chats, email responses may be received long after the <b>original</b> <b>message</b> was sent, so the original sender may have forgotten, misplaced or deleted the original. Many email reading programs (mail user agents) encourage this behaviour by automatically including {{a copy of the}} <b>original</b> <b>message</b> in the reply editing window.|$|R

40|$|In the {{classical}} compress-and-forward relay scheme developed by (Cover and El Gamal, 1979), the decoding process operates in a successive way: the destination first decodes the compression of the relay’s observation, and then decodes the <b>original</b> <b>message</b> of the source. Recently, several modified compress-and-forward relay schemes were proposed, where, the destination jointly decodes the compression and the message, instead of successively. Such a modification on the decoding process {{was motivated by}} realizing that it is generally easier to decode the compression jointly with the <b>original</b> <b>message,</b> and more importantly, the <b>original</b> <b>message</b> can be decoded even without completely decoding the compression. Thus, joint decoding provides more freedom in choosing the compression at the relay. However, the question remains whether this freedom of selecting the compression necessarily improves the achievable rate of the <b>original</b> <b>message.</b> It {{has been shown in}} (El Gamal and Kim, 2010) that the answer is negative in the single-relay case. In this paper, it is further demonstrated {{that in the case of}} multiple relays, there is no improvement on the achievable rate by joint decoding either. More interestingly, it is discovered that any compressions not supporting successive decoding will actually lead to strictly lower achievable rates for the <b>original</b> <b>message.</b> Therefore, to maximize the achievable rate for the <b>original</b> <b>message,</b> the compressions should always b...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new notion of short identity-based multisignature scheme with message recovery.
