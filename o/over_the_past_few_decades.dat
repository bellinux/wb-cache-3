When filming began on Dad's Army, Villa fan Ian Lavender {{was allowed to}} choose Frank Pike's scarf from an array in the BBC wardrobe; he chose a claret and blue one—Aston Villa's colours. The character Nessa in the BBC sitcom Gavin & Stacey was revealed as an Aston Villa fan in an episode screened in December 2009.|$|E
5|$|The short-tail {{stingray}} {{is common}} and widely {{distributed in the}} temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere. Off southern Africa, {{it has been reported}} from Cape Town in South Africa to the mouth of the Zambezi River in Mozambique. Along the southern Australian coast, it is found from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Maroochydore in Queensland, including Tasmania. In New Zealand waters, it occurs off North Island and the Chatham Islands, and rarely off South Island and the Kermadec Islands. Records from northern Australia and Thailand likely represent misidentifications of Himantura fai and D. matsubarai respectively. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades,</b> its range and numbers off southeastern Tasmania have grown, possibly as a result of climate change.|$|E
