5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the restoration, the spare A3 boiler had been dispatched in June 2005 to Riley & Son to be completely rebuilt. It was to be used instead of the A4 boiler both out of the desire to restore the locomotive to original condition, {{and because it was}} deemed that the A4 boiler had deteriorated into a worse state than the spare due to the higher <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> the locomotive had experienced following the up-rating of the locomotive to 250psi during its last private overhaul. Deemed surplus to requirements, the A4 boiler was sold to Jeremy Hosking for potential use on his locomotive, LNER Class A4 4464 Bittern.|$|E
25|$|Storm {{systems are}} {{accompanied}} by low atmospheric pressure, which causes more methane to escape from coal seams and sealed areas. In winter the air is drier and less dense and creates a drier mine environment. Such conditions {{have been known to}} contribute to past mine fires and explosions. Other factors affecting methane liberation include whether the mine ventilation system is exhausting (negative pressure) or blowing (positive pressure), and the <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of the fans.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{evaporator}} and condenser heat exchangers is also {{very important to the}} overall efficiency of the heat pump. The heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential (between the refrigerant and the air stream) directly affect the <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> and hence the work the compressor has {{to do in order to}} provide the same heating or cooling effect. Generally, the larger the heat exchanger, the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes.|$|E

Due to the <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> of the regenerator unit increasing almost proportionally with the reboiler load (Wen et al. 2007), the <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> should not be too high.

25|$|The {{most popular}} {{catalysts}} {{are based on}} iron promoted with K2O, CaO, SiO2, and Al2O3. The original Haber–Bosch reaction chambers used osmium as the catalyst, but it was available in extremely small quantities. Haber noted uranium was almost as effective and easier to obtain than osmium. Under Bosch's direction in 1909, the BASF researcher Alwin Mittasch discovered a much less expensive iron-based catalyst, which is still used today. Some ammonia production utilizes ruthenium-based catalysts (the KAAP process). Ruthenium forms more active catalysts that allows milder <b>operating</b> <b>pressures.</b> Such catalysts are prepared by decomposition of triruthenium dodecacarbonyl on graphite.|$|E
25|$|The Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted {{sheet metal}} steel receiver, {{but due to}} the higher <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of the 5.56×45mm cartridge, this {{solution}} was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy milled forging. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using Valmet Rk 62 receivers manufactured in Finland. All exterior metal surfaces are phosphated for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block and front sight tower). The machined solid steel billet action avoided cracking problems the AK-series had with steel stamped sheet actions, but this made the Galil heavier.|$|E

40|$|This Chapter {{presents}} {{numerical simulation}} on MILD combustion <b>operating</b> at high <b>pressure.</b> Influence of preheat and dilution of oxidizer and <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> on stabilization of MILD combustion are presented. Three different preheat temperatures (1100, 1300 and 1500  K) and three different dilution levels (3, 6 and 9 % O 2) are simulated over an <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> variation from 1  atm to 16  atm. A classical jet in hot coflow burner is considered for this study. Total of 45 cases are simulated and analyzed. Essential characteristics of MILD combustion, i. e., maximum temperature (Tmax), temperature rise (ΔT) and temperature distributions, are analyzed. The distribution of emissions OH and CO are also studied and presented. Well-stabilized MILD combustion is observed for all cases {{except for two}} cases with high preheated (1500  K). Peak temperature is observed to decrease with increasing <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> for a given level of preheat and dilution. OH mass faction is reduced with increasing pressure. The CO emissions show little sensitivity to <b>operating</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, CO mass fraction is slightly higher at 1  atm <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> as compared to 4 to 16  atm. Since the residence time of reactants increases as the <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> increases, well-stabilized MILD combustion is observed for all highly diluted and low temperature preheat cases (3 % O 2 and 1100  K) ...|$|R

2500|$|Shotguns, in general, {{operate at}} much lower {{pressures}} than pistols and rifles, typically operating at pressures of 10,000 psi, or less, for 12 gauge shells, whereas rifles and pistols routinely are operated at pressures {{in excess of}} 35,000 psi, and sometimes upwards of 50,000 psi. The SAAMI maximum permitted pressure limit is only 11,500 psi for 12 gauge 2-3/4 inch shells, so the typical <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> for many shotgun shells are only slightly below the maximum permitted pressures allowed for safe ammunition. [...] Because of this small difference in typical operating vs. maximum industry allowed pressures, {{and the fact that}} even small changes in components can cause pressure variances in excess of 4,000 psi, the components used in shotshell reloading must not be varied from published recipes, as the margin of safety relative to <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> for shotguns is much lower than for pistols and rifles. [...] This lower operating pressure for shotguns and shells is also the reason why shotgun barrels have noticeably thinner walls than rifle and pistol barrels.|$|E

2500|$|In HPLC, {{typically}} 20 μl of {{the sample}} of interest are injected into the mobile phase stream delivered by a high pressure pump. The mobile phase containing the analytes permeates through the stationary phase bed in a definite direction.The components of the mixture are separated depending on their chemical affinity with the mobile and stationary phases. The separation occurs after repeated sorption and desorption steps occurring when the liquid interacts with the stationary bed. The liquid solvent (mobile phase) is delivered under high pressure (up to 400 bar or 300.000 torr) into a packed column containing the stationary phase. The high pressure is necessary to achieve a constant flow rate for reproducible chromatography experiments. Depending on the partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, the components {{of the sample}} will flow out of the column at different times. The column is the most important component of the LC system and is designed to withstand the high pressure of the liquid. Conventional LC columns [...] are 100–300mm long with outer diameter of 6.4mm (1/4 inch) and internal diameter of 3.0-4.6mm. [...] For applications involving LC-MS, the length of chromatography columns can be shorter (30–50mm) with 3-5 μm diameter packing particles. In addition to the conventional model, other LC columns are the narrowbore, microbore, microcapillary, and nano-LC models. These columns have smaller internal diameters, allow for a more efficient separation, and handle liquid flows under 1 ml/ min (the conventional flow-rate). [...] In order to improve separation efficiency and peak resolution, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) can be used instead of HPLC. This LC variant uses columns packed with [...] smaller silica particles (~1.7 μm diameter) and requires higher <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> in the range of 310.000 to 775.000 torr (6000 to 15000 psi).|$|E
