5|$|In July 1942 the Royal Navy {{formed the}} Future Building Committee, chaired by the Deputy First Sea Lord, {{to examine the}} fleet's {{requirements}} {{for the rest of}} the war. Tasked with anticipating the Navy's readiness and requirements for January 1944, the committee realised that a major expansion of naval aviation was required, which meant that more aircraft carriers would be needed. Many factors combined to drive up the size of these new carriers, notably the increasing size and speed <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> and the desire to increase the numbers <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> aboard fleet carriers. Another important consideration was the change in carrier tactics from the earlier doctrine of more attacks with smaller numbers <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> to the use of large, single airstrikes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{aircraft}} landing problem (ALP) {{consists of}} scheduling the landing <b>of</b> <b>aircrafts</b> onto the available runways {{in an airport}} by assigning to each aircraft a landing time and a specific runway while respecting different operational constraints.

In this paper, we study the dynamic version of the ALP when new aircrafts appear over time, {{which means that the}} landing <b>of</b> the previous <b>aircrafts</b> should be rescheduled. To solve this problem, we propose a memetic algorithm combining an ant colony algorithm and a local heuristic...|$|R

5|$|HMS Argus was a British {{aircraft}} carrier that {{served in the}} Royal Navy from 1918 to 1944. She was converted from an ocean liner that was under construction when the First World War began, {{and became the first}} example of what is now the standard pattern <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrier, with a full-length flight deck that allowed wheeled aircraft to take off and land. After commissioning, the ship was heavily involved for several years {{in the development of the}} optimum design for other {{aircraft carrier}}s. Argus also evaluated various types of arresting gear, general procedures needed to operate a number <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> in concert, and fleet tactics. The ship was too top-heavy as originally built and had to be modified to improve her stability in the mid-1920s.

5000|$|The weight <b>of</b> an <b>aircraft</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the basic}} factors that determines {{the length of}} the landing roll <b>of</b> an <b>aircraft.</b> An {{increase}} in weight increases the stall speed <b>of</b> an <b>aircraft.</b> Stall is a reduction in the lift coefficient generated by a wing as angle of attack increases.
