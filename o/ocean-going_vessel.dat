25|$|In August 1842, the Star of Oregon - {{the first}} <b>ocean-going</b> <b>vessel</b> built in Oregon - left Oregon City {{for two weeks}} of {{practice}} runs on the Columbia River. In September, the ship left for California with a crew of five inexperienced men and an Indian boy with Gale as captain. On reaching San Francisco, the ship was sold for 350 cows. The following spring, Gale and 42 others drove 1,250 cattle, 600 horses and mules, and 3,000 sheep back to the Oregon Country.|$|E
25|$|The Sacramento-Yolo Port District {{was created}} in 1947, and ground was broken on the Port of Sacramento in 1949. On June 29, 1963, with 5,000 spectators waiting to welcome her, the Motor Vessel Taipei Victory arrived. The port was open for business. The Nationalist Chinese flagship, freshly painted for the {{historic}} event, was loaded with 5,000 tons of bagged rice for Mitsui Trading Co. bound for Okinawa and 1,000 tons of logs for Japan. She was the first <b>ocean-going</b> <b>vessel</b> in Sacramento since the steamship Harpoon in 1934. The Port of Sacramento has been plagued with operating losses {{in recent years and}} faces bankruptcy. This severe loss in business is due to the heavy competition from the Port of Stockton, which has a larger facility and a deeper channel. As of 2006, the city of West Sacramento took responsibility for the Port of Sacramento. During the Vietnam War era, the Port of Sacramento was the major terminus in the supply route for all military parts, hardware and other cargo going into Southeast Asia.|$|E
500|$|The {{interception}} of the Rex was {{a training}} exercise and military aviation {{achievement of the}} United States Army Air Corps prior to World War II. The tracking and location of an <b>ocean-going</b> <b>vessel</b> by B-17 Flying Fortresses on 12 May 1938 was a major event {{in the development of}} a doctrine that led to a United States Air Force independent of the Army. The mission was ostensibly a training exercise for coastal defense of the United States, but was conceived by planners to be a well-publicized demonstration of the capabilities of [...] "heavy bombers (as) long range instruments of power".|$|E

2500|$|Maritime mobile {{stations}} are {{mobile stations}} {{installed in a}} watercraft, usually an <b>ocean-going</b> <b>vessel.</b> When in international waters, these stations are operated under the regulatory authority of the flag under which the vessel is registered.

Maritime mobile stations append a /MM to end of their call sign (pronounced as [...] "slash maritime mobile").|$|E
2500|$|On 10 July the longboat, fitted for {{a voyage}} and crewed with eleven men, {{was sent to}} Batavia to obtain help. It never arrived there, and nothing is known of its fate.

Completed in March 1728 and affectionately named the Sloepie ("little sloop"), it was the first <b>ocean-going</b> <b>vessel</b> built in Australian history.

2500|$|Collision between steamboats and {{seagoing}} vessels did {{occur in the}} lower Columbia river. [...] Such collisions {{would have been much}} more serious because of the generally much larger size and tough construction of the <b>ocean-going</b> <b>vessel.</b> [...] Thus, on December 30, 1907, Annie Comings was rammed by the barque Europe in the Willamette River near St. Johns, and sank in three minutes, fortunately with no loss of life. [...] Clatsop Chief was sunk in a similar collision with the steamship Oregon on February 28, 1881, that time four people drowned. [...] F.B. Jones was rammed and sunk in 1907 on the lower Columbia by the tanker Asuncion.|$|E
2500|$|Banning was {{not content}} to {{consolidate}} business interests in staging. He also began expanding the harbor and docks at San Pedro from their beginnings as illegal exchange sites for mission contraband during the Spanish and Mexican eras, and made them efficient enterprises. [...] In the late 1850s Banning {{and a group of}} Southern California investors purchased 640 acres (2.6 km2) of land adjacent to San Pedro for port expansion. The land purchase was incorporated as Wilmington, after Banning's Delaware birthplace, and his facility became known as Banning's Landing. Banning invested the profits from his trade networks into the development of a more sophisticated port complex and for the creation of roads, telegraphs, and other connections to Los Angeles. In 1859, the first <b>ocean-going</b> <b>vessel</b> anchored in Los Angeles-Wilmington harbor, and the 1860s saw the beginning of small-scale maritime trade between San Pedro and ships anchored in the deeper parts of the harbor. After government-funded dredging made a deep water harbor and breakwater a reality, the port continued to grow.|$|E
2500|$|Lot Whitcomb ran twice weekly on {{the route}} from Milwaukie to Astoria, making the run in 10 hours, a {{substantial}} improvement over the previous time set by the Columbia which was 24 hours. [...] Columbia charged $25 fare for the run from Portland to Astoria, but under pressure from Lot Whitcomb was forced to drop this first to $15 per person, and later to $12. [...] For a while, the owners of Lot Whitcomb as Milwaukie boosters, refused to stop at Portland. [...] Portland's city founders retaliated by raising $60,000 and then buying the Gold Hunter, an actual <b>ocean-going</b> <b>vessel,</b> to come north to the Columbia River, where she ran {{for about a year}} against the Whitcomb. [...] Shortly after launching, Lot Whitcomb struck a rock near Milwaukie, sustained damage to her paddle wheel and a hole in her hull. [...] The vessel was hung up for a week until her owners and the resourceful Captain Ainsworth were able to pull her off and repair her. [...] She also functioned well as a tow boat, escorting many oceangoing ships from Astoria up the Columbia and Willamette rivers to Portland.|$|E

50|$|CSI {{believed}} that an <b>ocean-going</b> <b>vessel</b> {{would be the}} most appropriate facility for ministering New OT VIII because this advanced level of religious service requires a completely safe, aesthetic and distraction-free environment and because L.
