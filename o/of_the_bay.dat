5|$|A {{number of}} localities {{in the area}} are named after the Ashbridges. Just to the south of the house is Jonathan Ashbridge Park (named after Sarah's son), while {{slightly}} to the east is Sarah Ashbridge Avenue. The bay that marked the southern edge of the property is now known as Ashbridge's Bay, named for John Ashbridge. On the east and north sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> is the large Ashbridge's Bay Park. Ashbridge's Bay Park North, to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> is the site of the Ashbridge's Bay Skate Park, opened in 2009. The west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> is the location of the Ashbridge's Bay Wastewater Treatment Plant, Toronto's main sewage treatment plant and the second largest such facility in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean {{emerged into}} the Bay of Campeche as a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{on the afternoon}} of August21. Its inner core was largely disrupted, so although a ragged eye reformed over the warm waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> the hurricane no longer had the structure to support its previous strength. Nevertheless, the warm waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> proved conducive for some development and the eye contracted overnight, indicating that the hurricane was regaining structure. With better structure came stronger winds of 100mph (160km/h), and the storm was re-categorized as a Category2 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{settlement}} of the Americas occurred some 20,000 years ago, when the first Asians crossed the Bering Strait into Alaska, the earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area dates to around 3,000 B.C. along the shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> with evidence pointing to even earlier settlement in Point Reyes in Marin County. The Miwokan and Costanoan Ohlone people, who {{were living in the}} Bay Area at the time of first European contact, were possibly descended from Siberian tribes who arrived at around 1,000 BC by sailing over the Arctic Ocean and following the salmon migration. The Ohlone lived in about forty or so tribes spread throughout the lands adjacent to the San Francisco Bay and as far south as Point Sur in near Monterey Bay.|$|E

5|$|Government in the San Francisco Bay Area {{consists}} of multiple actors, including 101 city and nine county governments, a dozen regional agencies, {{and a large}} number of single-purpose special districts such as municipal utility districts and transit districts. Incorporated cities are responsible for providing police service, zoning, issuing building permits, and maintaining public streets among other duties. County governments are responsible for elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, agricultural regulations, and building inspections, among other duties. Public education is provided by independent school districts, which may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts, and are managed by an elected school board. A variety of special districts also exist and provide a single purpose, such as delivering public transit in the case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area Rapid Transit District, or monitoring air quality levels in the case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area Air Quality Management District.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> St. John's {{land and}} coast is a National Park and {{is protected by}} the federal government. In spite <b>of</b> these restrictions, <b>the</b> population <b>of</b> St. John has risen in {{the past fifteen years}} as has <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> tourists that visit the island. A possible side-effect to the growing population is increased nitrogen loading to <b>the</b> <b>bays,</b> which can impact the benthic habitat. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this thesis is to evaluate <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> human developments on nitrogen loading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays</b> on St. John, U. S. Virgin Islands. This is accomplished by taking nitrogen samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays,</b> using ArcGIS and the Nitrogen Loading Model to estimate <b>the</b> nitrogen loading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays,</b> and correlating historical nitrogen concentrations with increases in population. While <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> nitrogen samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bays</b> is inconclusive, <b>the</b> Nitrogen Loading Model estimates that bays with greater levels of development have higher amounts of nitrogen loading. Historical nitrogen concentrations show little relationship between <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watersheds and <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> nitrogen within <b>the</b> <b>bays.</b> Overall, {{there is little evidence that}} nitrogen loading from development is causing excessive nitrogen loading. by Alfred Patrick Navato.

5|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area Rapid Transit System's current {{coverage}} area was once served by an electrified streetcar and suburban train system called the Key System. This early 20th-century system once had regular transbay traffic across the lower deck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Bridge, {{but the system}} was dismantled in the 1950s and operated its last transbay crossing in 1958. By the mid-1950s, that system had been dismantled in favor of highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed rapid transit system linking the cities and suburbs.|$|E
