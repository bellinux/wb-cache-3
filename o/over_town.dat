5|$|US40Scenic was {{assigned}} to old US40 from Fifteen Mile Creek Road <b>over</b> <b>Town</b> Hill to the Mann Road intersection when US40 was moved to its and I-68's present alignment <b>over</b> <b>Town</b> Hill in 1965. US40 was expanded to a divided highway {{and moved to a}} new alignment from High Germany Road to the sweeping curve that is now Exit74 in 1983. The section of old US40 from the 19491952 Sideling Hill relocation immediately around Sideling Hill Creek was dismantled. The upgraded US40 became a part of I-68 that passes through a cut in Sideling Hill around 1987. The old alignment over Sideling Hill was transferred to county maintenance and designated US40Scenic around 1989. However, US40Scenic temporarily followed the old McFarland Road alignment of US40 {{on the west side of}} Sideling Hill until the completion of Exit74 in 1991.|$|E
5|$|US40Scenic {{is the old}} {{alignment}} of US40 <b>over</b> <b>Town</b> Hill and Sideling Hill, two of the many northsouth ridges of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians between Cumberland and Hancock {{that needed to be}} crossed first by the Baltimore and Cumberland Turnpike, then US40, and most recently I-68. The portion of US40Scenic from its western terminus <b>over</b> <b>Town</b> Hill to Sideling Hill Creek follows the original {{alignment of}} the turnpike and US40 except for deviations at both ends due to construction of the new alignments of US40 and I-68. The Baltimore and Cumberland Turnpike and later US40 rose abruptly from Sideling Hill Creek to climb the west flank of Sideling Hill, following what is today McFarland Road east, turning south at Hixon Road, and continuing south along the same line, now abandoned, to join the present line {{at the top of the}} mountain. On the east flank, the old road began along the current alignment, then turned east a short distance south of the present curve to the east for a steeper descent that followed Western Pike before joining the present alignment a short distance west of MD144.|$|E

5|$|Lt. Blue and Parrish {{returned}} to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons set about locating pine {{from which to}} make torches to light {{their way out of}} the hollow. Parsons carried with him a small hatchet, and began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch. He accidentally struck himself in the knee with his hatchet, and Blue applied a handkerchief to his wound to stop its bleeding. The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where they ate and dried their clothes by the fire. The following morning, they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris' home, where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish. Parsons and Blue continued east <b>over</b> <b>Town</b> Hill and reached George Thompson's residence on the Little Cacapon River, which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall. They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided, then traveled to Blue's Gap, where they set up camp. There, Lt. Blue received orders from Col. Angus William McDonald to carry out an expedition for General Stonewall Jackson to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry, cavalry, and artillery present in and around Romney; he was accompanied on this expedition by Col. Parsons' son, Isaac Parsons, Jr., and by W. V. Parsons.|$|E

25|$|He based {{himself in}} Cicero, Illinois after using bribery and {{widespread}} intimidation to take <b>over</b> <b>town</b> council elections, and this {{made it difficult}} for the North Siders to target him. His driver was found tortured and murdered, and there was an attempt on Weiss's life in the Chicago Loop. On September 20, 1926, the North Side Gang used a ploy outside the Capone headquarters at the Hawthorne Inn, aimed at drawing him to the windows. Gunmen in several cars then opened fire with Thompson submachine guns and shotguns at the windows of the first-floor restaurant. Capone was unhurt and called for a truce, but the negotiations fell through. Three weeks later, Weiss was killed outside the former O'Banion flower shop North Side headquarters. The owner of Hawthorne's restaurant was a friend of Capone's, and he was kidnapped and killed by Moran and Drucci in January 1927.|$|E

500|$|U.S.Route40Scenic (US40Scenic) is {{a scenic}} route of US40 in the U.S. state of Maryland. US40Scenic, {{which is known}} {{for most of its}} route as National Pike, is the old {{alignment}} of US40 <b>over</b> <b>Town</b> Hill in eastern Allegany County and Sideling Hill in far western Washington County. The highway was originally constructed as part of a turnpike connecting Baltimore with the eastern end of the National Road at Cumberland in the early 19th century. The highway was paved as a modern road in the mid-1910s and designated US40 in the late 1920s. US 40 was relocated over Sideling Hill in the early 1950s and <b>over</b> <b>Town</b> Hill in the mid-1960s. The US40Scenic designation was first applied to the old highway <b>over</b> <b>Town</b> Hill in 1965. Following the completion of Interstate68 (I-68) at Sideling Hill, US40Scenic was extended east along old US40's crossing of the mountain in the late 1980s. US40Scenic is the only scenic route in the U.S. Highway System; formerly, there was a second, US412Scenic in Oklahoma, but this has since been redesignated to a more conventional [...] "Alternate" [...] route.|$|E
