A pyrochlore lattice {{is considered}} {{where the average}} electron number of electrons per site is half–integer, concentrating {{on the case of}} exactly half an electron per site. Strong on-site repulsions are assumed, so that all sites are either empty or singly occupied. Where there are in addition strong nearest–neighbour repulsions, a tetrahedron rule comes into effect, as previously suggested for magnetite. We show that in this case, there exist excitations with fractional charge ±e/ 2. These are intimately connected with the high degeneracy of the ground state in the absence of kinetic energy terms. When an additional electron is inserted into the system, it decays into two point like excitations with charge −e/ 2, connected by a Heisenberg spin chain which carries the electron’s spin...|$|R

Momentum exchange with accelerated bodies through gravitons is discussed and shown similar to mode exchange in optical fibers. Reported anomalies on the behaviour of the Foucault pendulum, both periodic and exceptional on the occasion of solar eclipses, are explained not only qualitatively but also on order of magnitude, resorting to graviton exchanges between Earth and the Sun or the Moon.

Using {{the density}} matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we study the quantum coherence in one-dimensional disordered Fermi systems. We consider in detail spinless fermions on a ring, {{and compare the}} influence of several kinds of impurities in a gapless and a dimerized, gapped system. In the translation-invariant system a so-called site-impurity, which can be realized by a local potential or a change of one link, increases for repulsive interaction and decreases for attractive interaction. The weakening of two neighboring bonds, which is a realization of a so-called bond-impurity, on the other hand, is healed for repulsive interaction, but enhanced for intermediate attractive interactions. This leads to strong suppression of the quantum coherence measured by the phase sensitivity, but not to localization. Adding a local distortion to a dimerized system we find that even {{the presence of a}} single site-impurity increases the metallic region found in the dimerized model. For a strong dimerization and a high barrier, an additional sharp maximum, even seen for systems with about 100 sites, occurs in the phase sensitivity. A bond-impurity in the dimerized system also opens a small metallic window in the otherwise isolating regime...|$|R

We {{review the}} density of states and related quantities of quasi one-dimensional disordered Peierls systems in which fluctuation effects of a backscattering potential play a crucial role. The low-energy behavior of non-interacting fermions which are subject to a static random backscattering potential will be described by the fluctuating gap model (FGM). Recently, the FGM has also been used to explain the pseudogap phenomenon in high-Tc superconductors. After an elementary introduction to the FGM {{in the context of}} commensurate and incommensurate Peierls chains, we develop a non-perturbative method which allows for a simultaneous calculation of {{the density of}} states (DOS) and the inverse localization length. First, we recover all known results in the limits of zero and infinite correlation lengths of the random potential. Then, we attack the problem of finite correlation lengths. While a complex order parameter, which describes incommensurate Peierls chains, leads to a suppression of the DOS, i. e. a pseudogap, the DOS exhibits a singularity at the Fermi energy if the order parameter is real and therefore refers to a commensurate system. We confirm these results by calculating the DOS and the inverse localization length for finit...|$|R

The {{starting point}} of this work is the principle that all movement of particles and photons in the observable Universe must follow geodesics of a 4 -dimensional space where time intervals are always a measure of geodesic arc lengths, i. e. c 2 (dt) 2 = gαβdx α dx β, with c is {{the speed of light}} in vacuum, t time, gαβ and the metric tensor; x α represents any of 4 space coordinates. The last 3 coordinates (α = 1, 2, 3) are immediately associated with the usual physical space coordinates, while the first coordinate (α = 0) is later found to be related to proper time. The work shows that this principle is applicable in several important situations and suggests that the underlying principle can, in fact, be used universally. Starting with special relativity it is shown that there is perfect mapping between the geodesics on Minkowski space-time and on this alternative space. The discussion than follows through light propagation in a refractive medium, and some cases of gravitation, including Schwartzschild’s outer metric. The last part of the presentation is dedicated to electromagnetic interaction and Maxwell’s equations, showing that there is a particular solution where one of the space dimensions is eliminated and the geodesics become equivalent to light rays in geometrical optics.

Received <b>yyyy</b> <b>mm</b> dd; in {{original}} form <b>yyyy</b> <b>mm</b> dd The {{crossing of the}} Galactic disk by a Globular Cluster could produce star formation due to gravitational focussing or compression of disk material. We report on simulations of the effect on disk material which reveal that the crossing can sometimes cause local gravitational focussing of disk material. We also present the salient points of a little-known paper by Levy (2000), that shows that strong compression can result from the shock wave generated by GC disk crossing. The main thrust of our paper is a search for remnants of disk crossings by Globular Clusters. Using the gravitational potential of the Galaxy to locate {{the position of the}} most recent crossings of a subset of fifty-four Globular Clusters reveals that systematic errors and uncertainties in initial conditions limit the scope for unequivocal identification. From the subset of fifty-four, six possible search sites with the best constraints are retained for further scrutiny. Three of the six potentially promising search areas in the disk are from Globular Clusters NGC 3201, 6397 and NGC 6838, for which we cannot rule out some observed star associations observed nearby as being remnants. The three other of the six areas are too large to provide meaningful identification of remnants. Also, a possible remnant (open cluster NGC 6231) is shown not to be due to Globular Cluster impact, contrary to a previous report. In a more wide-ranging screening of one hundred and fifty-five Globular Clusters we identify which Globular Clusters are compatible with being responsible for the formation of any of the Galaxy’s five most prominent Star Super Clusters...|$|R

In contrast, crocodylian faunas of the later Tertiary tend to be more endemic, with local adaptive radiations occurring in Africa and Australia containing members of most basic snout shapes. Endemic radiations in Africa and Australia have largely been replaced by Crocodylus, which can be divided into subclades that may indi-vidually represent endemic adaptive radiations...|$|R

40|$|Many {{published}} cladograms report {{measures of}} stratigraphic congruence. Strong congruence between cladistic branching {{order and the}} order of first fossil occurrences is taken to support both the accuracy of cladograms and the fidelity of the record. Poor congruence may reflect inaccurate trees, a misleading fossil record, or both. However, it has been demonstrated that most congruence indices are logically or empirically biased by parameters that are not uniformly distributed across taxa or through time. These include tree size and balance, mean ghost range duration (gap size) and the range and distribution of <b>origination</b> <b>dates.</b> This study used 650 published cladograms to investigate the influence of these variables on the Gap Excess Ratio (GER). In a range of multivariate models, factors other than congruence per se explained up to 74. 5 % of the observed variance in GER amongst trees. Arthropods typically have poorer GER values than other groups, but the residual differences from our models are much less striking. The models also show no clear residual trend in GER through the Phanerozoic. Because the GER is strongly influenced by parameters related to cladogram size, balance and duration, comparisons across trees should be made with caution...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} information and incentive {{problems that can}} exist {{in the market for}} commercial mortgages that are pooled and repackaged as commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs). We find that mortgages that are originated by institutions with large negative stock returns in the quarters prior to the <b>origination</b> <b>date</b> tend to have higher credit spreads and default more than other mortgages with similar observable characteristics. Properties financed with these mortgages also exhibit weaker post-securitization operating performance. In addition, stock price loser institutions are anxious to securitize mortgages they originate more quickly. Finally we find that credit rating agencies require higher levels of subordination for CMBS pools (i. e., view these pools as riskier) that include more mortgages originated by underperforming originators. This evidence is consistent with reputation models in which poorly performing originators have less incentive to carefully evaluate the credit quality of prospective borrowers, thereby letting relatively riskier mortgages pass through their weaker screening standards.

40|$|Through-the-Cycle (TTC) PD is {{the long-run}} {{probability}} of default through a full credit cycle. It is a more suitable risk factor for the capital purpose than Point-in-time (PIT) PD as it is less sensitive to the fluctuations of the economic environment. Accurate forecasting of the TTC PD is an industry challenge for Australian banks {{due to the lack}} of data in sufficient long period of time. Furthermore, low default rates are often observed in the book of small and medium enterprises (SME), which imposes extra difficulty for the TTC PD estimation. To meet these challenges, this research proposes a TTC PD model constructed in a way similar to the Cox Proportional Hazard modeling framework by incorporating the long-term survivors. The variations of the hazard are explained by four components including the non-linear life-cycle effect, credit quality of the portfolio, macro-economic environment and seasonality effect.

We consider a situation, common in practice, where accounts with common <b>origination</b> <b>date</b> (typically month) are aggregated into a single vintage for analysis, and the data for analysis consists of a time series of a univariate portfolio performance variable (for example, the proportion of defaulting accounts) for each vintage over successive time periods since origination. An invaluable management tool for understanding portfolio behaviour can be obtained by decomposing the data series nonparametrically into components of exogenous variability (E), maturity (time since origination; M) and vintage (V), referred to as an EMV model. For example, identification of a good macroeconomic model is the key to effective forecasting, particularly in applications such as stress testing, and identification of this can be facilitated by investigation of the macroeconomic component of an EMV decomposition. We show that care needs to be taken with such a decomposition, drawing parallels with the Age-Period-Cohort approach, common in demography, epidemiology and sociology.

40|$|Abstract. Monte Carlo {{simulation}} is {{a common}} method for studying the volatility of market traded instruments. It is less employed in retail lending, because of the inherent nonlinearities in consumer behavior. In this paper, we leverage the approach of Dual-time Dynamics to separate loan performance dynamics into three components: a maturation function of months-on-books, an exogenous function of calendar date, and a quality function of vintage <b>origination</b> <b>date.</b> Of these three, the exogenous function captures the impacts from the macroeconomic environment. As such, we might naturally want to generate scenarios for the possible futures of these environmental impacts. To generate such scenarios, we must go beyond the random walk methods most commonly applied {{in the analysis of}} market-traded instruments. Retail portfolios exhibit autocorrelation structure and variance growth with time that requires more complex modeling than a random walk. This paper describes work using ARMA and ARIMA models for scenario generation, rules for selecting the correct model given the input data, and validation methods on the scenario generation. We find when the goal is capturing the future volatility via Monte Carlo scenario generation, that model selection does not follow the same rules as for forecasting. Instead, test more appropriate to reproducing volatility are proposed, which assure that distributions of scenarios have the proper statistical characteristics. These results are supported by studies of the variance growth properties of macroeconomic variables and theoretical calculations of the variance growth properties of various models. We also provide studies on historical data showing minimum training lengths and differences by macroeconomic epochs. Key words.
