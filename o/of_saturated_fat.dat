25|$|While {{consumption}} of small amounts <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> {{is common in}} diets, meta-analyses found a significant correlation between high consumption <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and blood LDL concentration, {{a risk factor for}} cardiovascular diseases.

25|$|The {{consumption}} <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> {{is generally}} considered {{a risk factor for}} dyslipidemia, which in turn is a risk factor for some types of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> on risk {{of disease}} is controversial. Many reviews {{recommend}} a diet low in saturated fat and argue it will lower risks of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or death. However, other reviews have challenged those arguments or advocated for examining {{the proportion of}} saturated to unsaturated fat in the diet.|$|E
25|$|As {{butter is}} {{essentially}} just the milk fat, it contains only traces of lactose, so moderate consumption of butter {{is not a}} problem for lactose intolerant people. People with milk allergies may still need to avoid butter, which contains enough of the allergy-causing proteins to cause reactions. Whole milk, butter and cream have high levels <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat.</b> Butter is a good source of Vitamin A.|$|E
50|$|Not all <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> have equally cholesterolemic effects. Studies have {{indicated}} that consumption of palm olein (which is more unsaturated) reduces blood cholesterol when compared to sources <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> like coconut oil, dairy and animal fats.|$|R
50|$|Cocoa butter {{contains}} {{a high proportion}} <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats,</b> derived from stearic and palmitic acids. Cocoa butter, unlike cocoa solids, has no more than trace amounts of caffeine and theobromine.|$|R
25|$|Similarly, {{the authors}} of a 2009 review of dietary studies {{concluded}} that there was insufficient evidence to establish a causal link between consumption <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and coronary heart disease risk.|$|R
25|$|Various fats contain {{different}} {{proportions of}} saturated and unsaturated fat. Examples of foods containing {{a high proportion}} <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> include animal fat products such as cream, cheese, butter, other whole milk dairy products and fatty meats which also contain dietary cholesterol. Certain vegetable products have high saturated fat content, such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil. Many prepared foods are high in saturated fat content, such as pizza, dairy desserts, and sausage.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} seafood, shrimp {{is high in}} calcium, iodine and protein but low in food energy. A shrimp-based meal is also a {{significant}} source of cholesterol, from 122mg to 251mg per 100g of shrimp, depending on the method of preparation. Shrimp consumption, however, is considered healthy for the circulatory system because the lack of significant levels <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> in shrimp means that the high cholesterol content in shrimp actually improves the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol and lowers triglycerides.|$|E
25|$|That {{study also}} {{suggests}} that fat and saturated fat are not likely contributors to pancreatic cancer. Animal fat, particularly from ruminants, tends {{to have a higher}} percentage <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> vs. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat when compared to vegetable fats, with the exception of some tropical plant fats; consumption of which has been correlated with various health problems. The saturated fat found in meat has been associated with significantly raised risks of colon cancer, although evidence suggests that risks of prostate cancer are unrelated to animal fat consumption.|$|E
25|$|While {{many studies}} have found that {{including}} polyunsaturated fats in the diet in place <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> produces more beneficial CVD outcomes, the effects of substituting monounsaturated fats or carbohydrates are unclear.|$|R
2500|$|Blanket {{recommendations}} to lower <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> were criticized at a 2010 conference debate of the American Dietetic Association for focusing too narrowly on reducing <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> rather than emphasizing increased consumption of healthy fats and unrefined carbohydrates. [...] Concern was expressed over {{the health risks}} <b>of</b> replacing <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> in the diet with refined carbohydrates, which carry {{a high risk of}} obesity and heart disease, particularly at the expense of polyunsaturated fats which may have health benefits. [...] None of the panelists recommended heavy consumption <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats,</b> emphasizing instead the importance of overall dietary quality to cardiovascular health.|$|R

25|$|Western {{vegetarian}} diets {{are typically}} high in carotenoids, but relatively low in {{omega-3 fatty acids}} and vitamin B12. Vegans can have particularly low intake of vitamin B and calcium {{if they do not}} eat enough items such as collard greens, leafy greens, tempeh and tofu (soy). High levels of dietary fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, and low consumption <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> are all considered to be beneficial aspects of a vegetarian diet. A well planned vegetarian diet will provide all nutrients in a meat-eater's diet to the same level for all stages of life.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} {{preventive}} measure for type1 diabetes. Type2 diabeteswhich accounts for 85-90% of all casescan often be prevented or delayed by maintaining a normal body weight, engaging in physical activity, and consuming a healthful diet. Higher levels {{of physical activity}} (more than 90 minutes per day) {{reduce the risk of}} diabetes by 28%. Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole grains and fiber, and choosing good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish. Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> can also help prevent diabetes. Tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes and its complications, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{fat content}} of meat can vary widely {{depending}} on the species and breed of animal, {{the way in which}} the animal was raised, including what it was fed, the anatomical part of the body, and the methods of butchering and cooking. Wild animals such as deer are typically leaner than farm animals, leading those concerned about fat content to choose game such as venison. Decades of breeding meat animals for fatness is being reversed by consumer demand for meat with less fat. The fatty deposits that exist with the muscle fibers in meats soften meat when it is cooked and improve the flavor through chemical changes initiated through heat that allow the protein and fat molecules to interact. The fat, when cooked with meat, also makes the meat seem juicier. However, the nutritional contribution of the fat is mainly calories as opposed to protein. As fat content rises, the meat's contribution to nutrition declines. In addition, there is cholesterol associated with fat surrounding the meat. The cholesterol is a lipid associated with the kind <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> found in meat. The increase in meat consumption after 1960 is associated with, though not definitively the cause of, significant imbalances of fat and cholesterol in the human diet.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES. This {{study of}} lipid intakes among {{preschool}} children (1) analyzed {{the contributions of}} 38 food groups to <b>fat,</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat,</b> and cholesterol intakes; (2) estimated the effects of food substitutions on intakes; and (3) examined demographic differences in food group intake and food group sources of these lipids. METHODS. The sample consisted of 547 children, aged 2 to 5 years, from the US Department of Agriculture's 1985 and 1986 Continuing Surveys of Food Intakes by Individuals. Dietary information for 4 nonconsecutive days throughout a year was used. All foods were classified into groups and the lipids contributed from each group were computed. RESULTS. Over 80 % of the children consumed more total <b>fat,</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats,</b> and cholesterol than is recommended. The major source <b>of</b> total <b>fat</b> and <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> was whole milk; the major sources of dietary cholesterol were eggs and whole milk. Children's food consumption patterns differed by {{region of the country}} and race/ethnicity, providing opportunities to refine nutrition education interventions and evaluations. CONCLUSIONS. By substituting lower-fat foods for the major sources <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats,</b> significant reductions in preschool children's intakes <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats,</b> fat, and dietary cholesterol could be achieved...|$|R
50|$|Within Australia {{there is}} a broad {{spectrum}} of different diets that many children have adopted, as Australia is a country of many diverse cultures. However, without a doubt, there are trends reflecting a gross overconsumption <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and fast food being consumed habitually within Australia.|$|R
25|$|The {{existence}} of the French paradox has caused some researchers to speculate that the link between dietary consumption <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and coronary heart disease {{might not be as}} strong as had previously been imagined. This has resulted in a review of the earlier studies which had suggested this link.|$|R
2500|$|Consuming {{large amounts}} <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> can {{negatively}} affect your brain. [...] Eating foods with saturated fats elevates {{the level of}} cholesterol and triglycerides in your body. [...] Studies have shown that high levels of triglycerides strongly link with mood problems such as depression, hostility and aggression. [...] This may occur because high triglyceride levels decrease the amount of oxygen that blood can carry to your brain. The American Heart Association recommends that you consume no more than 16g <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> daily. [...] Common sources <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> are meat and dairy products.|$|E
2500|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{published in}} 2003 {{found a significant}} positive relationship in both control and cohort studies between saturated fat and breast cancer.

2500|$|The {{effects of}} omega-3 fatty acid in the {{prevention}} of dementia is uncertain. [...] Vegetables and nuts may be of benefit, because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats. Non-fish meat, on the other hand, increases the risk of Alzheimer's, because of its high content <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat.</b> However, consumption of fish should be limited due to concerns over mercury poisoning, which could exacerbate the symptoms of dementia.|$|E
50|$|Discussions {{concerning}} the nutritional value of margarines and spreads revolve around two aspects—the {{total amount of}} fat, and the types <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> (<b>saturated</b> <b>fat,</b> trans fat). Usually, a comparison between margarine and butter is included in this context as well.|$|R
40|$|<b>Saturated</b> <b>fats</b> {{have been}} {{in the line of fire}} for more than three decades. The major mistake in {{understanding}} fats was to equate all saturated fatty acids as one. The oversimplification of the relationship <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> with cardiovascular disease (CVD) led to unwarranted removal of some valuable fats from our diets. Recently, the relationship <b>of</b> dietary <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and that <b>of</b> individual <b>saturated</b> fatty acids (SFAs) to CVD risk has been reevaluated. All <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> are not equal and these fats are not as bad as they are made out to be. Thus, not all SFAs in natural fats are atherogenic (formation of fatty deposits in arteries). Butter, clarified butter (desi ghee), coconut oil, and palm oil as a part of a healthy diet are not contraindicated. The review of literature clearly suggests a relook at <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> with respect to atherogenicity and over health...|$|R
2500|$|It {{should be}} noted, {{as this is}} the {{defining}} factor <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fats,</b> that the two-dimensional illustration has implicit hydrogen atoms bonded {{to each of the}} carbon atoms in the polycarbon tail of the myristic acid molecule (there are 13 carbon atoms in the tail; 14 carbon atoms in the entire molecule).|$|R
2500|$|This finding {{tended to}} confirm an earlier {{meta-analysis}} of the nutritional effects <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition which found [...] "rospective epidemiologic {{studies showed that}} there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease.

Unwilling to prescribe the Atkins approach to patients with cardiac issues due to the diet's allowance <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> and limitation of carbohydrates containing fiber and other nutrients, Agatston referenced medical research to build an eating plan that categorized fats and carbohydrates as good or bad and emphasized lean protein and fiber.|$|E
