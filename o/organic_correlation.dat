60|$|On {{the other}} point we lean to the opinion of Professor Owen. We agree with him in {{thinking}} that where a rational correlation (in the highest sense of the term) can be made out, it affords a better basis for deduction than an empirical correlation ascertained only by accumulated observations. Premising that by rational correlation is not meant one {{in which we can}} trace, or think we can trace, a design, but one of which the negation is inconceivable (and this is the species of correlation which Cuvier's principle implies); then we hold that our knowledge of the correlation is of a more certain kind than where it is simply inductive. We think that Professor Huxley, in his anxiety to avoid the error of making Thought the measure of Things, does not sufficiently bear in mind the fact, that as our notion of necessity is determined by some absolute uniformity pervading all orders of our experiences, it follows that an <b>organic</b> <b>correlation</b> which cannot be conceived otherwise, is guaranteed by a much wider induction than one ascertained only by the observation of organisms. But the truth is, that there are relatively few organic correlations of which the negation is inconceivable. If we find the skull, vertebræ, ribs, and phalanges of some quadruped as large as an elephant; we may indeed be certain that the legs of this quadruped were of considerable size--much larger than those of a rat; and our reason for conceiving this correlation as necessary, is, that it is based, not only upon our experiences of moving organisms, but upon all our mechanical experiences relative to masses and their supports. But even were there many physiological correlations really of this order, which there are not, there would be danger in pursuing this line of reasoning, in consequence of the liability to include within the class of truly necessary correlations, those which are not such. For instance, there {{would seem to be a}} necessary correlation between the eye and the surface of the body: light being needful for vision, it might be supposed that every eye must be external. Nevertheless it is a fact that there are creatures, as the Cirrhipedia, having eyes (not very efficient ones, it may be) deeply imbedded within the body. Again, a necessary correlation might be assumed between the dimensions of the mammalian uterus and those of the pelvis. It would appear impossible that in any species there should exist a well-developed uterus containing a full-sized foetus, and yet that the arch of the pelvis should be too small to allow the foetus to pass. And were the only mammal having a very small pelvic arch, a fossil one, it would have been inferred, on the Cuvierian method, that the foetus must have been born in a rudimentary state; and that the uterus must have been proportionally small. But there happens to be an extant mammal having an undeveloped pelvis--the mole--which presents us with a fact that saves us from this erroneous inference. The young of the mole are not born through the pelvic arch at all; but in front of it! Thus, granting that some quite direct physiological correlations may be necessary, we see that there is great risk of including among them some which are not.|$|E
60|$|When {{discussing}} the question {{more than twenty}} years ago (Principles of Biology, § 166), I instanced the decreased size of the jaws in the civilized races of mankind, as a change not accounted for by the natural selection of favourable variations; since no one of the decrements by which, in thousands of years, this reduction has been effected, could have given to an individual in which it occurred, such advantage as would cause his survival, either through diminished cost of local nutrition or diminished weight to be carried. I did not then exclude, as I might have done, two other imaginable causes. It may be said that there is some <b>organic</b> <b>correlation</b> between increased size of brain and decreased size of jaw: Camper's doctrine of the facial angle being referred to in proof. But this argument may be met by pointing to the many examples of small-jawed people who are also small-brained, and by citing not infrequent cases of individuals remarkable for their mental powers, {{and at the same time}} distinguished by jaws not less than the average but greater. Again, if sexual selection be named as a possible cause, there is the reply that, even supposing such slight diminution of jaw as took place in a single generation to have been an attraction, yet the other incentives to choice on the part of men have been too many and great to allow this one to weigh in an adequate degree; while, during the greater portion of the period, choice on the part of women has scarcely operated: in earlier times they were stolen or bought, and in later times mostly coerced by parents. Thus, reconsideration of the facts does not show me the invalidity of the conclusion drawn, that this decrease in size of jaw can have had no other cause than continued inheritance of those diminutions consequent on diminutions of function, implied by the use of selected and well-prepared food. Here, however, my chief purpose is to add an instance showing, even more clearly, the connexion between change of function and change of structure. This instance, allied in nature to the other, is presented by those varieties, or rather sub-varieties, of dogs, which, having been household pets, and habitually fed on soft food, have not been called on to use their jaws in tearing and crunching, and have been but rarely allowed to use them in catching prey and in fighting. No inference can be drawn from the sizes of the jaws themselves, which, in these dogs, have probably been shortened mainly by selection. To get direct proof of the decrease of the muscles concerned in closing the jaws or biting, would require a series of observations very difficult to make. But it is not difficult to get indirect proof of this decrease by looking at the bony structures with which these muscles are connected. Examination of the skulls of sundry indoor dogs contained in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, proves the relative smallness of such parts. The only pug-dog's skull is that of an individual not perfectly adult; and though its traits are quite to the point they cannot with safety be taken as evidence. The skull of a toy-terrier has much restricted areas of insertion for the temporal muscles; has weak zygomatic arches; and has extremely small attachments for the masseter muscles. Still more significant is the evidence furnished by the skull of a King Charles's spaniel, which, if we allow three years to a generation, and bear in mind that the variety must have existed before Charles the Second's reign, we may assume belongs to something approaching to the hundredth generation of these household pets. The relative breadth between the outer surfaces of the zygomatic arches is conspicuously small; the narrowness of the temporal fossæ is also striking; the zygomata are very slender; the temporal muscles have left no marks whatever, either by limiting lines or by the character of the surfaces covered; and the places of attachment for the masseter muscles are very feebly developed. At the Museum of Natural History, among skulls of dogs there is one which, though unnamed, is shown by its small size and by its teeth, to have belonged to one variety or other of lap-dogs, and which has the same traits in an equal degree with the skull just described. Here, then, we have two if not three kinds of dogs which, similarly leading protected and pampered lives, show that in the course of generations the parts concerned in clenching the jaws have dwindled. To what cause must this decrease be ascribed? Certainly not to artificial selection; for most of the modifications named make no appreciable external signs: the width across the zygomata could alone be perceived. Neither can natural selection have had anything to do with it; for even were there any struggle for existence among such dogs, it cannot be contended that any advantage in the struggle could be gained by an individual in which a decrease took place. Economy of nutrition, too, is excluded. Abundantly fed as such dogs are, the constitutional tendency is to find places where excess of absorbed nutriment may be conveniently deposited, rather than to find places where some cutting down of the supplies is practicable. Nor again can there be alleged a possible correlation between these diminutions and that shortening of the jaws which has probably resulted from selection; for in the bull-dog, which has also relatively short jaws, these structures concerned in closing them are unusually large. Thus there remains as the only conceivable cause, the diminution of size which results from diminished use. The dwindling of a little-exercised part has, by inheritance, been made more and more marked in successive generations.|$|E

40|$|In many {{situations}} {{the extension of}} hydrological or water quality time series at short-gauged stations is required. Ordinary least squares regression (OLS) of any hydrological or water quality variable is a traditional and commonly used record extension technique. However, OLS tends to underestimate {{the variance in the}} extended records, which leads to underestimation of high percentiles and overestimation of low percentiles, given that the data are normally distributed. The development of the line of <b>organic</b> <b>correlation</b> (LOC) technique is aimed at correcting this bias. On the other hand, the Kendall-Theil robust line (KTRL) method has been proposed as an analogue of OLS with the advantage of being robust in the presence of outliers.

40|$|The Bechgaard salts and {{the high}} T_c cuprates are {{described}} by two and three band models, respectively, with the lowest band (nearly) half filled. In organics the interactions are small, while in cuprates the repulsion U_d on the Cu site is the largest energy. The Mott AF state is stable in undoped materials in both cases.

The theories of the coherent SDW and charge-transfer correlations in the metallic phases of organics and cuprates are thus similar.

40|$|Abstract—The world {{economic}} crises and budget constraints have caused authorities, {{especially those in}} developing countries, to rationalize water quality monitoring activities. Rationalization consists of {{reducing the number of}} monitoring sites, the number of samples, and/or the number of water quality variables measured. The reduction in water quality variables is usually based on correlation. If two variables exhibit high correlation, it is an indication that some of the information produced may be redundant. Consequently, one variable can be discontinued, and the other continues to be measured. Later, the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression technique is employed to reconstitute information about discontinued variable by using the continuously measured one as an explanatory variable. In this paper, two record extension techniques are employed to reconstitute information about discontinued water quality variables, the OLS and the Line of <b>Organic</b> <b>Correlation</b> (LOC). An empirical experiment is conducted using water quality records from the Nile Delta water quality monitoring network in Egypt. The record extension techniques are compared for their ability to predict different statistical parameters of the discontinued variables. Results show that the OLS is better at estimating individual water quality records. However, results indicate an underestimation {{of the variance in the}} extended records. The LOC technique is superior in preserving characteristics of the entire distribution and avoids underestimation of the variance. It is concluded from this study that the OLS can be used for the substitution of missing values, while LOC is preferable for inferring statements about the probability distribution.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of methods of {{physical}} anthropology available to reconstruct living stature from skeletal remains. Some methods use dimensions of just a few bones, together with regression equations (mathematical, see Table 1 : 1 - 7), while other methods require the whole skeleton and simply add the heights of specific skeletal components (anatomical, see Table 1 : 8 - 11). This study investigates the consistency that mathematical and anatomical methods can provide in the determination of stature from skeletal remains. A significant difference was found between average heights of the same 20 individuals determined from seven mathematical and four anatomical methods (paired t-test, p < 0. 001, df = 19). Mathematical methods provided taller height estimates than anatomical methods; the average difference was 47 mm. A repeated measures ANOVA indicated significant differences in the heights determined by all methods (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Understanding and {{preparing}} for future hydroclimatic variability greatly benefits from long (i. e., multi-century) records at seasonal to annual time steps that have been gridded at km-scale spatial intervals over a geographic region. Kriging is a geostatistical technique commonly used for optimal interpolation of environmental data, and space-time geostatistical models can improve kriging estimates when long temporal sequences of observations exist at relatively few points on the landscape. Here I present how a network of 22 tree-ring chronologies from single-leaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla) in the central Great Basin of North America was used to extend hydroclimatic records both temporally and spatially. First, the Line of <b>Organic</b> <b>Correlation</b> (LOC) method was used to reconstruct October–May total precipitation anomalies at each tree-ring site, as these ecotonal environments at the lower forest border are typically moisture limited. Individual site reconstructions were then combined using a hierarchical model of spatio-temporal kriging that produced annual anomaly maps on a 12 × 12 km grid during the period in common among all chronologies (1650 – 1976). Hydro-climatic episodes were numerically identified and modeled using their duration, magnitude, and peak. Spatial patterns were more variable during wet years than during dry years, {{and the evolution of}} drought episodes over space and time could be visualized and quantified. The most remarkable episode in the entire reconstruction was the early 1900 s pluvial, followed by the late 1800 s drought. The 1930 s "Dust Bowl" drought was among the top ten hydroclimatic episodes in the past few centuries. These results directly address the needs of water and natural resource managers with respect to planning for "worst case" scenarios of drought duration and magnitude at the watershed level.

The aim {{of this study was to}} verify this finding in addition to the macroscopic aspect, and to evaluate its probative value for the diagnosis of drowning. Therefore, water levels in the liver of drowning victims were analyzed by two in practice known methods and compared with values of non- drowning cases. In addition, analyzed organ samples were examined histological in regard to extended spaces of Disse, the <b>organic</b> <b>correlation</b> of liver-edema. Basis for this study were liver samples from drowning cases and acute deceased persons, which had been collected between September 2003 to January 2005. Liver samples had been collected in the catchment area of the three institutes of forensic medicine in Berlin. In addition logged water measurements, histological evidence objects and autopsy protocols of the Forensic Medicine Institute of the Free University of Berlin in Dahlem in the years 1997 to 2003 were used. The water measurements did not show a statistically significant difference between drowning and non-drowning cases with any of the two methods that had been used. The histological examination showed in 93. 0 % of the drowning cases and in 78. 0 % of non-drowning cases enlarged spaces of Disse. The statistical review of the frequency distribution did not show a significant difference. But, perhaps, a long-term study with a greater number of cases could enable significant results, both in histology and analysis. The results speak well for the development of a liver edema during drowning due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the sinusoidal vessels and by cytotoxic hypoxia. Positive findings were noted, however, also with multiple other causes of death. Thus the difficulty arises in differentiating liver edema due to another pathogenesis than drowning and of degenerative and autolytic changes. This leads to the conclusion that the edema of the liver is another non-specific finding in the death by drowning, acceptable as an indication of drowning, but not as evidence...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 In this thesis, stature {{reconstruction}} of three prehistoric/protohistoric Native American populations (from Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, and South Dakota) was performed using the Fully Anatomical method {{in order to}} formulate regression equations and analyze the ability of regression equations of other researchers to accurately estimate the statures within my study populations. The calculation of regression equations demonstrated that {{even though there was}} a significant difference in the statures of the three populations, they were similar enough in body proportions such that regression equations from the pooled sample could be used to accurately estimate statures from all three groups as well as 12 randomly chosen individuals from outside the study sample. Results of statures calculated using the regression formulae of other researchers on my sample populations forced me to conclude that there is too much variation between populations to allow for much inter-populational applicability except in those cases where the populations are similar enough in proportion. For my study groups, the best equations for estimating statures (besides the ones formulated specifically for them) were those of Sciulli et al. for Ohio native Americans, followed closely by Trotter and Gleser's 1952 and 1958 equations. The femur/stature ratio of Feldesman et al (1990) performed relatively poorly, and the formulae of Genoves' for Mesoamericans (1967) were the least accurate. While individual statures may be more highly influenced by genes, the mean statures of populations or homogeneous geographical groups is more controlled by common levels of nutrition, stress, and environment of the individuals within that group. The Arikara were the tallest population: the female mean of that group were as tall as the male means from both the Alaskan and Aleutian populations. The populations in this study differed in their degree of sexual dimorphism, with the Arikara individuals showing the greatest stature difference and dimorphism between males and females. The distal limb bones of the arms and the legs of the individuals from both Alaska and the Aleutian Islands show significant shortening when compared to those of the Arikara, supporting "biogeographical" rules of human adaptations to chronically cold environments. The results of this study illustrate how important it is for researchers to keep studying (and publishing regression equations for) statures of prehistoric and historic populations.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the assessment and redesign of surface water quality monitoring (WQM) networks. The design of WQM networks depends primarily upon {{the objectives of}} the monitoring program and the characteristics of the monitored region. Despite several statistical approaches that have been proposed for the assessment and redesign of long-term WQM networks, several deficiencies in these approaches exist. The main goal {{of this study is to}} propose statistical approaches for the assessment and redesign of WQM networks that overcome existent deficiencies in the currently applied approaches. In addition, this study intends to introduce an innovative approach for the estimation of the water quality characteristics at ungauged sites. Four objectives are specified: (i) to review the current applied statistical approaches for the assessment and redesign of surface WQM networks; (ii) to develop a new statistical approach for the rationalization of water quality variables; (iii) to develop a new statistical approach for the assessment and redesign of WQM locations; and (iv) to introduce a statistical methodology for the estimation of water quality characteristics at ungauged sites. In this study, statistical approaches used for the assessment and redesign of surface water quality monitoring networks are first reviewed. In this review, various monitoring objectives and related procedures used for the assessment and redesign of surface WQM networks are discussed. For each approach, advantages and disadvantages are examined from a network design perspective. The literature review reveals that correlation-regression is the most common approach used to assess and eventually reduce the number of water quality variables in WQM networks. However, several deficiencies in this approach are identified. Based upon these identified deficiencies, a new statistical approach is proposed for the rationalization of water quality variables. The proposed approach overcomes deficiencies in the conventional correlation-regression approach and represents a useful decision support tool for the optimized selection of water quality variables. It allows for the identification of optimal combinations of water quality variables to be continuously measured and those to be discontinued. To reconstitute information about discontinued water quality variables, four record extension techniques are examined. Ordinary least squares regression (OLS), the line of <b>organic</b> <b>correlation</b> (LOC), the Kendall-Theil robust line (KTRL) and KTRL 2, which is a modified version of the KTRL proposed in this study. The advantage of the KTRL 2 is that it includes the advantage of LOC in maintaining variability in the extended records and the advantage of KTRL in being robust in the presence of extreme values. Monte-Carlo and empirical studies are conducted to examine these four techniques for bias, standard error of moment estimates and a full range of percentiles. The Monte-Carlo study showed serious deficiencies in the OLS and KTRL techniques, while the LOC and KTRL 2 techniques have results that are nearly similar. Using real water quality records, the KTRL 2 is shown to lead to better results than the other techniques. The literature review also reveals that several deficiencies in the approaches proposed for the assessment of monitoring locations exist. The deficiencies vary from one approach to another, but generally include: (i) ignoring the characteristics of the basin being monitored in the design approach; (ii) handling multivariate water quality data sequentially rather than simultaneously; (iii) focusing mainly on locations to be discontinued; and (iv) ignoring reconstitution of information at discontinued locations. A methodology that overcomes these deficiencies is proposed. In the proposed methodology, hybrid-cluster analysis is employed to identify groups of sub-basins with similar characteristics. A stratified optimum sampling strategy is then employed to identify the optimum number of monitoring locations in each of the sub-basin groups. An aggregate information index is employed to identify the optimal combination of locations to be discontinued. Results indicate that the proposed methodology allows the identification of optimal combinations of locations to be discontinued, locations to be continuously measured and sub-basins where monitoring locations should be added. To fulfill the last objective, two models are developed for the estimation of water quality mean values at ungauged sites. An ensemble artificial neural network (EANN) model is developed to establish the functional relationship between water quality mean values and basin attributes. The second model is based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and EANN. CCA is used to form canonical attributes space using data from gauged sites. Then, an EANN is applied to identify the functional relationships between water quality mean values and the attributes in the CCA space. A jackknife validation procedure is used to evaluate the performance of the two models. The results show that the developed models are useful for estimating the water quality status at ungauged sites. However, the CCA-based EANN model performed better than the EANN model in terms of prediction accuracy. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Adsorption of {{atrazine}} was studied on two Vertisols and two Alfisols varying {{in their}} physicochemical properties. Soils were equilibrated with various concentrations of atrazine using batch techniques. Adsorption affinity for atrazine was approximated by Freundlich constant (Kf), {{which is a}} measure of the strength or degree of adsorption. Kd values were calculated for atrazine despite some non-linearity in adsorption on both Vertisols and Alfisols. The Kd values are greater for Vertisols than Alfisols and increased with <b>organic</b> carbon content. <b>Correlations</b> were worked out between extent of adsorption and soil properties and were positively correlated with organic carbon (r = 0. 688), clay content (r = 0. 712) and clay + organic carbon (r = 0. 708). KOC values were calculated taking into account the organic carbon content for both Vertisols and Alfisols...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe global AsIII-oxidizing {{activity}} of microorganisms in eight surface soils from polluted sites was quantified {{with and without}} addition of organic substrates. The organic substances provided differed by their nature: either yeast extract, commonly used in microbiological culture media, or a synthetic mixture of defined organic matters (SMOM) presenting some common features with natural soil <b>organic</b> matter. <b>Correlations</b> were sought between soil characteristics and both the AsIII-oxidizing rate constants and their evolution in accordance with inputs of organic substrates. In the absence of added substrate, the global AsIII oxidation rate constant correlated positively with the concentration of intrinsic organic matter in the soil, suggesting that AsIII-oxidizing activity was limited by organic substrate availability in nutrient-poor soils. This limitation was, however, removed by 0. 08 g/L of added organic carbon. In most conditions, the AsIII oxidation rate constant decreased as organic carbon input increased from 0. 08 to 0. 4 g/L. Incubations of polluted soils in aerobic conditions, amended or not with SMOM, resulted in short-term As mobilization {{in the presence of}} SMOM and active microorganisms. In contrast, microbial AsIII oxidation seemed to stabilize As when no organic substrate was added. Results suggest that microbial speciation of arsenic driven by nature and concentration of organic matter exerts a major influence on the fate of this toxic element in surface soils...|$|R
40|$|Breeding maize (Zea mays L.) for {{traditional}} agriculture can increase quality and added value of agricultural products {{and allow the}} recovery of traditional foods. The objectives of this work were to evaluate improved open-pollinated populations under organic and conventional agriculture {{in order to determine}} the effects of selection for yield and flour yield and the relationship between agronomic and quality traits under both cropping systems. We have selected open-pollinated maize populations for flour yield and bakery quality under organic conditions, improved them under conventional conditions and evaluated the breeding programs under organic and conventional conditions. Breeding was efficient for grain and flour yield under organic agriculture for Meiro (an open-pollinated population with black grains) but not for the other populations neither in organic nor in conventional conditions. Yield ranks of varieties were moderately correlated under both conditions, and genotype environment interaction (GE) was significant for most traits when the analyses of variance were made over all environments but also when organic and conventional environments were separated. GE was higher under <b>organic</b> agriculture. <b>Correlations</b> between traits were higher under conventional agriculture and there were important discrepancies between <b>correlations</b> in <b>organic</b> and conventional agriculture. We concluded that selection under conventional agriculture was efficient for one population under organic agriculture. Selection under the target environment could increase the possibilities of success. Key words: organic agriculture; yield; quality; germplasm; breeding 2...|$|R
40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs), {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) and carbonyl compounds are the major organic pollutants in the atmosphere. Emissions from motor vehicles {{have been one of}} the primary pollution sources in the metropolitan area of Hong Kong. A 12 -month monitoring program for VOCs, PAHs and carbonyl compounds was performed at a roadside urban station at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU) in order to determine the correlations of each selected pollutant. The monitoring program ran from 16 April 1999 to 10 April 2000 for a period of 1 year, and a 2 -week winter intensive sampling was carried out during January 2000. Traditionally, emission sources are identified from {{organic compounds}} in air particulates. Since many of the gaseous and particulate phases of organic compounds are from the same sources, correlations between the major exhausts are to be expected. Therefore, it would be more effective to apportion the sources using the combined gaseous and particulate phases of <b>organic</b> compounds. <b>Correlations</b> of selected pollutants within two other toxic air pollutants (TAPs) monitoring stations in Tsuen Wan (TW) and Central/Western (CW) were analyzed. Good correlations were found between pollutants that came from vehicle exhaust, especially in intensive sampling periods at HKPU roadside station. This was because the washing out effect for particulates during rainy days and photochemical degradation during high solar radiation were minimized in wintertime.

40|$|During a 4 -week {{period of}} {{composting}} of wheat straw-amended pig faeces, humin (HU) - and core-HU-like matter were isolated by NaOH-Na 4 P 2 O 7 {{treatment of the}} compost bed, respectively, without and with previous extraction by organic solvent and by H 2 SO 4. The changes in the content and elemental composition of both fractions in the compost bed were monitored. Evidence of the compositional changes was also obtained by NMR spectroscopy and by pyrolysis-GC/MS studies. The results indicated that core-HU-like matter was mainly aromatic, while HU contained both core-HU-Iike {{and other types of}} easily degradable <b>organic</b> matter. <b>Correlation</b> of the data found in this study with data from previous studies on humic acid (HA) - and core-RA-like matter in the same composting process indicated that in the time range from 2 to 4 weeks, the weight loss of the core-HU-Iike matter amounted to 788 g, whereas the weight of total core-HA-like matter increased by 87 g. In spite of the high weight loss, the NAIR and pyrolysis-GC/MS spectra failed to reveal significant changes in the chemical nature of the core-HU-Iike residue. However, the chemical composition of the core-HA-like matter changed significantly and tended to become {{similar to that of the}} core-HU-Iike matter when the composting time increased. The data suggest that, during composting, core-HU-Iike matter undergoes both conversion to new core-HA-like soluble matter and biodegradation to volatile products...|$|R

The activity of the LDOx catalysts was demonstrated to be proportional to the surface density of basic sites. LDO 2 calcined at 600 °C exhibited maximum activity for the transesterification reaction. The beneficial effect of the optimum ratio of Mg/Al = 2 is related to its high total basicity.
