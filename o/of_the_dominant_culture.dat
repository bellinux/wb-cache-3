5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of the American Indian Movement, {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>culture.</b> Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E

Reverse racism describes discriminatory actions by members of a minority group against a dominant or formerly dominant racial or other group representative of the majority in a particular society. Those who campaign for the interests of ethnic minorities commonly reject the term [...] "reverse racism". From their perspective, [...] "racism" [...] is defined {{not only in terms of}} individual prejudice, but also in terms of a power structure which protects the interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> and actively discriminates against ethnic minorities.

The Qing dynasty made it clear to the Japanese that Taiwan was definitely within Qing jurisdiction, even though part of that island's aboriginal population was not yet under the influence of Chinese culture.

50|$|Often, the oppositional culture/identity {{created by}} the {{involuntary}} minority involves the incorporation of attitudes, behaviors, and speech styles that are stigmatized by the dominant group, which, of course, precludes those who adopt the manifestations of the oppositional culture from external success in the dominant culture.

Therefore, those who are not members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> are at a disadvantage to receive cultural information, and therefore will remain at a disadvantage. Capitalist societies depend on a stratified social system, where the working class has an education suited for manual labor: leveling out such inequalities would break down the system. Therefore, schools in capitalist societies require a method of stratification, and often choose to do so in a way in which the dominant culture will not lose its hegemony. One method of maintaining this stratification is through cultural reproduction.|$|E

50|$|Integrative {{communication}} {{theory suggests that}} these varying levels of integration within a culture directly impact the individual's experience in the new culture, which other research suggests. According to Don C. Locke, one major difference among members of various cultural groups within America {{is the degree to}} which they have immersed themselves into the culture of the United States. He states that members of culturally diverse groups can be placed into several categories. Bicultural individuals are able to function as competently in the dominant culture as their own while holding on to manifestations of their own culture. Traditional individuals hold on to a majority of cultural traits from the culture of origin and reject many traits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>culture.</b> A third type of individual will acculturate and give up most cultural traits of the culture of origin and traits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>culture.</b> Finally, a marginal individual does not fit into the culture of origin nor into the dominant culture.|$|E
