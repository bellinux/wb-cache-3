5|$|By the 1960s, {{even before}} the {{increase}} of abuse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Case</b> Stated procedure, the United Kingdom {{was estimated to be}} losing £500 million a year through the movement of arbitration business to other countries. In response, the Lord Chancellor convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the conclusion was that the status quo should remain. With the increased use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Case</b> Stated procedure, more calls for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage current law was causing. In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the system so that appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or both parties to the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Case</b> Stated procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective: In this study, <b>the</b> {{efficacy}} <b>of</b> thoracic ultrasonography during echocardiography {{was evaluated}} in newborns. Methods: Sixty newborns {{who had undergone}} pediatric cardiac surgery were successively evaluated between March 1, 2015, and September 1, 2015. Patients were evaluated for effusion, pulmonary atelectasis, and pneumothorax by ultrasonography, and results were compared with X-ray findings. Results: Sixty percent (n= 42) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> were male, <b>the</b> median age was 14 days (2 - 30 days), and the median body weight was 3. 3 kg (2. 8 - 4. 5 kg). The median RACHS- 1 score was 4 (2 - 6). Atelectasis was demonstrated in 66 % (n= 40) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Five <b>of</b> them were determined solely by X-ray, 10 of them only by ultrasonography, and 25 of them by both ultrasonography and X-ray. Pneumothorax was determined in 20 % (n= 12) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Excluding one case determined by both methods, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 11 <b>cases</b> were diagnosed by X-ray.

Material and Method: Clinical onset findings, clinical progress and radiologic findings were evaluated. A total of 33 regularly followed cases were introduced to the study. Results: Mean age, disease onset age, age of measles infection and latent period were 10. 53 ± 2. 37 years, 7. 93 ± 1. 84 years, 13. 06 ± 8. 85 months and 6. 96 ± 1. 99 years, respectively. Seventy eight percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> (n= 26) were males and 22 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> were females. Fifty two percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> (n= 18) were in stage 3 a. Ninety seven percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> (n= 32) had history of measles infection and 42 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> (n= 14) were not vaccinated. The most presenting symptom was head drop and 60 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> (n= 14) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. The most common radiologic abnormality was periventricular and subcortical white matter changes which were detected in T 2 imaging series.

40|$|Because {{there is}} the {{impression}} that psoriatic arthritis is a composite disorder with mild forms close to more severe and aggressive ones, we conducted a multicenter study with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> characterizing disease expression in a large cohort of Italian patients. One-thousand-three-hundred-six patients fulfilled inclusion criteria and were analyzed in this study. Psoriasis antedated <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> arthritis in <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> (67. 7 %). More rare was inverse or simultaneous onset which occurred in 17. 3 % and 15. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases,</b> respectively. Peripheral articular involvement (mono-oligo or polyarthritis) was recorded in 88. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> while spondylitis occurred in 11. 3 %. Peripheral enthesopathies were found in 28. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> with a marked occurrence in patients with axial involvement (64. 5 % vs 35. 5 % in oligo or polyarthritis). Abnormal levels of ESR and CRP respectively occurred in 52. 2 % and in 52. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases,</b> while rheumatoid factor was detected in 5. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> distribution of joint involvement, symmetry and presence of peripheral enthesopathies we recognized three clusters of arthritis.

40|$|Objectives: Analyze <b>the</b> {{anatomic}} variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> testicular {{veins in}} human cadavers and fetuses. Materials and Methods: One hundred male adult cadavers and 24 fetuses were studied. Four anatomic aspects were considered: 1) Number of testicular veins, 2) <b>The</b> local <b>of</b> vein termination, 3) Type {{and number of}} collaterals present and 4) Testicular vein termination angle. Results: Cadavers – Right side – One testicular vein occurred in 85 % and 2 veins in 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> There were communi-cating veins with the colon in 21 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Left side – One testicular vein occurred in 82 %, two veins in 15 %, three veins in 2 % and four veins in 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> There were communicating veins with the colon in 31 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Fetuses – Right side –One testicular vein occurred in all cases.

40|$|Background. Eye {{injuries}} {{constitute a}} leading problem in eye surgery worldwide, {{as well as}} at our department. Their treatment is very complex, and requires a wide surgical knowledge and surgical skills supported by the material and the equipment. Aim. To analyze <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> vitreoretinal surgery on 647 patients with severe penetrating eye injuries in the period from 1991 to 1998. Methods. The study included a retrospective analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> 647 injuries, out of which 500 were penetrating, and 147 were severe contusion injuries. Attention was payed to the penetrating injuries with intraocular foreign body (IOFB), to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performed pars plana vitrectomies (VPP), to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extirpated foreign bodies, as well as to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional retinal ablation surgeries. Also significant proved <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> contusion injuries, and <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> their complete surgical management - the surgery combined with <b>the</b> implantation <b>of</b> intraocular lens, as well as their functional results. Results. Inside the said period, 558 VPPs were performed, 60 conventional retinal ablation surgeries, and 29 combined anterior/posterior segment surgeries. VPP was applied in 286 (51. 3 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> with penetrating injuries with IOFB, and in 58 (10. 4 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> with contusion injuries. VPP in one eye was applied in 464 (83 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases,</b> in both eyes in 65 (11. 8 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases,</b> and in a single eye in 29 (5. 2 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Following VPP, silicone oil tamponade was done in 352 (63 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases,</b> air tamponade in 123 (22 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases,</b> and Ringer-BSS tamponade in 83 (15 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Laser photocoagulation (LFC) was performed in 484 (87 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases,</b> cryocoagulation in 45 (8 %), while neither of them was done in 29 (5 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> In all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional retinal ablation (n = 60), a placement of a serclage was applied and exocryocoagulation was performed, while in <b>the</b> 52 <b>cases</b> a placement of a scleral flap was applied. Combined surgery - lensectomy, VPP, and an anterior chamber intraocular lens (AC IOL), was applied in 16 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases,</b> and phacoemulsification, VPP and a posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) in 13 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Conclusion. Vitrectomy was the most frequently applied surgery in solving the complex eye injuries. The eye injuries treated in our department were with the IOFB, and the retinal ablation. The IOFBs in our patients were almost completely extirpated. The applied combined anterior/posterior segment surgeries had the potential to safely and successfully condense those separate procedures in one surgery.
