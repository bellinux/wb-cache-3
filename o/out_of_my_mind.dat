He also published his memoir Hippie Hippie Shake, which has been adapted as a film by Working Title. The film was not released for unknown reasons. Neville had sent the manuscript of his autobiography for Greer to check but she did not read it. When the book was published, however, she took offence.|$|E

500|$|In 1976, {{speaking}} as The Thin White Duke, Bowie's persona at the time, and [...] "at least partially tongue-in-cheek", he made statements that {{expressed support for}} fascism and perceived admiration for Adolf Hitler in interviews with Playboy, NME and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: [...] "Britain is ready for a fascist leader... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership." [...] He was also quoted as saying: [...] "Adolf Hitler {{was one of the}} first rock stars" [...] and [...] "You've got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up." [...] Bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with Melody Maker in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems at the time, saying: [...] "I was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> totally, completely crazed." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1921 Grainger {{moved with}} his mother to a large house in White Plains, New York. This was [...] his [...] home for the {{remainder}} of his life. From the beginning of 1922 Rose's health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from [...] delusions and nightmares, and became [...] fearful that her illness would harm her son's career. Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there had long been [...] rumours that [...] their relationship was incestuous; [...] in April 1922 Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough. From her last letter to Grainger, dated 29 April, it seems that this confrontation unbalanced Rose; on 30 April, while Grainger was touring on the West Coast, she jumped to her death from an office window [...] on the 18th floor of the Aeolian Building in New York City. The letter, which began [...] "I am <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and cannot think properly", asked Grainger if he had ever spoken to Lotta of [...] "improper love". She signed the letter: [...] "Your poor insane mother".|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E

500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu kick lines, and sang {{to the tune of}} Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay: [...] "We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair." [...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay powerites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." [...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not a good thing to do, because they got me in the back with a nightstick." [...] Another account stated, [...] "I just can't ever get that one sight <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> The cops with the [...] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line." ...|$|E
500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went and got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually {{back in the days}} when I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E

2500|$|On February 16, 2003, Butler {{received}} the American Society of Cinematographers Lifetime Achievement Award. His memorable and influential work on Jaws {{is one of}} the many reasons the ASC honored him with the award, and Spielberg wrote a letter to Butler acknowledging his award which indicated the director's mutual respect for Butler and his work behind the camera. [...] "You were the calm before, during and after every storm on the set of Jaws," [...] Spielberg wrote in the letter. [...] "Without your zen-like confidence and wonderful sense of humor, I would have gone the way of the rest of the Jaws crew â€” totally <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friggin' <b>mind.</b> Congratulations on this well-deserved career achievement award from your peers.

2500|$|The {{pattern of}} Wilson's speechmaking was {{exemplified}} by his performances in Buffalo and New York City. His oratory style was, [...] "right <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> {{as it is}} working at the time". He maintained towards his primary opponent Roosevelt a tone of humorous detachment, describing the Bull Moose party as [...] "the irregular Republicans, the variegated Republicans". Wilson shunned the stump speech campaign routine, and initially was reluctant to conduct an extensive campaign tour, but this changed after Roosevelt went on the offensive.|$|E

6000|$|About {{this time}} it was that I {{perceived}} my lord began to look very pale and meagre, and I had a notion he was going into a consumption, but did not dare tell him so, for fear he should say I was daily looking for his death, and was now overjoyed that I saw a shadow of it; nevertheless, he soon after began to find himself in a very bad state of health, for he said to me one morning, that my care would not last long, for he believed he was seized by a distemper it was impossible for him to get over. [...] "My lord," [...] said I, [...] "you do not do me justice in imagining anything concerning me that does not tend to your own happiness, for if your body is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> order, <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> suffers for it." [...] Indeed, had he died then, without making a will, it might have been well for me; but he was not so near death as that; and, what was worse, the distemper, which proved a consumption (which was occasioned chiefly by much study, watchings, melancholy thoughts, wilful and obstinate neglect of taking care of his body, and such like things), held him nine weeks and three days after this, before it carried him off.|$|R

[...] He began using Goa music, something he discovered on the beaches of Goa in India, fusing it with similar-sounding European tracks to create his own distinct sound.

They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties.

6000|$|J. H. Hackett, in {{his part}} of Falstaff, was an actor who gave Mr. [...] Lincoln great delight.

(Let me pour you <b>out</b> another glass <b>of</b> this Conquistador: yes, it's the old '87: but I suppose we'll never get any more of it on this side: they say that the rich Spaniards are making so much money they're buying up every cask of it and it will never be exported again. Just another illustration of the way that the war hits everybody alike.) But, as I was saying, I think if YOU were to raise a complaint about the income tax, you'd find the whole country--I mean all the men with incomes--behind you. I don't suppose they'd want you to mention their names. But they'd be BEHIND you, see? They'd all be there. (Will you try one of these Googoolias? They're the very best, but I guess we'll never see them again. They say the rich Cubans are buying them up. So the war hits us there, too.) As I see it, the income tax is the greatest mistake the government ever made. It hits the wrong man. It falls on the man with an income and lets the other man escape. The way I look at it, and the way all the men that will be behind you look at it, is that if a man sticks tight to it and goes on earning all the income he can, he's doing his bit, in his own way, to win the war. All we ask is to be let alone (don't put that in your notes as from me, but you can say it), let us alone to go on quietly piling up income till we get the Germans licked. But if you start to take away our income, you discourage us, you knock all the patriotism <b>out</b> <b>of</b> us. To <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> a man's income and his patriotism are the same thing.

The only mathematician on his list was Bernhard Riemann. Influenced by the Catholic mystic Marthe Robin who was claimed to survive on the Holy Eucharist alone, Grothendieck almost starved himself to death in 1988. His growing preoccupation with spiritual matters was also evident in a letter titled Lettre de la Bonne Nouvelle sent to 250 friends in January 1990.

2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track.

[...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take.
