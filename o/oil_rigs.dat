5|$|An upper-low {{pressure}} system {{formed in the}} Gulf of Mexico on September6, with the circulation heading westward. Initially, minimal development occurred, though by September8, the system became a surface low. It is estimated that the surface low became a subtropical depression by 0000UTC on the following day. Over the next 24hours, the low began acquiring tropical characteristics, mainly from developing deep convection on its north and east sides. By early on September10, observations from <b>oil</b> <b>rigs,</b> radars, and Air Force reconnaissance flights indicated that the subtropical system had transitioned into Tropical Depression Four. However, the National Hurricane Center did not operationally issue advisories until 1900UTC on September10, at which time Chris was already a tropical storm.|$|E

5|$|A broad mid-tropospheric trough {{over the}} southeastern United States spawned {{an area of}} {{convection}} over the lower Mississippi River Valley on July 13, and drifted southward towards the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. As it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, a weak and isolated surface low pressure area formed {{off the coast of}} Louisiana. The circulation in the system steadily expanded, and initially the surface winds and convection were intermittent. On July 16, deep convection increased and organized near the center, and <b>oil</b> <b>rigs</b> and surface buoys reported surface winds of 30mph (50km/h). Based on the observations, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Four on July 16 while about 150miles (240km) south of the southwestern Louisiana coastline.|$|E
5|$|By 11 January, the Apache Corporation began {{evacuating}} all non-essential {{personnel from}} <b>oil</b> <b>rigs</b> {{in the path}} of the storm.

Across the Pilbara region, the State Emergency Service advised residents to secure loose objects and ensure their emergency kits were stocked. Incident management teams were also established to help people in the wake of the storm. Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha. Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at-risk areas in Narelle's path to speed up power restoration in the wake of the storm. In Carnarvon, mango producers picked as much of their fruit as possible before the storm arrived to minimise losses.|$|E

5|$|On September5, {{a frontal}} trough, the same {{responsible}} for the extratropical transition of Tropical Storm Lee, passed through the western Gulf of Mexico before stalling in the central Gulf of Mexico and Bay of Campeche. At the tail-end of the trough, increased shower and thunderstorm activity associated with a developing low-pressure area prompted the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to begin monitoring the disturbance for tropical cyclone formation the next day. The low separated from the front early on September7, but convection was too disorganized for classification at the time. By 1800UTC, however, a curved band developed in the western semicircle of the circulation. In accordance with satellite imagery, surface observations from land and <b>oil</b> <b>rigs,</b> and data from a reconnaissance aircraft, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Storm Nate, positioned roughly 160mi (260km) north of Villahermosa, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} on Dauphin Island voluntarily evacuated, {{spurred by}} memories of 1979's Hurricane Frederic and Jeanne's northward motion. 3,000 workers evacuated their <b>oil</b> <b>rigs</b> because of Jeanne's high waves. The National Hurricane Center advised small watercraft {{to remain in}} ports from Brownsville to Tarpon Springs. Forecasters expected tides of 2feet above normal in Louisiana, which increased to 4feet above normal along coastal Texas. In Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, schools were closed because of uncertainties regarding Jeanne's path. The hurricane center also expected Jeanne to make landfall in southwestern Louisiana, although the hurricane eventually stayed offshore; thousands of residents moved inland, while Civil Defense officials remained alert. Forecasters expected locally heavy rainfall, although they suggested it would remain below 8inches (203mm).|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to cause significant disruption to oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico. Several hundred active wells went out of service, and drilling {{came to a halt}} for a few days during and after the cyclone's passage. One of Humble company's tenders saw three-quarters of its mooring chains compromised, which swung it around into an adjacent oil platform, causing $200,000 in damage (1956USD). The cost to downtime in production was greater than the damage Flossy created to the <b>oil</b> <b>rigs.</b> There was no loss of life. Due to the impact of Flossy on oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico, the American Petroleum Institute formed a committee called Fundamental Research on Weather Forecasting. Their goal was to use mathematical models and historic data to better predict hurricane formation and path. Studies went on into 1962, but no reliable forecast mechanism was found.|$|E

30|$|We {{found that}} non-experts almost always chose the closer <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> {{to the center}} of the {{hurricane}} forecast when the <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> fell on an individual hurricane track, consistent with prior work showing a strategy to report more damage to locations close to the center (Ruginski et al., 2016). However, when the farther <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> visually overlapped with a single ensemble track, judgments were significantly biased by the individual path, decreasing the likelihood of choosing the close location. The results of the second study suggest that ensemble displays have their own set of interpretation biases, as individual ensemble members can be over weighted in participants’ judgments.|$|R
5|$|While on its erratic path off the {{northern}} Gulf Coast, Juan killed 12people, nine of whom offshore due to overturned <b>oil</b> <b>rigs</b> or boats.

The damage total included losses to the oil industry, wrecked crops, and overall flooding damage, mostly in Louisiana. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Juan injured 1,357people, mostly to a minor extent.

5|$|Shortly {{after first}} developing, one oil company {{evacuated}} its <b>oil</b> <b>rigs</b> off of Texas and Louisiana by helicopter, {{with several other}} companies beginning to evacuate unneeded workers. Ultimately, 7,000 oil workers were removed from offshore oil platforms. The threat of the developing disturbance prompted officials to close a state park in southern Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along the northern Gulf Coast to remain at port. Initially, Anita was predicted to continue tracking west-northwestward and make landfall near the Texas/Louisiana border. As a result, schools in Cameron Parish, Louisiana were closed, and on August 30 a hurricane watch was issued for the southwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas coastlines. After the track shifted further to the south, the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning between Brownsville and just south of Corpus Christi, Texas. An emergency shelter was opened in Brownwood, Texas, and Army trucks were prepared to assist in evacuations. An official from the National Weather Service recommended evacuation for all residents east of Galveston, Texas living in an area below 5 feet (1.5 m) above sea level; about 20,000 left Cameron, Louisiana. In all, about 58,000 people evacuated coastal locations in Louisiana and Texas.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression drifted southeastward, and {{within hours of}} its formation it emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. Based on ship reports and observations from <b>oil</b> <b>rigs,</b> it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl at 1000UTC on August 8 while located just offshore coastal Louisiana. Conditions remained favorable for further intensification, with the circulation located over warm waters and maintaining well-defined outflow; early on August 9 Beryl attained its peak intensity of 50mph while located about 75miles (120km) southeast of New Orleans. Shortly thereafter, a trough from the northwest dissipated the anticyclone and resulted in a steady northwest motion very near where the cyclone originally moved offshore. Beryl maintained tropical storm status for about 18hours before weakening to a tropical depression over central Louisiana. It turned to the northwest, and the surface circulation dissipated on August 10 while located a short distance south of Shreveport, Louisiana. The surface low pressure area crossed into north Texas before dissipating early on August 12, while its upper-level circulation turned northward into Oklahoma before being merged by an approaching trough.|$|E
