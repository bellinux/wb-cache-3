5|$|A dwarf, in the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy roleplaying game, is a {{humanoid}} race, one of {{the primary}} races available for player characters. The idea for the D dwarf comes from European mythologies and J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), and has been used in D and its predecessor Chainmail since the early 1970s. Variations from the standard dwarf archetype <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> and stout demihuman are commonly called subraces, of which {{there are more than a}} dozen across many different rule sets and campaign settings.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown on Soviet {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was {{in black and white}} as the Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again in black and white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> explanatory note {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent mess in the eyes of many critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E

In the same period, he was often heard in New York playing solo, in duos, or in trios. In 1988 he played with a band founded by Mingus' widow to perform the bassist's compositions – the Mingus Big Band.
