The Spanish explored the entire bay and concluded that it had much promise and thus reported their findings to Cavite. This report was not well-accepted in Manila as the Spanish command was reluctant to move to the provincial isolation of Subic. Finally, in 1884, a Royal Decree declared Subic Bay as a naval port.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{reported}} crimes in which the perpetrators cited Grand Theft Auto IV as their primary influence. On 27 June 2008, six teenagers were arrested after participating in a crime spree in New Hyde Park, New York. The teenagers mugged a man, knocking his teeth out, attempted to hijack a car, and smashed a passing van with a bat. According to the Nassau County Police, the teenagers claimed that they were inspired by Grand Theft Auto IV. On 4 August 2008, BBC Newsbeat reported that an 18-year-old student had been arrested in Bangkok, Thailand for the murder of a taxi driver after attempting to hijack the vehicle. Bangkok police captain Veerarit Pipatanasak stated that the student [...] "wanted to find <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game". Grand Theft Auto IV was subsequently banned in Thailand as a result.

500|$|Under Section 4(a), {{a covered}} {{jurisdiction}} may seek exemption from coverage {{through a process}} called [...] "bailout." [...] To achieve an exemption, a covered jurisdiction must obtain a declaratory judgment from a three-judge panel of the District Court for D.C. that the jurisdiction is eligible to bail out. As originally enacted, a covered jurisdiction was eligible to bail <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had not used a test or device with a discriminatory purpose or effect during the 5 years preceding its bailout request. Therefore, a jurisdiction that requested to bail out in 1967 would have needed {{to prove that it}} had not misused a test or device since at least 1962. Until 1970, this effectively required a covered jurisdiction to prove that it had not misused a test or device since before the Act was enacted five years earlier in 1965, making it impossible for many covered jurisdictions to bail out. However, Section 4(a) also prohibited covered jurisdictions from using tests or devices in any manner, discriminatory or otherwise; hence, under the original Act, a covered jurisdiction would become eligible for bailout in 1970 by simply complying with this requirement. But in the course of amending the Act in 1970 and 1975 to extend the special provisions, Congress also extended the period of time that a covered jurisdiction must not have misused a test or device to 10 years and then to 17 years, respectively. These extensions continued the effect of requiring jurisdictions to prove that they had not misused a test or device since before the Act's enactment in 1965.|$|E

In his memoirs Time and Chance, Callaghan wrote that introducing the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill had been an unwelcome task but {{that he did not}} regret it. He claimed the Asians had [...] "discovered a loophole" [...] and he told a BBC interviewer: [...] "Public opinion in this country was extremely agitated, and the consideration that was in my mind was how we could preserve a proper sense of order in this country and, at the same time, do justice to these people—I had to balance both considerations". An opponent of the Act, Conservative MP Ian Gilmour, asserted that it was [...] "brought in to keep the blacks <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> had been the case that it was 5,000 white settlers who were coming in, the newspapers and politicians, Callaghan included, who were making all the fuss would have been quite pleased".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Jim Kaat earned {{rave reviews}} {{for his role}} as CBS' backup analyst (which flashed a {{considerable}} [...] "good-guy air"). Ron Bergman wrote of Kaat's performance during the 1990 ALCS, [...] "This was a night for pitchers to excel. Dave Stewart. Roger Clemens.

He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead NFL on CBS color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes into the booth he felt compelled to use them and would [...] "force" [...] something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said [...] "Then John told me if he did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank.

2500|$|Despite lengthy {{delays in}} their own programme, the Luftwaffe beat the British efforts into the air by nine months. A lack of cobalt for {{high-temperature}} steel alloys meant the German designs were always at risk of overheating and damaging their turbines. The low-grade alloy production versions of the Junkers Jumo 004, designed by Dr. Anselm Franz and which powered the Messerschmitt Me 262 would typically last only 10–25hours (longer with an experienced pilot) before burning <b>out,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was accelerated too quickly, the compressor would stall and power was immediately lost and sometimes it exploded on their first startup. [...] Over 200 German pilots were killed during training. [...] Nevertheless, the Me 262 could fly far faster than allied planes and had very effective firepower. [...] Although Me 262s were introduced late in the war they shot down 542 or more allied planes and in one allied bombing raid downed 32 of the 36 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. Whittle's designs were more basic, with centrifugal compressors rather than the more complicated axial designs. [...] The latter, having several stages of rotating blades, each stage increasing the pressure, were potentially more efficient but were {{much more difficult to}} develop. [...] The UK designs also had better materials such as the Nimonic alloys for turbine blades. Early UK jet engines would run for 150hours between overhauls and had better power-to-weight ratio and specific fuel consumption compared with the German designs. By the end of the Second World War, other UK engine companies were working on jet designs based on the Whittle pattern, such as the de Havilland Goblin and Ghost engines. However, the advantages of axial-flow compressors with their higher pressure ratios compared with simpler centrifugal designs led to a transition to axial compressors in the late 1940s, epitomised by the Rolls-Royce Avon series, Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire, Bristol Olympus, and others.|$|E
2500|$|Most wine racks are {{designed}} to allow a wine to be stored on its side. The thinking behind this orientation is that the cork {{is more likely to}} stay moist and not dry <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is kept in constant contact with the wine. Some wineries package their wines upside down in the box for much the same reason. Research in the late 1990s suggested that the ideal orientation for wine bottles is at a slight angle, rather than completely horizontal. This allows the cork to maintain partial contact with the wine in order to stay damp but also keeps the air bubble formed by a wine's ullage at the top rather than {{in the middle of the}} bottle if the wine is lying on its side. Keeping the ullage near the top, it has been argued, allows for a slower and more gradual oxidation and maturation process. This is because the pressure of the air bubble that is the ullage space rises and falls depending on temperature fluctuation. When exposed to higher temperatures the bubble's pressure increases (becomes positive relative to the air outside of the bottle), and if the wine is tilted at an angle, this compressed gas will diffuse through the cork and not harm the wine. [...] When the temperature falls the process reverses. [...] If the wine is completely on its side then this action will eject some wine through the cork. Through this [...] "breathing" [...] which can result from variations in temperature, oxygen may be repeatedly introduced into the bottle and as a result, can react with the wine. [...] An appropriate and constant temperature is therefore preferred. Additionally, oxidation will occur more rapidly at higher temperatures and gases dissolve into liquids faster the lower the temperature.|$|E
