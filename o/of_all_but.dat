5|$|Action Film and JIF {{continued}} producing films {{until the}} beginning of the Japanese occupation of the Indies began in early 1942, leading to the closing <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> one film studio. The cast of Srigala Item remained with JIF until the company closed, as did Tan. According to JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Catalogue of Indonesian Films), a copy of Srigala Item is stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta. The reels have been damaged by acid, leading to part of the film being excised.|$|E
5|$|Bowman Creek's main stem is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and the watersheds <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> two of its tributaries have the same designation. The watersheds of the remaining two tributaries, Sorber Run and Cider Run, are {{designated as}} Exceptional Value waters, with standards even {{higher than those of}} High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries. Additionally, these two tributaries are the only Wilderness Trout Streams in Wyoming County. Wild trout naturally reproduce throughout all of the creek's tributaries. A total of ten named streams in the watershed of Bowman Creek are classified by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Class A Wild Trout Waters. Most hold this designation for brook trout only, but Sugar Hollow Creek and a section of Roaring Run hold the designation for rainbow trout, either instead of or in addition to brook trout.|$|E

5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century the area {{developed}} into a major saw-milling region, supplying the newly developing town of Dunedin with timber shipped from the ports of Waikawa and Fortrose. A -long jetty was built at Fortrose in 1875, although this has long since disappeared. Several shipwrecks occurred along the treacherous coastline during this period. Most notably, one of New Zealand's worst shipping disasters occurred here: {{the wreck of the}} passenger-steamer Tararua, en route from Bluff to Port Chalmers, which foundered off Waipapa Point on 29 April 1881 with the loss <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> 20 of the 151 people aboard.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings {{were heavily}} invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended {{the house and}} the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire, resulting in the destruction <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the 71st Highlanders, a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by Hugh Halkett's 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out {{until the end of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the {{previous}} Bond film, Licence to Kill, in July 1989, pre-production work for the third James Bond film starring Timothy Dalton, fulfilling his three-film contract, began in May 1990. A poster for the then-upcoming movie was even featured on the Carlton Hotel during the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In August, The Sunday Times reported that producer Albert R. Broccoli had parted company with writer Richard Maibaum, who had worked on the scripts <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> three Bond films so far, and director John Glen, responsible for the previous five instalments of the series. Broccoli listed among the possible directors John Landis, Ted Kotcheff, and John Byrum. Broccoli's stepson Michael G. Wilson contributed a script, and Wiseguy co-producer Alfonse Ruggiero Jr. was hired to rewrite. Production was set to start in 1990 in Hong Kong for a release in late 1991.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Andrew was a Category 5 Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{that struck}} the Bahamas and Florida in mid-August 1992, the most destructive hurricane to ever hit the state. It {{was the strongest}} in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the United States until it was surpassed by Katrina in 2005. Andrew caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was felt in South Florida, with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (270 km/h). Passing directly through the city of Homestead in Dade County (now known as Miami-Dade County), it stripped many homes <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> their concrete foundations. In total, it destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $26.5 billion in damage, and left 65 people dead.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the ATC made {{progress}} toward protecting the trail from development, thanks to efforts {{of politicians and}} officials. The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail as the first national scenic trails and {{paved the way for}} a series of National Scenic Trails within the National Park and National Forest systems. Trail volunteers worked with the National Park Service to map a permanent route for the trail, and by 1971 a permanent route had been marked (though minor changes continue to this day). By the close of the 20th century, the Park Service had completed the purchase <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> a few miles of the trail's span.|$|E

5|$|The Hudson Bay territories (known to the English as Prince Rupert's Land) {{were not}} {{significantly}} fought over in this war. They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick left France in control <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> one outpost on the bay. The only incident of note was a French attack on the outpost of Fort Albany in 1709. The Hudson's Bay Company was unhappy that Ryswick had not returned its territories, and it successfully lobbied {{for the return of}} its territories in the negotiations that ended this war.|$|E

5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies P. o. obsoleta is 12–13cm (4.7–5.1in) long with light brown upperparts, becoming paler {{on the lower}} back, and a short square tail that has small white patches near the tips <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> the central and outermost pairs of feathers. It has a pale grey throat, upper breast and underwing coverts, {{and the rest of}} the underparts are a dirty white. The eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The wing length averages 1.3cm (4.55in) and the tail averages 4.8cm (1.9in). The sexes are similar in appearance, but juveniles have pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers. The other subspecies differ from the nominate form as detailed in the table above.|$|E

The eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The sexes are similar, but juveniles show pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers. The species differ in plumage shades and size, Eurasian crag martin being significantly larger than the others. The flight is slow, with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat-winged glides. The songs of these birds are simple twitterings, and contact calls include a high-pitched twee or chi, chi, and a tshir or trrt call {{like that of the}} house martin.|$|E
5|$|Within hours, {{suspected}} KLA gunmen {{attacked a}} Serb-owned café in Peć, killing six unarmed Serb youths. Western diplomats suspected {{the attack was}} carried out in retaliation for the ambush, though the KLA denied responsibility. Several days later, Yugoslav authorities returned the bodies <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> three of the fallen militants following mediation by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The militants were given heroes' funerals in a rebel-held area, in a ceremony attended by thousands of ethnic Albanians, including other KLA fighters. In January 1999, the KLA abducted eight VJ personnel, who were later exchanged for the nine militants captured in the ambush.|$|E
5|$|In France, {{the action}} was infamous for a {{despatch}} supposedly sent by Dupotet and subsequently printed in edited form in the newspaper Le Moniteur Universel. The report, which was later used by Mends in his dispute with Seymour, claimed that Niémen had not only been largely undamaged before Arethusas arrival, but that Seymour had actually surrendered to the French captain before Mends arrived. This story, almost totally invented, was widely believed in France at the time. The effect on the Mauritius campaign of the defeat of Niémen was not immediately apparent, Hamelin's squadron remaining a menace to British shipping well into 1810. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the destructive Battle of Grand Port, the French, although the victors, were unable to repair their ships due to lack of naval stores and their effectiveness declined until they were unable to resist the Invasion of Isle de France in November 1810. This inability was directly related to the failure <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> one of the French frigates sent to reinforce and resupply the island to reach it, the others either captured or driven back en route.|$|E

5|$|Judges of the Subordinate Courts do {{not enjoy}} the {{security}} of tenure enjoyed by the Supreme Court judges. As officers of the Singapore Legal Service, {{it is said that}} there is a risk of executive interference because judges may be removed from their judicial positions or transferred to lower-ranking positions elsewhere within the Legal Service by the Legal Service Commission (LSC). In 1984, the Senior District Judge Michael Khoo acquitted Opposition Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaratnam <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> one minor charge in a case involving cheques for the Workers' Party of Singapore which had allegedly been fraudulently handled. The acquittal was overturned on appeal to the High Court, and a retrial ordered. However, before the retrial took place, Khoo was transferred from his position on the Bench to the Attorney-General's Chambers to take up the post of deputy public prosecutor. This was considered to be a demotion. In 1986, Jeyaratnam claimed in Parliament that the transfer had been made because Khoo had ruled in his favour in the 1984 case. However, a commission of inquiry formed to look into the circumstances surrounding the transfer found no evidence of this. For making the allegation, Jeyaratnam was referred to Parliament's Committee of Privileges for abusing parliamentary privilege. While the Committee was considering the matter, Jeyaretnam wrote five newsletters about the Committee's proceedings and sent them to residents of his constituency. On 9 October 1986, the Leader of the House made a written complaint regarding the newsletters' contents to the Speaker of Parliament, which the Committee also considered. On 27 January 1987 Parliament accepted the Committee's reports on the complaints and found Jeyaretnam guilty of abusing the privileges of Parliament by alleging executive interference in the judiciary, and of contempt of the Committee and Parliament by publishing the newsletters. Fines totalling S$26,000 were imposed.|$|E
5|$|Many royal and baronial castles {{were left}} to decline, {{so that by the}} 15th century only a few were {{maintained}} for defensive purposes. A small number of castles in England and Scotland were developed into Renaissance Era palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid their elaborate architecture. Such structures were, however, beyond the means <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> royalty and the richest of the late-medieval barons. Although gunpowder weapons were used to defend castles from the late 14th century onwards it became clear during the 16th century that, provided artillery could be transported and brought to bear on a besieged castle, gunpowder weapons could also play an important attack role. The defences of coastal castles around the British Isles were improved to deal with this threat, but investment in their upkeep once again declined {{at the end of the}} 16th century. Nevertheless, in the widespread civil and religious conflicts across the British Isles during the 1640s and 1650s, castles played a key role in England. Modern defences were quickly built alongside existing medieval fortifications and, in many cases, castles successfully withstood more than one siege. In Ireland the introduction of heavy siege artillery by Oliver Cromwell in 1649 brought a rapid end to the utility of castles in the war, while in Scotland the popular tower houses proved unsuitable for defending against civil war artillery– although major castles such as Edinburgh put up strong resistance. At the end of the war many castles were slighted to prevent future use.|$|E
5|$|Operation Trio {{coincided with}} {{and contributed to}} the {{polarisation}} of the almost exclusively Serb rebels in eastern Bosnia into two groups: the Serb-chauvinist Chetniks and the multi-ethnic and communist-led Partisans. Encouraged by Chetnik propaganda against Croats and Bosnian Muslims and repelled by the sectarian left-wing policies and actions of the communists, many Serb peasant fighters were swayed to the Chetnik cause. Violent coups occurred against the communist leadership <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> one of the Partisan detachments in eastern Bosnia, and these detachments effectively defected to the Chetniks. Most of the surviving communist fighters from these detachments rejoined the Partisan forces, and many withdrew with Tito to western Bosnia during the Partisan Long March. Within a few weeks of the end of Operation Trio only 600 Partisan fighters were left in eastern Bosnia, comprising the Group of Shock Battalions and the Birač Partisan Detachment. All these forces sought refuge in the Birač region. The Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia, at best a confederacy of local warlords, was strengthened by mass defections from the Partisans. For a time they ruled large parts of the region, after making accommodations with the Ustaše regime in May and June 1942.|$|E
