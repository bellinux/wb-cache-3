25|$|By May 1915 Douglas {{had moved}} back to her parents in Birkenhead.

Emma Langdon was the wife <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been a newspaper reporter in Victor, Colorado, during the Cripple Creek miner's strike of 1903-04. Her husband had been wrongfully imprisoned by the state militia in a notorious bullpen. Outraged, Langdon wrote and published {{a book about the}} 1903-04 strike. Calderwood contributed a chapter to the book, providing background about the 1894 strike. It is the most comprehensive first-person discussion of the strike to be published.|$|E
25|$|Thus, it is {{apparent}} that ergi of a níðingr was strongly connoted not only with sorcery, unmanliness, weakness, and effeminacy but also especially with lecherousness or sexual perversion in the view of Old Scandinavian people during the Early and High Middle Ages. Ergi of females was considered as excessive lecherousness bordering raging madness, ergi of males as perversity, effeminacy and the passive role within same-sex intercourse between men, while an active role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been included into same-sex intercourse, was not to be tanged by ergi, ragr, argr or níð.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} of these books were written before Nithard's {{appointment}} as lay-abbey of St-Riquier {{in the winter of}} 842, the fourth and final in spring of 843 after taking up office there. Although rough in style, partisan in character and sometimes incorrect in detail, the books are the work <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> an intimate knowledge of the events which he relates, who possessed a clear and virile mind, and who above all was not a recluse but a man of action. They are dedicated to Charles the Bald, at whose request they were written.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{popular with}} the crowds, Findlater was seen {{by many of the}} {{military}} establishment as deliberately profiting from the Victoria Cross. The War Office approached the management of the Alhambra to try and stop his performance, without success, sparking counter-criticism as to whether the Army had any standing to control the private engagements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> already left the Army. Within the year, however, his fame began to turn sour; he was implicated in a contentious breach of promise lawsuit in late 1898, which led to heckling at his Scottish performances, and to avoid further scandal left the country to tour the United States and Canada.|$|E
25|$|After {{the landing}} the Frisian {{strategy}} was to prevent the Hollanders from leaving the coast and coming inland. According to {{the tale of the}} Hainautian chronicler Froissart the Frisian leader he names Yves Joncre (a giant <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> fought in Prussia, Hungary, Turkey, on Rhodes and on Cyprus), who was known to the Hollanders and their allies as le Grand Frison, and who is usually identified as Juw Juwinga, a headling from the city of Bolsward, was one of only a few who argued against this strategy, saying that the Frisians should go home and let the Hollanders try to fight the marshy terrain. He was, however, outvoted.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, he {{enrolled}} in the Escuela de Instrucción Primaria Superior Municipal de Varones that was headed by Rafael María de Mendive. Mendive was influential {{in the development of}} Martí's political philosophies. Also instrumental in his development of a social and political conscience was his best friend Fermín Valdés Domínguez, the son of a wealthy slave-owning family. In April the same year, after hearing the news of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Martí and other young students expressed their pain—through group mourning—for the death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> decreed the abolition of slavery in the United States. In 1866, Martí entered the Instituto de Segunda Ensañanza where Mendive financed his studies.|$|E

25|$|A coroner's inquest {{into the}} death, {{conducted}} by coroner Thomas Erskine Cleland, commenced {{a few days}} after the body was found but was adjourned until 17 June 1949. The investigating pathologist John Burton Cleland re-examined the body and made a number of discoveries. Cleland noted that the man's shoes were remarkably clean and appeared to have been recently polished, rather than being in the state expected of the shoes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> apparently been wandering around Glenelg all day. He added that this evidence fitted in with the theory that the body might have been brought to Somerton beach after the man's death, accounting for the lack of evidence of vomiting and convulsions, which are the two main effects of poison.|$|E
25|$|Stevenson's Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects (1997), {{examined}} {{two hundred}} cases of birth defects or birthmarks on children claiming past-life memories. These included children with malformed or missing fingers {{who said they}} recalled {{the lives of people}} who had lost fingers; a boy with birthmarks resembling entrance and exit wounds who said he recalled the life of someone who had been shot; and a child with a scar around her skull three centimetres wide who said she recalled the life <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had skull surgery. In many of the cases, in Stevenson's view, the witness testimony or autopsy reports appeared to support the existence of the injuries on the deceased's body.|$|E
25|$|In early January 1949, {{two people}} {{identified}} {{the body as}} that of 63-year-old former wood cutter Robert Walsh. A third person, James Mack, also viewed the body, initially could not identify it, but an hour later he contacted police to claim it was Walsh. Mack stated that the reason he did not confirm this at the viewing was {{a difference in the}} colour of the hair. Walsh had left Adelaide several months earlier to buy sheep in Queensland but had failed to return at Christmas as planned. Police were skeptical, believing Walsh to be too old to be the dead man. However, the police did state that the body was consistent with that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been a wood cutter, although the state of the man's hands indicated he had not cut wood for at least 18 months. Any thoughts that a positive identification had been made were quashed, however, when Elizabeth Thompson, {{one of the people who}} had earlier positively identified the body as Walsh, retracted her statement after a second viewing of the body, where the absence of a particular scar on the body, as well as the size of the dead man's legs, led her to realise the body was not Walsh.|$|E

500|$|He {{moved to}} the Los Angeles area and {{associated}} with an apocalyptic cult known as the [...] "Worldwide Church of God" [...] for a time. On May 26, 1981, while walking in Pasadena, Fischer was arrested by a police patrolman, allegedly because he matched the description <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> just committed a bank robbery in the area. Fischer, who alleged that he was slightly injured during the arrest, {{said that he was}} held for two days, subjected to assault and various types of mistreatment, and released on $1,000 bail. Fischer published a 14-page pamphlet detailing his alleged experiences and saying that his arrest had been [...] "a frame up and set up".|$|E

Then all was silent." [...] Lowe and his crew found four men still alive, one of whom died shortly afterwards. Otherwise, all they could see were [...] "hundreds of bodies and lifebelts"; the dead [...] "seemed as if they had perished with the cold as their limbs were all cramped up." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1979, {{following}} his second {{marriage and the}} birth of his son Dhani, he released George Harrison. The album and the single [...] "Blow Away" [...] both made the Billboard top 20. The album marked the beginning of Harrison's gradual retreat from the music business, and the fruition of ideas introduced on All Things Must Pass. In 1978 {{the death of his father}} in May {{and the birth of}} his son in August had influenced his decision to devote more time to his family than to his career. Leng described the album as [...] "melodic and lush... peaceful... the work <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss".|$|E
500|$|An epikleros ( [...] ; plural epikleroi) was an heiress {{in ancient}} Athens and other ancient Greek city states, {{specifically}} a daughter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> no male heirs. In Sparta, {{they were called}} patrouchoi (...) , {{as they were in}} Gortyn. Athenian women were not allowed to hold property in their own name; in order to keep her father's property in the family, an epikleros was required to marry her father's nearest male relative. Even if a woman was already married, evidence suggests that she was required to divorce her spouse to marry that relative. Spartan women were allowed to hold property in their own right, and so Spartan heiresses were subject to less restrictive rules. Evidence from other city-states is more fragmentary, mainly coming from the city-states of Gortyn and Rhegium.|$|E
500|$|By November 1921, Siboney {{was placed}} in New York–Cuba–Mexico service, where {{business}} thrived, {{in part because of}} Prohibition in the United States. Ward Line cruises to Havana were one of the quickest and least expensive ways to what one author called [...] "alcohol-enriched vacations". A typical route from this time period would sail from New York and call at Nassau, Havana, Progreso, Veracruz, and Tampico, skipping Nassau on the return. Prohibition also had a more direct effect on Siboney and her crew. On 27June 1922, Siboney — freshly returned from Havana with a load of pineapples — was raided by United States Customs Service inspectors who seized 300bottles of smuggled liquor on board. In December 1923, four boiler room workers were arrested when police became suspicious <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> apparently just delivered a supply of alcohol to the docked ship.|$|E
