Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation, and often answered a junior man's question before it had even been stated.

5|$|When the {{convention}} concluded, Ross returned home {{and spent the}} next four years focusing on his farm. In 1880, he became an accidental candidate for Texas State Senator from the 22nd District. The nominating convention deadlocked between two candidates, with neither receiving a two-thirds majority. As a compromise, one of the delegates suggested the group nominate Ross. Although no <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> Ross whether he wanted to run for office, the delegates elected him as their candidate. He agreed to the nomination to spare the trouble and expense of another convention.|$|E
5|$|After Lukashenko {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed Constitution. The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand {{the power of his}} office, marking a turning point in post-Soviet era politics in Belarus. A May 1995 national referendum was {{the first step in the}} amendment process. Out of the four questions, <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> if the president could disband parliament if the members violate national law. The vote, which several Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the dismissal of the legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the national flag and national emblem, didn't affect the Constitution as a whole, but their status has been decided by the Constitution. Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter the Constitution. The last referendum on the Constitution occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.|$|E

The Director of Operations Division, Rear Admiral Thomas Jackson, had asked the intelligence division, Room 40, for the current location of German call sign DK, used by Admiral Scheer.

Game Informers Jay Fitzloff argued that the game was unsuitable for a male gamer, expressing concern that [...] "owning this title will brand them a pansy {{for the rest of their}} elementary school careers". Although Fitzloff called the game a [...] "worthwhile pastime", he argued that it was not worth the possibility of being bullied at school.|$|E
500|$|After the event, it was {{claimed by}} Nixon and Kissinger that Sihanouk {{had given his}} tacit {{approval}} for the raids, but this is dubious. Sihanouk told U.S. diplomat Chester Bowles on January 10, 1968, {{that he would not}} oppose American [...] "hot pursuit" [...] of retreating North Vietnamese troops [...] "in remote areas ," [...] provided that Cambodians were unharmed. Kenton Clymer notes that this statement [...] "cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids... In any event, no <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> him.... Sihanouk was never asked to approve the B-52 bombings, and he never gave his approval." [...] During the course of the Menu bombings, Sihanouk's government formally protested [...] "American violation of Cambodian territory and airspace" [...] at the United Nations on over 100 occasions, although it [...] "specifically protested the use of B-52s" [...] only once, following an attack on Bu Chric in November 1969.|$|E
500|$|The {{music critic}} Harold Schonberg surmises that had Bizet lived, {{he might have}} revolutionised French opera; as it is, verismo was taken up mainly by Italians, notably Puccini who, {{according}} to Dean, developed the idea [...] "till it became threadbare". Bizet founded no specific school, though Dean names Chabrier and Ravel as composers influenced by him. Dean also suggests that a fascination with Bizet's tragic heroes—Frédéri in L'Arlésienne, José in Carmen—is reflected in Tchaikovsky's late symphonies, particularly the B minor [...] "Pathetique". Macdonald writes that Bizet's legacy {{is limited by the}} shortness of his life and by the false starts and lack of focus that persisted until his final five years. [...] "The spectacle of great works unwritten either because Bizet had other distractions, or because no <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> him to write them, or because of his premature death, is infinitely dispiriting, yet the brilliance and the individuality of his best music is unmistakable. It has greatly enriched a period of French music already rich in composers of talent and distinction." ...|$|E

500|$|On 2 June 1899, Luna {{received}} two telegrams – <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> {{for help in}} launching a counterattack in San Fernando, Pampanga; and the other [...] said to be signed by Aguinaldo himself, ordered {{him to go to}} the new capital at Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija to form a new cabinet. In his jubilation, Luna wrote Arcadio Maxilom, military commander of Cebu, to stand firm in the war. Luna set off from Bayambang, Pangasinan; first by train, then on horseback, and eventually in three carriages to Nueva Ecija with 25 of his men. During the journey, two of the carriages broke down, so he proceeded with just one carriage with Colonel Francisco Román and Captain Eduardo Rusca, having earlier shed his cavalry escort. On 4 June, Luna sent a telegram to Aguinaldo confirming his arrival. Upon arriving at Cabanatuan on 5 June, Luna alone, proceeded to the headquarters to communicate with the President. As he went up the stairs, he ran into an officer whom he had previously disarmed for insubordination, and an old enemy whom he had once threatened with arrest for favoring American autonomy. The former was Captain Pedro Janolino, commander of the Kawit Battalion. The latter was Felipe Buencamino, Minister of Foreign Affairs {{and a member of the}} Cabinet. He was told that Aguinaldo had left for San Isidro in Tarlac. Enraged, Luna asked why he had not been told the meeting was cancelled.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Necrid varied. University of Delaware professor Rachel Hutchinson cited {{him as an}} example of the cultural stereotype of human versus monster, a [...] "mutated or damned [...] deviant from the human norm" [...] that the game's human characters are expected to vanquish. A staff writer for GameNOW magazine called the visual design [...] "silly" [...] and compared the character to an [...] "old-school He-Man character", but added that Necrid's gameplay was decent. Another magazine, GMR, described him {{as an example of}} [...] "bad American comic book design". IGN's Kaiser Hwang called Necrid a [...] "disappointment" [...] and questioned the character's design in comparison to others in the series; he also felt Necrid was [...] "filler" [...] rather than a complete character. GameSpot made similar comments in their review of the game, as did GameSpy. IGN's Xbox article editor described the character's inclusion as an unnecessary marketing ploy and would have preferred new characters made without McFarlane's involvement; the editor also wrote that Necrid did not [...] "vibe" [...] with the rest of the game. 1UP.com's podcast Retronauts criticized the design and wrote that the character's name was used as a synonym for [...] "shitty". They further added that McFarlane had [...] "tainted" [...] the game with Necrid's inclusion, with host Jeremy Parish stating [...] "I could close my eyes and draw a better character". In a retrospective of the series, Joystiq used him {{as an example of the}} series succumbing to [...] "commercial gimmicks", citing his design as reviled and that Necrid was either too strong or too weak a character to play as, depending on who <b>one</b> <b>asked.</b>|$|E
500|$|As {{relations}} with China worsened, Sihanouk pursued rapprochement with the US. He learned that Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, had {{expressed a desire}} to see Angkor Wat. Seeing {{this as an opportunity to}} restore {{relations with}} the US, Sihanouk invited her to visit Cambodia and personally hosted her visit in October 1967. Jacqueline Kennedy's visit paved the way for Sihanouk to meet with Chester Bowles, the US ambassador to India. To Bowles, Sihanouk expressed his willingness to restore bilateral relations with the US, hinted at the presence of Viet Cong troops in Cambodia, and suggested he would turn a blind eye should US forces enter Cambodia to attack Viet Cong troops retreating into Cambodia from South Vietnam—a practice known as [...] "hot pursuit"—provided that Cambodians were unharmed. Kenton Clymer notes that this statement [...] "cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids" [...] the US launched in eastern Cambodia beginning in March 1969 as part of Operation Menu, adding: [...] "In any event, no <b>one</b> <b>asked</b> him.... Sihanouk was never asked to approve the B-52 bombings, and he never gave his approval." [...] The bombing forced the Viet Cong to flee from their jungle sanctuaries and seek refuge in populated towns and villages. As a result, Sihanouk became concerned that Cambodia might get drawn into fighting in the Vietnam War. In June 1969 he extended diplomatic recognition to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRGSV), hoping that he could get the Viet Cong troops under its charge to leave Cambodia should they win the war. At the same time, he also openly admitted the presence of Viet Cong troops in Cambodia for the first time, prompting the US to restore formal diplomatic relations with Cambodia three months later.|$|E

500|$|When Jefferson took office, {{he moved}} {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} to fill his cabinet positions. Although he had asked James Madison to be his Secretary of State, Madison did not arrive in Washington until May 1, 1801, due to illness. In the interim, Jefferson asked Lincoln to act temporarily as Secretary of State, which he did from March 5, 1801, until Madison assumed his duties on May 2. During this time, Lincoln was involved in actions that led to the celebrated Marbury v. Madison case concerning judicial review. In the later days of the John Adams administration, the President issued a large number of commissions, some of which had not been delivered by John Marshall, his Secretary of State, at the time Jefferson assumed office. Jefferson ordered Lincoln (in his capacity as acting Secretary of State), and then Madison (after his assumption of the position) not to deliver these commissions. Some intended recipients of these commissions, William Marbury among them, filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to compel their delivery. In his role as Attorney General, Lincoln was present at the preliminary hearing on the case, representing Madison. When the case was heard (ironically by a court headed by John Marshall, the preparer of the commissions), Lincoln was called to the stand by Marbury's attorney, former Attorney General Charles Lee. Rather than answer Lee's questions, Lincoln invoked both executive privilege and the Fifth Amendment, requesting the opportunity to consider whether or not to answer the questions. The justices granted him time, but {{made it clear that he}} must either answer the questions or clearly justify his objections to specific written questions. When Lincoln returned the next day, he answered all of the posed questions but <b>one.</b> <b>Asked</b> [...] "hat had been done with the commissions", Lincoln refused to answer directly, only stating that he did not know if Madison ever received them. The opposition press criticized Lincoln for this performance, writing that he [...] "was asked a simple question, but could not answer it until they gave it to him in writing, [...] and then he made out to remember that he had forgot all about it".|$|E
