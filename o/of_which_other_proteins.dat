The SLX1-SLX4 complex acts as a Holliday junction resolvase. As such, the complex cleaves the links between two homologous chromosomes that form during homologous recombination.

[...] SLX4 also associates with RAD1, RAD10 and SAW1 in the single-strand annealing pathway of homologous recombination.|$|R
50|$|A fully {{denatured}} protein lacks both tertiary and secondary structure, and exists as a so-called random coil. Under certain conditions some proteins can refold; however, in many cases, denaturation is irreversible. Cells sometimes protect their proteins against the denaturing influence of heat with enzymes known as heat shock proteins (a type <b>of</b> chaperone), <b>which</b> assist <b>other</b> <b>proteins</b> both in folding and in remaining folded. Some proteins never fold in cells at all except {{with the assistance}} <b>of</b> chaperones <b>which</b> either isolate individual proteins so that their folding is not interrupted by interactions with <b>other</b> <b>proteins</b> or help to unfold misfolded proteins, allowing them to refold into the correct native structure. This function is crucial to prevent the risk of precipitation into insoluble amorphous aggregates. The external factors involved in protein denaturation or disruption of the native state include temperature, external fields (electric, magnetic), molecular crowding, and even the limitation <b>of</b> space, <b>which</b> can have a big influence on the folding of proteins. High concentrations of solutes, extremes of pH, mechanical forces, {{and the presence of}} chemical denaturants can contribute to protein denaturation, as well. These individual factors are categorized together as stresses. Chaperones are shown to exist in increasing concentrations during times of cellular stress and help the proper folding of emerging proteins as well as denatured or misfolded ones.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{interactions}} {{are essential for}} coordinating cellular functions. Proteomic studies have already elucidated {{a huge amount of}} protein-protein interactions that require detailed functional analysis. Understanding the structural basis of each individual interaction through their structural determination is necessary, yet an unfeasible task. Therefore, computational tools able to predict protein binding regions and recognition modes are required to rationalize putative molecular functions for proteins. With this aim, we previously created SCOWLP, a structural classification of protein binding regions at protein family level, based on the information obtained from high-resolution 3 D protein-protein and protein-peptide complexes. Description We present here a new version of SCOWLP that has been enhanced by the inclusion of protein-nucleic acid and protein-saccharide interactions. SCOWLP takes interfacial solvent into account for a detailed characterization of protein interactions. In addition, the binding regions obtained per protein family have been enriched by the inclusion of predicted binding regions, which have been inferred from structurally related proteins across all existing folds. These inferences might become very useful to suggest novel recognition regions and compare structurally similar interfaces from different families. Conclusions The updated SCOWLP has new functionalities that allow both, detection and comparison of protein regions recognizing different types <b>of</b> ligands, <b>which</b> include <b>other</b> <b>proteins,</b> peptides, nucleic acids and saccharides, within a solvated environment. Currently, SCOWLP allows the analysis of predicted protein binding regions based on structure-based inferences across fold space. These predictions may have a unique potential in assisting protein docking, in providing insights into protein interaction networks, and in guiding rational engineering of protein ligands. The newly designed SCOWLP web application has an improved user-friendly interface that facilitates its usage, and is available at [URL]. </p...|$|R

In this work we chose GFP as a scaffold and engineered many alternative oligomeric forms, driven by either specific disulfide bond formation or metal ion addition.

Some of the oligomeric GFP variants show geometric polymorphism depending on conditions, while others show considerable geometric rigidity.

In this work a method is developed to allow the deduction of possible new protein interactions by looking at the set of protein interactions that are already known. A framework has been created for experimenting with superimposition of protein binding sites. The central methods employed are Particle Swarm Optimization and Iterative Closest Point. Because the same protein binding site may have variations across protein families, the removal of outliers, i. e. atoms that should be discarded to achieve a good superimposition of the binding site core, has been a central theme of this work...|$|R
50|$|Ku is a dimeric protein {{complex that}} binds to DNA double-strand break ends and is {{required}} for the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair. Ku is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans. The ancestral bacterial Ku is a homodimer (two copies of the same protein bound to each other). Eukaryotic Ku is a heterodimer of two polypeptides, Ku70 (XRCC6) and Ku80 (XRCC5), so named because the molecular weight of the human Ku proteins is around 70 kDa and 80 kDa. The two Ku subunits form a basket-shaped structure that threads onto the DNA end. Once bound, Ku can slide down the DNA strand, allowing more Ku molecules to thread onto the end. In higher eukaryotes, Ku forms a complex with the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to form the full DNA-dependent protein kinase, DNA-PK. Ku is thought to function as a molecular scaffold to <b>which</b> <b>other</b> <b>proteins</b> involved in NHEJ can bind, orienting the double-strand break for ligation.|$|R

40|$|Well-formed {{sentences}} of natural language usually state facts. Intuitively, such facts {{can be seen}} as consisting of two different types of items: firstly, there are some things and secondly there are some associations that are claimed to hold between that things.
