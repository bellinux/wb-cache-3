40|$|Screening aims {{to improve}} health by early {{detection}} of disease or risk factors for disease. It may also influence health behaviour, either by intention or as a side effect. The aim of this review was to summarize evidence {{of the effects of}} screening, either risk factor screening or screening for {{early detection of}} disease, on health behaviour: smoking habits, diet, exercise, alcohol consumption and adherence to guidelines for healthy living. This review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of <b>screening</b> <b>on</b> health behaviour in a screened group and an unscreened group. Systematic searches of Medline, CCTR and Embase between 1970 and May 2008 were conducted. Seven trials were included, five <b>on</b> <b>screening</b> for risk factors (four cardiovascular; one ALDH 2) and two <b>on</b> <b>screening</b> for early detection of disease (colorectal cancer and hearing loss). In trials of screening for risk factors, health behaviour was on average significantly more favourable in screened individuals. The number of trials <b>on</b> <b>screening</b> for early detection of disease was too small to allow for conclusions on effects on health behaviour. The number of trials studying the effect of population-based <b>screening</b> programmes <b>on</b> health behaviour is limited. The trials <b>on</b> <b>screening</b> for risk factors suggest a positive effect on health behaviour, while the number of trials <b>on</b> <b>screening</b> for early detection of disease was too low to draw conclusions on subsequent health behaviour. Future RCTs of screening interventions should systematically include health behaviour effects in their study desig...|$|R
