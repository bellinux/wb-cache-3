50|$|Most {{metering}} pumps have a pump {{head and a}} motor. The liquid being pumped goes through the pump head, entering through an inlet line and leaving through an <b>outlet</b> <b>line.</b> The motor is commonly an electric motor which drives the pump head.|$|E
50|$|The drum {{should have}} a vapor outlet at the top, liquid outlet at the bottom, and feed inlet at about the half-full level. At the vapor outlet, provide a de-entraining mesh pad within the drum such that the vapor must pass through that mesh before it can leave the drum. Depending upon how much liquid flow is expected, the liquid <b>outlet</b> <b>line</b> should {{probably}} have a liquid level control valve.|$|E

30|$|For the bi-reforming reaction, {{water was}} fed to the reactor at a {{controlled}} rate using a HPLC pump [21]. The water flows through a vaporizer where steam is formed, which is later mixed with other gases before {{flowing through the}} catalyst bed. All the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>lines</b> were heat-traced to 200  °C to avoid condensation of steam. Outlet gases were analyzed using an inline quadrupole mass spectrometer.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the flow}} has stopped, the booster is started, {{and as the}} piston withdraws along the cylinder, {{increasing}} the volume between the cylinder head and the piston crown, the pressure in the cylinder will drop, and gas will flow in from the inlet port. On the return cycle, the piston moves toward the cylinder head, decreasing {{the volume of the}} space and compressing the gas until the pressure is sufficient to overcome the pressure in the <b>outlet</b> <b>line</b> and the opening pressure of the outlet valve. At that point, the gas will flow out of the cylinder via the outlet valve and port.|$|E
5000|$|Piston-driven {{metering}} pumps commonly work as follows: There is a piston (sometimes called plunger), typically cylindrical, which {{can go in}} and out of a correspondingly shaped chamber in the pump head. The inlet and outlet lines are joined to the piston chamber. There are two check valves, often ball check valves, attached to the pump head, one at the inlet line and the other at the <b>outlet</b> <b>line.</b> The inlet valve allows flow from the inlet line to the piston chamber, but not in the reverse direction. The outlet valve allows flow from the chamber to the <b>outlet</b> <b>line,</b> but not in reverse. The motor repeatedly moves the piston into and out of the piston chamber, causing the volume of the chamber to repeatedly become smaller and larger. When the piston moves out, a vacuum is created. Low pressure in the chamber causes liquid to enter and fill the chamber through the inlet check valve, but higher pressure at the outlet causes the outlet valve to shut. Then when the piston moves in, it pressurizes the liquid in the chamber. High pressure in the chamber causes the inlet valve to shut and forces the outlet valve to open, forcing liquid out at the outlet. These alternating suction and discharge strokes are repeated over and over to meter the liquid. In back of the chamber, there is packing around the piston or a doughnut-shaped seal with a toroid-shaped sphincter-like spring inside compressing the seal around the piston. This holds the fluid pressure when the piston slides in and out and makes the pump leak-tight. The packing or seals can wear out after prolonged use and can be replaced. The metering rate can be adjusted by varying the strokelength by which the piston moves back and forth or varying the speed of the piston motion.|$|E
50|$|Many valves are {{controlled}} manually with a handle {{attached to the}} stem. If the handle is turned ninety degrees between operating positions, the valve is called a quarter-turn valve. Butterfly, ball valves, and plug valves are often quarter-turn valves. If the handle is circular with the stem as the axis of rotation {{in the center of}} the circle, then the handle is called a handwheel. Valves can also be controlled by actuators attached to the stem. They can be electromechanical actuators such as an electric motor or solenoid, pneumatic actuators which {{are controlled}} by air pressure, or hydraulic actuators which are controlled by the pressure of a liquid such as oil or water. Actuators can be used for the purposes of automatic control such as in washing machine cycles, remote control such as the use of a centralised control room, or because manual control is too difficult such as when the valve is very large. Pneumatic actuators and hydraulic actuators need pressurised air or liquid lines to supply the actuator: an inlet line and an <b>outlet</b> <b>line.</b> Pilot valves are valves which are used to control other valves. Pilot valves in the actuator lines control the supply of air or liquid going to the actuators.|$|E

50|$|Check valves {{are often}} used with some types of pumps. Piston-driven and {{diaphragm}} pumps such as metering pumps and pumps for chromatography commonly use inlet and outlet ball check valves. These valves often look like small cylinders attached to the pump head on the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>lines.</b> Many similar pump-like mechanisms for moving volumes of fluids around use check valves such as ball check valves. The feed pumps or injectors which supply water to steam boilers are fitted with check valves to prevent back-flow.|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} support the field demonstration of improved techniques for salt dissolution in waste tanks at the Savannah River Site. The tests were designed to investigate three density driven techniques for salt dissolution: (1) Drain-Add-Sit-Remove, (2) Modified Density Gradient, and (3) Continuous Salt Mining.

40|$|During {{the process}} of {{withdrawing}} fluids from tanks, surface distortion and subsequent gas ingestion have been observed in situations where no liquid rotation was present. The distortion {{takes the form of}} a depression of the liquid surface over the outlet, which leads to ingestion of gas in the <b>outlet</b> <b>line</b> before all of the liquid has drained from the tank. This phenomenon becomes more important as the fluid flow rate is increased. The flow of fluids from tanks, under conditions that lead to gas ingestion, has been studied with emphasis on a theoretical solution, e. g., Abramson et al. and Saad and Oliver. However, no results applicable to the problem studied here have been obtained, and to the authors' knowledge, no comprehensive experimental study of the ingestion phenomenon has been undertaken prior to this work. This paper describes the results of such an investigation for flat-bottomed, right cylindric tanks with right cylindric outlets located on the tank centerline. The work discussed here deals primarily with the determination of the maximum height of the liquid surface when the surface distortion reaches the outlet.

40|$|As protein binding of uremic toxins is {{not well}} understood, neither in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, nor during a {{hemodialysis}} (HD) session, we studied protein binding in two cross-sectional studies.

Blood samples were taken either during the routine ambulatory visit (CKD patients) or from blood inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>line</b> during dialysis (HD patients). Total (CT) and free concentrations were determined of p-cresylglucuronide (pCG), hippuric acid (HA), indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresylsulfate (pCS), and their percentage protein binding (%PB) was calculated. In CKD patients, %PB/CT resulted in a positive correlation (all p < 0. 001) with renal function for all five uremic toxins. In HD patients, %PB was increased after 120 min of dialysis for HA and at the dialysis end for the stronger (IAA) and the highly-bound (IS and pCS) solutes. During one passage through the dialyzer at 120 min, %PB was increased for HA (borderline), IAA, IS and pCS. These findings explain why protein-bound solutes are difficult to remove by dialysis: {{a combination of the}} fact that (i) only the free fraction can pass the filter and (ii) the equilibrium, as it was pre-dialysis, cannot be restored during the dialysis session, as it is continuously disturbed...|$|E
