60|$|It was in {{the winter}} of 1822-3 that I formed the plan of a little society, to be {{composed}} of young men agreeing in fundamental principles--acknowledging Utility as their standard in ethics and politics, and a certain number of the principal corollaries drawn from it in the philosophy I had accepted--and meeting once a fortnight to read essays and discuss questions conformably to the premises thus agreed on. The fact would hardly be worth mentioning, but for the circumstance, that the name I gave to the society I had planned was the Utilitarian Society. It {{was the first time that}} anyone had taken the title of Utilitarian; and the term made its way into the language, from this humble source. I did not invent the word, but found it in one of Galt's novels, the Annals of the Parish, in which the Scotch clergyman, of whom the book is a supposed autobiography, is represented as warning his parishioners not to leave the Gospel and become utilitarians. With a boy's fondness for a name and a banner I seized on the word, and for some years called myself and others by it as a sectarian appellation; and it came to be occasionally used by some others holding the opinions which it was intended to designate. As those opinions attracted more notice, the term was repeated by strangers and opponents, and got into rather common use just about the time when those who had originally assumed it, laid down that along with other sectarian characteristics. The Society so called consisted at first of no more than three members, one of whom, being Mr. Bentham's amanuensis, obtained for us permission to hold our meetings in his house. The number never, I think, reached ten, and the Society was broken up in 1826. It had thus an existence of about three years and a half. The chief effect of it as regards myself, over and above the benefit of practice in <b>oral</b> <b>discussion,</b> was that of bringing me in contact with several young men at that time less advanced than myself, among whom, as they professed the same opinions, I was for some time a sort of leader, and had considerable influence on their mental progress. Any young man of education who fell in my way, and whose opinions were not incompatible with those of the Society, I endeavoured to press into its service; and some others I probably should never have known, had they not joined it. Those of the members who became my intimate companions--no one of whom was in any sense of the word a disciple, but all of them independent thinkers on their own basis--were William Eyton Tooke, son of the eminent political economist, a young man of singular worth both moral and intellectual, lost to the world by an early death; his friend William Ellis, an original thinker in the field of political economy, now honourably known by his apostolic exertions for the improvement of education; George Graham, afterwards official assignee of the Bankruptcy Court, a thinker of originality and power on almost all abstract subjects; and (from the time when he came first to England to study for the bar in 1824 or 1825) a man who has made considerably more noise in the world than any of these, John Arthur Roebuck.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} participation levels of developmental writing students inoral discussions and electronic discussions using the synchronous conferencing software InterChange. The study used {{a combination of}} quantitative and qualitative methods in a naturalistic/quasi-experimental design under a social constructivist epistemology. The methods included: word counts onto which biological sex and socially-constructed gender (as measured by the Bern Sex-Role Inventory) were overlaid as variables; a modified taxonomy based on Bales' Conversational Analysis measure; a taxonomy which measured the direction of discourse; and "thick description" {{in the form of}} subjective reactions to videotaped <b>oral</b> <b>discussions</b> and transcribed electronic discussions. The multi-modal, descriptive findings indicate that students participate more frequently in electronic discussions; that subsequent oral classes take on participatory characteristics of an InterChange session; and that while the more frequent participation in InterChange discussions does appear to carry over into subsequent <b>oral</b> <b>discussions,</b> socially constructed variables such as gender may, in fact, encourage students to participate less frequently in oral discussons after using InterChange. The findings also show that InterChange discussions are primarily student-centered: most of the responses generated are aimed at other students. In the oral classroom, very little student-to-student interaction occurs. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} while the computer environment may not promote egalitarian discourse, it does tend to produce more democratic discourse. Department of EnglishThesis (Ph.

In the college mathematics classrooms, discussion revolved around mathematical problems. Discussion in English around problems cycled through participant structures in which written mathematical representations mediated interaction. The literate discourse of mathematics relied on symbolic mediation ([Sfard, 2008]), and classroom <b>oral</b> English <b>discussion</b> was mediated by written mathematical representations (students wrote on notebooks or the board and the professor wrote on the board and on handouts). Thus, students are socialized multimodally, including through <b>oral</b> English <b>discussions.</b> Furthermore, the study also shows how values about mathematics education (cooperation, diversity of solutions, mathematics is meaningful) were intoned frequently.|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{contribute}} to the on-going development of the Appraisal framework, particularly in terms of the system of Attitude, in contexts that international students from all language backgrounds are usually involved in. For international students, it is very common that they have casual conversations or formal <b>oral</b> <b>discussions</b> about issues relating to their personal everyday life experience and their academic and professional concerns as these topics are closely related to their security and well-being when living and studying overseas, and also their academic performance and their concerns about their current or future career. In discussing these topics, the capacity to express an evaluative stance effectively is essential. It not only allows international students to precisely express their needs and concerns in a new living and studying environment about things that matter to them everyday and to communicate and respond to the purposes of discussions appropriately but also to build solidarity and inter-subjective rapport, which is very important for their acculturation process and their security in a new country. This paper proposes an extension of a more delicate framework for expressions of Attitude that can be used as a tool for enhancing the precision in attitudinal meaning expressions in semi-casual <b>oral</b> <b>discussions</b> involving three of the topics of particular and frequent interest to international students mentioned above. The article begins with the Methods section providing a brief description of the approach taken in the study. The Results section provides the basis for a proposal for modifications to the Attitude system in all three categories of Affect, Judgement and Appreciation, which is developed in the Discussion section. The paper concludes with the significance of the re-theorisation and modifications of the framework in linguistic research and language teaching.|$|R
