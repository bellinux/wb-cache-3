5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is infested {{by a number}} of {{external}} parasites, which usually cause little harm to adult sparrows. In Europe, the most common mite found on sparrows is Proctophyllodes, the most common ticks are Argas reflexus and Ixodes arboricola, and the most common flea <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> sparrow is Ceratophyllus gallinae. A number of chewing lice occupy different niches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> sparrow's body.

5|$|Albizu Campos {{had been}} {{corresponding}} with 34-year-old Lebrón from prison and chose {{a group of}} nationalists who included Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irvin Flores and Andres Figueroa Cordero to attack locations in Washington, D.C. Upon receiving the order she communicated it to {{the leadership of the}} Nationalist party in New York and, although two members unexpectedly disagreed, the plan continued. Lebrón decided to lead the group, even though Albizu Campos did not order her to directly take part in the assault. She studied the plan, determining the possible weaknesses, concluding that a single attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives would be more effective. The date for the attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives was to be March 1, 1954. This date was chosen because it coincided with the inauguration of the Conferencia Interamericana (Interamerican Conference) in Caracas. Lebrón intended to call attention to Puerto Rico's independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{was accused}} of being a {{communist}} sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940. The accusation in 1934 stemmed from a letter police found from a local Communist official that alleged that Cagney would bring other Hollywood stars to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, backed up this denial, asserting that the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney's donation to striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the charges in 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr., <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, when {{financial}} constraints forced Churchill {{to again}} consider selling Chartwell, it {{was acquired by}} the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy. After Churchill's death, Lady Churchill surrendered her lease <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and it was {{opened to the public}} by the Trust in 1966. A Grade I listed building, for its historical significance rather than its architectural merit, Chartwell has become among the Trust's most popular properties; some 232,000 people visited the house in 2016, the fiftieth anniversary of its opening.|$|E
40|$|In a {{historical}} view, house prices have {{developed at the}} same rate as inflation. In the end of the 20 th century <b>the</b> prices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market started to differ from the inflation rate, and today the deviation is strong and the real price increase has been very strong. The financial crisis in 2008, which was a result of a subprime mortgage crisis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> American real estate market, has made several agents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market in Sweden question today’s prices. Robert Schiller, an American economist who predicted the mortgage crisis in 2008, claimed during the Nobel Prize ceremony 2013, that Sweden shows signs of a financial bubble – "I think that people here in Sweden have an illusion that increasing prices is a lasting trend, but that is more suggestive of a bubble". Sweden has been in a recession for the last years, which has led to low interest rates and beneficial conditions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> real estate market. Despite the high unemployment and <b>the</b> recession, prices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market in Stockholm County have continued to increase. This bachelor thesis aims to analyze <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market in Stockholm County and investigate if there is a price bubble or not, or if the high prices can be explained by fundamental factors. The Thesis suggests that there is no price bubble <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market in Stockholm County. The increasing prices are based on fundamental factors, such as low interest rate, low supply <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market in combination with an increasing demand. Therefore it is unlikely that there is no existing pricing bubble <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market in Stockholm County...|$|R
