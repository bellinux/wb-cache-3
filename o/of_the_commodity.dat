Despite never having been trained in economic matters, Thơ had a prominent hand in the administration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commodity</b> Import Program, an American initiative akin to the Marshall Plan, whereby aid was funnelled into the economy through importing licenses rather than money, {{in order to avoid}} inflation. However, Thơ's administration of the program led to {{the vast majority of the}} imports being consumer goods for the upper classes, rather than capital goods to develop South Vietnam's economic capacity. Under Thơ's watch, the foreign trade deficit hovered between 150 and 200%, and the gap between the urban elite and the peasant majority grew. American advisers thought Thơ and the Ngô brothers continually went against their counsel because they were either incompetent or simply distrustful and thus did the opposite of what was recommended.|$|E

Using a Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR), we were able to analyze the causation relationships between the variables and compare the effect on the different industries and sectors. In order to analyze the effects from the financial crisis we made use of two sample periods, one going from 1994 through June 2008 : (1) and the other from 1994 up until today: (2). What we found was that the correlations between <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> crude oil and <b>the</b> <b>commodities</b> were higher in (2) for all but natural gas and iron ore, which decreased severely through the financial crisis. We further found that leading up to the financial crisis most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural <b>commodities,</b> coal and gold all shared a delayed but significant causation relationship with the crude oil price. In (2) however, only soybeans and rubber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agricultural <b>commodities</b> proved to have a significant causation relationship with the crude oil price whereas both the metal sector and the energy sector as well as salmon proved to have a significant causation relationship with the crude oil price. In addition, we have analyzed how economic growth affects <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commodities</b> to be able to compare this to how the crude oil price affects <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commodities...</b>|$|R

25|$|Mining {{operations}} can {{be grouped}} into five major categories {{in terms of}} their respective resources. These are oil and gas extraction, coal mining, metal ore mining, nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying, and mining support activities. Of all of these categories, oil and gas extraction remains {{one of the largest in}} terms of its global economic importance. Prospecting potential mining sites, a vital area of concern for the mining industry, is now done using sophisticated new technologies such as seismic prospecting and remote-sensing satellites. Mining is heavily affected by the prices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> minerals, which are often volatile. The 2000s commodities boom ("commodities supercycle") increased the prices of commodities, driving aggressive mining. In addition, the price of gold increased dramatically in the 2000s, which increased gold mining; for example, one study found that conversion of forest in the Amazon increased six-fold from the period 2003–2006 (292 ha/yr) to the period 2006–2009 (1,915 ha/yr), largely due to artisanal mining.|$|E
25|$|One issue {{concerns}} {{the relationship between}} the real economy (producing goods and services) and the financial economy (trading assets). Some argue, like Marx did, that the tendency of the rate of profit to fall applies only to the sphere of the capitalist industrial production of commodities, not to the whole capitalist economy. Thus, it is argued, it is eminently possible that while industrial profitability stagnates, average profitability in activities external to the sphere of industrial production increases. In fact, Michael Hudson claims that in the United States, only about a quarter of workers' gross wages is spent on the purchase of actual goods and services. All the rest is spent on the payment of rents and mortgages, retirement schemes and insurance, loans and interest, and various taxes Costas Lapavitsas adds to this insight that not just household liabilities, but also household assets have to be looked at: the rich 20% of the world's workers have substantial deposits and savings invested with banks and retirement funds, so that, {{on both sides of the}} ledger, they become fully dependent on finance capital. Since labor incomes rose strongly in rich countries along with population growth in the second half of the 20th century, very large savings became available in retirement funds, representing an additional source of capital invested for profit worldwide and increasing the economic power of the finance industry. In 2008, the world's total tradeable financial assets (stocks, debt securities and bank deposits) were estimated at $178 trillion, more than three times the value of what the whole world produces in a year. In June 2017, the world's total public and private debt was estimated at US$217 trillion, again more than three times the value of what the whole world produces in a year. If one assumes a grand-average net profit rate of 5% on this global debt, the profit made from global debt is roughly equal to the annual national income of China. This has created a world in industrialized countries that is very different from the orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commodity,</b> where workers simply exchange their commodity labor power for a wage to buy a bundle of consumable commodities with.|$|E
