25|$|It {{should be}} noted that it's not clear that the first {{objection}} really provides a challenge to Girard's theory, as even in repressive societies men are still desired (albeit by women). However, such a response leaves unexplained why homosexuals would imitate the desires of heterosexual members of the opposite sex. One might also argue that the last objection ignores the influence of an original sin from which all others follow, which Girard clearly affirms. However, original sin, on Girard's interpretation, explains <b>only</b> <b>our</b> propensity to imitate, not the specific content of our imitated desires. Thus, the doctrine of original sin does not solve the problem of how the original model first acquires the desire that is subsequently imitated by others.|$|E

500|$|While he {{remained}} genial in public, Rimsky-Korsakov personally found {{the situation with}} Tchaikovsky more conflicting. He was uncomfortable that Tchaikovsky was becoming more popular among Rimsky-Korsakov's followers, and had developed a jealous resentment of Tchaikovsky's greater fame. He confessed his fears to his friend, the Moscow critic Semyon Kruglikov, writing that if Tchaikovsky followed through with a contemplated move to Saint Petersburg, a group of followers [...] "will immediately form around him, which Lyadov and Glazunov will certainly join, and after them many others... ur youth will drown (and not <b>only</b> <b>our</b> youth—look at Lyadov) {{in a sea of}} eclecticism that will rob them of their individuality." [...] About this eclecticism, and Tchaikovsky's part in it, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote in his memoirs, seemingly matter-of-factly, [...] "By this time quite an accretion of new elements and young blood had accumulated in Belyayev's circle. New times, new birds, new songs."

500|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts late in February 1604 Thomas's cousin, Robert Catesby, {{invited him to}} his house in Lambeth, but Thomas was indisposed and could not attend. [...] Catesby sent a second letter that Thomas did respond to, and when he arrived he found his cousin with John Wright, a devout Catholic and a renowned swordsman. [...] Catesby planned to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament, killing the king. Thomas did not immediately recoil from the idea. [...] As a former soldier he was a practical man, and he agreed with Catesby that should the plot succeed, it would [...] "breed a confusion fit to beget new alterations". He also offered a warning {{of the price of}} failure: [...] "the scandal would be so great which the Catholic religion might hereby sustain, as not <b>only</b> <b>our</b> enemies, but our friends also would with good reason condemn us." [...] He nevertheless agreed to join the conspiracy, and as Catesby had not entirely given up hope of foreign support—"because we will leave no peaceable and quiet way untried"—Thomas returned to the continent.|$|E
