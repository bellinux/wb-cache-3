5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|Karthik then {{played in}} the First Test at Chittagong after Dhoni was forced to {{withdraw}} due to injury. He made a duck in the first innings as India stumbled to 243 on the first day. He then made 27, falling in pursuit <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> runs for a declaration after India recovered in the second innings. India {{went on to win}} the match, and Karthik watched the next match from the sidelines after Dhoni recovered and steered India to a clean sweep.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructions of ankylosaur forelimb {{musculature}} made by Coombs in 1978 {{suggest that}} the forelimbs bore {{the majority of the}} animal's weight, and were adapted for high force delivery on the front feet, possibly for food gathering. In addition, Coombs suggested that ankylosaurs may have been capable diggers, though the hoof-like structure of the manus would have limited fossorial activity. Ankylosaurs were likely to have been slow-moving and sluggish animals, though they may have been capable <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> movements when necessary.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese had {{excellent}} {{coordination between}} light bombers, helicopters and reinforced ground patrols. They utilised American tactics <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> airborne (helibourne) assaults supported by heavy aerial bombardments of FRELIMO camps by the Portuguese Air Force (Força Aérea Portuguesa or FAP) to surround {{and eliminate the}} guerrillas. These bombardments were accompanied {{by the use of}} heavy artillery. The Portuguese also used cavalry units to cover the flanks of patrols and where the terrain was too difficult to motor transport, and units of captured or deserted guerrillas to penetrate their former bases.|$|E
5|$|When a party {{calling itself}} Conservative {{can think of}} {{nothing better than to}} outbid the Government's {{election}} promises; when it demands economy in one breath and increased spending in the next; when it proposes an immediate tax cut regardless of inflationary results... when in short, the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty-one years... then our political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for something more than the improbable chance <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> victory.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resumption}} of play, Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 without adding to his lunch score, ending an 87-run partnership with Miller, and bringing Lindwall to the crease at 416/5. Miller and Lindwall attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller's innings was noted for its driving, and he was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from Laker in pursuit <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> runs. He was followed by Lindwall, who ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary, missed, and was stumped for 25, prompting Bradman to declare with Australia at 460/7 with a lead of 595 runs. The tourists had added 51 runs {{for the loss of}} three wickets in approximately an hour's batting after lunch. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each. The Australians had punished the spinners the most, taking more than 3.50 runs per over from each of Wright, Laker and Compton. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In the {{classical}} problem <b>of</b> <b>quickest</b> change detection, a decision maker observes {{a sequence of}} random variables. At some point in time, {{the distribution of the}} random variables changes abruptly. The objective is to detect this change in distribution with minimum possible delay, subject to a constraint on the false alarm rate. In many applications <b>of</b> <b>quickest</b> change detection, e. g., where the changes are infrequent, it is of interest to control the cost of observations or the cost of data acquired before the change point. To this end, in this survey paper, data-efficient versions <b>of</b> {{the classical}} <b>quickest</b> change detection problems are studied, and a summary of existing results on these problems is provided. Some extensions to distributed sensor networks are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized the use <b>of</b> <b>quick,</b> low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of the jaw {{structure}} of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 2004, 2009) {{suggests that the}} animal was capable <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites {{are more important than}} strong bites when capturing small prey, as shown by studies of modern-day crocodiles. These researchers also noted a high degree of flexibility (kinesis) within the skull and especially the lower jaw, somewhat similar to modern snakes. Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed Carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole. In addition, the front part of the lower jaw was hinged, and thus able to move up and down. When pressed downwards, the teeth would have projected forward, allowing Carnotaurus to spike small prey items; when the teeth were curved upwards, the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping. Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items. Carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey, but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had done}} with the prior two Adventures, Wallez {{organised}} a publicity stunt to mark the culmination of Tintin in America, in which an actor portraying Tintin arrived in Brussels. It proved the most popular yet. In 1932, the series was collected and published in a single volume by Les Éditions de Petit Vingtième, coinciding with their publication of the first collected volume <b>of</b> <b>Quick</b> and Flupke. A second edition was produced in France by Éditions Ogéo-Cœurs-Vaillants in 1934, while that same year Casterman published an edition, the first of The Adventures of Tintin that they released. In 1936, Casterman asked Hergé to add several new colour plates to a reprint of Tintin in America, which he agreed to. They also asked him to replace the cover with one depicting a car chase, but he refused.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} ten years the city has {{experienced}} an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> expansion without careful municipal planning. Today, Amman is known as a modern, liberal and westernized Arab city, with major mega projects such as the Abdali Urban Regeneration Project and the Jordan Gate Towers. The city contains several high-end hotel franchises including the Four Seasons Hotel Amman, Sheraton Hotel Amman, Fairmont Amman, St. Regis Hotel Amman, Le Royal Hotel and others.|$|E
5|$|Fame was {{the last}} musical film to be {{produced}} by MGM, before the studio merged with United Artists in 1981. The film has been credited with revitalizing the teen musical subgenre by adding dramatic elements into its story, echoing 1950s melodramas. Its presentation of musical numbers {{in the style of}} a music video—through the use <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> cuts with multiple angles and crowded, kinetic frames—was a major influence on other 1980s films in the dance film genre, such as Flashdance (1983), Footloose (1984) and Dirty Dancing (1987). It also inspired the creation of many similar performing arts schools around the world—notably the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA)— and popularized the use of leg warmers.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, São Paulo {{rose from}} being a mere great in Brazil to become an {{international}} powerhouse. Manager Telê Santana turned to the Paulistas youth and instilled his style <b>of</b> <b>quick,</b> cheerful, and decisive football. Led by stars such as Zetti, Müller, Raí, Cafu, Palhinha, São Paulo beat Newell's Old Boys of Argentina to begin a dynasty. In 1993 São Paulo successfully defended the title by thumping Universidad Católica of Chile in the finals. The Brazilian side became the first club since Boca Juniors in 1978 to win 2 consecutive Copa Libertadores. Like Boca Juniors, however, they would reach another final in 1994 only to lose the title to Vélez Sársfield of Argentina in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E

5|$|Operationally, RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. Strategic Air Command cooperated in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) {{to ensure}} {{coverage}} of all major Soviet targets from 1958, 108 aircraft of the RAF's V-Bombers were assigned targets under SIOP {{by the end}} of 1959. From 1962 onwards, two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle <b>of</b> <b>Quick</b> Reaction Alert (QRA). Vulcans on QRA standby were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving an alert, as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain. The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential nuclear conflict was during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3, an increased state of preparedness from normal operations; however, it stood down in early November.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} days, the cyclone {{showed signs of}} restrengthening and executed an elongated cyclonic loop to the southeast of Papua New Guinea. Rewa subsequently entered a phase <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> intensification while proceeding southeastward, peaking in intensity as a Category5 severe tropical cyclone. It recurved toward the southwest while gradually weakening for several days. Although forecasters had predicted Rewa to make landfall near Mackay, Queensland, the cyclone began interacting with an upper-level trough on 18January, causing it to divert to the southeast and move along the Queensland coast. Rewa transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on 20January, with its remnants bringing heavy rain to New Zealand three days later.|$|E
5|$|Short story {{fiction and}} tales were also popular during the Tang, {{one of the}} more famous ones being Yingying's Biography by Yuan Zhen (779–831), which was widely {{circulated}} in his own time and by the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) became the basis for plays in Chinese opera. Timothy C. Wong places this story within the wider context of Tang love tales, which often share the plot designs <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> passion, inescapable societal pressure leading to the abandonment of romance, followed by a period of melancholy. Wong states that this scheme lacks the undying vows and total self-commitment to love found in Western romances such as Romeo and Juliet, but that underlying traditional Chinese values of inseparableness of self from one's environment (including human society) served to create the necessary fictional device of romantic tension.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to previous installments, focusing on combo-based combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and other weapons acquired by the new World Weapons mechanic. It continues the use <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> time events and adds a new, promptless, free-form system. Four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability {{can be used as}} alternative combat options, and the game features puzzles and platforming elements. Ascension is the only installment in the series to include online multiplayer features for both competitive and cooperative play. It also features a redesigned combat system, new gameplay mechanics, and downloadable content. From October 2012 to March 2013, a social experience was available online {{in the form of a}} graphic novel titled Rise of the Warrior, a prequel story that tied into the game's single-player and multiplayer modes.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the office learn that Dunder Mifflin is in {{financial}} trouble.

In a moment <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> thinking, Michael pulls out a murder mystery party game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets and forces the rest of the staff to play along. The staff slowly warms up to the game. It is set in Savannah, Georgia, and everyone has to adopt a Southern accent. Thanks to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), and Phyllis Lapin-Vance (Phyllis Smith), the game becomes a hit. Everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder. Jim, however, believes that the entire exercise is pointless.|$|E
