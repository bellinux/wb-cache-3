25|$|Very tall {{buildings}} ("skyscrapers"), when built using modern lightweight materials, might sway uncomfortably (but not dangerously) in certain wind conditions. A {{solution to this}} problem is to include at some upper story a large mass, constrained, but free to move within a limited range, and moving <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> bearing system such as an air cushion or hydraulic film. Hydraulic pistons, powered by electric pumps and accumulators, are actively driven to counter the wind forces and natural resonances. These may also, if properly designed, be effective in controlling excessive motion – with or without applied power – in an earthquake. In general, though, modern steel frame high rise buildings are not as subject to dangerous motion as are medium rise (eight to ten story) buildings, as the resonant period of a tall and massive building is longer than the approximately one second shocks applied by an earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Soap opera storylines run concurrently, {{intersect}} {{and lead}} into further developments. An individual episode of {{a soap opera}} will generally switch between several different concurrent narrative threads that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independent to each other. Each episode may feature some of the show's current storylines, but not always all of them. Especially in daytime serials {{and those that are}} broadcast each weekday, there is some rotation of both storyline and actors so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week's worth of episodes. Soap operas rarely bring all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time. When one storyline ends, there are several other story threads at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> cliffhanger, and the season finale (if a soap incorporates a break between seasons) ends in the same way, only to be resolved when the show returns for {{the start of a new}} yearly broadcast.|$|E
25|$|Kant opens section III by {{defining}} the will {{as the cause}} of our actions. According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions {{in a way that is}} distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> law would be arbitrary and not the sort of thing that we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} exact time-dependent solutions of the supergravity equations {{of motion}} in which two initially non-singular branes, one with positive {{and the other with}} negative tension, move together and annihilate each other in an all-enveloping spacetime singularity. Among our solutions are the Hoˇrava-Witten solution of heterotic M-theory and a Randall-Sundrum I type solution, both of which are supersymmetric, i. e. BPS, in the timeindependent case. In the absence of branes our solutions are of Kasner type, and the source of instability may ascribed to a failure to stabilise some of the modulus fields of the compactification. It also raises questions about the viability <b>of</b> models based <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> negative tension brane. 1 One of the most popular current models relating M-theory to phenomenology is that of Hoˇrava and Witten [1], in which an eleven-dimensional spacetime {{is the product of a}} compact Calabi-Yau manifold with a 5 -dimensional spacetime consisting of two parallel 3 -branes o...|$|R

500|$|The Matrix {{commented that}} after they {{presented}} songs to Spears, she tailored them to suit herself, especially the lyrics. Christy said, [...] "... she {{really knows what}} she wants.

[...] Christy also claimed to be impressed with Spears's vocal ability during the recording of [...] "Shadow". Steve Anderson, Lisa Greene and Stephen Lee wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] at Metrophonic Studios in London, England. Before meeting with the other writers, Anderson thought of two concepts for songs specifically for Spears: one he had worked on [...] "for ages", and [...] "Breathe on Me", which he drafted {{on the morning of}} the sessions. Greene and Lee did not like the first concept, and they wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] with Anderson. The song was produced by Mark Taylor, who kept most of the programming done by Anderson. With Taylor, Spears recorded [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "And Then We Kiss", which did not make the album. Before the album was released, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph commented that it was important for Spears to continue moving away from a traditional pop sound, citing [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Boys" [...] from Britney as departures from her previous music. Barry Weiss, then-president of Jive Label Group, added, [...] "She has achieved what she set out to achieve, which was to make a mature album that didn't sound like something she would have done three years while still making a commercial album that has hit singles. [...] It's the kind of record she should be doing right now, and it came down to her to make it." [...] In the Zone was recorded at Battery Studios and The Dojo in New York City, 3:20 Studios, Decoy Studios, Pacifique Studios, Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California, The Chocolate Factory, in Chicago, Illinois, Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, Metrophonic Studios and Olympic Studios in London, England, and Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Throughout the beginning of 2003, Spears started testing tracks by playing them in nightclubs such as Show in New York City.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

30|$|The above {{methods for}} normal and/or {{pathological}} MRI segmentation have <b>some</b> known limitations. <b>On</b> the one hand, {{the majority of}} them has focused <b>on</b> imposing <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> spatial constraints over a local neighborhood, and requires a tunable parameter to weigh the importance of these constraints relative to the data-driven objective function. This parameter has a crucial impact on the performance of those methods, and its selection is generally difficult and needs some trial-and-error experiments. Some few methods (e.g.[13]) have however tried to get around this problem by making the determination of this parameter adaptive and data-dependent. On the other hand, some of these methods (e.g.[33]) need user intervention one way or the other.|$|R
