500|$|From {{the end of}} the Great Depression to the mid-1970s, Keynes {{provided}} the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Europe, America and {{much of the rest of}} the world. While economists and policy makers had become increasingly won over to Keynes's way of thinking in the mid and late 1930s, it was only after the outbreak of World War II that governments started to borrow money for spending on a scale sufficient to eliminate unemployment. According to the economist John Kenneth Galbraith (then a US government <b>official</b> <b>charged</b> with controlling inflation), in the rebound of the economy from wartime spending, [...] "one could not have had a better demonstration of the Keynesian ideas." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 3, 1995, {{after the}} Superior Court had {{dismissed}} the complaint, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC), the <b>official</b> <b>charged</b> by the National Banking Act with regulating national banks, issued a proposed regulation defining [...] "interest" [...] under the Act as including [...] "any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor ... any default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended."

2500|$|Thus {{the special}} {{law of the}} higher ecclesiastical tribunals, the Tribunal of the Roman Rota and the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, reorganized by St. Pius X, {{provides}} for the appointment of notaries for these two tribunals. The reason why the head <b>official</b> <b>charged</b> with drawing up the documents of the Holy Office is called the notary, as were the clerks who in former times drew up {{the records of the}} Inquisition, is, doubtless, that of all the Roman Congregations the Holy Office is the only real judicial tribunal.|$|E

2500|$|Islamic law {{during this}} era had {{developed}} a specific institution to regulate community morals, or hisba, which included the order and security of public markets, the supervision of market transactions, and related matters. The urban marketplace [...] was generally a street of shops selling the same or similar commodities (vegetables, cloth, metalware, lumber, etc.). The city <b>official</b> <b>charged</b> with these responsibilities was called the muhtasib. In effecting public order in the urban markets, the muhtasib enforced fair commercial dealing (merchants truthfully quoting the local price to rural people, honest weights and measures, but not quality of goods nor price per se), keeping roadways open, regulating the safety of building construction, ensuring the metal value of existing coinage and minting new coin. The authority of the muhtasib, with his group of assistants, was somewhere between a qadi (judge) and the police, or on other occasions perhaps between a public prosecutor or trade commissioner and the mayor or a high city official. Often a leading judge or mufti held the position. The muhtasib did not hear contested litigation, but nonetheless could order the pain and humiliation of up to 40 lashes, remand to debtor's prison, order a shop closed, and expel from the city. The authority of the muhtasib did not extend into the countryside.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the emperor}} demoted {{his eldest son}} Liu Rong from heir {{apparent}} to prince of Linjiang in 150BC, the empress dowager took the occasion of an imperial feast to demand that Emperor Jing name Liu Wu as his crown prince in preference to his other sons. He immediately agreed, only to be talked out of it by his advisors. Yuan Ang in particular counseled strongly against breaking the laws of succession, as the act would set a highly destabilizing precedent. Acting in support of their patron, Gongsun Gui and Yang Sheng conspired to have the elderly minister stabbed to death outside {{the walls of the}} imperial suburb of Anling. They were responsible for nine related murders as well. Upon the emperor's discovering their involvement, Liu Wu ordered them to commit suicide and presented their bodies to the emperor, but he never regained his brother's favor and was only seldom received at court. Instead, following custom, Liu Che, the prince of Jiaodong, was promoted to crown prince and his mother Lady Wang to empress. Afraid for her younger son's life, the empress dowager refused to eat until he was cleared of any charges. The <b>official</b> <b>charged</b> with the investigation reported back to Emperor Jing that, in his view, Liu Wu had been involved and that [...] "sparing the Prince of Liang would break the law of Han"; nonetheless, [...] "killing him would deeply distress the empress dowager and upset the emperor even more". He counseled the emperor to drop the issue. In discussion with the empresses, he blamed the murders solely upon the two courtiers and explained they had already been lawfully punished.|$|E
