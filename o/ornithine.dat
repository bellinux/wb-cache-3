5|$|<b>Ornithine</b> and S-adenosylmethionine are {{precursors}} of polyamines.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{inhibition}} is {{an unusual}} type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, α-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid <b>ornithine,</b> and is used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). <b>Ornithine</b> decarboxylase can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of <b>ornithine,</b> as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction {{is followed by the}} elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated imine, a highly electrophilic species. This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, some {{amino acids}} {{derivatives}} {{are used in}} pharmaceutical industry. They include 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) used for experimental treatment of depression, L-DOPA (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine) for Parkinson's treatment, and eflornithine drug that inhibits <b>ornithine</b> decarboxylase and used {{in the treatment of}} sleeping sickness.|$|E
5|$|Nitric oxide's rapid {{reaction}} {{with water}} in animals results in production of its metabolite nitrite. Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins, in general, results in excretion of urea, while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid. The characteristic odour of animal flesh decay {{is caused by}} the creation of long-chain, nitrogen-containing amines, such as putrescine and cadaverine, which are breakdown products of the amino acids <b>ornithine</b> and lysine, respectively, in decaying proteins.|$|E
5|$|Some non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are {{not found in}} proteins. Examples include 2-aminoisobutyric acid and the {{neurotransmitter}} gamma-aminobutyric acid. Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids– for example, <b>ornithine</b> and citrulline occur in the urea cycle, part of amino acid catabolism (see below). A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid beta alanine (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), a component of coenzyme A.|$|E
5|$|Although most proteasomal {{substrates}} must be ubiquitinated {{before being}} degraded, {{there are some}} exceptions to this general rule, especially when the proteasome plays a normal role in the post-translational processing of the protein. The proteasomal activation of NF-κB by processing p105 into p50 via internal proteolysis is one major example. Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to intrinsically unstructured regions, are degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. The most well-known example of a ubiquitin-independent proteasome substrate is the enzyme <b>ornithine</b> decarboxylase. Ubiquitin-independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported, although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Finally, structurally abnormal, misfolded, or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin-independent and 19S-independent degradation under conditions of cellular stress.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ornithine</b> transcarbamylase {{deficiency}} {{also known}} as OTC deficiency {{is the most common}} urea cycle disorder in humans. <b>Ornithine</b> transcarbamylase, the defective enzyme in this disorder is the final enzyme in the proximal portion of the urea cycle, responsible for converting carbamoyl phosphate and <b>ornithine</b> into citrulline. OTC deficiency is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females.|$|E
25|$|OTC {{deficiency}} {{is caused}} by mutations in the OTC gene, which {{is located on the}} X chromosome. OTC codes for the mitochondrial enzyme <b>ornithine</b> transcarbamylase, which is expressed only in liver. The functional enzyme consists of three identical subunits. OTC is the last enzyme in the proximal portion of the urea cycle, which consists of the reactions that take place in the mitochondria. The substrates of the reaction catalyzed by <b>ornithine</b> transcarbamylase are <b>ornithine</b> and carbamyl phosphate, while the product is citrulline.|$|E
25|$|Canavanine and canaline are toxic analogs of {{arginine}} and <b>ornithine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Arginine {{is also a}} {{precursor}} for urea, <b>ornithine,</b> and agmatine; {{is necessary for the}} synthesis of creatine; and can also be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through <b>ornithine</b> and to a lesser degree through agmatine), citrulline, and glutamate. The presence of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a close relative, inhibits the nitric oxide reaction; therefore, ADMA is considered a marker for vascular disease, just as L-arginine is considered a sign of a healthy endothelium.|$|E
25|$|Gyrate atrophy is an {{inherited}} degenerative disorder of the retina and choroid, sometimes accompanying the metabolic condition hyperornithinemia. The presence of gyrate atrophy with iminoglycinuria {{stems from a}} deficiency of proline in chorioretinal tissues, while processes behind hyperornithinemia disrupt the metabolic pathway from <b>ornithine</b> to proline, which alters the catabolism of <b>ornithine,</b> and also results in reduced levels of proline. Thus, gyrate atrophy can be found with either disorder, with proline deficiency as an underlying feature.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} drug Vaniqa, {{with the}} active ingredient eflornithine hydrochloride, inhibits the enzyme <b>ornithine</b> decarboxylase, preventing new hair cells from producing putrescine for stabilizing their DNA.|$|E
25|$|With his {{distinguished}} English pupil Henry Drysdale Dakin, Kossel investigated arginase, the ferment which hydrolyses arginine into urea and <b>ornithine.</b> Later, {{he discovered}} agmatine in herring roe and devised {{a method for}} preparing it.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} conjectured that {{norleucine}} {{was present in}} early versions of the genetic code, but methionine intruded into {{the final version of}} the genetic code due to the fact it is used in the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). This situation is not unique and may have occurred with <b>ornithine</b> and arginine.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{derivative}} of gramicidin, {{produced by the}} gram-positive bacterium Bacillus brevis. Gramicidin S is a cyclodecapeptide, constructed as two identical pentapeptides joined head to tail, formally written as cyclo(-Val-Orn-Leu-D-Phe-Pro-)2. That is to say, it forms a ring structure composed of five different amino acids, each one used twice within the structure. Another interesting point is that it utilizes two amino acids uncommon in peptides: <b>ornithine</b> {{as well as the}} atypical stereoisomer of phenylalanine. It is synthesized by gramicidin S synthetase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ornithine</b> transcarbamylase is only {{expressed}} in the liver, thus performing an enzyme assay to confirm the diagnosis requires a liver biopsy. Before molecular genetic testing was commonly available, {{this was one of}} the only methods for confirmation of a suspected diagnosis. In cases where prenatal diagnosis was requested, a fetal liver biopsy used to be required to confirm if a fetus was affected. Modern molecular techniques have eliminated this need, and gene sequencing is now the preferred method of diagnosis in asymptomatic family members after the diagnosis has been confirmed in a proband.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia {{also plays}} a role in both normal and {{abnormal}} animal physiology. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The liver converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the urea cycle. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in cirrhosis, may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as <b>ornithine</b> transcarbamylase, lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and coma of hepatic encephalopathy, as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and organic acidurias.|$|E
25|$|Diagnostic {{testing for}} OTC deficiency, or any {{individual}} with hyperammonemia involves plasma and urine amino acid analysis, urine organic acid analysis (to identify {{the presence or}} absence of orotic acid, as well as rule out an organic acidemia) and plasma acylcarnitines (will be normal in OTC deficiency, but can identify some other causes of hyperammonemia). An individual with untreated OTC deficiency will show decreased citrulline and arginine concentrations (because the enzyme block is proximal to these intermediates) and increased orotic acid. The increased orotic acid concentrations result from the buildup of carbamoyl phosphate. This biochemical phenotype (increased ammonia, low citrulline and increased orotic acid) is classic for OTC deficiency, but can also be seen in neonatal presentations of <b>ornithine</b> aminotransferase deficiency. Only severely affected males consistently demonstrate this classic biochemical phenotype.|$|E
500|$|Threonine proteases, {{such as the}} {{proteasome}} protease subunit and <b>ornithine</b> acyltransferases use {{the secondary}} hydroxyl of threonine in a manner analogous {{to the use of}} the serine primary hydroxyl. [...] However, due to the steric interference of the extra methyl group of threonine, the base member of the triad is the N-terminal amide which polarises an ordered water which, in turn, deprotonates the catalytic hydroxyl to increase its reactivity. Similarly, there exist equivalent 'serine only' and 'cysteine only' configurations such as penicillin acylase G and penicillin acylase V which are evolutionarily related to the proteasome proteases. Again, these use their N-terminal amide as a base.|$|E
2500|$|... from <b>ornithine</b> {{through the}} {{breakdown}} of proline or glutamine/glutamate ...|$|E
2500|$|Disorders of {{the distal}} urea cycle, such as citrullinemia, argininosuccinic aciduria and argininemia are {{included}} in newborn screening programs in many jurisdictions that using tandem mass spectrometry to identify key amino acids. [...] Proximal urea cycle defects, such as <b>ornithine</b> transcarbamylase deficiency and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency {{are not included in}} newborn screening panels because they are not reliably detected using current technology, and also because severely affected infants will present with clinical symptoms before newborn screening results are available. Some regions claim to screen for HHH syndrome (hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, homocitrullinuria) based on the detection of elevated <b>ornithine</b> levels in the newborn screening dried blood spot, but other sources have shown that affected individuals do not have elevated <b>ornithine</b> at birth.|$|E
2500|$|NO exerts {{antiproliferative}} effects by cGMP-dependent inhibiting Ca2+ influx or by directly inhibiting {{the activity}} of arginase and <b>ornithine</b> decarboxylase, decreasing the generation of polyamides required for DNA synthesis. NO also has antithrombotic effects that result of its diffusion across platelet membrane and sGC activation, resulting in inhibition of platelet aggregation. Moreover, NO affects leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium by inhibiting the [...] nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which induces vascular endothelial expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules.|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{reaction}} catalyzed by AGAT is {{the synthesis}} of guanidinoacetate from arginine and glycine, with <b>ornithine</b> as a byproduct. [...] The guanidinoacetate produced is then combined with S-Ado-Methionine, a reaction catalyzed by GAMT, to produce creatine and S-Ado-Homocysteine. The mechanism by which the AGAT catalyzes this committed step follows a ping-pong mechanism, and involves the transferring of an amidino group to the Cys407 residue on the protein from L-arginine, which leaves as L-ornithine. [...] The His303 residue then extracts a proton from glycine, which then picks up the amidino group from Cys407 {{in exchange for a}} proton to become guanidinoacetate and renew the catalyst.|$|E
2500|$|The {{formation}} of guanidinoacetate is normally the rate-limiting step of creatine biosynthesis. Consequently, the AGAT reaction {{is the most}} likely control step in the pathway, a hypothesis that is supported by a great deal of experimental work. Most important in this respect is the feedback repression of AGAT by creatine, the end-product of the pathway. Cyclocreatine, N-acetimidoylsarcosine, and N-ethylguanidinoacetate display repressor activity like creatine as well. [...] L-Arginine and guanidinoacetate have only [...] "apparent" [...] repressor activity. They exert no effect on AGAT expression by themselves but are readily converted to creatine, which then acts as the true repressor. It has been suggested that AGAT activity in tissues is regulated {{in a number of ways}} including induction by growth hormone and thyroxine, inhibition of the enzyme by <b>ornithine,</b> and repression of its synthesis by creatine.|$|E
2500|$|Since Harlow's {{pioneering}} work on touch research in development, recent work in rats has {{found evidence that}} touch during infancy resulted in a decrease in corticosteroid, a steroid hormone involved in stress, {{and an increase in}} glucocorticoid receptors in many regions of the brain. Schanberg and Field found that even short-term interruption of mother–pup interaction in rats markedly affected several biochemical processes in the developing pup: a reduction in <b>ornithine</b> decarboxylase (ODC) activity, a sensitive index of cell growth and differentiation; a reduction in growth hormone release (in all body organs, including the heart and liver, and throughout the brain, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem); an increase in corticosterone secretion; and suppressed tissue ODC responsivity to administered growth hormone. Additionally, it was found that animals who are touch-deprived have weakened immune systems. Investigators have measured a direct, positive relationship between the amount of contact and grooming an infant monkey receives during its first six months of life, and its ability to produce antibody titer (IgG and IgM) in response to an antibody challenge (tetanus) at a little over one year of age. Trying to identify a mechanism for the [...] "immunology of touch", some investigators point to modulations of arousal and associated CNS-hormonal activity. Touch deprivation may cause stress-induced activation of the pituitary–adrenal system, which, in turn, leads to increased plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Likewise, researchers suggest, regular and [...] "natural" [...] stimulation of the skin may moderate these pituitary–adrenal responses in a positive and healthful way.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the second}} pathway, {{arginine}} is converted into <b>ornithine</b> and then <b>ornithine</b> is converted into putrescine by <b>ornithine</b> decarboxylase (ODC).|$|E

50|$|<b>Ornithine</b> is a non-proteinogenic {{amino acid}} that {{plays a role}} in the urea cycle. <b>Ornithine</b> is {{abnormally}} accumulated in the body in <b>ornithine</b> transcarbamylase deficiency. The radical is ornithyl.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in the SLC25A15 gene cause <b>ornithine</b> {{translocase}} deficiency. <b>Ornithine</b> translocase deficiency {{belongs to}} a class of metabolic disorders referred to as urea cycle disorders. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions that occurs in liver cells. This cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein {{is used by the}} body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. The SLC25A15 gene provides instructions for making a protein called a mitochondrial <b>ornithine</b> transporter. This protein is needed to move a molecule called <b>ornithine</b> within the mitochondria (the energy-producing centers in cells). Specifically, this protein transports <b>ornithine</b> across the inner membrane of mitochondria to the region called the mitochondrial matrix, where it participates in the urea cycle. Mutations in the SLC25A15 gene result in a mitochondrial <b>ornithine</b> transporter that is unstable or the wrong shape, and which cannot bring <b>ornithine</b> to the mitochondrial matrix. This failure of <b>ornithine</b> transport causes an interruption of the urea cycle and the accumulation of ammonia, resulting in the signs and symptoms of <b>ornithine</b> translocase deficiency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ornithine</b> oxoglutarate (OGO) or <b>ornithine</b> α-ketoglutarate (OKG) {{is a drug}} used in liver therapy. It is {{the salt}} formed from <b>ornithine</b> and alpha-ketoglutaric acid. It {{is also used to}} improve {{nutritional}} health in elderly patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ornithine</b> {{translocase}} {{is responsible}} for transporting <b>ornithine</b> from the cytosol into the mitochondria in the urea cycle.|$|E
50|$|The OAT {{involved}} in the ultimate formation of the non-essential amino acid proline from the amino acid <b>ornithine.</b> <b>Ornithine</b> aminotransferase forms the initial intermediate in this process. It catalyzes the reverse reaction as well, and is therefore essential in creating <b>ornithine</b> from the starting substrate proline.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ornithine,</b> via {{the action}} of <b>ornithine</b> decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.17), is the {{starting}} point for the synthesis of polyamines such as putrescine.|$|E
5000|$|L-Ornithine {{is one of}} the {{products}} of the action of the enzyme arginase on L-arginine, creating urea. Therefore, <b>ornithine</b> is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess nitrogen. <b>Ornithine</b> is recycled and, in a manner, is a catalyst. First, ammonia is converted into carbamoyl phosphate (...) [...] <b>Ornithine</b> is converted into a urea derivative at the δ (terminal) nitrogen by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Another nitrogen is added from aspartate, producing the denitrogenated fumarate, and the resulting arginine (a guanidinium compound) is hydrolysed back to <b>ornithine,</b> producing urea. The nitrogens of urea come from the ammonia and aspartate, and the nitrogen in <b>ornithine</b> remains intact.|$|E
