5|$|The {{coat of arms}} of the Swedish Army {{consists}} of two crossed golden swords <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> field. This motif is repeated in {{the flag of the}} Inspector General of the Army, and a blue field with a single upright golden sword appears on the flag of Military Region Command infrastructure, with three gold crowns in the canton.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the {{inhabitants}} of the French-administered Saar Protectorate voted to join West Germany. Since its establishment as a separate French protectorate in 1947, the Saar had a white Nordic cross <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> and red background as its flag. To demonstrate the commitment of the Saar {{to be a part of}} West Germany, a new flag was selected on 9 July 1956: the black-red-gold tricolour defaced with the new coat of arms, also proposed on this day. This flag came into force on 1 January 1957, upon the establishment of the Saarland as a state of West Germany.|$|E

50|$|The {{work itself}} is 170 {{measures}} and based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Blues</b> {{form in the}} key of f minor. The smaller 12 measure sub-form repeats numerous times; the overall work mimicks a hybrid Sonata form with an exposition/statement, development (with improvisation section), and recap (or restatement).|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s he {{returned}} to expressionism with works like Los hacheros (Axemen) and La comida (Food), and {{began a series of}} suburban landscapes including Villa Piolín (Villa Tweety), La casa del sastre (House of Taylor), La iglesia (The Church), El tanque blanco (White Tank), La calle (Street), La res (The Answer), Carnicería (Carnage), La luna y su eco (The Moon and its Echo), and Mañana helada en el páramo desierto (Morning Frost on the Moor). He also painted Negro y blanco (Black and White), Utensilios de cocina sobre un muro celeste (Cookware <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Blue</b> Wall), and El caballito (The Pony).|$|E
5|$|Saint Michael the Archangel appears {{often in}} heraldic settings. In one case, the device from the shield of the Trinity is placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> field and {{attributed}} to St. Michael (Dennys, 95). More usually, he {{is shown in}} armour with a red cross on a white shield, slaying the devil depicted as a dragon. These attributed arms were later transferred to Saint George (Dennys, 109).|$|E
5|$|The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), {{established}} independently in 1952, {{has only}} the plain sun disc as its emblem. This {{is the only}} branch of service with an emblem that does not invoke the rayed Imperial Standard. However, the branch does have an ensign to fly on bases and during parades. The ensign was created in 1972, which was the third used by the JASDF since its creation. The ensign contains the emblem of the branch centered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> background.|$|E

5|$|The {{arms are}} used as a mark of {{authority}} by various government agencies and representatives, including the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Speaker of the House of Commons, most courts (including the Supreme Court), and, formerly, Parliament, and {{on the cover of}} Canadian passports. Since 1962, a banner of the arms, defaced with a variant of the Queen's cypher, has formed the Royal Standard of Canada, for use by the Canadian sovereign. The personal flag of the Governor General has featured the crest of the arms of Canada <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> background since 1981.|$|E
5|$|The earlier Saxon Kings were {{assigned}} a gold cross <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> shield, {{but this did}} not exist until the 13th century. The arms of Saint Edward the Confessor, a blue shield charged with a gold cross and five gold birds, {{appears to have been}} suggested by heralds in the time of Henry III of England (Boutell, 18) based on a coin minted in Edward's reign (Neubecker, 30). These arms were later used by Richard II of England out of devotion to the saint (Fraser, 44).|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans to}} {{undertake}} a major restoration of Mdina's walls were made in 2006, {{as part of a}} project that also included restoration of the fortifications of Valletta, Birgu and the Cittadella. In the case of Mdina, the main focus was to consolidate the terrain, since the city is built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> clay plateau which is prone to subsidence. The multimillion-euro restoration was partially financed by the European Regional Development Fund. Works began in early 2008 by the Restoration Unit. The process of restoration was documented by Dr. Spiteri.|$|E

5|$|The {{flag of the}} Republic of Kosovo {{was adopted}} by the Assembly of Kosovo {{immediately}} following the declaration of independence of Kosovo from Serbia on 17 February 2008. The flag is the result of an international design competition, organised by the United Nations-backed Kosovo Unity Team, which attracted almost one thousand entries. The now-used design was proposed by by Muhamer Ibrahimi. It shows six white stars in an arc above a golden map of Kosovo <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> field. The stars symbolise Kosovo's six major ethnic groups.|$|E
5|$|The shirts worn by {{players of}} Ipswich Town did not sport a crest until the mid-1960s, when they adopted a design {{featuring}} a gold lion rampant guardant {{on a red}} background on the left half and three gold ramparts <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> background on the right half. In 1972, the crest was redesigned {{as the result of}} a competition, won by the Treasurer of the Supporters Club, John Gammage. Each element of the new design was intended to represent the region.|$|E
5|$|Albion's main club badge {{dates back}} to the late 1880s, when club {{secretary}} Tom Smith suggested that a throstle (song thrush) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge. Since then, the club badge has always featured a throstle, usually <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the club's move to the Hawthorns. The throstle was chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, the Throstles. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning. In 1979, an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns, and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Newfoundland and Labrador, each {{province}} and territory bears {{at least some}} elements from its coat of arms upon its flag. The flags of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island are banners of the provincial arms, while Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories, and the Yukon each have the shield of the local coat of arms on their flags, with other design elements. The flag of Nunavut uses some elements from its coat of arms along with other symbols and colours. The shield of the arms of each province, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> background and circled with ten gold maple leaves, the whole surmounted by a crown, forms the main element of {{the flag of the}} Lieutenant-Governor of that province. The exceptions are Nova Scotia, which uses the Union Flag defaced with the shield of Nova Scotia, surrounded by green maple leaves, and Quebec, which uses the shield on a white circle with the provincial motto inscribed below.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise was {{refurbished}} for its space shots, {{with its}} shiny exterior dulled down and extra detail {{added to the}} frame. Compared to the newly built Reliant, the Enterprise was hated by the effects artists and cameramen; it took eight people to mount the model, and a forklift truck to move it. The Reliant, meanwhile, was lighter and had less complex internal wiring. The ships were filmed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> screen with special film that does not register the color; the resulting shots could be added to effects shots or other footage. Any reflection of blue on the ship's hull would appear as a hole on the film; the gaps had to be patched frame by frame for the final film. The same camera used to film Star Wars, the Dykstraflex, was used for shots of the Enterprise and other ships.|$|E
5|$|The chancel, {{which has}} a ceiling {{decorated}} by C. E. Kempe, has three windows {{in the style of}} the late 12th century, and a priest's door built into the south side circa 1250. A south porch was built in 1621 at the behest of Dr Robert Burton, whose arms are carved in the gable above the date. A candelabrum given by Ann Kendall in 1705 hangs in the chancel. The chancel ceiling was decorated with a pattern of gold stars <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> background in 1914. Two years later, an altar was erected at the east end of the north aisle, and an aumbry placed in the north wall of the chancel. The royal arms of William IV are displayed in the tower.|$|E

5|$|In the 1979 general election, a Conservative {{government}} came {{to power}} and the Council shifted focus towards retaining Grammar Schools where they still existed and improving schools where work had been put on hold during the comprehensive debate; despite 90% of English councils adopting comprehensive education, Lincolnshire had resisted. In 1979, the schools sub-committee recommended that the Westholme site be rebuilt. By December, the Council had approved the consolidation of the school at Westholme, but the catchment area was decreased to protect the smaller schools at Billingborough and Billinghay, causing controversy amongst parents in affected areas and governors at the school. A new building was constructed at Westholme between 1981 and 1983, allowing the Church Lane site to close in 1983−84.

A new badge, to be worn on pupil's blazers, was designed by pupil Stephen Robinson: it featured a gold sword atop a red dragon <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> shield, bordered with gold, all above a scroll with the motto Loyalty.|$|E
