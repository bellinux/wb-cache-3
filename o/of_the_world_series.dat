5|$|Major League Baseball {{presents}} {{a variety of}} annual awards and trophies to recognize both its teams and its players. Three team trophies are awarded annually: one each to the National League and American League champions, {{and one of the}} champion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series.</b> Additionally, various organizations—such as the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA), the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball, and select corporate sponsors—present awards for such accomplishments as excellence in batting, pitching performance, fielding prowess, and community service.|$|E
5|$|Pitchers {{have been}} named Series MVP twenty-seven times; four of them were relief pitchers. Twelve of the first {{fourteen}} World Series MVPs were won by pitchers; from 1969 until 1986, the proportion of pitcher MVPs declined—Rollie Fingers (1974) and Bret Saberhagen (1985) {{were the only two}} pitchers to win the award in this period. From 1987 until 1991, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series</b> MVPs were pitchers, and, since 1995, pitchers have won the award nine times. Bobby Richardson of the 1960 New York Yankees is the only player in World Series history to be named MVP despite being on the losing team.|$|E
5|$|Since {{moving to}} Progressive Field, the Indians have won nine Central Division titles and have hosted playoff games in ten seasons, {{the most recent}} being in 2017.

The Indians have hosted games of the American League Championship Series in five seasons and have advanced to the World Series three times at the park.|$|E

5|$|The series {{moved to}} the Polo Grounds for game two. Sheldon Jones took the mound for the Giants despite a 6–10 record going into the game, {{allowing}} the Giants to save Sal Maglie for the series' game three or the first game <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series.</b> The Dodgers used Clem Labine, a rookie who had started just six games for the Dodgers in his career, because they lacked pitchers who were ready for the game. The Yankees were among those in attendance as spectators.|$|E
5|$|The trophy was {{not without}} {{precedent}} in Major League baseball: the Dauvray Cup (named after actress Helen Dauvray) was awarded to the winner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series</b> between the National League and the American Association from 1887 to 1890, and from 1891 to 1893, when a solitary major league remained, to {{the winner of the}} National League pennant. The Dauvray Cup was to be held by the victorious team, and was to be relinquished the following year when (and if) a new champion team emerged. The Dauvray Cup mysteriously vanished following the 1893 series and has never been located. From 1894 to 1897, the Temple Cup was awarded to the winner of a postseason contest between the two top National League clubs.|$|E
5|$|A {{modicum of}} peace was {{eventually}} established, {{leading to the}} National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and {{between them and the}} National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The Boston Americans of the American League defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion New York Giants, under manager John McGraw, refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion. In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series</b> as the major leagues' annual championship event.|$|E

5|$|As {{a sophomore}} {{in the fall}} of 1995, he was moved up to the varsity {{basketball}} team from the junior varsity due to injuries. As a junior, his presence was significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding a broom in the air to simulate playing against him. He helped his team reach the Class 4A-state Region II final. As a junior in baseball, Young threw a no-hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997. However, he missed {{a large part of the}} season after getting off to a 6–0 start because of a stress fracture in his foot. Nonetheless, he was already considered a top professional prospect, and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all-district team. By the summer of 1997, he was able to play for the Dallas Mustangs who were the defending national champions in the Connie Mack World Series, and he earned the win in the fifth place game <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both the Dodgers and Braves {{finished}} the regularly scheduled 154-game season tied with records of 86–68, forcing a tie-breaker {{to decide the}} pennant winner. The two teams' managers flipped a coin to decide home field advantage and Dodgers' manager Walt Alston won. The Dodgers opted to play {{the second and third}} (if necessary) games at home, choosing to play Game 1 in Milwaukee. The tie-breaker was scheduled for the 28th, 29th, and the 30th if necessary, which required moving the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series</b> from September 30 to October 1. The Giants' falling out of the pennant race avoided a potentially disruptive situation involving their home field. Candlestick Park was under construction during the 1959 season and the Giants would not begin play there until 1960. However, Giants vice president Chub Feeney had said earlier in the season that if the Giants won the pennant they would play their World Series home games in Candlestick. Several potential problems were suggested with this move including a lack of seating, lack of toilet facilities, and insufficient access roads to the stadium.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, in {{the middle}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series</b> match between two Bay Area {{baseball}} teams, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck and caused widespread infrastructural damage, including {{the failure of the}} Bay Bridge, a major link between San Francisco and Oakland. Even so, the Bay Area's technology industry continued to expand and growth in Silicon Valley accelerated that the United States Census confirmed that year that San Jose had overtaken San Francisco in terms of population. The commercialization of the Internet {{in the middle}} of the decade rapidly created a speculative bubble in the high-tech economy known as the Dot-com bubble. This bubble began collapsing in the early 2000s and the industry continued contracting for the next few years, nearly wiping out the market. Companies like Amazon.com and Google managed to weather the crash however, and following the industry's return to normalcy, their market value increased significantly.|$|E

5|$|On October 22, in Game 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series,</b> Pujols {{became the}} first player to get at least four hits, two home runs, and five RBIs in a World Series game in a 16–7 victory over the Rangers. Pujols had five hits, three home runs, four runs scored, and six RBIs in the game. He joined Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only players in {{baseball}} history to hit three home runs in a World Series game (Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year), {{became the first}} player in series history to have hits in four consecutive innings, and tied records for most hits and most RBIs in a World Series game. He had one hit and no RBIs the other six games of the series but became a World Series champion for the second time as the Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games. After the season, he became a free agent {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
5|$|On October 26 at AT Park, in a 5-0 {{win over}} the Royals in Game 5 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series,</b> Bumgarner pitched his second career postseason complete-game shutout, another four-hit shutout on the 2014 postseason, {{becoming}} the second pitcher in franchise history with two shutouts in a single postseason after Christy Mathewson's three shutouts in the 1905 World Series and the first San Francisco Giants pitcher to toss a complete-game shutout in a World Series game since Jack Sanford in Game 2 of the 1962 World Series, according to Fox. In addition, according to Fox Sports, Bumgarner is the fourth left-handed pitcher {{with at least two}} shutouts in a single postseason, joining Whitey Ford, Sandy Koufax, and former teammate Randy Johnson. He set all-time MLB records for lowest World Series ERA (0.29) among pitchers of at least twenty-five innings pitched and three starts, and was the first pitcher in World Series history to pitch a shutout with at least eight strikeouts and no walks.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{his five}} postseason home runs broke up no-hitters. His home run off the Braves' Derek Lowe was the Giants' first hit in Game 4 of the NLDS. His first home run off Halladay in Game 1 of the NLCS, in {{addition}} to being the first hit off Halladay in the game, was the first hit off Halladay in 11 innings, as Halladay had thrown a no-hitter in his previous start. Finally, his home run off Oswalt in Game 2 of the NLCS was the Giants' first hit of the game. In Game 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Series</b> against the Texas Rangers, he hit the first home run for the Giants off Colby Lewis; however, the Giants went on to lose 4–2. He won his first World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series since 1954.|$|E
