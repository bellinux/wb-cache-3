5|$|Doge Domenico Contarini (10431071) had a {{relatively}} uneventful reign, healing the rift between the Doge and his subjects and regaining territory {{that had been}} lost in the east to the Kingdom of Croatia in the years following the deposition of Otto Orseolo. However, <b>one</b> <b>fact</b> remained: based on their actions {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were clearly not in favor of having a royal hereditary class. This reality, coupled with the fresh memories of power-hungry Doges, set the stage for Domenico Selvo.|$|E

25|$|Some {{commentators}} later dismissed {{such claims}} as borne out of jealousy, aggravated by Goncharov's natural suspiciousness, impressionability, and general hypochondria. Others {{argued that this}} would have been too simple an explanation, for while many of Goncharov's allegations were far-fetched, some were not altogether groundless. At least <b>one</b> <b>fact</b> was undisputed: in 1855, having returned from his long sea voyage, Goncharov laid out before Turgenev, his then good friend, the whole plan of his future third novel, which he has conceived as far back as 1849.|$|E

25|$|One {{intriguing}} fact is {{that very}} few fish remains are found among their middens. This has led to much speculation and argument. Most archaeologists reject any decisive judgment based on this <b>one</b> <b>fact,</b> however, as fish bones decompose more quickly than other remains, {{and may have been}} disposed of in a different manner. Isotope analysis of the bones of inhabitants shows that marine food sources supplied {{more and more of the}} diet of the Norse Greenlanders, making up between 50% and 80% of their diet by the 14th century.|$|E
25|$|Both {{nature and}} culture are major {{components}} of Indonesian tourism. The natural heritage can boast a unique {{combination of a}} tropical climate, a vast archipelago of 17,508 islands, 6,000 of them being inhabited, the second longest shoreline in the world (54,716km) after Canada. It is the worlds largest and most populous country situated only on islands. The beaches in Bali, diving sites in Bunaken, Mount Bromo in East Java, Lake Toba and various national parks in Sumatra {{are just a few}} examples of popular scenic destinations. These natural attractions are complemented by a rich cultural heritage that reflects Indonesia's dynamic history and ethnic diversity. <b>One</b> <b>fact</b> that exemplifies this richness is that 719 living languages are used across the archipelago. The ancient Prambanan and Borobudur temples, Toraja, Yogyakarta, Minangkabau, and of course Bali, with its many Hindu festivities, are some of the popular destinations for cultural tourism.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the indigenous Indian architecture which was of the trabeate order, i.e. all spaces were spanned by means of horizontal beams, the Islamic architecture was arcuate, i.e. an arch or dome was adopted {{as a method of}} bridging a space. The concept of arch or dome was not invented by the Muslims but was, in fact, borrowed and further perfected by them from the architectural styles of the post-Roman period. Muslims used a cementing agent in the form of mortar {{for the first time in}} the construction of buildings in India. They further put to use certain scientific and mechanical formulae, which were derived by experience of other civilisations, in their constructions in India. Such use of scientific principles helped not only in obtaining greater strength and stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and builders. <b>One</b> <b>fact</b> that must be stressed here is that, the Islamic elements of architecture had already passed through different experimental phases in other countries like Egypt, Iran and Iraq before these were introduced in India. Unlike most Islamic monuments in these countries, which were largely constructed in brick, plaster and rubble, the Indo-Islamic monuments were typical mortar-masonry works formed of dressed stones. It must be emphasized that the development of the Indo-Islamic architecture was greatly facilitated by the knowledge and skill possessed by the Indian craftsmen, who had mastered the art of stonework for centuries and used their experience while constructing Islamic monuments in India.|$|E

2500|$|Among all the {{disputes}} and uncertainties of the ethnographers about the races of Europe, <b>one</b> <b>fact</b> stands out clearly—namely, {{that we can}} distinguish a race of northerly distribution and origin, characterised physically by fair colour of hair and skin and eyes, by tall stature and dolichocephaly (i.e. long shape of head), and mentally by great independence of character, individual initiative and tenacity of will.

2500|$|When in {{the spring}} {{following}} {{the departure of the}} Fortuna (on March 31, 1685), Milan got wind of what he at once suspected to be a nefarious plot against his life, he vented his fury upon the unfortunate persons with swift and fiendish vengeance.

2500|$|Screenwriter {{and film}} {{director}} Ron Shelton {{played in the}} Baltimore Orioles minor league organization soon after Dalkowski. His 1988 film Bull Durham features a character named [...] "Nuke" [...] LaLoosh (played by Tim Robbins) who is based loosely on the tales Shelton was told about Dalkowski. Brendan Fraser's character in the film The Scout is loosely based on him. In 1970, Sports Illustrateds Pat Jordan wrote, [...] "Inevitably, the stories outgrew the man, until {{it was no longer}} possible to distinguish fact from fiction. But, no matter how embellished, <b>one</b> <b>fact</b> always remained: Dalkowski struck out more batters and walked more batters per nine-inning game than any professional pitcher in baseball history." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the few {{fragments}} of this Baraita preserved by the above-mentioned authors, only <b>one</b> <b>fact</b> pertaining to its character can be ascertained, viz., that it contained haggadic (Yalḳ. l.c. on the seventy nations) {{as well as}} halakic matter, especially such portions of the Halakah as are concerned with exact measurement; for instance, the measurement of the Tabernacle and its furnishings (Rashi, l.c.). If from these short fragments an opinion could be formed concerning {{the composition of the}} Baraita, Zunz's assumption would be justified that it contained Haggadah and Halakah numerically arranged. Another assumption of his, however, that it represents the [...] "Mishnat R. Nathan" [...] mentioned elsewhere, is highly improbable; R. Nathan's Mishnah was in all likelihood only a version of Akiva's Mishnah differing from the authoritative Mishnah. Against Zunz's opinion, compare Eliakim Milsahagi RABIH, pp.4b, 7b.|$|E

2500|$|The {{typical day}} would start with Huxley lecturing at 9am, {{followed}} by a program of laboratory work supervised by his demonstrators. Huxley's demonstrators were picked men—all became leaders of biology in Britain in later life, spreading Huxley's ideas {{as well as their}} own. Michael Foster became Professor of Physiology at Cambridge; E. Ray Lankester became Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College London (1875–91), Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Oxford (1891–98) and Director of the Natural History Museum (1898–1907); S.H. Vines became Professor of Botany at Cambridge; W.T. Thiselton-Dyer became Hooker's successor at Kew (he was already Hooker's son-in-law!); T. Jeffery Parker became Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at University College, Cardiff; and William Rutherford became the Professor of Physiology at Edinburgh. William Flower, Conservator to the Hunterian Museum, and THH's assistant in many dissections, became Sir William Flower, Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and, later, Director of the Natural History Museum. It's a remarkable list of disciples, especially when contrasted with Owen who, in a longer professional life than Huxley, left no disciples at all. [...] "No <b>one</b> <b>fact</b> tells so strongly against Owen... as that he has never reared one pupil or follower".|$|E
2500|$|During {{his radio}} show on March 22, 1994, Stern {{announced}} his candidacy for Governor of New York under the Libertarian Party ticket, challenging Mario Cuomo for re-election. Stern planned to reinstate the death penalty, remove highway tolls to improve traffic flow, and limit road work to graveyard shifts hours. Stern announced that once those three goals were accomplished, he would resign and pass the governorship to his lieutenant. At the party's nomination convention on April 23, Stern won the required two-thirds majority on the first ballot, receiving 287 of the 381 votes cast; James Ostrowski finished second with 34 votes. To place {{his name on the}} final ballot, Stern was obliged to state his home address and complete a financial disclosure form under the Ethics in Government Act. Stern applied for an injunction as he wished to avoid stating his income; the request was denied by a judge on August 2. Stern withdrew his candidacy in an on-air press conference two days later, saying: [...] "I spend 25 hours a week telling you all the most intimate details of my life ... <b>One</b> <b>fact</b> I've never revealed is how much I make and how much money I have ... it's none of your business." [...] In the gubernatorial election on November 8, Cuomo was defeated by George Pataki, whom Stern backed. In August 1995, Pataki signed a bill which limited construction on state roads to night hours in New York City and Long Island, which was named the [...] "Howard Stern Bill" [...] in honor of Stern originally proposing the plan. Stern has since felt [...] "firmly opposed" [...] to the death penalty.|$|E
