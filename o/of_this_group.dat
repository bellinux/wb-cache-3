5|$|After a brief stay {{among the}} Mormon {{community}} of southern Utah, Harrison {{enlisted in the}} Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1917 and was stationed at a French hospital, where he tended {{to the needs of}} the Chinese Labour Corps. Quickly learning the language and customs <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> of some 200,000 men, Harrison successfully treated many bilharzia, catarrh and tuberculosis cases, significantly reducing the number of sick members of the Corps during the winter of 1917–18.|$|E
5|$|After the war, it was {{estimated}} that only 5,000 of the 107,000 Jews deported from the Netherlands between 1942 and 1944 survived. An estimated 30,000 Jews remained in the Netherlands, with many people aided by the Dutch underground. Approximately two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> survived the war.|$|E
5|$|Calbovista {{is usually}} {{classified}} in the family Lycoperdaceae, although the nomenclatural status <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> is unclear, as some authorities lump it into the Agaricaceae. By contrast, Sanford Myron Zeller placed Calbovista in Mycenastracae, a family erected by him in 1948 to contain Calbovista and Mycenastrum, two genera united by similarities in capillitial morphology. Mycenastraceae is not currently considered to have independent taxonomic significance and is folded into synonymy with the Agaricaceae.|$|E

5|$|In a 1998 review, {{primatologist}} Marc Godinot recognized Sivaladapidae as {{a separate}} family within the Adapiformes, and this classification has been followed since then. Several genera in addition to Indraloris and Sivaladapis are now allocated to Sivaladapidae, which is known from the Eocene through the Miocene of China, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and Pakistan. Sivaladapids are notable for including by far the youngest adapiforms; members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> are otherwise known mostly from the Eocene, but several sivaladapids occurred during the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|In current practice, the Marcellus Formation(abbr. Dm or Dms) is {{classified}} as the basal unit of the Hamilton Group(Dh), lying beneath the Mahantango Formation(Dmh) member <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> in Pennsylvania and Maryland. In New York, the Mahantango, also of Middle Devonian age, is further divided. There the Marcellus is separated from the overlying Skaneateles Formation, a more clastic and fossiliferous dark shale, by the thin Stafford or Mottville Limestone bed.|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} that Prophets of Rage {{is a new}} supergroup formed by Morello, Wilk and Commerford, with Chuck D of Public Enemy and B-Real of Cypress Hill.

5|$|Mapracorat {{is one of}} {{a number}} of trifluoropropanolamines and -amides which are less {{obviously}} steroid-like in structure. Other typical examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> are ZK216348 and 55D1E1. The bulky, bicyclic aromatic substituents (R1 and R2) account for the structural similarity to corticoids. The R conformation of the asymmetric carbon atom seems to be essential for GR affinity.|$|E
5|$|Nishikori and Raonic {{are among}} a group of players whom tennis pundits suggest could be the successors of the Big Four. The members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> vary, but have {{included}} Grigor Dimitrov, Ernests Gulbis, Marin Cilic, and Dominic Thiem. Raonic holds a positive record against Gulbis and Thiem, having won in all six occasions, but has negative record against Čilić and Dimitrov, most notably having lost in four matches to the latter in five meetings.|$|E
5|$|Nos. 46234, 46246 and 46253 {{followed}} {{the next month}} and throughout 1963 the entire initial batch, Nos. 46220-46224, was withdrawn along with Nos. 46230, 46242, 46247, 46249 and 46252. These withdrawals meant that by the New Year of 1964, there were only 22 of the class remaining. Nos. 46229, 46233 and 46236 followed in early 1964, although two <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> - No. 46229 Duchess of Hamilton and No. 46233 Duchess of Sutherland - were destined for preservation.|$|E
50|$|The {{poems in}} <b>this</b> {{collections}} are <b>grouped</b> into two main sections: Part I Mangroves (2000-2002) and Part II The Night Watch (1988-1994). An author's note (p.ix) explains the significance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>grouping.</b>|$|R
30|$|Pyŏnhan is {{referred}} to in the Wei shu as Pyŏnjin 弁辰, usually interpreted as an amalgamation of the names for Pyŏnhan and Chinhan. The name further emphasizes the heterogeneous nature <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>grouping.</b>|$|R
50|$|Among {{all these}} varied activities, the {{outstanding}} feature <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group's</b> combat record is the 235 enemy aircraft it {{destroyed in the}} air and 440 on the ground during its one year of operations.|$|R
5|$|Oganesson is {{a member}} of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> are usually inert to most common {{chemical}} reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a closed outer valence shell in which its valence electrons are arranged in a 7s27p6 configuration.|$|E
5|$|On 15March {{the three}} heavy cruisers {{anchored}} at Tanjung Priok near Java. Following this, either 15 or 36 survivors {{were transferred to}} Aoba.

All <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> were later landed at Tanjung Priok.|$|E
5|$|Spirituals were {{primarily}} expressions of religious faith, sung by slaves on southern plantations. In {{the mid to}} late 19th century, spirituals spread out of the U.S. South. In 1871 Fisk University became home to the Fisk Jubilee Singers, a pioneering group that popularized spirituals across the country. In imitation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group,</b> gospel quartets arose, followed by increasing diversification with the early 20th-century rise of jackleg and singing preachers, from whence came the popular style of gospel music.|$|E

5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of Anthozoans is {{not clearly}} understood {{and a number}} of different models have been proposed. Within the Hexacorallia, the sea anemones, coral anemones and stony corals may constitute a monophyletic grouping united by their six-fold symmetry and cnidocyte trait. The Octocorallia appears to be monophyletic, and primitive members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> may have been stolonate. The cladogram presented here comes from a 2014 study by Stampar et al. which was based on the divergence of mitochondrial DNA within the group and on nuclear markers.|$|E
5|$|While the {{previous}} grouping had good morphological support, molecular studies do not corroborate the monophyly <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group.</b> Previously Mysida included two other families, Lepidomysidae and Stygiomysidae, but these {{have now been}} placed in a separate order, Stygiomysida.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Dworkin is {{most often}} remembered {{for her role as}} a speaker, writer, and activist in the feminist anti-pornography movement. In February 1976, Dworkin took a leading role in {{organizing}} public pickets of Snuff in New York City and, during the fall, joined Adrienne Rich, Grace Paley, Gloria Steinem, Shere Hite, Lois Gould, Barbara Deming, Karla Jay, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Robin Morgan, and Susan Brownmiller in attempts to form a radical feminist antipornography group. Members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>group</b> would go on to found Women Against Pornography in 1979, but by then Dworkin had begun to distance herself from the group over differences in approach. Dworkin spoke at the first Take Back the Night march in November 1978, and joined 3,000 women in a march through the red-light district of San Francisco.|$|E
