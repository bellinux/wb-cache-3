5|$|King William, {{using the}} {{treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>Bishop</b> John {{as a cause}} for war with Harald, brought a large army north in 12011202.

During this time, Earl Harald's son Thorfinn was captured by the Scots. Whether in revenge for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>Bishop</b> John, or to cow Harald, or because Thorfinn may have had some claim to the throne through his mother (the lady of Moray), he was blinded and castrated, dying soon later in prison.|$|E
50|$|Hippolytus of Rome was {{a disciple}} of Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp, a disciple of Apostle John. Hippolytus's works were {{considered}} lost {{prior to their}} discovery at a monastery on Mt. Athos in 1854. While his major work The Refutation of All Heresies was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, On the Twelve Apostles of Christ and On the Seventy Apostles of Christ, are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers. Here is the complete text of Pseudo-Hippolytus's On the Seventy Apostles of Christ:# James the Lord's brother, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem.# Cleopas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem.# Matthias, who supplied the vacant place {{in the number of}} the twelve apostles.# Thaddeus, who conveyed the epistle to Augarus.# Ananias, who baptized Paul, and was <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Damascus.# Stephen, the first martyr.# Philip, who baptized the eunuch.# Prochorus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Nicomedia, who also was the first that departed, 11 believing together with his daughters.# Nicanor died when Stephen was martyred.# Timon, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Bostra.# Parmenas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Soli.# Nicolaus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Samaria.# Barnabas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Milan.# Mark the Evangelist, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria.# Luke the Evangelist.These two belonged to the seventy disciples who were scattered by the offence of the word which Christ spoke, “Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he is not worthy of me.” But the one being induced to return to the Lord by Peter’s instrumentality, and the other by Paul’s, they were honored to preach that Gospel on account of which they also suffered martyrdom, the one being burned, and the other being crucified on an olive tree.Silas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Corinth.Silvanus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Thessalonica.Crisces (Crescens), <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Carchedon in Gaul.Epænetus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Carthage.Andronicus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Pannonia.Amplias, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Odyssus.Urban, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Macedonia.Stachys, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Byzantium.Barnabas, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> HeracleaPhygellus, <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> Ephesus.

5|$|Against {{all these}} reforms were the nobles of Wessex, who {{included}} most of Dunstan's own relatives, {{and who had}} an interest in maintaining established customs.

5|$|Bishop John Innes (1407–14) contributed {{greatly to}} the {{rebuilding}} of the cathedral, {{as evidenced by the}} inscription on his tomb praising his efforts. When he died, the chapter met secretly—"in quadam camera secreta in campanili ecclesie Moraviensis"—and agreed that should one of their number be elected to the see, the bishop would grant one-third of the income of the bishopric annually until the rebuilding was finished. The major alterations to the west front were completed before 1435 and contain the arms <b>of</b> <b>Bishop</b> Columba de Dunbar (1422–35), and it is presumed that both the north and south aisles of the choir were finished before 1460, as the south aisle contains the tomb of John de Winchester (1435–60). Probably the last important rebuilding feature was the major restructuring of the chapterhouse between 1482 and 1501, which contains the arms <b>of</b> <b>Bishop</b> Andrew Stewart.|$|E
