500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1982, [...] "sub-fossil" [...] shells of what {{appeared}} to be Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found in the banks {{on the west side of}} Chittenango Creek near the Falls. Grimm (1981) postulated that Pleistocene deposits of what was originally described as Novisuccinea ovalis pleistocenica (Baker, 1927) are in fact shells of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, and that this species was widely distributed during the Pleistocene epoch. Shell specimens have been recorded from Yarmouthian Interglacial, Sangamonian Stage, and Peorian Stage deposits in the states of Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, and Nebraska, and in Ontario. Alan Solem, however, questioned the assignment of the fossil succineid shell deposits to any species group. Although Hubricht (1985) mapped the location of extant populations of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis to include New York, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina, with fossil records from Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas, Hoagland and Davis (1987) concluded that there is only one verified extant population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and that it is impossible to verify fossil records as being Novisuccinea chittenangoensis based <b>on</b> <b>shell</b> characteristics alone.|$|E

2500|$|Technological {{developments}} such as crude ceramics {{were developed}} by Archaic societies early during the late Holocene. A total of 792 shards of pottery were found at Indian Knoll. All of which were shell or grit tempered, [...] mainly found within the first {{foot and a half}} of the mound, and closely relate to the later Mississippian culture's pottery. Most vessels had wide mouths and curved or flat bases, which were handmade by building up coils of clay. Pottery contributed to the exploitation and manipulation of wild plants, and more efficiency in food processing and water storage. The most common type of ceramics were shell tempered, representing 78.5% of the total pottery shards found at Indian Knoll, with only 171 grit tempered shards of bowls or jars discovered. Heavy grit tempered pottery appeared in different regions of the Eastern Woodlands, including Ohio Valley, between 2000-500 BC. The grit tempered ceramics that were found show plain and cord marked ware, as well as simple stamped grooved patterns. Several different finishes <b>on</b> <b>shell</b> tempered ceramics were also noted. [...] Nine shards found in one were also cord marked, or tapped with a twisted fibers wrapped [...] paddle, and three shards show signs of roughening, which were individually created by a rectangular object. Other shards show signs of net impressions caused by [...] mesh fabrics, which is common in much of western Kentucky.|$|E
