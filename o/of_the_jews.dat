5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would {{have a negative impact on}} the economy and the food supply. The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of Jews). Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established to make use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> as slave labour until they were totally eliminated, a goal that was postponed until 1942.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler {{to draft}} a new plan for the {{elimination}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting {{the entire population of}} occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E

5|$|From 1881 through 1914, {{approximately}} 2million Jews {{immigrated to}} the United States from Europe. An estimated three-quarters of them settled in New York City, primarily in the Lower East Side. Over 75,000 of these immigrants were from Romania, where Jews faced antisemitic laws, violence and expulsion. These hardships, combined with low crop yields and economic depression, resulted in 30 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> in Romania emigrating to the United States.|$|E

40|$|My thesis {{examines}} imagery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> in four Italian silent fils: Il mercante di Venezia (Gerolamo Lo Savio, 1910), L'Inferno (Francesco Bertolini, Adolfo Padovan, Giuseppe de Liuoro, 1922) Quo Vadis? (Enrico Guazzoni, 1913) and Cabiria (Giovanni Pastrone, 1914). The thesis deconstructs this filmic {{imagery and}} traces its history back to medieval and Renaissance representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew.</b> This process reveals connections between traditional anti-Jewish ideologies and <b>the</b> moving images <b>of</b> early Italian cinema. In so doing, my thesis demonstrates {{that there is}} a powerful relationship between the socio-political and relifious discourses that were in circulation before the First World War in Italy and <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> anti-Semitic stereotyping in these films. It also argues that <b>the</b> image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> in all <b>of</b> these filmic case studies functiones as a representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radical dangerous Other that threatens <b>the</b> unity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citizenry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nationstate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> Italy and <b>the</b> cohesion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Italian society at a key time of new nation building...|$|R

40|$|From Preface]. Any study centred in the exploratlon and {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval and Elizabethen images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> might, with some justification. seem redundant and impertinent {{to a modern}} reader; for <b>the</b> third quarter <b>of</b> this century has witnessed the almost total obviatlon of a great many such time-honoured images and symbols. <b>The</b> immemorial figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wandering <b>Jew,</b> to cite a sIngle instance, has {{for the past two}} decades, attained his country and place of destination - history no longer condemning him to tarry until <b>the</b> Second Coming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Messiah. Even <b>the</b> deicide <b>Jew</b> has been granted complete absolution, by an offlcial decree from the Vatican, for his complicity in <b>the</b> killing <b>of</b> Christ. It would seem, moreover, that the atrocities perpetrated against <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> during <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second World War have resulted in an alteration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish image radically transforming It from one of contempt into one of compassion a living symbol of "man's inhumanlty to man"; and the modern European dramatist has revived the Jewlsh figure on the stage as an instance of almost personal atonement or, alternatively, as a means <b>of</b> scourging <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> middle-class mind which abetted <b>the</b> persecution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazi regime, attacking state policies of inactio and deploring <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> influentlal powers to resist the blatant inhumanlty perpetrated within Its boundaries.
