5|$|It {{is likely}} that Theophanu kept the {{document}} until October 989, when she left for her journey to Italy and Rome, at which time it is believed she placed it in Gandersheim Abbey to preserve the document.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz {{was among the first}} to recognise the historical significance of this document, and reports <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> History of Welf. After the secularisation of Gandersheim Abbey in 1811, the document was transferred to the Göttingen State and University Library. On 4 May 1820, the archives from the abbey were delivered to the treasury of the duchy of Brunswick. In 1835, the document was transferred to the State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, where it remains.|$|E

5|$|Owing to {{the mistake}} by the Observer Corps, and the Geschwader being missed {{approaching}} the eastern, instead of central Channel by radar, KG 2 hit the RAF airfield.KG 2 claimed 10 Spitfires destroyed on the ground. In fact, no Fighter Command fighters were lost. For some time afterward, this wrong claim convinced German intelligence that Eastchurch was a fighter {{station and the}} Luftwaffe would launch seven fruitless raids <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the coming weeks. Added to this mistake was the failure to keep up pressure. Raids were spaced out, giving the field time to recover. The station was used by RAF Coastal Command, which lost five Bristol Blenheims in the attack and one Coastal Command Spitfire. However, severe damage was done to the infrastructure. Much equipment and ammunition was destroyed and 16 of the Command's personnel were killed. RAF Eastchurch was back in operation by 16:00.|$|E

Eleven years later, the league introduced the NFL draft after team owners voted <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1935. The intention of the draft {{was to make the}} NFL more competitive, as a few stronger teams, including the Giants, had an advantage in signing young players because they were able to offer higher salaries and an opportunity to compete for championships. Since that first draft, the Giants have selected 74 players in the first round. The team's first-round pick in the inaugural NFL draft was Art Lewis, a tackle from Ohio University; he was the 9th overall selection. In the most recent draft, held in 2017, the Giants chose Mississippi tight end Evan Engram.|$|E
5|$|The castle motte {{was built}} up in several stages, {{originally}} being lower in height than today, before being built up during the medieval period and scarped by cutting away at the surrounding stone.

The motte is separated from the bailey by a ditch, now crossed by a modern bridge. In the 13th century this point was protected by a D-shaped tower, which still survives, located {{to one side of the}} gateway. The causeway steps up to the top of the mound were originally a roofed, stone corridor. There are the foundations of the castle well on the west side of the causeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} of Big Woods was significantly affected by flooding, with 30 families being {{isolated in the}} area.

Torrential rains during a two-hour span overnight triggered most of the flooding in the area, isolating many homes and inundating several. In Westmoreland Parish, severe flooding inundated several homes and damaged roadways.
