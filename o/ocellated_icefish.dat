50|$|The <b>ocellated</b> <b>icefish</b> (Chionodraco rastrospinosus) is a fish of {{the family}} Channichthyidae. It lives in the cold waters off Antarctica and is known for having {{transparent}} haemoglobin-free blood.|$|E
40|$|The {{important}} intracellular oxygen-binding protein, myoglobin (Mb), {{is thought}} to be absent from oxidative muscle tissues of the family of hemoglobinless Antarctic icefishes, Channichthyidae. Within this family of fishes, which is endemic to the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, there exist 15 known species and 11 genera. To date, we have examined eight species of icefish (representing seven genera) using immunoblot analyses. Results indicate that Mb is present in heart ventricles from five of these species of icefish. Mb is absent from heart auricle and oxidative skeletal muscle of all species. We have identified a 0. 9 -kb mRNA in Mb-expressing species that hybridizes with a Mb cDNA probe from the closely related red-blooded Antarctic nototheniid fish, Notothenia coriiceps. In confirmation that the 0. 9 -kb mRNA encodes Mb, we report the full-length Mb cDNA sequence of the <b>ocellated</b> <b>icefish,</b> Chionodraco rastrospinosus. Of the eight icefish species examined, three lack Mb polypeptide in heart ventricle, although one of these expresses the Mb mRNA. All species of icefish retain the Mb gene in their genomic DNA. Based on phylogeny of the icefishes, loss of Mb expression has occurred independently at least three times and by at least two distinct molecular mechanisms during speciation of the family...|$|E
40|$|Aim  A lack {{of genetic}} {{structure}} is predicted for Antarctic fish {{due to the}} duration of pelagic larval stages {{and the strength of}} the currents in the Southern Ocean, particularly the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In this study we explored the population structure of the <b>ocellated</b> <b>icefish,</b> Chionodraco rastrospinosus, by means of analysing a total of 394 individuals collected at four geographical areas off the Antarctic Peninsula in the period 1996 – 2006. Location  Elephant Island, southern South Shetlands, Joinville Island and South Orkneys in the Southern Ocean. Methods  The spatio-temporal genetic structure of Chionodraco rastrospinosus was explored using seven microsatellite loci. Existence and direction of gene flow across sampling locations were investigated using the isolation-by-migration procedure. Results  Microsatellite data showed a lack of genetic structuring in the area studied, with no differences found at both the geographical or temporal level, and an eastward unidirectional gene flow among sites. This suggested a lack of genetic barriers for this species, attributable to larval dispersal following the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which fits well with the predicted pattern for Antarctic fish. Re-examination of genetic data of the closely related icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus, with similar larval duration but displaying genetically structured populations, indicated a weak but significant bidirectional gene flow. Main conclusions  Our results point to a relationship that is more complex than expected between potential for dispersal and realized gene flow in the marine environment. In addition to ocean circulation and larval dispersal, other major life-history traits might be driving connectivity, particularly larval retention...|$|E
