5|$|Anti-slavery campaigners, {{inspired}} by Non-conformist preachers such as John Wesley, started {{some of the}} earliest campaigns against the practice. Prominent local opponents of both the trade and the institution of slavery itself included Anne Yearsley, Hannah More, Harry Gandey, Mary Carpenter, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge. The campaign itself proved to be the beginning <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> for reform and women's emancipation.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with neuroacanthocytosis {{also often}} suffer from parkinsonism, the {{uncontrolled}} slowness <b>of</b> <b>movements,</b> and dystonia, abnormal body postures.

5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing for a wide range <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> and subjective time can be expanded with the utilization of images as visual stimuli. The aim of this work was to verify if two static images with different representations <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> would affect distinctly temporal perception. University students not trained in visual arts submitted to images with different suggestions <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> reproduced the time of presentation of the stimuli under the prospective paradigm. The {{results showed that the}} picture with the lesser suggestion <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> (Stimulus A) was judged shorter than the one with more suggestion <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> (Stimulus B), although both have been underestimated in relation to real duration. The analysis of the data of semantic differential scales, referred to 4 criteria <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> judgment in static images, showed that stimulus A was judged having less movement than stimulus B. The conclusion was that the suggestion <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> in a static image extends the temporal experience...|$|R
5|$|A {{sequence}} <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> {{in which}} a horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to a dozen or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E
5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central axle (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a stator. This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E

40|$|The {{direction}} and magnitude <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> by the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Giles {{has been of}} great interest to medical entomologists for over 70 years. This direction <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> is likely to be affected by many factors, from environmental conditions and stage of life history of the mosquito to the existence of attractants in the vicinity. We report here the direction <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> newly emerged An. gambiae in nature, around the village of Donéguébougou, Mali. We assessed the direction <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> for individual mosquitoes by placing them in a novel enclosure with exit traps oriented {{in the direction of the}} cardinal and intermediate points of the compass. We consistently found predominantly Southward directions <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> during 2009 and 2010, with an additional Eastward component during the dry season and a Westward one during the wet season. Our data indicate that wind has an important effect on the direction <b>of</b> <b>movement,</b> but that this effect varied by season: Average directions <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> were downwind during the dry season and upwind during the wet season. A switch in anemotactic response suggests that the direction <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> An. gambiae relative to the wind immediately after emergence under varying conditions of humidity should be further investigated unde...|$|R
5|$|Burrowing behaviour, {{in which}} an {{individual}} sinks itself entirely (or partially) into the substrate, is frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing behaviour of L.canarium consists of a series <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> characteristic of the species. There are three consecutive movements: first is probing, where the animal pushes the anterior portion of the foot into the substrate to gain a hold; next is shovelling, where it pushes the substrate with its long, extensible proboscis. Retraction is the final movement, where it moves the shell along an anterior-posterior axis to settle the substrate around it. Once burrowed, part of the dorsal shell is usually still visible (although the ventral surface and the animal's soft parts are buried).|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is the {{primordial}} darkness and ignorance, from which rises {{the world of}} illusion. She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary because without the realization of this ignorance, true knowledge can not be achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, {{as well as the}} primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E
5|$|In Haydn's {{previous}} {{two sets of}} quartets, the Opus 20 ("Sun") and Opus 33 ("Russian"), he adopted a variety of cyclical structures, particularly in the alternate placement of the slow movement as {{the second or third}} movement. But in the Opus 50 set, each quartet follows the same fast–slow–minuet–fast sequence. The set is also characterised by a high degree of monothematicism (the use of a single theme within a movement). In a number <b>of</b> <b>movements,</b> including sonata form movements and minuets and trios, Haydn eschews presenting a second and contrasting theme and instead elects to explore the full potential of the primary theme.|$|E

5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E

5|$|Several {{courtship}} displays by splendid fairywren {{males have}} been recorded; the 'sea horse flight,' so {{named for the}} similarity <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> to those by a seahorse, is an exaggerated undulating flight where the male, with his neck extended and his head feathers erect, flies and tilts his body from horizontal to vertical and by rapidly beating wings is able to descend slowly and spring upwards after alighting on the ground. The 'face fan' display {{may be seen as}} a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.|$|E

5|$|Unlike oratorios or operas, {{which are}} {{generally}} structured dramaturgically into arias, recitatives and choruses, a choral symphony is structured like a symphony, in movements. It may employ the traditional four-movement scheme of a fast opening movement, slow movement, scherzo and finale, or {{as with many}} instrumental symphonies, it may use a different structure <b>of</b> <b>movements.</b> The written text in a choral symphony shares equal standing with the music, as in an oratorio, and the chorus and soloists share equality with the instruments. Over time the use of text allowed the choral symphony to evolve from an instrumental symphony with a choral finale, as in the Beethoven's Ninth, to a composition that can use voices and instruments throughout the entire composition, as in Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms or Mahler's Eighth Symphony.|$|E
