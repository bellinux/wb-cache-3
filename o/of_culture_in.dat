5|$|After {{years of}} decline with {{abandoned}} buildings and high elderly populations, {{the demographics of}} Old Louisville began to change noticeably in the 1990s. New residents were not just college students using the area as housing, but also young professionals who {{wanted to live in}} Old Louisville. The Courier-Journal's Velocity weekly has reported the area as a hip, emerging center <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> Louisville. This change is reflected in numerous coffeehouses, restaurants and bars opening in Old Louisville in the 1990s and early 2000s targeting at the younger crowd.|$|E

5|$|The first {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} the 14th century. A town grew up and received its municipal charter in 1692. Białystok has traditionally {{been one of the}} leading centers of academic, cultural, and artistic life in Podlachia and the most important economic center in northeastern Poland. Białystok was once an important center for light industry, which was the reason for the substantial growth of the city's population. The city continues to reshape itself into a modern metropolis. Białystok in 2010, was on the short-list, but ultimately lost the competition to become a finalist for European Capital <b>of</b> <b>Culture</b> <b>in</b> 2016.|$|E
5|$|Although Busoni {{met with}} many other artistic personalities who were also basing {{themselves}} in Switzerland during the war (including Stephan Zweig and James Joyce– the former noting Busoni's extensive drinking) he soon found his circumstances limiting. After {{the end of the}} war, he again undertook concert tours in England, Paris and Italy. In London he met with the composer Kaikhosru Sorabji who played to him his Second Piano Sonata (which he dedicated to Busoni); Busoni was sufficiently impressed to write for Sorabji a letter of recommendation. When Busoni's former pupil Leo Kestenberg, now an official at the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Culture</b> <b>in</b> the German Weimar Republic, invited him to return to Germany, with the promise of a teaching post and productions of his operas, he was very glad to take the opportunity.|$|E

It also provided the overall framework for management of ethnocultural and racial diversity in Canada. Similarly the Broadcasting Act of 1991 asserts the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the diversity <b>of</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>in</b> the country.|$|R
5|$|As {{a nucleus}} of the 19th- and early 20th-century Bengal Renaissance and a religiously and ethnically diverse centre <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> Bengal and India, Kolkata has local traditions in drama, art, film, theatre, and literature. Many people from Kolkata—among them several Nobel laureates—have contributed to the arts, the sciences, and other areas. Kolkata culture {{features}} idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and freestyle intellectual exchanges (adda). West Bengal's share of the Bengali film industry is based in the city, which also hosts venerable cultural institutions of national importance, such as the Academy of Fine Arts, the Victoria Memorial, the Asiatic Society, the Indian Museum and the National Library of India. Among professional scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the Agri Horticultural Society of India, the Geological Survey of India, the Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta Mathematical Society, the Indian Science Congress Association, the Zoological Survey of India, the Institution of Engineers, the Anthropological Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association. Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata differs from other Indian cities by giving importance to association football and other sports.|$|E
5|$|Gyeongju has {{produced}} notable individuals throughout its history. As {{the capital of}} Silla, Gyeongju was a center <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> its heyday. Notable Gyeongju residents in the Silla period included most of the kingdom's leading figures, not only rulers but scholars such as Seol Chong and Choe Chi-won, and generals like Kim Yusin, {{the leader of the}} Hwarang warriors. The city continued to contribute to traditional Korean thought in subsequent dynasties. Relatives of Choe Chi-won such as Choe Eon-wui and Choe Hang {{played an important role in}} establishing the structures of early Goryeo. In the Joseon period, Gyeongju joined the rest of Gyeongsang in becoming a hotbed of the conservative Sarim faction. Notable Gyeongju members of this faction included the 15th century intellectual Yi Eon-jeok. He has been enshrined in the Oksan Seowon since 1572. In modern times, the city produced writers such as Kim Dong-ni and Park Mok-wol, both of whom did a great deal to popularize the region's culture, as well as Choe Jun, a wealthy businessman who established the Yeungnam University Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabad {{emerged as}} the {{foremost}} centre <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> India with {{the decline of the}} Mughal Empire. After the fall of Delhi in 1857, the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian sub continent, under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu. This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions, for which the city has become noted. A further consequence of this north–south mix is that both Telugu and Urdu are official languages of Telangana. The mixing of religions has also resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Bonalu of Hindu tradition and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha by Muslims.|$|E

He {{was a member of}} the Jewish League <b>of</b> <b>Culture</b> <b>in</b> Berlin in 1938–39.

5|$|Relics of Qutb Shahi and Nizam rule remain visible today; the Charminar—commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah—has come to symbolise Hyderabad. Golconda fort {{is another}} major landmark. The {{influence}} of Mughlai culture {{is also evident}} in the region's distinctive cuisine, which includes Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi haleem. The Qutb Shahis and Nizams established Hyderabad as a cultural hub, attracting men of letters {{from different parts of}} the world. Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> India with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, with artists migrating to the city {{from the rest of the}} Indian subcontinent. The Telugu film industry based in the city is the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{is officially}} the main {{language}} of Sweden. Swedish {{is also one}} of two official languages of Finland. In Sweden it has long been used in local and state government and most of the educational system but remained only a de facto primary language with no official status in law until 2009. A bill was proposed in 2005 that would have made Swedish an official language but failed to pass by the narrowest possible margin (145–147) due to a pairing-off failure. A proposal for a broader language law, designating Swedish as the main language of the country and bolstering the status of the minority languages, was submitted by an expert committee to the Swedish Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Culture</b> <b>in</b> March 2008. It was subsequently enacted by the Riksdag and entered into effect on 1 July 2009.|$|E
