5|$|Another intense fixture {{is that of}} the New Firm derby between United and North-East rivals Aberdeen. The match itself {{became one}} <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> {{competition}} due to the domestic and European success the two sides achieved in the late 1970s and 1980s under the stewardship of United's Jim McLean and Aberdeen's Alex Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had {{suffered}} during a winter <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe {{was ready to}} embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named Numaga. For three days Numaga fasted and argued for peace.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, Sparta lost its {{position}} as a major power in Greece. Subsequent Spartan attempts to recover the losses failed and Nabis, the last sovereign ruler, was eventually murdered. Soon after, Sparta was forcibly made a member of its former rival, the Achaean League, ending several centuries <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> political independence.|$|E

5|$|After {{this day}} <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> fighting, {{which has been}} {{described}} as the hardest-fought action of the whole Sinai campaign, the Anzac Mounted Division's advance was effectively stopped. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Further, the Anzac Mounted Division had lost a significant proportion of their strength; over 300 casualties, including eight officers and 65 other ranks killed.|$|E
5|$|As a final factor, Lee faced {{a new and}} {{formidable}} {{opponent in}} George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac fought well on its home territory. Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as Winfield S. Hancock to make decisions where {{and when they were}} needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some of his predecessors, stood his ground throughout the battle in the face <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> Confederate attacks.|$|E

5|$|Commonwealth's cavalry, {{including}} the Winged Hussars, significantly restricted Russian mobility, {{forcing them to}} stay in their trenches. In a series <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> engagements, Commonwealth forces gradually overran the Russian field fortifications, and the siege reached its final stages by late September. On 28 September 1633, Commonwealth forces took the main Russian supply points, and by 4 October the siege had broken.|$|E
5|$|In 1551, an Ottoman force briefly {{attacked}} Malta, {{and then}} sacked Gozo and captured Tripoli, {{and as a}} result, the Order set up a commission to improve the island's fortifications. In 1552, the Aragonese watchtower was demolished and Fort Saint Elmo was built in its place. The fort {{played a significant role}} in the Great Siege of Malta of 1565. It eventually fell after a month <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> fighting (in which the Ottoman general Dragut was killed). The knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived, and the siege was lifted.|$|E
5|$|In March 1695, Captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set {{out from}} Cahabón in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, with 70 Spanish soldiers, {{accompanied}} by {{a large number of}} Maya archers from Verapaz, native muleteers, and four Dominican friars. They pressed ahead to Lake Petén Itzá and engaged in a series <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> skirmishes with Itza hunting parties. At the lakeshore, the Spanish encountered such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to their main camp. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón.|$|E

5|$|Newman's {{great success}} at ABC had been {{noted by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation, whose {{executives}} were keen to revive their own drama department's fortunes in the face <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> competition from ITV. In 1961 the BBC's Director of Television, Kenneth Adam, met with Newman and offered him the position of Head of Drama at the BBC. He accepted the position, eager for a new challenge, although he was forced by ABC to remain with them until the expiration of his contract in December 1962, after which he immediately began work with the BBC.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{were able}} to briefly capture Yongsan from the 2nd Infantry Division, which had been split in half from the {{penetrations}} at Naktong Bulge. Lieutenant General Walton Walker, seeing {{the danger of the}} attack, brought in the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to counterattack. In three days <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> fighting, the Army and Marine forces {{were able to}} push the North Koreans out of the town and destroy the two attacking divisions. The win was a key step toward victory in the fight at the Naktong Bulge.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{landmark in}} Middlewich is the Anglican parish church of St Michael and All Angels, parts of which {{date back to}} the 12th century, although the majority was built during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. There was a general remodelling of the church during the 19th century, which included removing the whitewash from its interior to reveal the sandstone appearance seen today. The church was the site <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> fighting in the first and second Battles of Middlewich during the English Civil War.|$|E

5|$|The {{theology}} and liturgy of the Church of England became markedly Protestant {{during the reign}} of Henry's son Edward VI largely along lines laid down by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. Under Mary, the whole process was reversed and the Church of England was again placed under papal jurisdiction. Soon after, Elizabeth reintroduced the Protestant faith but in a more moderate manner. The structure and theology of the church was a matter <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> dispute for generations.|$|E
5|$|By October Axis {{operational}} objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, {{with only the}} sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing. A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two months <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive. Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The blitzkrieg phase {{of the war in}} Europe had ended.|$|E

At the lakeshore, within sight of Nojpetén, the Spanish encountered such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to their main camp. Interrogation of an Itza prisoner revealed that the Itza kingdom {{was in a state of}} high alert to repel the Spanish; the expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón.|$|E

After the fortress fell on 11 May 1825, he hurried to Myloi, near Nafplio, arriving with one hundred men on 10 June. He ordered the construction of makeshift fortifications, as well as the gathering of provisions. More chieftains soon arrived in Myloi and Ibrahim Pasha, the commander of the Egyptian forces, was unable to take the position, despite numerical superiority and the launching <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> attacks on 12 and 14 June. Makriyannis was injured during the battle and was carried to Nafplio.|$|E
5|$|In early November, MacArthur's {{plan for}} a westward advance {{along the coast of}} New Guinea to the Philippines was {{incorporated}} into plans for the war against Japan. Three months later, airmen reported no signs of enemy activity in the Admiralty Islands. Although Willoughby did not agree that the islands had been evacuated, MacArthur ordered an amphibious landing there, commencing the Admiralty Islands campaign. He accompanied the assault force aboard the light cruiser , the flagship of Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, the new commander of the Seventh Fleet, and came ashore seven hours after the first wave of landing craft, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star. It took six weeks <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> fighting before the 1st Cavalry Division captured the islands.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1632 a well-prepared Russian army took a number of strongholds on the Lithuanian {{side of the border}} and {{commenced}} a siege of Smolensk. The well-fortified city was able to withstand a general onslaught followed by a ten-month encirclement by an overwhelming force led by Mikhail Shein. At that time a Commonwealth rescue expedition of comparable strength arrived, under the highly effective military command of Władysław IV. After months <b>of</b> <b>fierce</b> fighting, in February 1634 Shein capitulated. The Treaty of Polyanovka confirmed the Deulino territorial arrangements with small adjustments in favor of the Tsardom. Władysław had relinquished, upon monetary compensation, his claims to the Russian throne.|$|E
