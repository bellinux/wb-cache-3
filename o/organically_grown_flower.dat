40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of ethanol extracts of some <b>organically</b> and conventionally <b>grown</b> leafy vegetables. Methods: The ethanol extracts of kailan (Brassica alboglabra), bayam (Amaranthus spp.) and sawi (Brassica parachinensis) were tested for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total anthocyanin content (TAC) and the antioxidant {{capacity of the}} extracts measured using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl assay. Results: In TPC test, sawi extract showed the highest phenolic content while bayam contained the least phenolic content for both <b>organically</b> and conventionally <b>grown</b> types. In TFC test, <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> sawi extract showed the highest flavonoid content, while <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> kailan extract showed the least flavonoid content among all types of vegetables. The flavonoid content of the conventionally grown types of vegetable extracts was the highest in kalian and the least in sawi. For 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, the activity increased with the increasing concentration of each extract. All conventionally grown vegetable extracts showed higher antioxidant activity compared to their <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> counterparts. Extracts of conventionally grown sawi showed the highest percentage inhibition followed by conventionally <b>grown</b> kailan and <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> sawi. There were no correlation between TPC, TFC, TAC and IC 25 of both <b>organically</b> and conventionally <b>grown</b> vegetables. However, there was a correlation between TAC and IC 25 of conventionally grown vegetable extracts. The results showed relatively similar polyphenol content between <b>organically</b> and conventionally <b>grown</b> vegetable extracts. However, the conventionally grown vegetables extracts generally have higher antioxidant activity compared to the <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> extracts. Conclusions: These results suggested that {{the different types of}} agricultural practice had a significant contribution to the polyphenol content and antioxidant activity in the vegetables...|$|R

40|$|It {{is evident}} that the growing {{interest}} in <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> produce has correspondingly necessitated {{the debate on the}} nutritional supremacy between <b>organically</b> and conventionally <b>grown</b> produce. A study was carried out to determine and compare vitamin C, calcium and potassium in <b>organically</b> and conventionally <b>grown</b> cabbage, carrots, Cos lettuce and Valencia oranges. Samples were purchased from local supermarkets within Central Coast, New South Wales in Australia from late March to early April 2007. Vitamin C content was determined by 2, 6 -dichloroindophenol titrimetric method while calcium and potassium were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Results from the study showed inconsistent pattern with respect to vitamin C, calcium and potassium contents in the conventionally and <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> samples. No significant differences were observed in vitamin C content in conventionally and <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> cabbage, carrots and Cos lettuce while significant differences were observed in Valencia oranges which showed higher vitamin C content in organic Valencia oranges as compared to conventional ones (51. 8 to 43. 4 mg/ 100 g fresh weight). Results on calcium and potassium contents showed significant differences in all the samples with the trend of higher values for <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> cabbage, carrots and Cos lettuce as opposed to their conventionally grown counterparts. However, for Valencia oranges, results showed that the calcium and potassium contents were significantly higher in conventional Valencia oranges compared to the organic Valencia orange (54. 5 and 192. 0 mg to 51. 8 and 189. 5 mg/ 100 g, respectively) ...|$|R

40|$|Organic fruits are {{perceived}} {{to have a higher}} nutritional content than conventionally grown fruits, but currently literature is rather ambiguous on the accuracy of this claim. Using vitamin C concentration as a nutritional marker, we found no clear or significant difference in the nutritional content between <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> and conventionally grown fruit. The fruits analyzed were: oranges, mangoes, kiwi, lemons, gala apples, and red delicious apples. Of the six types of fruits analyzed by cyclic voltammetry only one, lemon, demonstrated a significantly higher vitamin C concentration for <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> versus conventionally grown fruit. Our results suggest that other factors are more influential on vitamin C levels than whether fruits are <b>organically</b> or conventionally <b>grown...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine attitudes and {{perceptions}} about organic cotton of Mississippi cotton growers and producers in comparison to fashion-conscious consumers, including advantages/disadvantages of growing and production processes, quality control, consumer preferences, and competitive price structures/profit margins. A sample size of 16 local Mississippi growers and/or producers and 44 undergraduate students at a mid-major Southeastern university were chosen to participate in the study. Instruments were developed based on current research and the definition of organic cotton production defined by the United States Department of Agriculture. Results indicate 75 % of growers and producers do not perceive a quality difference between organic and conventionally grown cotton, while 72. 7 % of the consumers report <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> cotton is capable of producing a higher quality product compared to conventionally grown cotton. Even with an increase in organic cotton prices (25 - 40 % higher premium), only 25 % of growers and producers would be willing to convert, while a majority (52. 3 %) of consumers would not be willing to spend more than 25 % extra for an <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> cotton product. Consumers indicate the negative effects of conventionally grown cotton, yet many report little knowledge about organic cotton production, while growers/producers immediately dismiss <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> cotton as a retail marketing strategy...|$|R

40|$|Consumer awareness, {{pesticide}} {{and fertilizer}} contaminations and environmental concerns {{have resulted in}} significant demand for <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> farm produce. Consumption of berries has become popular among health-conscious consumers due to {{the high levels of}} valuable antioxidants, such as anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds. The present study evaluated the influence that organic farming (OF) and integrated pest management (IPM) practise exert on the total phenolic content in 22 strawberry samples from four varieties. Postharvest performance of OF and IPM strawberries grown in the same area in the centre of Portugal and harvested at the same maturity stage were compared. Chemical profiles (phenolic compounds) were determined with the aid of HPLC-DAD/MS. Total phenolic content was higher for OF strawberry extracts. This study showed that the main differences in bioactive phytochemicals between <b>organically</b> and IPM <b>grown</b> strawberries concerned their anthocyanin levels. <b>Organically</b> <b>grown</b> strawberries were significantly higher in antioxidant activity than were the IPM strawberries, as measured by DPPH and FRAP assays...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} reports the post-harvest qualities of {{conventionally}} versus <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> banana fruit from nearby plantations in the Dominican Republic.

They were triggered to ripen with ethylene gas and kept under simulated retail conditions. Fruit mass, colour, firmness and flavour parameters were measured every second day over 12 d of shelf life. Sensory comparisons were conducted on {{four of the six}} harvest times. Significant differences (P< 0. 05) in measured quality attributes between conventionally and <b>organically</b> <b>grown</b> fruit were few and marginal. Moreover, any differences were inconsistent across harvest-times and during shelf life. Thus, <b>organically</b> and conventionally <b>grown</b> product had almost identical qualities.
