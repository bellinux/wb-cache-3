50|$|Noriaki Sano et al. {{synthesized}} single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) via a gas-injected arc-in-water method. The electrode configuration {{and duration}} of arc discharge were modified {{in order to enhance}} the yield and methane-adsorption properties ofSWNHs. Using these modified experimental parameters, the horn units in the SWNH aggregates increased in size, and the thermal stability of SWNHs in an oxidative environment increased accordingly. SWNHs obtained using the above modified conditions adsorbed a larger amount of methane than did SWNHs obtained from the conventional synthetic conditions. The effect of a mild <b>oxidation</b> <b>treatment</b> on SWNHs on their methane adsorption suggested that SWNHs with micropores would be more flexible than pristine SWNHs. By comparing the methane adsorption on the oxidized SWNHs to that on the pristine SWNHs, one can see that the oxidation of the SWNHs significantly increased the amount of methane adsorbed per apparent volume of SWNH bulk. The amount of methane adsorbed per apparent volume of oxidized SWNHs was about 2 times larger than that of pristine SWNHs, and the amount of methane adsorbed per mass of oxidized SWNHs was about 1.8 times larger than that of pristine SWNHs. The difference between “2 times” and 1.8 times” suggests that oxidized SWNHs can be packed more densely by compression than the pristine SWNHs, which is due to the change in the structural flexibility of SWNHs caused by mild oxidation.|$|E

In the present study, we have measured in vitro Ti and Al ion release from Ti 64 alloy in the as-received state and after thermal <b>oxidation</b> <b>treatments</b> at 500 or 700 °C, to culture medium under standard cell-culture conditions. Concentrations of both Ti and Al released from both thermal <b>oxidation</b> <b>treatments</b> were lower than from polished alloy. Al was released from the treated or untreated surfaces in substantially lower extent than Ti. Titanium and aluminium ions affected primary human osteoblast proliferation, metabolic activity, and differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. Treatments with individual Ti or Al metal ions in similar concentration ranges than released from the surfaces did not alter osteoblast response, which also remained unaffected after treatments with combinations of Ti plus Al applied in the proportional relations than detected in ion-release experiments. We then selected higher concentrations of Ti that impaired osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, while the proportional lower concentrations of Al did not alter osteoblast behavior. In spite of its inert character, it was found that Al significantly enhanced the deleterious effect of Ti on osteoblast differentiation. Therefore, thermal <b>oxidation</b> <b>treatments</b> of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy may improve the biocompatibility of the alloy by reducing both Ti and Al release, and thus attenuating ion-mediated interference with osteoblast differentiation. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

5000|$|The {{electronic}} {{properties are}} {{greatly influenced by}} the unique conical structure of SWNHs. Most of the studies on the electronic properties investigated the conical endcaps that contain five pentagons in the hexagonal network. [...] Berber et al. utilized theoretical calculations to determine the stability, optimum geometry, and electronic properties of SWNHs and found a net electron transfer to the pentagonal sites of the SWNH tips by simulated scanning tunneling microscopy(STM). The local density of electronic states at the tip varies corresponding to {{the shapes of the}} SWNHs that differ in the relative locations of the five pentagons. Pursuing this further, Kolesnikov et al. proposed a hyperboloid geometry that has a cone asymptotic at large distance and a smoothing at the tip for SWNHs. They investigated the influence of the pentagonal defects on the electronic properties of the SWNHs within the continuum gauge field-theory model. They found that only for five pentagons at the tip does a normalized electron state appear at the Fermi level(a hypothetical level of potential energy for an electron inside a crystalline solid) for an unbounded hyperboloid. [...] The electronic properties of dahlia-SWNHs and oxidized SWNHs were also studied by adsorption of gas such as CO2(an electron donor) and O2 (an electron acceptor). The increased electronic conductivity with adsorption of CO2 indicates that dahlia-SWNHs are n-type semiconductors. On the other hand, the electronic conductivity increases after an initial drop for the oxidized SWNHs, implying that SWNHs can be transformed into p-type semiconductors after <b>oxidation</b> <b>treatment.</b> The initial drop is due to transfer of electrons from CO2 to ox-SWNH annihilates holes, reducing the conductivity, while the later increase is because of the further electron transfer from CO2 after compensation of the hole carriers.

Under isothermal conditions this steel follows a parabolic oxidation kinetics, with an activation energy of 324 kJ mol – 1. This value corresponds to an apparent activation energy for the global process, which includes both outward diffusion of Fe cations and inward diffusion of oxygen. The oxidation products present in the oxide scales, which were characterised by X-ray diffraction and SEM, are in total agre - ement with the Fe-O phase diagram. Thus, magnetite is the most stable oxide at low temperatures and wustite starts to form above 570 °C.

All samples treated at 675 ˚C displayed higher EOC than samples treated at 600 ˚C, indicating an increase in oxide thickness with higher temperature. During the first hour of treatment at 675 ˚C, the rate of oxide growth was greater than the rate of oxide growth of all samples treated at 600 ˚C. Samples treated at 600 ˚C for 4 and 8 hours displayed pitting during potentiodynamic polarization, but all other samples withstood the applied potentials and surfaces were further passivated. To simulate damage during surgery, a single abrasion was made across samples in the abraded group with a diamond-tip indenter under a load of 471 g at 4. 4 mm/s. Abraded samples were subjected to potential-step tests to assess repassivation ability after abrasion. All samples displayed repassivation ability, except for the sample treated at 600 ˚C for 4 hours. Surface roughness was measured with atomic force microscopy before and after thermal <b>oxidation</b> <b>treatments.</b> Lower surface roughness was desired to discourage osseointegration, or the growth of bone cells. No isothermal surface roughness trends were observed, as high surface roughness outliers were seen in samples treated at 675 ˚C for 8 hours and 600 ˚C for 4 hours. Rockwell hardness and Vickers microhardness were also measured to assess bulk changes in mechanical properties and hardness of the oxidized surfaces. No statistical change was seen in Rockwell hardness. Vickers hardness increased with increasing temperature and time, {{with the exception of the}} sample treated at 600 ˚C for 4 hours. Metallography of the thermally oxidized samples was analyzed to determine if a change in microstructure had occurred due to thermal processing. No major change in grain size or the amount of alpha and beta grains was seen in samples treated at 600 ˚C, but samples treated for extended times at 675 ˚C showed equiaxed enlarged alpha grains and a reduction in beta grains. The breakdown of samples treated at 600 ˚C exemplified possible differences in the alpha-beta oxide behavior during thermal oxidation and corrosion. Outlying surface roughness and microhardness values related to the thermal <b>oxidation</b> <b>treatments</b> and resulting oxide structure. Due to delamination of oxides grown at 675 ˚C for 4, 8, and 16 hours, the treatment parameters would not be effective in the ACP application. Therefore, through corrosion resistance, repassivation ability, low surface roughness, increased microhardness, and no microstructural change, thermal <b>oxidation</b> <b>treatments</b> at 600 ˚C for more than 16 hours, and 675 ˚C for 1 hour or less would be suitable treatments for anterior cervical plates...|$|R
30|$|In nanoimprint lithography, {{a surface}} {{oxidation}} process {{is needed to}} produce an effective poly(dimethylsiloxane) coating {{that can be used}} as an anti-adhesive surface of template molds. However, the conventional photooxidation technique or acidic oxidative treatment cannot be easily applied to polymer molds with nanostructures since surface etching by UV radiation or strong acids significantly damages the surface nanostructures in a short space of time. In this study, we developed a basic oxidative treatment method and consequently, an effective generation of hydroxyl groups on a nanostructured surface of polymer replica molds. The surface morphologies and water contact angles of the polymer molds indicate that this new method is relatively nondestructive and more efficient than conventional <b>oxidation</b> <b>treatments.</b>|$|R
