5|$|In October 1943, McCormack became Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Transportation</b> Branch of the First United States Army Group, and was {{promoted}} to colonel on 1 December 1943. On 1 July 1944, he became the Chief of the Movements Branch of Twelfth United States Army Group, remaining in this role until 28 May 1945. For his services in the European Theater of Operations, {{he was awarded the}} Legion of Merit on 30 December 1944, and the Bronze Star Medal in May 1945. The British government made him an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 24 March 1945, while the French government awarded him the Croix de guerre with the silver star on 29 January 1945, and made him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor on 3 October 1945.|$|E
5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially higher than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transportation</b> sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings {{in order to reduce}} the planet's energy-related carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, glass wool, cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Miami {{was also}} {{recently}} awarded a federal grant as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Transportation</b> Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program {{to restore a}} connection between the Florida East Coast Railway's yard in Hialeah and the Port of Miami, directly connecting the port to rail networks across the United States, as well as re-establish the port's on-dock rail capability (loading and unloading directly between ships and trains). The railroad bridge connecting the Port of Miami to the mainland was damaged by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, at which time service was suspended, and the bridge remained closed for well over a decade. Rail service to the port was restored by 2014. The rail project is part of another element of increasing PortMiami's capacity; an inland intermodal center to be built near the airport known as Flagler Logistics Hub, which was planned to be built on 300 acres of land in Hialeah.|$|E

5|$|The President of Honduras {{estimated}} that Mitch set back 50years of economic development. The storm wrecked about 35,000houses and damaged another 50,000, leaving up to 1.5million people homeless, or about 20% of the country's population. Mitch directly caused $2.005billion in damage, {{with an additional}} $1.8billion in indirect costs. Most of the damage was ruined crops, and cash crop exports were cut by 9.4% in 1999, {{largely due to the}} storm. Over 70% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transportation</b> infrastructure was damaged, mostly damaged highways and bridges. Widespread areas experienced power outages, and about 70% of the country lost water after the storm. In the capital, Tegucigalpa, a large landslide affected three neighborhoods and formed a temporary dam. Floods in the city damaged buildings that were over 350years old. Throughout the country, there were at least 7,000fatalities, some reported in each department.|$|E
5|$|Though {{most of the}} Jews {{still alive}} in Linz after the war had emigrated, Wiesenthal decided to stay on, partly because the family of Adolf Eichmann lived {{a few blocks away}} from him. Eichmann had been in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transportation</b> and {{deportation}} of Jews in the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question: a plan, finalised at the Wannsee Conference—at which Eichmann took the minutes—to exterminate all the Jews in Europe. After the war, Eichmann hid in Austria using forged identity papers until 1950, when he left via Italy and moved to Argentina under an assumed name. Hoping to obtain information on Eichmann's whereabouts, Wiesenthal continuously monitored the remaining members of the immediate family in Linz until they vanished in 1952.|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} freight {{transportation}} services is a derived demand and is {{strongly influenced by}} the spatial organization and management of supply chains. In recent years, numerous trends affecting the spatial organization and structure of supply chain-logistical systems have emerged. These trends have developed as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rapidly changing political, economic, social, and technological environments. The rational planning and design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freight <b>transportation</b> system should consider these emerging trends in order to respond efficiently to the requirements imposed by <b>the</b> new organization <b>of</b> logistical systems. <b>The</b> objective here is twofold: first, to propose a methodological framework for developing and assessing scenarios describing <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freight <b>transportation</b> system characteristics due to the emerging logistical trends and, second, to apply the proposed framework to assess the future development patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freight <b>transportation</b> system {{for a number of}} industrial sectors in Europe. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed methodology led to identifying <b>the</b> relevant importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various logistical trends influencing the organization, utilization, and performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freight <b>transportation</b> system. <b>The</b> research results provide an insight into <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freight <b>transportation</b> system for different types of movement (i. e., primary, secondary, and so forth) and <b>transportation</b> modes. <b>The</b> proposed methodology provides decision makers with a tool for developing and simulating alternative policies regarding <b>the</b> future development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freight <b>transportation</b> system...|$|R
25|$|A {{temporary}} PATH station {{opened in}} 2003 and {{construction on the}} permanent station was supposed to begin in fall 2004; however, the NYPD raised security concerns on the entire site. Among the revisions effecting the Transportation Hub was doubling the number of support columns. In the original plan, {{the construction of the}} 9/11 Memorial and Museum was only supposed to have begun after the Transportation Hub had been completed because the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Transportation</b> Hub provided the foundation on which the Memorial rested upon and the walls of the Museum. Due to the two-year delay and pressure by the victims' families to have the Memorial completed by the 10-year anniversary, it was decided to concentrate on building the Memorial and holding off construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Transportation</b> Hub, which increased costs. Construction finally began on the Transportation Hub in 2010. The hub formally opened on March 3, 2016, several years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.|$|E
