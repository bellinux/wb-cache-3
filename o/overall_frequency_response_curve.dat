40|$|An {{expression}} for the output voltage for periodic saturation pulse recording is derived via the Reciprocity Principle {{and is based}} on superposition of isolated magnetisation transitions described by the function arctan (x/a) where a is a transition length parameter; this function having been found, for thin recording surfaces, to be close to the actual recorded distributions as determined both analytically and computationally for recording surfaces having a variety of hysteresis characteristics. The same function is used to describe the transition in thicker recording surfaces and provision is made for finding the replay signal from magnetisation components both parallel and perpendicular to the recording surface. Values for the transition parameter are obtained from measurements on the spectrum of a periodic waveform since the usual methods for measuring this quantity - from the width of the replayed isolated pulse - are not valid for the thicker recording surfaces used here. Attempts to compare the performance of the theoretical model with actual measured waveforms for a finite train of transitions are hampered by a lack of knowledge of the actual depth of recording (or any independent means of assessing this quantity) and of the magnitude of y-components of magnetisation and by an increasing spread in calculated values of the transition parameter from the spectrum of the isolated pulse, particularly for higher recording currents and for tapes whose recorded magnetisation levels change {{as a result of the}} replay process. Using averaged values for the transition width parameter, unknown quantities are inferred by comparison of computed and measured waveforms and, although this process can give only approximate results, qualitative conclusions can be drawn about the effect of y-components of magnetisation on the output wavetrain. By Fourier analysis, the model derived in this study for pulse recording is related to more general analyses for sinusoidal recording and from this, reasons for the spread in calculated values for the transition parameter are suggested. The Fourier expansion of the output voltage is used to try to elucidate the mechanism of high density recording, the reasons why output voltages may differ from those given by superposition and the way in which record current and y-components of magnetisation can affect the validity of superposition. The possibility of shaping the <b>overall</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> <b>curve</b> for a particular head-tape combination using y-components of magnetisation and of doubling output voltages at the cost of some distortion of the replay voltage waveforms is worth further investigation. These are opportunities not afforded by thinner recording surfaces.

40|$|A digitalized audio {{recording}} adapter utilizing adaptive delta modulator for A/D conversion was trially manufactured. This report describes {{the design of}} its playback part and estimated overall record-playback characteristics. The digital code reproduced from recording VTR includes 150 serial data bits for each horizontal scanning period.

The Research Background The safety of transform is the necessary condition for power system operation. As the increasing of power system capacity,the short-circuit current will be bigger than before. Therefore, transformer will take more risk of winding deformation [1]. The transformer whose winding is deformed would cause an accident for power system.
