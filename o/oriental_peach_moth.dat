Males (33 %) could copulate immediately after a previous copula. They were fertile until the fourth mating, but only in the first copula they transferred the longest (1. 43 ± 0. 10 mm) and widest (0. 83 ± 0. 11 mm) spermatophore, presenting the fastest mating duration (34. 8 ± 2. 62 min). A high proportion of females copulated by non-virgin males (84 %) was receptive to other copulas, in comparison to those copulated by virgin males (32. 4 %). However, the fecundity, fertility, and longevity were similar among females that copulate once or more. The age was the most important factor affecting reproductive variables, where one and three day old insects had a significant higher fecundity, fertility and presented a shorter mating duration in comparison with older individuals.

40|$|The {{codling moth}} (Cydia pomonella,L.) {{is the most}} serious pest of pears in the Goulburn Valley {{irrigation}} area. In the Shepparton, Kyabram, and Ardmona districts, there are approximately 3500 acres of Williams Pon Chretien pears grown principally for canning purposes. For some years past, the losses of pears due to the codling moth have been considerable. In 1936 it was estimated, by executives of the Northern Victoria Fruitgrowers' Association, that codling moth losses accounted for as much as 20 % of the total pear crop from the area, that is, a loss of at least � 20, 000 per annum was being experienced by the industry. No investigation of the codling moth had ever been conducted in the Goulburn Valley; and, although a considerable amount of research had been done elsewhere on the control of the pest in apples, little information was available on combatting the codling moth in pears. Ward (1936) conducted a survey of the pear-growing districts of the Goulburn Valley and found that there was a complete lack of uniformity among growers as to the control measures being used against the codling moth. Having no precise information on the seasonal activity of the pest, growers were not In a position to apply their sprays at the correct time, nor was there an efficient spray schedule in general use. In response to a request from the Northern Victoria Fruitgrowers' Association, and with funds made available from a Commonwealth grant for research and advisory work in relation to the apple and pear industry, an investigation of the problem of codling moth in 'NEC pears was commenced in 1936 by the Victorian Department of Agriculture.

O sucesso reprodutivo da mariposa-oriental foi avaliado em quatro bioensaios: 1) avaliação do tempo de cópula, fecundidade, fertilidade e longevidade de fêmeas pareadas com machos virgens e imediatamente acasalados; 2) tempo de cópula, tamanho do espermatóforo, fecundidade, fertilidade e longevidade em fêmeas pareadas com machos virgens e acasalados até quatro vezes; 3) receptividade de fêmeas a cópulas adicionais após o acasalamento com machos virgens ou acasalados, e o efeito deste comportamento na fecundidade, fertilidade e longevidade das fêmeas; 4) influência da idade dos insetos no sucesso reprodutivo. Machos (33 %) foram capazes de copular logo após o primeiro acasalamento.

40|$|Suitability {{of plant}} tissues as food for insects varies from plant to plant. In {{lepidopteran}} insects, fitness is largely {{dependent on the}} host-finding ability of the females. Existing {{studies have suggested that}} polyphagous lepidopterans preferentially select certain host plant species for oviposition. However, the mechanisms for host recognition and selection have not been fully elucidated. For the polyphagous yellow <b>peach</b> <b>moth</b> Conogethes punctiferalis, we explored the effect of chestnut cultivar on the performance and fitness and addressed the mechanisms of plant-volatile-mediated host recognition. By carrying out laboratory experiments and field investigation on four chestnut Castanea mollissima cultivars (Huaihuang, Huaijiu, Yanhong, and Shisheng), we found that C. punctiferalis females preferentially select Huaijiu for oviposition and infestation, and caterpillars fed on Huaijiu achieved slightly greater fitness than those fed on the other three chestnut cultivars, indicating that Huaijiu was a better suitable host for C. punctiferalis. Plant volatiles played important roles in host recognition by C. punctiferalis. All seven chestnut volatile compounds, α-pinene, camphene, β-thujene, β-pinene, eucalyptol, 3 -carene, and nonanal, could trigger EAG responses in C. punctiferalis. The ubiquitous plant terpenoids, α-pinene, camphene and β-pinene, and their specific combination at concentrations and proportions similar to the emissions from the four chestnut cultivars, was sufficient to elicit host recognition behavior of female C. punctiferalis. Nonanal and a mixture containing nonanal, that mimicked the emission of C. punctiferalis infested chestnut fruits, caused avoidance response. The outcome demonstrates the effects of chestnut cultivars on the performance of C. punctiferalis and reveals the preference-performance relationship between C. punctiferalis adults and their offspring. The observed olfactory plasticity in the plant-volatile-mediated host recognition may be important for the forming of the relationship between yellow <b>peach</b> <b>moth</b> and chestnuts since it allows the polyphagous herbivores to adjust to variation in volatile emission from their host plants...|$|R

40|$|The yellow <b>peach</b> <b>moth</b> (YPM), Conogethes punctiferalis (Guenée), is a {{multivoltine}} {{insect pest}} of crops and fruits.

However, few olfactory related genes were reported in YPM until now. In the present study, we sequenced and characterized the antennal transcriptomes {{of male and female}} YPM. In total, 15 putative odorant binding proteins (OBPs), 46 putative odorant receptors (ORs) and 7 putative ionotropic receptors (IRs) were annotated and identified as olfactory-related genes of C. punctiferalis. Further analysis of RT-qPCR revealed that all these olfactory genes are primarily or uniquely expressed in male and female antennae. Among which, 3 OBPs (OBP 4, OBP 8 and PBP 2) and 4 ORs (OR 22, OR 26, OR 44 and OR 46) were specially expressed in male antennae, whereas 4 ORs (OR 5, OR 16, OR 25 and OR 42) were primarily expressed in female antennae.

The main components of the first fraction were (Z) - 9 -tricosene, (Z) - 9 -pentacosene, (Z) - 9 -heptacosene, (Z) - 9 -nonacosene and (Z) - 9 -hentriacontene.

Significant expression variability has been reported among peach cultivars at both transcript and protein level. In this study, the allele diversity of the LTP 1 -encoding gene was assessed in a large set of peach cultivars by direct sequencing of the gene and its upstream region. Evolution of the LTP 1 -encoding genes in peach (Prunus persica) and three other Prunus species (Prunus kansuensis, Prunus mira, and Prunus davidiana) were also inferred. Sequence analysis revealed that LTP 1 -encoding genes are highly conserved among peach cultivars and wild peach. Three different allele sequences were obtained from 50 Prunus accessions {{on the basis of}} the upstream region of the LTP 1 -encoding gene and three allele specific markers were derived according to the polymorphic sites. These markers were used to test 316 peach cultivars, most of which clustered within the three main subpopulations of peach, 'Yu Lu', 'Hakuho' and landraces. The genotypic frequencies and allele frequencies in the <b>oriental</b> <b>peach</b> cultivars in these subpopulations except for 'Yu Lu' were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 0. 05). The dominant alleles were upLTP 1 -a in the 'Yu Lu' subpopulation and upLTP 1 -c in the 'Hakuho' subpopulation, allele upLTP 1 -b and allele upLTP 1 -c had the highest rates in the landraces, and the dominant allele in the three peach wild relatives was allele upLTP 1 -b. Furthermore, we found many light-responsive elements in the upstream region. Most of the polymorphic sites in Prunus species are located in the intron region. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Prunus kansuensis KC 311794 and Prunus mira KC 311791 are related more closely to Prunus persica KC 311795 than to Prunus davidiana KC 311792 and KC 311793.

The relative amounts and ratios of these hydrocarbons differed between sexes. In females, the ratios in body wax and pheromone gland extracts were similar, with lesser amounts found in gland extracts. Synergistic effects of these hydrocarbons when added to the known aldehyde pheromone components were assessed in wind tunnel tests. A blend of (E) - 10 -hexadecenal (E 10 - 16 : Ald) and (Z) - 10 -hexadecenal (Z 10 - 16 : Ald) elicited upwind flight and orientation of males to the pheromone source, but arriving males did not remain close to source for very long. Among the hydrocarbons identified, only Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 23 :HC enhanced the activity of the aldehyde blend by increasing the time spent close to the source and the number of source contacts. Z 3, Z 6, Z 9 - 23 :HC and (Z 9) -heptacosene (Z 9 - 27 :HC) also increased close-range responses to the aldehyde blend. The activity of the aldehyde blend plus these two hydrocarbons was similar to that of crude pheromone extract. Positive dose-response relationships between the aldehyde blend and two hydrocarbon mixtures were found.

40|$|Abstract Background Peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} model fruits in the Rosaceae family. Native to the west of China, where peach has been domesticated for more than 4, 000  years, its cultivation spread from China to Persia, Mediterranean countries and to America. Chinese peach has had a major impact on international peach breeding programs due to its high genetic diversity. In this research, we used 48 highly polymorphic SSRs, distributed over the peach genome, to investigate the difference in genetic diversity, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among Chinese cultivars, and North American and European cultivars, and the evolution of current peach cultivars. Results In total, 588 alleles were obtained with 48 SSRs on 653 peach accessions, giving an average of 12. 25 alleles per locus. In general, the average value of observed heterozygosity (0. 47) was lower than the expected heterozygosity (0. 60). The separate analysis of groups of accessions according to their origin or reproductive strategies showed greater variability in Oriental cultivars, mainly due to the high level of heterozygosity in Chinese landraces. Genetic distance analysis clustered the cultivars into two main groups: one included four wild related Prunus, and the other included most of the Oriental and Occidental landraces and breeding cultivars. STRUCTURE analysis assigned 469 accessions to three subpopulations: Oriental (234), Occidental (174), and Landraces (61). Nested STRUCTURE analysis divided the Oriental subpopulation into two different subpopulations: ‘Yu Lu’ and ‘Hakuho’. The Occidental breeding subpopulation was also subdivided into nectarine and peach subpopulations. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis in each of these subpopulations showed that the percentage of linked (r 2 [*]>[*] 0. 1) intra-chromosome comparisons ranged between 14 % and 47 %. LD decayed faster in Oriental (1, 196 Kbp) than in Occidental (2, 687 Kbp) samples. In the ‘Yu Lu’ subpopulation there was considerable LD extension while no variation of LD with physical distance was observed in the landraces. From the first STRUCTURE result, LG 1 had the greatest proportion of alleles in LD within all three subpopulations. Conclusions Our study demonstrates a high level of genetic diversity and relatively fast decay of LD in the <b>Oriental</b> <b>peach</b> breeding program. Inclusion of Chinese landraces will have a greater effect on increasing genetic diversity in Occidental breeding programs. Fingerprinting with genotype data for all 658 cultivars will be used for accession management in different germplasms. A higher density of markers are needed for association mapping in Oriental germplasm due to the low extension of LD. Population structure and evaluation of LD provides valuable information for GWAS experiment design in peach.
