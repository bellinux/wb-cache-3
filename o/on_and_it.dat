5|$|In 2004, Tecmo began {{releasing}} low-priced episodic installments of Ninja Gaiden for AT and Verizon {{mobile phones}} on both BREW and Java platforms. The official English Tecmo Games mobile website advertised {{it for a}} future release along with a mobile version of Tecmo Bowl. They planned to release the entire game throughout 2004 {{in a series of}} four installments – similar to what Upstart Games did when they ported the NES version of Castlevania to mobile phones. The port featured the same visuals and soundtrack found on the NES version, and each installment was to consist of several levels of gameplay at a time. The first installment, titled Ninja Gaiden EpisodeI: Destiny, was released <b>on</b> , <b>and</b> <b>it</b> included only the first Act from the NES version but added two new levels. The second installment was planned to be released in North America and was previewed by GameSpot in September 2004, but it – along with the third and fourth installments – was never released.|$|E
5|$|The ENIAC (1946) was {{the first}} machine that was both {{electronic}} and general purpose. It was Turing complete, with conditional branching, and programmable to solve {{a wide range of}} problems, but its program was held in the state of switches in patchcords, not in memory, and it could take several days to reprogram. Researchers such as Turing and Zuse investigated the idea of using the computer's memory to hold the program as well as the data it was working <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was mathematician John von Neumann who wrote a widely distributed paper describing that computer architecture, still used in almost all computers.|$|E
5|$|The {{substantial}} two storied station building, solidly build of stone, made {{an effective}} strong redoubt for the garrison, {{with the windows}} used by the defenders to fire their automatic rifles and throw their grenades from. At this time several white flags were reported at the station, but when the light horsemen approached they were fired <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was in this way {{that most of the}} light horsemen who died during the battle were killed. Once they succeeded in entering the station buildings, hand-to-hand fighting from room-to-room with rifles, bayonets, and swords, followed. Other groups of defenders deployed in the locomotives, tenders and carriages standing in the railway sidings, were also attacked.|$|E

25|$|In the replay at St Mary's Stadium, Southampton beat Norwich City by {{a single}} late goal {{to advance to the}} fourth round of the FA Cup. The game {{featured}} very few chances for either side until late in the game, with Norwich having no shots on target and only three shots overall in the full 90 minutes, with the hosts enjoying the majority of possession. Shane Long, James Ward-Prowse and Nathan Redmond came close to breaking the deadlock later <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was Long who on his 100th appearance for the club eventually scored the only goal of the game in stoppage time, when he bundled in a cross from winger Sam McQueen after his header was saved by Michael McGovern.|$|E

25|$|Brevik was {{the furthest}} along the South Coast that the railway reached {{at the time}} it opened, and {{remained}} in that position until the opening of the Kragerø Line in 1927. In that period the station acted as a transfer station between the train and steamships for the fastest transport along the coast. The ferry service, Brevikruta, commenced in 1896, and continued until 1934, although it struggled for the last seven years. Plans for a railway ferry service to Continental Europe were launched in 1912. By 1915 Frederikshavn had been settled <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was argued that it would provide fastest service from Norway to Hamburg, Germany. Two ferries would be required, each using seven hours on a crossing and allowing for two return services per day. However the plans were never carried through.|$|E
25|$|After another break, Southampton {{travelled}} to face fellow strugglers Newcastle United on 24 February. The game started {{well for}} the Saints, as Morgan Schneiderlin opened the scoring within three minutes with a half volley into the bottom corner from a Rickie Lambert cross knockdown. The hosts quickly increased the pace of their play though, and after several chances they scored {{half an hour later}} when Moussa Sissoko converted a saved Yoan Gouffran chance to equalise. Just before half time they made it two, as Papiss Cissé scored a long range goal to put Newcastle 2–1 up going into the break. Southampton came out dominating in the second period, with Lambert picking up his 100th goal for the club when he turned in an Adam Lallana cross from the right wing. Danny Fox and Gastón Ramírez came on for Luke Shaw and Steven Davis later <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was the defender who gave away a penalty for handball which was converted by Yohan Cabaye in the 67th minute. The Saints attempted {{to get back into the}} match, but the result was confirmed when an attempted clearance by Fox went into his own net off Jos Hooiveld, meaning the team dropped from 15th to 16th in the table.|$|E

The act had long been referred to as a [...] "crime" [...] without the exact phrase being used; in one 1889 speech, Nevada Senator William M. Stewart called it a [...] "crime" [...] seven times.

[...] When the pub closed, the group moved on to SEX, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon. Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: ...|$|E

500|$|The Beatles reconvened at EMI Studios on 21 October {{to conduct}} three {{additional}} takes, including the master. The group experimented with the arrangements, {{with the second}} take introducing a double-tracked sitar opening that complemented Lennon's acoustic melody. Though the group completely reshaped [...] "Norwegian Wood", {{it was far from}} the album version. Harrison's sitar playing is still at the forefront, alongside heavy drumbeats. The take was not considered suitable for overdubbing, so the band scrapped it, and re-evaluated the arrangement. By the third take, the song was called [...] "Norwegian Wood", and the group changed the key from D major, to E major. The Beatles skipped the rhythm section on this take, and decided to jump directly to the master take. In all, the rhythm section accommodates the acoustics, and the band thought the musical style was an improvement over earlier run-throughs. Therefore, the sitar is an accompaniment, consequently affecting the droning sound evident in past takes. Looking back on the recording sessions in the 1990s, Harrison explained his inclusion of the sitar to be [...] "quite spontaneous from what I remember", adding, [...] "We miked it up and put it <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> just seemed to hit the spot".|$|E
500|$|Like God of War, {{the game}} uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine. Senior combat {{designer}} Derek Daniels {{said that for}} God of War II, they were basing the magical attacks on elements (e.g., air and earth). He said the combat system was updated so that it flowed smoothly between attacks and switching between weapons and magic. He {{said that they were}} working for a similar balance of puzzle solving, exploration, and combat seen in the first game, and they used elements that worked in that game as a base for the overall balance. Unlike God of War where magic had a small role, Daniels said that for God of War II, their goal was to make magic {{an integral part of the}} combat system and to make it more refined. Barlog said the game would feature new creatures and heroes from the mythology, and he wanted to put more boss battles in it. Commenting on multiplayer options, Barlog said that [...] "there are possibilities for that but it is not something we are doing right now." [...] He said that he felt that God of War is a single-player experience, and although multiplayer [...] "would be cool," [...] it did not appeal to him to work on. As for a PlayStation Portable (PSP) installment, he said that he thought it [...] "would be freaking awesome," [...] but not something he had time to work <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was Sony's decision whether or not to make a PSP installment.|$|E
