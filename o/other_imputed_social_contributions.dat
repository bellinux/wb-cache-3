40|$|Recently, {{competition}} among universities {{has a whole}} new face, and emphasis is given toward interdependence and interactive evolution between universities and regions. From this social perspective, universities should contribute to regional development by serving the regional society using results of intellectual work, and {{it is necessary for}} universities to accomplish <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> and regional cooperation strategically. One of the most important parts in strategic planning is that students participate in activities for <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> and regional cooperation. This paper presents a survey of the university students’ awareness on <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> and regional cooperation using several statistical methods and attempts to find factors which affect activities for <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> and regional cooperation using logistic regression analysis...|$|R

30|$|Public {{economics}} literature highlights two alternative {{definitions of}} the nature of <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> On the one hand, they can represent a deferred salary if the link between <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and <b>social</b> benefits (pensions and unemployment benefits) is high. This is the case of pension systems with defined contributions. On the other hand, they might be considered a regular payroll tax (such as the labour income tax), if the tax-benefit link is weak, {{as is the case in}} many defined-benefit pay-as-you-go pension systems. In this paper we opt for an intermediate position, so <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> would be treated as a particular labour tax whose revenues are partially affected by social security financing. Therefore, we will concentrate on the labour market dynamics to analyse the incidence of <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and, in general, of labour taxes.|$|R
40|$|Public social {{protection}} can be funded through either <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> or general taxation. Does this matter for employment? Yes, {{for a number}} of reasons. First, <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> tend to weigh on labour costs and thus may affect employment – unless workers are prepared to accept lower net wages to compensate for <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> Other funding bases like income taxes and value-added taxes may also raise labour costs, but because they are typically levied on broader population groups – and not just wage earners – they may be less detrimental to employment than <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> The chapter also considers the specific cases of switching to taxes on capital, including real estate, and activities detrimental to environment. Second, the “progressivity ” of the funding system also matters. Adverse employment effects can be alleviated by taxing less low-paid employment than high-paid employment. Third, strengthening the link between <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> and pension entitlements and introducing experience-rating for certain social schemes like sickness benefits may be helpful. 157 4.

Also, <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> represent a significant budgetary revenue item which can be viewed at the edge between taxation and insurance. <b>Social</b> <b>contributions</b> in Romania experienced many changes which ended in 2008. Nowadays, they are within a long transaction period towards partial externalization of the insurance activity to privately managed funds. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyse the homogeneity of Romanian social security public scheme using annual data extracted from 2002 - 2009. The main findings reveal that <b>social</b> <b>contributions</b> reached the pinnacle of diversification, being too many, some of them with a small contribution rates; fiscal reforms which reduced contribution rates advantaged employers, and state will be interested to externalize this activity as far private sector will be able to assume this responsibility and the budgetary effects are acceptable for the public finance...|$|R

50|$|In this context, the {{structure}} of the funding of the social security administrations has been more and more assured by taxes rather than <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> In particular, new taxes were levied to help fund the social security administrations, such as the general <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> (CSG) and the contribution for the repayment of the social debt (CRDS). More recently, the central government has helped to fund the social security administrations by the revenues from the excise on alcohol and tobacco, in part to offset reductions in <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> As for the growth of the revenues for the benefit of local administrations, it is only due to the devolution, begun with the 1992 laws, and continued with the reforms in 2003.|$|R

This {{study focused on}} Korean national fashion businesses and identified various types of CSR practices in addition to <b>social</b> <b>contributions.</b> Besides, comparison in corporation by size {{of the number of}} full-time employees and sales volume were examined. A total of 1054 cases of 147 brands, 86 corporations between 2000 and 2012 were collected from internet articles and brand home pages. Findings were as follows. First, the types of CSR activities were categorized into the following six: economic responsibility, legal responsibility, consumer protection, protection of worker's right, protection of environment, and <b>social</b> <b>contribution.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>contribution</b> took largest portion of CSR activities (67. 7 %), followed by environmental protection (14 %), and protection of worker's right (6. 2 %). The other three types presented limited cases but included negative aspects of CSR. <b>Social</b> <b>contribution</b> consisted of six sub categories (culture & art, sports, education, donation, voluntary service, and campaign), and donation took the largest part of <b>social</b> <b>contribution</b> area. Second, comparing 86 corporations {{by the size of the}} number of full-time employees, companies more than 300 employees (38. 1 %) were more likely to practice CSR activities. Similarly, companies with more than 500 billion won sales (13. 1 %) were more active in their CSR activities than their counterparts. Suggestion...|$|R
