40|$|The {{last years}} of {{research}} on numerical development have provided evidence that spatial-numerical associations (SNA) can be formed independent of formal school training. However, most of these studies used various experimental paradigms that referred to slightly different aspects of number and space processing. This poses {{a question of whether}} all SNAs described in the developmental literature can be interpreted as a unitary construct, or whether they are rather examples of different, but related phenomena. Our review aims to provide a starting point for a systematic classification of SNA measures used from infancy to late preschool years, and their underlying representations. We propose to distinguish among four basic SNA categories: (i) cross-dimensional magnitude processing, (ii) associations between spatial and numerical intervals, (iii) associations between cardinalities and spatial directions, (iv) associations between <b>ordinalities</b> and spatial directions. Such systematization allows for identifying similarities and differences between processes and representations that underlie the described measures, and also for assessing the adequacy of using different SNA tasks at different developmental stages...|$|R

5000|$|Like {{the mutual}} information, the {{category}} utility is not sensitive to any ordering in the feature or category variable values.

In this usage, the <b>ordinality</b> of the approximation is not exact, but is used to emphasize its insignificance; the higher the number used, the less important the effect. The terminology, in this context, represents a high level of precision required to account for an effect which is inferred to be very small when compared to the overall subject matter. The higher the order, the more precision is required to measure the effect, and therefore the smallness of the effect in comparison to the overall measurement.|$|E

Cardinal utility allows the relative magnitude of utilities to be discussed, while ordinal utility only implies that goods can be compared and ranked according to which good provided the most utility. Although Jevons predated the debate about <b>ordinality</b> or cardinality of utility, his mathematics required the use of cardinal utility functions. For example, in [...] "The Theory of Political Economy", Chapter II, the subsection on [...] "Theory of Dimensions of Economic Quantities", Jevons makes the statement that [...] "In the first place, pleasure and pain must be regarded as measured upon the same scale, and as having, therefore, the same dimensions, being quantities of the same kind, which can be added and subtracted...."

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{numerical}} cognition, <b>ordinality,</b> the sequence of numerals, has received less attention than cardinality, {{the number of items}} in a set. Therefore it is unclear whether numerical effects generated from <b>ordinality</b> and cardinality tasks are associated, and whether they relate to math achievement and more domain-general variables in similar ways. To address these questions, sixty adults completed <b>ordinality,</b> cardinality, visual-spatial working memory, inhibitory control and math achievement tasks. The numerical distance effect from the cardinality task and reverse distance effect from the <b>ordinality</b> task were reliable but not associated with one another. Additionally, both distance effects predicted independent unique variance in math scores, even when visual-spatial working memory and inhibitory control were included in the regression model. These findings provide support for dissociation in the mechanisms underlying cardinal and ordinal processing of number symbols and thereby highlight the critical role played by <b>ordinality</b> in symbolic numerical cognition...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to quantity processing, up to date, {{the nature of}} <b>ordinality</b> has received little attention from researchers {{despite the fact that}} both quantity and <b>ordinality</b> are embodied in numerical information. Here we ask if there are two separate core systems that lie at the foundations of numerical cognition: (1) the traditionally and well accepted numerical magnitude system but also (2) core system for representing ordinal information. We report two novel experiments of ordinal processing that explored the relation between ordinal and numerical information processing in typically developing adults and adults with developmental dyscalculia (DD). Participants made "ordered" or "non-ordered" judgments about 3 groups of dots (non-symbolic numerical stimuli; in Experiment 1) and 3 numbers (symbolic task: Experiment 2). In {{contrast to}} previous findings and arguments about quantity deficit in DD participants, when quantity and <b>ordinality</b> are dissociated (as in the current tasks), DD participants exhibited a normal ratio effect in the non-symbolic ordinal task. They did not show, however, the <b>ordinality</b> effect. <b>Ordinality</b> effect in DD appeared only when area and density were randomized, but only in the descending direction. In the symbolic task, the <b>ordinality</b> effect was modulated by ratio and direction in both groups. These findings suggest that there might be two separate cognitive representations of ordinal and quantity information and that linguistic knowledge may facilitate estimation of ordinal information...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Data with multi-valued {{categorical}} attributes {{can cause}} major problems for decision trees. The high branching factor {{can lead to}} data fragmentation, where decisions {{have little or no}} statistical support. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble method, Random <b>Ordinality</b> Ensembles (ROE), that circumvents this problem, and provides significantly improved accuracies over other popular ensemble methods. We perform a random projection of the categorical data into a continuous space by imposing random <b>ordinality</b> on categorical attribute values. A decision tree that learns on this new continuous space is able to use binary splits, hence avoiding the data fragmentation problem. A majority-vote ensemble is then constructed with several trees, each learnt from a different continuous space. An empirical evaluation on 13 datasets shows this simple method to significantly outperform standard techniques such as Boosting and Random Forests. Theoretical study using an information gain framework is carried out to explain RO performance. Study shows that ROE is quite robust to data fragmentation problem and Random <b>Ordinality</b> (RO) trees are significantly smaller than trees generated using multi-way split...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>Ordinality</b> takes origin from the {{formalization}} process of Emergy Algebra under dynamic {{conditions and the}} subsequent mathematical formulation of the Maximum Em-Power Principle (2001). Such a new concept enabled us to reinterpret the traditional concept of Externality (in Economics) as an “excess” of Quality (Giannantoni 2007, Giannantoni & Zoli, 2008), that is an “extra” Benefit of superior <b>Ordinality,</b> never ever reducible to the sole action of one subject {{or the other of}} the transaction, or to their “sum”. Such a new concept can be thus referred to as Ordinal Externality. An appropriate evaluation method, termed as Four-Sector Diagram of Benefits, was developed to account for Ordinal Externalities generated by the interaction of the four main Sectors usually involved in any productive process: Firm, Society, the Environment as a Source and the Environment as a Sink. The advantages of a Decision Making Process based on Ordinal Benefits (with respect to traditional economic benefits) has already been shown, under steady state conditions, with reference to the evaluation of well-calibrated Incentives concerning both Hydrogen Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Fuel Cell Buses (ib.), for electricity supply and public transportation respectively. The same case studies will now be reconsidered in order to show that, {{on the basis of the}} Ordinal Maximization Principle, the optimum economic conditions (usually assumed as being corresponding to Pareto’s General Equilibrium) can directly be obtained as an adherent reflex of the maximum level of <b>Ordinality</b> achieved by the System. Consequently, the Ordinal Maximization Principle represents a valid reference guide for a Policy Maker precisely because, being preferentially based on the external Benefits to be “remunerated” rather than on possible damages to be internalized, it is always orientated toward the genesis of the Maximum <b>Ordinality</b> Excess...|$|E

Following Cubitt (1996), these principles include dynamic consistency, separability, and reduction of sequential choice, which can be derived in turn from one consequentialist hypothesis applied to continuation subtrees as well as entire decision trees. Examples of behavior violating these principles are also reviewed, as are possible explanations of why such violations are often observed in experiments...|$|E
