25|$|The {{origin of}} the dynasty is uncertain, but {{according}} to the Puranas, their first king overthrew the Kanva dynasty. In the post-Maurya era, the Satavahanas established peace in the Deccan region, and resisted the onslaught of foreign invaders. In particular their struggles with the Saka Western Satraps went <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> The dynasty reached its zenith under the rule of Gautamiputra Satakarni and his successor Vasisthiputra Pulamavi. The kingdom fragmented into smaller states by the early 3rd century CE.|$|E
25|$|The Śātavāhana Empire was a royal Indian dynasty based from Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh {{as well as}} Junnar (Pune) and Prathisthan (Paithan) in Maharashtra. The {{territory}} of the empire covered large parts of India from the 1st century BCE onward. The Sātavāhanas started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty, but declared independence with its decline. They {{are known for their}} patronage of Hinduism and Buddhism which resulted in Buddhist monuments from Ellora (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) to Amaravati. The Sātavāhanas were one of the first Indian states to issue coins struck with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India. They had to compete with the Shunga Empire and then the Kanva dynasty of Magadha to establish their rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect a huge part of India against foreign invaders like the Sakas, Yavanas and Pahlavas. In particular, their struggles with the Western Kshatrapas went <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty Gautamiputra Satakarni and Sri Yajna Sātakarni were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the Western Kshatrapas and to stop their expansion. In the 3rd century CE the empire was split into smaller states.|$|E

Morgan escorted Holliday {{out onto the street}} and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing. Ike and Wyatt talked again a few minutes later, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning.

Ike told Earp, [...] "I will be ready for you in the morning." [...] Wyatt Earp walked over to the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him.

500|$|At {{some point}} in his travels, Themistocles's wife and {{children}} were extricated from Athens by a friend, and joined him in exile. His friends also managed to send him many of his belongings, although up to 100 talents worth of his goods were confiscated by the Athenians. When, after a year, Themistocles returned to the king's court, {{he appears to have}} made an immediate impact, and [...] "he attained...very high consideration there, such as no Hellene has ever possessed before or since". Plutarch recounts that [...] "honors he enjoyed were far beyond those paid to other foreigners; nay, he actually took part in the King's hunts and in his household diversions". Themistocles advised the king on his dealings with the Greeks, although it seems that for a long period, the king was distracted by events elsewhere in the empire, and thus Themistocles [...] "lived <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> without concern". He was made governor of the district of Magnesia on the Maeander River in Asia Minor, and assigned the revenues of three cities: Magnesia (about 50 talents per year—"for bread"); Myus ("for opson"); and Lampsacus ("for wine"). Neanthes of Cyzicus and Phanias add two more, the city of Palaescepsis ("for clothes") and the city of Percote with bedding and furniture for his house.|$|E

The Complete X-Files noted that many fans were [...] "ecstatic" [...] about Mulder and Scully's [...] "long-awaited" [...] kiss. David Blar from DVD Talk called the episode [...] "shocking" [...] because of Mulder and Scully's kiss, asking, [...] "why they didn't lock lips sooner"? Paula Vitaris {{noted that the}} kiss [...] "seems stuck on to the episode by a tack in its {{complete}} irrelevance to the storyline or Mulder and Scully in general." [...] Allan Johnson from the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "in a way, it's too bad Sunday's episode of Fox's The X-Files is getting more attention for what happens near the end than it does for its plot." [...] Kessenich praised the way the show worked in Mulder and Scully's kiss, noting that its lack of a [...] "steamy, rip your clothes off" [...] atmosphere made the sequence work [...] "so well". Handlen wrote that the scene, coupled with Black getting his daughter back, was [...] "the only scene which comes close to justifying the episode’s existence". Furthermore, he enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the kiss, noting {{that it could be}} [...] "just a one time thing, or maybe it’s the start of something, or maybe it’s just a continuation of something that’s been going <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> now, right under our noses." ...|$|E
500|$|Developing the {{gameplay}} {{began at}} the start of development, with a test environment being built to develop and refine the basics of the battle system. Work within the test build spanned approximately one and a half years. While creating the battle system, the staff decided that the key words should be [...] "order" [...] and [...] "chaos": whoever gained order on the battlefield would be the victor. One of the concepts that emerged from this was Gathering, Zael's ability to direct all enemies' attention towards him. At first, Gathering ended up generating an unwanted amount of chaos on the battlefield, and this resulted in the trial-and-error period for it running <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> The biggest challenge, once the concept had been finalized, was adjusting its effectiveness on the battlefield depending on the situation and enemy types. A concept that did not make it into the final game was [...] "Replay": after an enemy successfully cast a spell, players could rewatch the last few seconds of battle from an overhead view to see what type it was and take that into their strategy. This slowed the pace of combat down too much, so the concept was entirely removed. Hangovers of it include the ability to freeze time during certain actions, and the overhead perspective when commanding party members The cover system was designed around the limitations of the camera control born from the Wii Remote's control scheme.|$|E

Actor Stephen Barker Turner and actress Keira Naughton guest starred in the episode as Tom and Jennifer Parker. Stink Fisher appeared as Jason Peterson and Slaine starred as Kevin Roban, a drug dealer. Slaine said of his role in the episode, [...] "As a lot of people know I have branched out from hip-hop to acting and this will be my first venture into network television. I’m really looking forward to working on this, as it’s a great show with a fantastic cast". This episode marked the first appearance of Cliff Curtis, who plays Special Agent Derek Ames, a love interest for Megan Hunt (Delany). Curtis was reported to have a role in Body of Proof in November 2010. Curtis was originally meant to be appearing {{towards the end of the}} season. Delany said, [...] "We do have a very dashing FBI agent coming on for the end of the season, played by Cliff Curtis. [...] an old friend, so I wanted him for the role". Afterwards, Curtis appears in one more episode; [...] "Hard Knocks". [...] "Missing" [...] marked the first appearance of Joanna Cassidy since the first season. Cassidy, who plays Joan Hunt has appeared in season one episodes, [...] "Society Hill" [...] and [...] "Buried Secrets".

50|$|Feline {{cystitis}} blocks a cat’s urinary tract. This blockage can {{be from a}} {{bladder stone}} or a buildup of crystals, which are bacterial build up {{in the form of}} sand. These crystals lead to an obstruction causing stagnant urine to evolve in their bodies. The urine will eventually build up to a point where it can harm the kidneys. If the buildup goes <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of time the cat’s kidneys may fail. Stagnant urine will also create <b>a</b> perfect atmosphere <b>for</b> bacteria to build up even faster. The main reason as to why feline cystitis is more dangerous in male cats is because their urethra is much narrower than females. Therefore, when a buildup occurs in their system, time is not on their side. Females do not commonly experience a complete obstruction due to their wide urethra.|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} 1, 4 -dihydro- 1 -pyridylzinc and -magnesium complexes are described.

Evaporation of the solvent after 1 – 2 hours at 0 °C yielded a product containing pyridine, a 1, 4 -dihydropyridyl moiety and zinc hydrogen bonds, and two alternative structures are proposed for this complex. When the reaction was carried <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period, <b>a</b> yellow precipitate began to separate after about 40 hours, and reaction was complete after 7 days.

2500|$|Pet usage is {{the primary}} market for trapped painted turtles {{although}} a small number are sent to turtle races. Commercial trapping is modest economically, with double digits of trappers, selling a few thousand turtles yearly, at $1–2 per turtle. Individual harvesters who trap painted turtles typically do so for extra money and alternate between fishing and turtle trapping based on the markets. Many have been traditionally involved in the trade: Ben Hedstrom of Minnesota said, [...] "We've sold turtles for 50 years. My dad did it since the 1920s."

While in most cases the bug eventually occurs, the use of extensive measures within player controlled countries- such as explosive population growth manipulation, severe limiting of human development and minimal infrastructures and telecommunications development- can maintain a permanent, large, and increasing resource deficit, which results in permanent importing for the player country, and massive export growth for virtually all other countries. With extreme population manipulation through the building and canceling of large numbers of soldiers while paused, it is possible to sustain a pan-global computer nation export economy with one underdeveloped, vastly overpopulated nation.|$|R
