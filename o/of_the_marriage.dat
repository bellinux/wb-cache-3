5|$|Around late 1224 {{or early}} 1225, Alice married Bohemond, eldest son of Bohemond IV, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli.

Philip had a son from a previous marriage and was heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World.

5|$|At one time, some dynasties adhered {{strictly}} {{to the concept}} of royal intermarriage. The Bernadottes, Habsburgs, Sicilian and Spanish Bourbons and Romanovs, among others, introduced house laws which governed dynastic marriages; it was considered important that dynasts marry social equals (i.e., other royalty), thereby ruling out even the highest-born non-royal nobles. Those dynasts who contracted undesirable marriages often did so morganatically. Generally, this is a marriage between a man of high birth and a woman of lesser status (such as a daughter of a low-ranked noble family or a commoner). Usually, neither the bride nor any children <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> has a claim on the bridegroom's succession rights, titles, precedence, or entailed property. The children are considered legitimate for all other purposes and the prohibition against bigamy applies.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> in George Eliot s novel Middlemarch. It uses {{narrative}} theory {{to explore the}} power balance and happiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> through <b>the</b> portrayal by the narrator. The thesis proves {{that there is a}} struggle for power in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marriages,</b> and that <b>the</b> representation <b>of</b> these struggles follows a clear pattern: where the power balance appears to be set, <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> are portrayed as happy and successful, and where the power balance is not set, <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> are portrayed as unhappy and unsuccessful The factors used are economic, emotional and intellectual power, and here the historical context has been considered. <b>The</b> theme <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> has seldom been studied, and never in this particular manner, including all <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> that are portrayed in the novel. Through this study it becomes evident that <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> is important in the novel, and that many characters have been misunderstood in the past...|$|R

On the couple's third appearance before the bishop in his episcopal court on 9May 1166, Countess Agnes appealed to the pope to affirm the validity of her marriage. Foliot enclosed her appeal in his own surviving letter setting out the salient features of the case. While the case was under papal consideration, Foliot reprimanded the earl for his treatment of his wife, reminding him that until the pope had ruled otherwise, Agnes was to be considered his wife in bed and board. When Pope Alexander III wrote to the bishop concerning the countess's maltreatment, and requiring Foliot to threaten the earl with excommunication, he also chastised the bishop for {{his handling of the}} case.|$|E
