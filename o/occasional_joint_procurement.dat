40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have made important progress, particularly during the past year, {{in their efforts to}} jointly procure drugs to help control spiraling prescription drug costs. Although their collaborative efforts have been impressive, the two agencies have largely targeted generic drugs, which comprise less than 10 percent of their combined expenditures. More dramatic cost reductions could be achieved through procurements of high-cost brand-name drugs, although doing so can be more complex and time consuming to garner the necessary clinical support and provider acceptance on therapeutic interchangeability. Nonetheless, DOD's greatly expanded retiree drug benefit and the formularies being developed by both agencies should provide added <b>joint</b> <b>procurement</b> opportunities for such drugs. Also, VA and DOD have shown that flexible approaches to developing joint solicitations can take into account differences in their health systems while still maximizing drug discounts. In GAO's view, their joint activities could be further enhanced by periodically conferring with private managed care pharmacy experts and reporting to Congress on their <b>joint</b> <b>procurement</b> activities. Top management at DOD and VA need to stay focused on their <b>joint</b> <b>procurement</b> and distribution activities as leadership changes continue at the two agencies.

40|$|Purpose: This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{establish}} the mathematical programming model of the vendor selection for the <b>joint</b> <b>procurement</b> from a total cost of ownership perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Fuzzy genetic algorithm is employed to solve the model, and the data set of the ball bearings purchasing problem is illustrated as a numerical analysis. Findings: According to the results, {{it can be seen that}} the performance of the optimization model is pretty good and can reduce the total costs of the procurement. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, a literature review and classification of the published vendor selection models is shown in this paper. Second, a mathematical programming model of the vendor selection for the <b>joint</b> <b>procurement</b> from a total cost of ownership perspective is established. Third, an empirical study is displayed to illustrate the application of the proposed model to evaluate and identify the best vendors for ball bearing procurement, and the results show that it could reduce the total costs as much as twenty percent after the optimization. </p...|$|R

Specifically, import competition leads multi-product firms to drop peripheral products to refocus on core production. The weaker the linkages that a peripheral product shares with the core (as measured by the extent of <b>joint</b> sales, <b>joint</b> <b>procurement,</b> <b>joint</b> production, and joint sectorship), the more likely the peripheral product is to be divested in response to import competition. ...|$|R
