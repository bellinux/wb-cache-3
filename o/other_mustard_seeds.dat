40|$|Nowadays the <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> {{production}} {{represents only}} 3000 - 4000 hectares {{in the total}} agricultural area in Hungary. The crop area of <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> has been decreased continuously in for the past 10 years, and this tendency {{are not going to}} change in the future. The Hungarian <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> production has both organizational and economic problems, which may worsen the problems and the hard situation of this sector. In my researches, I demonstrated and analyzed the market connections of the <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> producing sector, the differences in the bargaining power of the market players and I make suggestions to solve the organizational problems of the <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> production. I made economic calculations on the <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> production data, to determine the cost and income data of <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> production in Hungary, per hectare.

40|$|A {{total number}} of 54 male growing New Zealand rabbits were used to study the effect of two {{different}} levels of ration protein supplemented with <b>Mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> (Sinapis alba Linn). Rabbits were classified into six equal groups (G 1 -G 6). The 1 st and 4 th groups received basal ration with 100 % and 90 % protein requirement and served as first and second control respectively. The 2 nd and the 3 rd groups received basal ration with 100 % protein requirement supplemented with Sinapisalba Linn {{at the level of}} 0. 5 and 1. 0 %, respectively. The 5 th and 6 th groups received basal ration with 90 % protein requirement with Sinapisalba Linn at the level of 0. 5 and 1. 0 %, respectively. The low level of protein (90 % of protein requirement containing diet) significantly increased (P 6) showed the best digestion coefficients of DM, OM, CP, EE and NFE and TDN value. However, the 100 % of protein requirement with 1 % <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> containing diet (G 3) showed the high value of DCP. Inclusion <b>Mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> at 1 % in rabbit diets significantly (P< 0. 05) increased all nutrient digestibility and nutritive values compared to control diet. Inclusion <b>Mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> at 0. 5 % significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the DM and EE digestibility and total digestible nutrient compared to control diet. The interaction between the protein and <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> levels significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the all nutrient digestibility coefficients (DM, OM, CP, CF, EE and NFE) and nutritive values (TDN and DCP). Inclusion <b>Mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> at 0. 5 % or 1 % significantly (P< 0. 05) improved the final or weight, total body weight gain, average daily gain and feed conversion compared to control diet. On the other hand inclusion of <b>Mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> at 1 % significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the total body weight gain and average daily gain by 24. 3 % while at 0. 5 % significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the total body weight gain and average daily gain by 14. 5 % compared to the control group. The 90 % of protein with 1 % <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> recorded the best values of final weight, total body weight gain, average daily gain and feed conversion. The interaction between the protein and <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> levels significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the final weight, weight gain, average daily gain and feed conversion. Inclusion <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> in rabbit diets clearly decreased the dressing percentages by increasing the level of <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> in rabbit diets. Dietary 90 % of protein requirements with 0. 5 % or 1 % <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> showed the higher value ofnet revenue, economical efficiency and relative economic efficiency, as well as the lower value of feed cost/ kg live body weight (LE). </p...|$|R

The results showed that <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> oil meal was an excellent protein feed when mixed with tankage and other protein supplements and self fed free choice. Generally the gains were somewhat cheaper than where tankage alone was fed, but the gains were not quite so rapid. In the tests reported last year the <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> meal made up as much as 50 percent of the protein mixtures, in some of the lots.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} mustard is in India from {{a story of}} Gautama Buddha in the fifth century BC.

The Buddha asks her to bring a handful of <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> from a family that has never lost a child, husband, parent, or friend. When the mother is unable to find such a house in her village, she realizes death is common to all, and she cannot be selfish in her grief. The Buddha stated that if an individual were to pick a single <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> every hundred years from a seven-mile cube worth of <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds,</b> then by the time the last seed is picked, the age of the world cycle would still continue. (If a <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> is 3 mm in diameter, then taking one seed every 100 years from a seven-mile cube of seeds, would take 936 quintillion years, 68 billion times the age of the universe.) ...|$|R
