5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Japanese would strike at Port Moresby again, the {{garrison}} was strengthened and MacArthur ordered {{the establishment of}} new bases at Merauke and Milne Bay to cover its flanks. The Battle of Midway in June 1942 led to consideration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal for {{an attack on the}} Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the Navy, which favored a less ambitious approach, and objected to an Army general being in command of what would be an amphibious operation. The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance. The first stage, the seizure of the Tulagi area, would be conducted by the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. The later stages would be under MacArthur's command.|$|E
5|$|In 1263 {{the dispute}} with the Scottish king over the Hebrides induced Haakon to {{undertake}} an expedition to the islands. Having learned in 1262 that Scottish nobles had raided the Hebrides and that Alexander III planned to conquer the islands, Haakon went on an expedition with his formidable leidang fleet of at least 120 ships in 1263, having become accustomed to negotiating backed by an intimidating fleet. The fleet left Bergen in July, and reached Shetland and Orkney in August where {{they were joined by}} chieftains from the Hebrides and Man. Negotiations were started by Alexander following Norwegian landings on the Scottish mainland, but were purposely prolonged by the Scots. Having waited until September/October for weather that caused trouble for Haakon's fleet, a clash occurred between a smaller Norwegian force and a Scottish division at the Battle of Largs. Although inconclusive and <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> impact, Haakon withdrew to Orkney for the winter. A delegation of Irish kings invited Haakon to help them rid Ireland of English settlers as High King of Ireland, but this was apparently rejected against Haakon's wish.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly in the context <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> voir dire.|$|E

5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem.

5|$|As a {{survival}} horror title, Resident Evil 2 features {{the same basic}} gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, Resident Evil. The player explores a fictional city while solving puzzles and fighting monsters. The game's two protagonists may be equipped with firearms, but limited ammunition adds a tactical element to weapon use. On the status screen, the player can check {{the condition of the}} protagonists, use medicine to heal their wounds, and assign weapons. The characters' current health can also be determined by their posture and movement speed. For example, a character will hold their stomach in pain if wounded, and will limp slowly if on the verge of death. The protagonists may carry a limited number of items, and must store others in boxes placed throughout the game world, where they may later be retrieved. Each protagonist is joined by a support partner {{during the course of the}} story. These characters accompany the player in certain scenes, and occasionally become playable. Certain rooms contain typewriters that the player may use to save the game. However, each save expends one <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> number of ink ribbons, which the player must collect in the game world. The graphics of Resident Evil 2 are composed of real-time generated– and thus movable– polygonal character and item models, superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds that are viewed from fixed camera angles.|$|E
5|$|J. E. Wright {{took over}} as {{secretary}} in 1911, and advocated the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> company to run a professional club, believing amateur football would not succeed in a rugby league stronghold. The club turned professional in 1912, and acquired a rough plot of land known as Field View. York were admitted to the Midland League in June 1912, and the new ground was opened with a 2–1 win over Rotherham Town, which was played before 5,000 spectators. They played in the Midland League for three seasons, achieving a highest finish of 10th of 20 teams in 1912–13, before ranking 12th in an 18-team league the following season. York were invited to a meeting to discuss {{the formation of a}} Third Division of the Football League, but with the outbreak of the First World War the meeting did not take place. Because of hostilities, the Midland League was suspended after 1914–15, in which York ranked 16th out of 20 teams. The club went into liquidation through the bankruptcy court in August 1917 after a creditor pressed for payment for the ground's stand. York's ground was taken over by the York Corporation, who leased it to allotment-holders.|$|E

5|$|The city of Kaunas {{is located}} at the {{confluence}} of two rivers, the Neman and Neris, which link Lithuania's interior and its capital, Vilnius, to the Baltic Sea. The Baltic peoples had created significant domains by the 1st century, and came into conflict with the Scandinavians and the Slavs; the Teutonic Order began targeting Lithuanian lands {{at the beginning of the}} 13th century. Since Lithuania was heavily wooded and its lands were often impassable, its interior was most approachable along its rivers when frozen and during the short dry harvest season in late summer. In response to this vulnerability, defensive structures, including a brick castle in Kaunas, were in place at various points on the Nemunas River by the 14th century. The city was first mentioned in written sources in 1361; it received Magdeburg rights, regulating its autonomy and establishing trade protocols, from Vytautas the Great in 1408. An outpost of the Hanseatic League was created there in 1441. By the end of the 16th century Kaunas had become a major regional trade center, but plagues, fires, and wars adversely affected the country and city during the 17th and 18th centuries. Following the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at the end of the 18th century, Lithuania was incorporated into the Russian Empire. Two major 19th century projects contributed to the city's revival. The Augustów Canal, completed in 1832, linked the Neman to the Black Sea, and a rail line linking Saint Petersburg, Warsaw, and Germany via Kaunas was completed in 1862; it was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> network of western Russian railways.|$|E
5|$|The last {{stage of}} rocky planet {{formation}} is the merger stage. It begins when {{only a small}} number of planetesimals remains and embryos become massive enough to perturb each other, which causes their orbits to become chaotic. During this stage embryos expel remaining planetesimals, and collide with each other. The result of this process, which lasts for 10 to 100million years, is the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> number of Earth sized bodies. Simulations show that the number of surviving planets is on average from 2 to 5. In the Solar System they may be represented by Earth and Venus. Formation of both planets required merging of approximately 10–20 embryos, while an equal number of them were thrown out of the Solar System. Some of the embryos, which originated in the asteroid belt, are thought to have brought water to Earth. Mars and Mercury may be regarded as remaining embryos that survived that rivalry. Rocky planets, which have managed to coalesce, settle eventually into more or less stable orbits, explaining why planetary systems are generally packed to the limit; or, in other words, why they always appear to be at the brink of instability.|$|E
5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere. These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> strength without those currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission. The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10–100TW. In addition, the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as Joule heating. This heating, which produces up to 300TW of power, {{is responsible for the}} strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter.|$|E
