5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume the Vice Presidency in 2009. He was a long-time member and former chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991, but advocated U.S. and NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in 1994 and 1995. He voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led the legislative efforts for creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Violence Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.|$|E
5|$|Grant was {{vigorous}} in his {{enforcement of}} the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. He proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws {{and the protection of}} African Americans more than any other 19th century president. He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan, reducing violence and intimidation in the South. He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation. Grant's relationship with Charles Sumner, the leader in promoting civil rights, was shattered by the Senator's opposition to Grant's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty. Grant retaliated, firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee. Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.|$|E
5|$|The most {{pressing}} foreign policy concerns when Grant took office were resolving the Alabama claims against Great Britain and whether to recognize Cuban belligerency. The {{dispute with the}} United Kingdom stemmed from a complex of grievances centering on attacks on American shipping during the Civil War by the , a Confederate warship constructed in England. Senator Charles Sumner, Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee, believed the British had violated American neutrality and demanded reparations. Sumner convinced his fellow Senators to reject the Johnson administration's proposed settlement, believing that Britain should directly pay $2 billion in gold or, alternatively, cede Canada to the United States. Fish and Boutwell convinced Grant that peaceful relations with Britain were more important than acquisition of territory, and the two nations agreed to negotiate along those lines. To avoid jeopardizing negotiations, Grant refrained from recognizing Cuban rebels who were fighting for independence from Spain, {{which would have been}} inconsistent with American objections to the British granting belligerent status to Confederates. A commission in Washington produced a treaty whereby an international tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, but not fault. The Senate approved the Treaty of Washington, which also settled disputes over fishing rights and maritime boundaries, by a 50–12 vote in 1871.|$|E

I'll be going back to the Senate as the chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee and I will continue to make the case I've been making..." [...] The end of this campaign marked the end of all presidential campaigns for Biden who stated that this run would be his last.|$|E
500|$|Senator Lodge died in November 1924, making Borah {{the senior}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee, {{and he took}} its {{chairman}}ship. [...] He could have become Judiciary Committee chairman instead, as the death of Frank Brandegee of Connecticut made Borah senior Republican on that committee as well. The Foreign Relations chairmanship greatly increased his influence, one quip was that the new Secretary of State, Frank B. Kellogg, created policy by ringing Borah's doorbell. Borah continued to oppose American interventions in Latin America, often splitting from the Republican majority over the matter. Borah was an avid horseback rider, and Coolidge {{is supposed to have}} commented after viewing him exercising in Rock Creek Park that it [...] "must bother the Senator to be going {{in the same direction as}} his horse." ...|$|E

500|$|The Democratic {{landslide}} {{that accompanied}} Roosevelt's election cost Borah his chairmanship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee, {{but much of}} his influence was independent of party. Borah liked Roosevelt for his liberalism and his energy. [...] Due to illness, Borah took only a limited role in Roosevelt's Hundred Days, though he did play a key part in the passage of Glass–Steagall in June 1933, helping forge a compromise that ended the opponents' filibuster. He opposed Roosevelt's calling in of gold, alleging {{that the government had}} no power to tell individuals what to do with their money. Borah opposed the National Recovery Act (NRA) and was gratified when it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1935. Borah's fifteen-year fight for the recognition of the USSR ended in 1933 when Roosevelt opened diplomatic relations.|$|E
500|$|Regarding foreign policy, {{during his}} first decade in the Senate, Biden focused on arms control issues. [...] In {{response}} to the refusal of the U.S. Congress to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, he took the initiative to meet the Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, educated him about American concerns and interests, and secured several changes to address objections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee. [...] When the Reagan administration wanted to interpret the 1972 SALT I Treaty loosely {{in order to allow}} the Strategic Defense Initiative to proceed, Biden argued for strict adherence to the treaty's terms. He clashed again with the Reagan administration in 1986 over economic sanctions against South Africa; he received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George P. Shultz at a Senate hearing because of the administration's support of that country, which continued to practice the apartheid system.|$|E
500|$|Biden chose veteran Democratic {{lawyer and}} aide Ron Klain {{to be his}} chief of staff, and Time Washington bureau chief Jay Carney to be his {{director}} of communications. [...] Biden intended to eliminate some of the explicit roles assumed by the vice presidency of his predecessor, Dick Cheney, who had established himself as an autonomous power center. Otherwise, Biden {{said he would not}} model his vice presidency on any of the ones before him, but instead would seek to provide advice and counsel on every critical decision Obama would make. [...] Biden said he had been closely involved in all the cabinet appointments that were made during the transition. [...] Biden was also named to head the new White House Task Force on Working Families, an initiative aimed at improving the economic well being of the middle class. [...] As his last act as Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee, Biden went on a trip to Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan during the second week of January 2009, meeting with the leadership of those countries.|$|E

500|$|In France, Schuman {{had gained}} strong {{political}} and intellectual support from all {{sections of the}} nation and many non-communist parties. Notable amongst these were ministerial colleague Andre Philip, president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Relations</b> Committee Edouard Bonnefous, and former prime minister, Paul Reynaud. Projects for a coal and steel authority and other supranational communities were formulated in specialist subcommittees of the Council of Europe in the period before it became French government policy. Charles de Gaulle, who was then out of power, had been an early supporter of [...] "linkages" [...] between economies, on French terms, and had spoken in 1945 of a [...] "European confederation" [...] that would exploit the resources of the Ruhr. However, he opposed the ECSC as a faux (false) pooling ("le pool, ce faux semblant") because he considered it an unsatisfactory [...] "piecemeal approach" [...] to European unity and because he considered the French government [...] "too weak" [...] to dominate the ECSC as he thought proper. De Gaulle also felt that the ECSC had insufficient supranational authority because the Assembly was not ratified by a European referendum and he did not accept Raymond Aron's contention that the ECSC was intended as a movement away from United States domination. Consequently, de Gaulle and his followers in the RPF voted against ratification in the lower house of the French Parliament.|$|E
