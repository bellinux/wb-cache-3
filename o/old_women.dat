5|$|Heavy rains caused {{landslides}} {{and flash}} flooding, which {{were responsible for}} extensive crop and property damage. Throughout the island of Shikoku, 14people were killed. In Mishima, two landslides claimed {{a total of four}} lives. Another landslide in Tsukude killed a 53-year old man, a 78-year <b>old</b> <b>women,</b> and a 14-year old girl. Hokkaido suffered the most severe flooding in 10years. Several major rivers on the island overflowed their banks, leaving towns inundated and isolated. Around 1,200residents in Tsukigata were evacuated after a nearby river overflowed its banks.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, another Hull House ghost story began circulating. According to this legend, after a man {{claimed that}} he would rather have the Devil in his house than a picture of The Virgin Mary, his child was born with pointed ears, horns, scale-covered skin, and a tail. The mother {{was said to have}} taken the baby to Hull House, where Addams was said to have {{attempted}} to have it baptized and wound up locking it in the attic. While initially annoyed about the story, which had no basis in fact, Addams became fascinated by the effect the episode had on <b>old</b> <b>women</b> in the neighborhood and used the episode as a basis for her book, The Long Road of Woman's Memory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} period the Mahdi's family became wealthy from cotton {{production}} based on irrigation and migrant laborers, mainly their Baggara followers from Darfur and Kordofan. These western tribes {{had been the}} backbone of the original Mahdist movement. The riverine tribes were more inclined to side with the rival Khatmiyya movement. The government supported Abd al-Rahman in these commercial enterprises. Abd al-Rahman's economic activity, and the resulting wide range of contacts with merchants and owners of pump-schemes for irrigating cotton fields, gave him influence among Sudanese engaged in commerce. As of 1 January 1922 the government suspended payment of allowances to Mahdist notables other than the old and those whose movements were restricted. The allowance of Abd al-Rahman was increased somewhat, but only so that he could support <b>old</b> <b>women</b> and other incapable people whose allowances had been stopped.|$|E

5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both {{literal and}} allegorical {{acceptance}} of myth, declaring roundly that myths {{have no place}} in philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even <b>old</b> <b>women</b> and boys) is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E
5|$|The Poveiro is a {{specific}} genre of boat characterized by a wide flat-bottom and a deep helm. There were diverse boats with different sizes, uses and shapes. The most notable of which, the Lancha Poveira, {{was believed to be}} derived from the Drakkar Viking, but without a long stern and bow and with a lateen sail. Each boat carried carvings, namely a sigla poveira mark for boat identification and magical-religious protection at sea. According to a tradition that persists to this day, the youngest son is the heir of the family, as in old Brittany and Denmark, because it was expected that he would take care of his parents when they became <b>old.</b> <b>Women</b> govern the family, because men were usually away from home fishing.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three <b>old</b> <b>women</b> spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} the three bears was in {{circulation}} before the publication of Southey's tale. In 1813, for example, Southey was telling the story to friends, and in 1831 Eleanor Mure fashioned a handmade booklet about the three bears and the <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> for her nephew Horace Broke's birthday. Southey and Mure differ in details. Southey's bears have porridge, but Mure's have milk; Southey's <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> has no motive for entering the house, but Mure's <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> is piqued when her courtesy visit is rebuffed; Southey's <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> runs away when discovered, but Mure's <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> is impaled on the steeple of St Paul's Cathedral.|$|R
5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{considered}} the above 'fairy lover' tradition {{to be connected}} to another about a lullaby. This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod, who was the clan bard in {{the last half of the}} 19th century; he obtained the tradition from several <b>old</b> <b>women</b> in 'MacLeod country'. This lullaby-tradition related how on an autumn night, a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle. She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle. The nursemaid, who was within the room as well, was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him a lullaby. This song was so remarkable that it was imprinted upon the nursemaid's memory, and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song. R.C. MacLeod stated that, over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family, to whom this lullaby was sung, would be protected by the power of the fairies. For a while, no nurse was employed by the family who could not sing this song. A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle, and the custom of singing the fairy's lullaby ceased to be followed—but according to R.C. MacLeod, not completely forgotten. R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847, for his infant elder brother, who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847–1935), 27th chief of the clan. An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the right.|$|E

Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like <b>old</b> <b>women.</b> I don't care about <b>old</b> <b>women</b> gossiping.

In one of the last scenes, the younger woman was showing to be attending to the <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> when the latter fell sick. The <b>older</b> <b>women,</b> realizing how much the younger woman was trying to help her was shown to be hugging the young woman out of forgiveness and appreciation. In the last scene, the younger woman was showing to be helping the <b>older</b> <b>woman</b> to eat while on their right, two framed pictures were shown.

These, the tower warns, will seek to divert her by pleading for her help: she must ignore them. The cakes are treats for distracting Cerberus, the three-headed watchdog of Orcus, and the two coins for Charon the ferryman, so she can make a return trip.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} {{study was to explore}} which inner conceptions about the abused <b>older</b> <b>women</b> the professional social workers had and how they experienced the enconter of an abused <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> in an intimate partner relation. The theoretical background is social construction by Berger and Luckmann. This theory was uset to analyze the transcribed interviews. This study is based on nine interviews with five professionals in social services, three volunteers from the voluntary sector and one social worker who worked in a community based support group for abused <b>older</b> <b>women.</b> The result of this study shows that <b>older</b> <b>women</b> were often abused, by a relative they were dependent on, in their home. The participants describe emotions of insecurity and frustration in their efforts to help the <b>older</b> <b>women.</b> They also described difficulties in creating confidence with the women. The conclusion is that the abused <b>older</b> <b>women</b> don´t always get the support of interventions from the social service agencies...|$|R

25|$|Abortion in Brunei {{is largely}} illegal, with an {{exception}} if a woman's life is danger. Previously, {{the penalty for}} receiving an abortion was up to seven years in prison, with 10-15 years for the person performing the abortion. In 2014, Brunei's government implemented Sharia criminal law {{in a series of}} phases which was set to increase the punishment for abortion to execution by stoning. This part of the law was to come into effect in 2016, although it's now expected to come into effect in 2018. In 2016, a 22 year <b>old</b> <b>women</b> was sentenced to seven years in prison for obtaining an abortion using the abortion pill.|$|E
25|$|Applications such as Instagram {{have become}} a “body-image battleground”, while the “selfie” is now the {{universal}} lens in which individuals use to criticise their bodies and others. Facebook and Snapchat also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the highpoints of their lives, a survey by Common Sense reported that 22% felt bad if their posts were ignored, or {{if it did not}} receive the amount of attention they hoped for. Hence, this could serve as a trigger for more insecurities, with many utilising digital manipulation techniques as well, to modify their photos {{in order to meet the}} media-crafted ideals of thinness and perfection. According to research by the Renfrew Center Foundation, 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35 year <b>old</b> <b>women</b> edited their images before uploading. Therefore, 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online.
