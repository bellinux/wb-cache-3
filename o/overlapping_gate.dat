40|$|We present normally-off AlGaN/Gan power tunnel-junction FETs (TJ-FETs) {{with high}} {{breakdown}} voltage, low off-state leakage current and low specific onresistance. The TJ-FETs exhibit normally-off operation {{in an otherwise}} normally-on as-grown sample owing to a current controlling scheme different from the conventional FETs. The high 2 DEG density in AlGaN/GaN heterostructure results in a thin tunnel barrier whose effective thickness is controlled by an overlaying gate electrode. This tunnel junction is controlled by an <b>overlapping</b> <b>gate</b> and deliver highly efficient quantum tunnelling, enabling normally-off operation. A positive gate bias results in a nanometer-thick barrier with high tunnelling current, while a zero gate bias leads to a thicker barrier that effectively blocks the current flow.

40|$|Niobium {{thin film}} {{nanostructures}} were fabricated using {{electron beam lithography}} and a liftoff process involving a four layer resist system. Wires having micrometres in length and below 200 nm in width were deposited on an insulating substrate and subsequently thinned by anodisation. The resistance of the wires was monitored in situ and could be trimmed by controlling the anodisation voltage and time. The method appears appropriate for the fabrication of very small resistors for use as biasing resistors for single electron devices. Transport properties of these resistors were measured at millikelvin temperatures. They had nonlinear current-voltage characteristics around zero bias and showed a transistion from superconducting to insulating behaviour. Analysis of the offset voltage showed that a Coulomb blockade set in when the sheet resistance of the films exceeded the superconducting quantum resistance approx 6. 45 kOhm. Samples in a single electron transistor-like geometry with two variable thickness weak links were made by combined angular evaporation of niobium and anodisation. <b>Overlapping</b> <b>gate</b> electrodes were deposited on these samples.

40|$|Silicon carbide {{is a wide}} bandgap {{semiconductor}} that is {{well suited}} for high power, high temperature electronic devices due to its remarkable electronic and thermal properties. Photosensitive devices in the 6 H polytype of Sic have also been demonstrated, showing high sensitivity in ultraviolet wavelengths near 270 nm. Furthermore, the native oxide on Sic is silicon dioxide, meaning that SIC can be thermally oxidized to form a high quality gate dielectric, making metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices possible. These qualities make silicon carbide ideal for constructing UV sensitive CCD imagers. 2 ̆ 7 This work investigates the feasibility for developing imagers in Sic through the fabrication and demonstration of a buried channel CCD linear shift array. Several elements of the MOS field effect family were studied. With careful surface preparation and device processing techniques, SiC/silicondioxide interfaces have been ameliorated to achieve surface state densities below 2 el 1 per-centimeters-squared and electron surface mobilities above 40 centimeters-squared-per-volt-second. Buried channel MOSFETs were fabricated with ion implantation of nitrogen at elevated temperatures and have functioned with electron mobilities in excess of 180 centimeters-squared-pervolt- second, which shows an advantage of using the buried channel structure. Studies of capacitance characteristics of the buried channel devices hold good agreement with a general one-dimensional depletion model. A double polysilicon level, <b>overlapping</b> <b>gate</b> process was adapted to the SiC/MOS system. A four phase buried channel CCD shift register was built and operated in,the pseudo-two phase configuration at room temperature. Device clocking frequencies were limited to 30 kHz by slow charge readout techniques, but higher speeds have been estimated. In this frequency range, charge transfer efficiencies were probably dominated by carrier trapping in bulk states, which may be present due to ion implantation.
