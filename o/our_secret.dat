500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{describes}} the protagonist revealing several bedroom fantasies {{in which she}} would like to engage, asking her lover playfully to [...] "touch her body". Though the song features sexually oriented lyrics, critics deemed that the melody and playful tone of the song made them less explicit. The song's lyrics find Carey maintaining the duo keep the relationship private from the media, as she threatens to [...] "hunt him down" [...] if he shall record anything of their private life. According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, [...] "Touch My Body" [...] is a [...] "questionably sexy striptease: a goofy-sleazy tryst vignette", with Carey singing [...] "If there's a camera up in here then I best not catch this flick on YouTube." [...] Critic Rodman felt the song's lyrics describe the protagonist's sexual fantasies, but also serves as a warning to [...] "potential touchers: 'If you run your mouth and brag about <b>our</b> <b>secret</b> rendezvous / I will hunt you down.' Yikes!" [...] In an interview with Fox News, journalist Hollie McKay asked Carey if there was any literal interpretation regarding the lyrics [...] "Touch My Body / Put Me on the Floor / Wrestle Me Around / Play With Me Some More", to which she replied [...] "There is no full-blown meaning; it is just cute and it's one of those songs that makes me happy. I wasn't taking it that seriously. It was just fun experience." [...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters wrote that in the song [...] "Mariah coos soft-core phone sex fantasies over plinked piano notes, all while referencing YouTube in {{what appears to be a}} desperate grab for relevance." [...] In his review of the song's parent album, Los Angeles Times critic Richard Hartog described the song's production, Carey's vocals and its overall mixing: ...|$|E

2500|$|Jack Straw (then Home Secretary) stated to the British Parliament in 1999: [...] "In 1992, after Mr. Mitrokhin had {{approached}} the UK for help, <b>our</b> <b>Secret</b> Intelligence Service made arrangements to bring Mr. Mitrokhin {{and his family}} to this country, together with his archive. As there were no original KGB documents or copies of original documents, the material itself was of no direct evidential value, but it was of huge value for intelligence and investigative purposes. Thousands of leads from Mr. Mitrokhin's material have been followed up worldwide. As a result, our intelligence and security agencies, in co-operation with allied Governments, {{have been able to}} put a stop to many security threats. Many unsolved investigations have been closed; many earlier suspicions confirmed; and some names and reputations have been cleared. Our intelligence and security agencies have assessed the value of Mr. Mitrokhin's material world wide as immense." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 9, 1942, Stout {{conducted}} {{the first of}} 62 wartime broadcasts of <b>Our</b> <b>Secret</b> Weapon on CBS Radio. The idea for the counterpropaganda series had been that of Sue Taylor White, wife of Paul White, the first director of CBS News. Research was done under White's direction. [...] "Hundreds of Axis propaganda broadcasts, beamed not merely to the Allied countries but to neutrals, were sifted weekly," [...] wrote Stout's biographer John McAleer. [...] "Rex himself, {{for an average of}} twenty hours a week, pored over the typewritten yellow sheets of accumulated data ... Then, using a dialogue format – Axis commentators making their assertions, and Rex Stout, the lie detective, offering his refutations – he dictated to his secretary the script of the fifteen-minute broadcast." [...] By November 1942, Berlin Radio was reporting that [...] "Rex Stout himself has cut his own production in detective stories from four to one a year and is devoting the entire balance of his time to writing official war propaganda." [...] Newsweek described Stout as [...] "stripping Axis short-wave propaganda down to the barest nonsensicals … There's no doubt of its success." ...|$|E

5000|$|... ==== <b>Our</b> <b>Secrets</b> Are the Same project ==== Having {{delivered}} <b>Our</b> <b>Secrets</b> Are the Same to Chrysalis, Simple Minds {{then found}} themselves {{caught up in}} record company politics while Chrysalis, EMI and other companies attempted to merge with each other. Originally due for release in late 1999, the album remained unreleased after the band mired themselves in lawsuits with Chrysalis. In 2000, the situation became even more complicated when <b>Our</b> <b>Secrets</b> Are the Same was leaked on the internet. Discouraged with their label's failure to resolve the problems, and with both momentum and potential album sales lost, the band once again went on hiatus. Eddie Duffy, Mark Taylor and Mark Kerr all {{moved on to other}} projects. Jim Kerr moved to Sicily and took up a part-time career as a hotelier, although both he and Burchill continued working together on various business interests and kept the idea of the band alive.|$|R
2500|$|Political {{commentators}} took {{different views}} on the raids, with intelligence agencies researcher and journalist Nicky Hager suggesting the raids {{may have been the}} result of the increased police and SIS staffing and resources aimed at anti-terrorism since 2001. (The raids and the surveillance preceding them cost $8 million to plan and execute.) Veteran activist John Minto criticised the police for the move, claiming that their actions provoked a [...] "climate of fear and repression" [...] while left-leaning commentator and blogger Martyn [...] "Bomber" [...] Bradbury, sided with the police, saying that in his dealings with the activist community he had become concerned with the actions of [...] "some clowns." [...] The Herald was criticised for publishing these comments which did not mention who the [...] "clowns" [...] were or name the blog site Bradbury claimed to have communicated with them on. New Zealand Herald columnist Matt McCarten saw the raids as being over the top; [...] "Some of the young people I know who were arrested are actually vegans who don't even believe in killing animals, let alone human beings. When you get the police searching homes of environmental activists trying to save snails on the West Coast, you know that things have got really silly." [...] McCarten also stated that New Zealanders should be more worried about the country joining the US database of terrorist suspects, and [...] "the creeping powers of <b>our</b> <b>secret</b> police." [...] However the 'From the left' columnist for the Dominion Post, Chris Trotter reacted differently, saying [...] "it wasn't the actions of the police that provoked my fury, but of those who'd forced their hand." [...] When left-wing musician Don Franks wrote a protest song about the raids, [...] "Safer Communities Together Blues" [...] he took a swipe at Trotters reaction with the lyrics [...] "The political climate's getting hotter / Got to watch out for the pigs and the pigs' Trotter." ...|$|E
