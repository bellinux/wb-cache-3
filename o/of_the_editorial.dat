40|$|Drawing on <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> inter-cultural rhetoric {{analysis}} and considering <b>the</b> important role <b>of</b> newspaper editorials in shaping public opinions, {{this article examines}} <b>the</b> schematic structures <b>of</b> Persian and English newspaper <b>editorials</b> <b>of</b> criticism. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this comparative {{study was to explore}} the discourse conventions employed in <b>the</b> <b>editorials</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> New York Times and Tehran Times. While revealing some interesting genre-specific features of schematic structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>editorials</b> in <b>the</b> two newspapers, <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study also indicated that cultural constraints did not substantially affect <b>the</b> schematic structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>editorials.</b> However, they had implications for realization of certain rhetorical structures in <b>the</b> <b>editorials...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>the</b> {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>editorials</b> about <b>the</b> 9 / 11 remembrance published {{in three different}} newspapers: the New York Times, the Washington Post and USA Today. <b>The</b> discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>editorials</b> will examine three different elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts. The first analysis deals with the newspapers’ views on the appropriate government response to the terrorist attacks and <b>the</b> commemoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims. The second analysis {{is based on the}} agenda-setting theory, and looks at topic choice and external topics connected to the 9 / 11 attacks and memorial services. The last analysis focuses on <b>the</b> stylistic elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>editorials,</b> to see how newspapers frame their <b>editorials.</b> <b>The</b> conclusion combines the three analyses and compares the outcome with the assumed political positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newspapers...|$|R

5|$|The new editor was Ejler Jakobsson, though Pohl {{continued}} to be listed as editor emeritus on the masthead until the July–August 1970 issue. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>editorial</b> work was actually done by Judy-Lynn Benjamin, who was hired by Pohl in 1969 as an editorial assistant. The new regime failed to impress readers, and circulation dropped from over 67,000 for the year ending October 1968 to under 45,000 the following year, a drop of over 30%. If went bimonthly in May 1970, as Abramson attempted to juggle the frequency of publication of several of his titles to maximize profits; the page count and price were also adjusted more than once over the next year, again increasing profitability. Abramson also began a British distribution of If, reprinted with a separate cover, priced in British currency. Circulation figures of the time show an increase of about 6,000 copies, but if this includes sales in the UK is not clear.|$|E

40|$|Bibliometric {{mapping of}} {{scientific}} articles based on keywords and technical terms in abstracts is now frequently used to chart scientific fields. In contrast, no significant mapping {{has been applied}} to <b>the</b> full texts <b>of</b> non-specialist documents. Editorials in Nature and Science are such non-specialist documents, reflecting <b>the</b> views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two most read scientific journals on science, technology and policy issues. We use the VOSviewer mapping software to chart <b>the</b> topics <b>of</b> these <b>editorials.</b> A term map and a document map are constructed and clusters are distinguished in both <b>of</b> them. <b>The</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> document clustering is verified by a manual analysis of a sample <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>editorials.</b> This analysis confirms <b>the</b> homogeneity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clusters obtained by mapping and augments the latter with further detail. As a result, the analysis provides reliable information on <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>editorials</b> over topics, and on differences between the journals. The most striking difference is that Nature devotes more attention to internal science policy issues and Science more to <b>the</b> political influence <b>of</b> scientists...|$|R
