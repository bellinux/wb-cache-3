40|$|Smart sensors {{embedded}} in packaging films for food or pharmaceuticals, and read out using RFID protocols, {{are an important}} future application of large-area organic electronics. The first steps towards flexible organic electronics were code generators for RFID tags [1]. To realize flexible smart sensors it is also essential to develop analog sensor interfaces and ADCs, which will enable the integration of sensors, data processing and RF communication (Fig. 6. 6. 1) on the same plastic foil [2]. This paper focuses {{on the design of}} an organic ADC for quasi-static signals, like the ones provided by chemical and temperature sensors. Only a few ADCs made with <b>organic</b> <b>TFTs</b> (<b>OTFTs)</b> have been reported [3, 4] so far. Their linearity is limited by the poor matching typical of organic technologies and reached an INL of 2. 6 LSB at 6 b resolution before calibration. This paper addresses an ADC whose linearity is not related to the matching of OTFTs or capacitances, but relies on the electrical properties of a transconductor. Even without calibration, the INL is 1 LSB and the DNL is 0. 6 LSB at 6 b resolution. The converter is manufactured in a double-gate p-type OTFT technology [5], which provides two gates to control the semiconductor channel, G and TG (Fig. 6. 6. 1) : a voltage applied to the top gate TG produces a linearly proportional shift of the threshold voltage...|$|R
40|$|For over 50 {{years the}} {{mainstream}} electronics {{industry has been}} dominated by thin film transistors based on inorganic semiconductors such as silicon and gallium arsenide. The fabrication of these devices requires high temperature and high vacuum deposition techniques that result in high production costs, which are particularly prohibitive for large-area electronics. Organic semiconductors (OSCs) offer an attractive alternative since their fabrication processes are much less complex compared to conventional inorganic technology. In particular, low temperature deposition and solution processing techniques provide a simple, low cost alternative. π-Conjugated organic semiconductors are therefore attracting considerable attention for applications such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), field-effect transistors (OFETs) and photovoltaic cells. Furthermore, the mechanical properties (flexibility) of organic compounds coupled with their low temperature solution-based processing provides the potential for new applications inc 1 uding flexible displays, pliable electronic paper and smart cards. While molecular and polymer OLEDs have already been commercialized in a number of consumer products, OLED displays still employ an inorganic (amorphous silicon, a-Si) thin-film transistor (TFT) matrix to control the emissive pixels. <b>Organic</b> <b>TFTs</b> (<b>OTFTs)</b> are nevertheless extensively investigated by numerous, both industrial and academic, research groups. The mobility of the best OSCs have already approached and even surpassed that of a-Si (1 cm² V/s). However, the limited stability of OSCs and the "difficult to control" molecular packing, particularly in solution-processed devices, are among the major limitations hampering industrial development, and the design of new OSCs continues to be an important area of materials research.

For what is {{believed}} to be for the first time, the device physics based modeling approach to derive the generic model current equations of organic thin film transistor (OTFT) is described.
