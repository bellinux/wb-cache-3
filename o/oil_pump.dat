5|$|In New Zealand, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances and traded the lead with Mikkola, Röhrl and Björn Waldegård. Soon after regaining {{the lead on}} stage twelve, she retired with a broken <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b> After seven rounds, Mouton was second in the championship, 32 points behind Röhrl and 12 ahead of Eklund. The Rally of Brazil was marred by the fatal accident of Brazilian driver Thomas Fuchs, and featured chaotic conditions as parts of the course were not successfully closed for competition. Although only five teams {{made it to the}} finish, Mouton improved her title hopes by winning her duel with Röhrl after the German lost a wheel on the last day. At the 1000 Lakes, she clocked in the eighth fastest time for the famous Ouninpohja stage and placed seventh after the first day. On the following leg, Mouton drove too fast into a jump and damaged her Quattro while landing. After the next jump, her front wheels locked up and she rolled the car. Mouton was next locked in a tight battle for the win in Sanremo. Although she recorded nine stage wins and Audi took a one-two, she had to settle for fourth behind Röhrl.|$|E
5|$|For 2001, Pescarolo Sport {{replaced}} their C52s {{with the}} C60. Their first race with the C60 {{came at the}} 12 Hours of Sebring, with Jean-Christophe Boullion, Sébastien Bourdais and Laurent Rédon selected to drive the car; however, engine problems after 167 laps forced them to retire, and they were classified 25th overall, and seventh in class. At the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Catalunya, Boullion and Bourdais completed 57 laps before another engine problem forced them to retire. For the 2 Hours 45 Minutes of Donington Park, Boullion partnered Rédon to fourth place, the fastest of the non-Audi entries. However, <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> issues struck at the 1000 km of Monza, forcing Boullion, Rédon and Bourdais to retire. Three C60s were entered in the 2001 24 Hours of Le Mans; Pescarolo ran Boullion, Bourdais and Rédon in one car, and Emmanuel Clérico, Cottaz and Boris Derichebourg in another, whilst SMG ran Gache alongside Jérôme Policand and Anthony Beltoise in their C60. Only the Boullion/Bourdais/Rédon C60 finished (in 13th overall, and 4th in the LMP900 category), as the other Pescarolo car crashed out after 42 laps, and SMG's C60 succombed to engine problems 9 laps later. Pescarolo Sport's next race with the C60 came at the 1000 km Estoril, where Boullion, Rédon and Derichebourg {{were able to take}} the car's first ever victory, although they had initially been disqualified for ignoring blue flags; Boullion and Rédon immediately followed this with another victory in their next race, which was the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Magny-Cours. Boullion and Derichebourg finished the season off with second at the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Nürburgring. Courage finished the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) season classified in sixth, whilst they took fifth in the FIA Sportscar Championship, and third in the European Le Mans Series (ELMS).|$|E

25|$|The first British {{synchronizer}} gear {{was built}} by the manufacturer of the machine-gun {{for which it was}} designed: it went into production in December 1915. George Challenger, the designer, was at the time an engineer at Vickers'. In principle it closely resembled the first form of the Fokker gear, although this was not because it was a copy (as is sometimes reported): it was not until April 1916 that a captured Fokker was available for technical analysis. The fact is that both gears were based closely on the Saulnier patent. The first version was driven by a reduction gear attached to a rotary engine <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> spindle, as in Saulnier's design; a small impulse-generating cam was mounted externally, on the port side of the forward fuselage, where it was readily accessible for adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Driving a car {{owned by}} his father, George Elliott, Elliott {{made his first}} Winston Cup Series start at Rockingham in 1976.

Elliott toiled for five years in the Winston Cup Series without corporate sponsorship, and along the way showed flashes that he could compete with the established veterans of the sport. In mid-1977, Elliott bought a Mercury Montego from Bobby Allison after his split from Penske Racing to replace the inferior Torino, and the move paid off. He soon earned his first Top 10 finish in the Southern 500 (10th), and his first top-5 finish 2 years later in the same race, finishing second to race winner (and Elliott's boyhood hero) David Pearson.|$|E

Salvadori immediately began to show some promise in the car, posting third fastest time in qualifying, beaten only by fellow Britons Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks, driving a BRP BRM P25 and works Ferrari 246 Dino respectively. Shelby also posted some fast lap times, taking sixth place. In the race both Brooks and Moss retired with mechanical problems, but the Astons performed faultlessly {{for the majority of the}} distance, before Shelby's <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> failed two laps from the finish.

25|$|On September 16, 1979, Hinton {{was racing}} the RB-51 in the Reno Air Races when a {{capacitor}} in the magneto failed, causing {{the engine to}} run on half its spark plugs. Not knowing what was wrong, Hinton pushed the plane to full throttle. This resulted in the supercharger carrying the extra pressure. Eventually, a bearing in the supercharger failed. Hinton finished the race in second place and moved to make an emergency landing. The supercharger failure resulted in a shaft failure, however; that shaft drove the <b>oil</b> <b>pump,</b> which in turn controlled the propeller pitch. The propellers went flat, acting as a huge air brake. The RB-51 crashed short of the runway.

Whincup dropped down the order in the second race due to a puncture, while Coulthard took victory with James Courtney and Craig Lowndes rounding out the podium. McLaughlin jumped the start and served the resulting ten-second penalty under safety car conditions, which led to another ten seconds being added to his race time, while Mostert hit the wall at turn eight and retired from the race. Michael Caruso also hit the wall at turn eight after contact with David Reynolds led to a puncture. Will Davison, after retiring from the first race, failed to start the second after a clutch failure on the warm-up lap.

The second part of qualifying lasts for 15minutes and eliminates cars that finished in positions 11 to 16. The final part of qualifying determines the positions from first to tenth, and decides who starts the Grand Prix in pole position. Hamilton clinched his seventh career pole position of his career, {{with a time of}} 1:26.714 in the third session. He was joined on the front-row by Kubica, who was a tenth of a second behind Hamilton. Kovalainen was third, with Massa fourth, four-tenths slower than Hamilton in the third part. In contrast to Massa's fourth place, his teammate, Räikkönen finished qualifying in 16th place. His Ferrari car suffered a fuel pump problem at the end of part one, with the Ferrari team unable to fix the problem before the second session. Räikkönen was not the only driver to suffer problems. Webber in the Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel in the Toro Rosso also suffered problems, with Webber spinning off in session two due to brake failure, leaving him down in 15th. Vettel was scheduled to be in the third session, but his Toro Rosso suffered <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> failure, preventing him from setting a time in the session. Heidfeld, Trulli, Rosberg and Coulthard completed the top eight positions. Timo Glock in a Toyota finished qualifying in ninth position, however, he was demoted to 19th after being given two five-place grid penalties.
