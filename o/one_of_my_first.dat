The novel was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. [...] The typewritten title page for the Library of Congress copyright application read simply: [...] "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane." [...] The name [...] "Maggie" [...] {{was added to the}} title later. Crane used the pseudonym [...] "Johnston Smith" [...] for the novel's initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the nom de plume was the [...] "commonest name I could think of. [...] I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the [...] "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths." [...] Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of The Arena, calling it [...] "the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums I have yet read, fragment though it is." [...] Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. [...] He would later remember [...] "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make. It fell flat. Nobody seemed to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> loves." ...|$|E

Rickover's legendary achievements were in the past. His present viselike grip on much of the navy was doing it much harm. I had sought the job because I believed the navy had deteriorated to the point where its weakness seriously threatened our future security. The navy's grave afflictions included loss of a strategic vision; loss of self-confidence, and morale; a prolonged starvation of resources, leaving vast shortfalls in capability to do the job; and too few ships to cover a sea so great, all resulting in cynicism, exhaustion, and an undercurrent of defeatism. The cult created by Admiral Rickover was itself a major obstacle to recovery, entwining nearly all the issues of culture and policy within the navy.|$|E

And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?'

Guitarist John McLaughlin said on Twitter, [...] "Very sad to have lost my old friend Jack Bruce." [...] Long-standing collaborator Robin Trower wrote on Facebook, [...] "It has always been a great source of pride to me to have made music with Jack (one of the few musicians that can be truly called a force of nature) and Jack and I were proud of that music. He will be greatly missed". Fellow bassist Billy Cox also posted a tribute to Bruce on Facebook. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick said, [...] "There was a time when Jack Bruce was synonymous with the bass guitar in rock history, when he was widely revered as the best there was on four strings." [...] Rush bassist and singer Geddy Lee wrote: “The sudden passing of Jack Bruce is terribly sad news. One of the greatest rock bassists to ever live and a true and profound inspiration to countless musicians. He was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> bass heroes and was a major influence on my playing and my music.

50|$|Bayramov {{was born}} in Baýramaly in the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, then part of the Soviet Union, on April 14, 1938. He lost both parents {{at a young age}} and lived as a {{homeless}} child before being placed in an orphanage in Serdar (then known as Kyzyl-Arvat), where he was raised. Growing up, Bayramov endured starvation and the many hardships that accompanied World War II and the post-war devastation. Later, he benefited from the guidance of exceptional teachers who recognized his talent and supported the young artist in his efforts to become a professional painter. His first art teacher was Gennadiy Brusentsov, a Russian artist who taught at the Shota Rustaveli Turkmen Art College in Ashgabat. Bayramov and Brusentsov developed a lifelong friendship, with Brusentsov acting as Bayramov’s mentor over the years. Brusentsov’s portrait of a young Bayramov, titled Young Soccer Player, is {{in the collection of the}} State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. Bayramov painted three significant portraits of his teacher, with the most famous <b>one</b> being Portrait <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>First</b> Teacher, created in 1997-98.|$|R
40|$|During World War II,over 120, 000 Japanese Americans were {{unjustly}} incarcerated in relocation camps, {{where two}} {{questions were designed}} to test their loyalty and willingness {{to serve in the}} armed forces. Those who either refused to answer the questions or answered in the negative were called ”no-no boy”. Ichiro Yamada, the protagonist of John Okada 2 ̆ 7 s No-No Boy, was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them. 　<b>My</b> <b>first</b> aim in this paper is to investigate and identify the real motivation that caused Ichiro to become ”no-no boy”. Ichiro 2 ̆ 7 s mother, who is a chauvinist devoted to Japan, has been thought to be most influential in his decision. But Ichiro, who was born in America and loved America, did not share his mother 2 ̆ 7 s enthusiasm for Japan. Ichiro lost his faith and trust in America because the U. S. government violated the Constitution. 　The second subject of mine is to trace Ichiro 2 ̆ 7 s struggling life into the novel. The loyalty questions divide Nisei into two groups: no-no boys and veterans who served in the armed to show their faith in the country. Ichiro, as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> no-no boys, feels inferiority to veterans. But veterans could not trust in post-war America because of its lasting racism. In the course of the novel, Ichiro comes to feel sympathy with veterans, for he becomes aware that they have lost their faith in America, too. The realization that there are no differences between no-no boys and veterans restores Ichiro to the status of Japanese American in the pre-war period. ...|$|R
