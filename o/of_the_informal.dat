25|$|The play {{served as}} a tribute to Scriblerians (satirists and members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> Scriblerus Club), as such it allowed Fielding to satirise politics. As a {{political}} allegory that satirised the government of the time, the play was subject to attacks and a ban. Critics agree that the play was bold in both its writing and its message.|$|E

25|$|The edited {{broadcast}} of December 3 – combining the big, choreographed numbers, lavish sets and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> live sessions – {{was an enormous}} success.

40|$|Within {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} {{framework of a}} developing economy with a foreign owned factor of production, this paper questions whether the informal-formal sector relationship is pro-cyclical/ complementary – expansion or contraction in one necessarily implies an expansion or contraction in the other – when <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> sector is subject to a technological shock. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition under which a positive shock to <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> sector results in a contraction in both <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban formal sector and <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> sector. Thus, although our result shows that the informal-formal sector relationship is pro-cyclical, it nevertheless {{calls into question the}} conventional wisdom on <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> intervention in <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> sector <b>of</b> developing economies, particularly where multinational corporations sub-contract certain labor intensive stages <b>of</b> production to <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> sector.

25|$|In {{their search}} for an early identity, English Canadians relied heavily on loyalty and {{attachment}} to the British Empire, a triumphalist attitude towards British role {{in the building of}} Canada, as evidenced in the lyrics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> anthem The Maple Leaf Forever and distrust or dislike of those who were not British or Protestant. John Ralston Saul sees in the influence of the Orange Order the counterpart of the Ultramontane movement among French Canadians, leading certain groups of English Canadian Protestants to provoke persecution of the Métis and suppress or resist francophone rights.|$|E

Internally, there are three floors of over 250 science-learning exhibits.

25|$|The Peruvian {{economy has}} {{undergone}} considerable free market reforms, from legalizing parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> sector to significant privatization in the mining, electricity and telecommunications industries. Thanks to strong {{foreign investment and}} the cooperation between the Fujimori government and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, growth was strong in 1994-97 and inflation was brought under control. In 1998, El Niño's impact on agriculture, the financial crisis in Asia, and instability in Brazilian markets undercut growth. 1999 was another lean year for Peru, with the aftermath of El Niño and the Asian financial crisis working {{its way through the}} economy. Lima did manage to complete negotiations for an Extended Fund Facility with the IMF in June 1999, although it subsequently had to renegotiate the targets.|$|E
25|$|Although the European Union has legislated in {{the area}} of energy policy for many years, the concept of {{introducing}} a mandatory and comprehensive European Union energy policy was only approved at the meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> European Council on 27 October 2005 at Hampton Court. The EU Treaty of Lisbon of 2007 legally includes solidarity in matters of energy supply and changes to the energy policy within the EU. Prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, EU energy legislation has been based on the EU authority {{in the area}} of the common market and environment. However, in practice many policy competencies in relation to energy remain at national member state level, and progress in policy at European level requires voluntary cooperation by members states.|$|E
25|$|Considered {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> faction of young {{officers}} insisting on reforming the Polish Army in exile into a highly trained specialized force rather than cannon fodder, Kalenkiewicz co-authored several memorials urging the Polish authorities {{to reform the}} standard infantry units into airborne units capable of both armed reconnaissance and diversion, and possible help in the envisioned all-national uprising in the German-occupied country. One of such memorials made Kalenkiewicz noted by Gen. Władysław Sikorski, who in October 1941 moved him to staff service in the newly established Airborne Training and Studies detachment of the Polish General Staff. One of the direct outcomes of the group's activities {{was the creation of}} the Polish 1st Independent Airborne Brigade under Gen. Stanisław Sosabowski. Kalenkiewicz also volunteered to be transported to occupied Poland and help the Home Army.|$|E
25|$|The urban {{lower class}} is {{characterized}} by <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> sector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy. <b>The</b> <b>informal</b> sector consists <b>of</b> small-scale enterprises that utilize traditional technologies and operate outside <b>the</b> legal regime <b>of</b> labor protections and taxation.

50|$|From <b>the</b> {{viewpoint}} <b>of</b> governments, <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> sector {{can create}} a vicious cycle. Being unable to collect taxes from <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> sector, <b>the</b> government may be hindered in financing public services, which in turn makes the sector more attractive. Conversely, some governments view informality as a benefit, enabling excess labor to be absorbed, and mitigating unemployment issues. Recognizing that <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> economy can produce significant goods and services, create necessary jobs, and contribute to imports and exports is critical for governments.|$|R

25|$|One of Ribbentrop's first acts as Foreign Minister was {{to achieve}} a total volte-face in Germany's Far Eastern policies. Ribbentrop was {{instrumental}} in February 1938 in persuading Hitler to recognize the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and to renounce German claims upon her former colonies in the Pacific, which were now held by Japan. By April 1938, Ribbentrop had ended all German arms shipments to China and had all of the German Army officers serving with the Kuomintang government of Chiang Kai-shek recalled (with the threat that {{the families of the}} officers in China would be sent to concentration camps if the officers did not return to Germany immediately). In return, the Germans received little thanks from the Japanese, who refused to allow any new German businesses to be set up in the part of China they had occupied, and continued with their policy of attempting to exclude all existing German (together with all other Western) businesses from Japanese-occupied China. At the same time, the ending <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> Sino-German alliance led Chiang to terminate all of the concessions and contracts held by German companies in Kuomintang China.|$|E
25|$|As {{has been}} remarked the temple's {{existence}} {{had been known}} to scholars from the record in Pausanias but its location was uncertain until the accidental discovery in November 1765 by the French architect J.

Though the temple was visited several times in the intervening years, it wasn't until the expedition of 1812 that excavations began. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> group of antiquaries who undertook the enterprise it fell to Haller to record the 1812 dig in his field notebook, the two copies of which are the only surviving details of the disposition of the intact site and finds since the drawings he made in 1811 were lost at sea. However, though Haller's study was exacting {{by the standards of the}} day no record was kept of the findspots of the frieze, and only sketchy details that parts of the frieze were found on the temple floor inside the cella by Brondsted. Furthermore, the early explorers of the temple make little discussion of the sculpture in their subsequent publications, it was not until 1892 that they were formally published with Arthur Smith's catalogue of the British Museum's holdings.|$|E
