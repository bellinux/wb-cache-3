30|$|This article {{presents}} two area/latency optimized gate level asynchronous full adder designs which correspond to early output logic. The proposed full adders {{are constructed using}} the delay-insensitive dual-rail code and adhere to the four-phase return-to-zero handshaking. For an asynchronous ripple carry adder (RCA) constructed using the proposed early <b>output</b> <b>full</b> adders, the relative-timing assumption becomes necessary and the inherent advantages of the relative-timed RCA are: (1) computation with valid inputs, i.e., forward latency is data-dependent, and (2) computation with spacer inputs involves a bare minimum constant reverse latency of just one full adder delay, thus resulting in the optimal cycle time. With respect to different 32 -bit RCA implementations, and {{in comparison with the}} optimized strong-indication, weak-indication, and early <b>output</b> <b>full</b> adder designs, one of the proposed early <b>output</b> <b>full</b> adders achieves respective reductions in latency by 67.8, 12.3 and 6.1  %, while the other proposed early <b>output</b> <b>full</b> adder achieves corresponding reductions in area by 32.6, 24.6 and 6.9  %, with practically no power penalty.

This is because the LOPT_EO_FA has reduced latency compared to the AOPT_EO_FA, as seen in Table  2.|$|R
