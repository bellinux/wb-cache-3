5|$|No. 4 <b>Operational</b> <b>Training</b> Unit (No.4 OTU) was an {{operational}} conversion {{unit of the}} Royal Australian Air Force during World WarII. It was formed at Williamtown, New South Wales, in October 1942 to train pilots and wireless air gunners to operate Vultee Vengeance dive bombers. The school was equipped with Vengeances and CAC Wirraway aircraft. Accidents were common in operational conversion units, and No.4 OTU suffered several fatal crashes during its existence. It was disbanded in April 1944, handing Williamtown over to No.5 <b>Operational</b> <b>Training</b> Unit.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to Australia, Crombie was posted for duties as an {{instructor}} with No.5 <b>Operational</b> <b>Training</b> Unit at RAAF Station Williamtown in December 1943. In March 1944, Crombie piloted a Beaufighter from Brisbane to New Guinea, flying the aircraft in the local area {{for a period of}} eleven days testing the machine, before returning to Richmond, New South Wales. He was promoted to acting squadron leader on 1 September, and made chief flying instructor of No.5 <b>Operational</b> <b>Training</b> Unit, heading the group's two sections of Beaufighter and de Havilland Mosquito aircraft.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{established}} several <b>operational</b> <b>training</b> units (OTUs) {{to convert}} recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills {{they had already}} learned. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and operational conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice impacted upon the squadrons' standard duties, {{and the advent of}} the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal training system. The Air Force's initial move in this direction was to re-establish No.2 (Fighter) <b>Operational</b> <b>Training</b> Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958.|$|E

On 1 October 1942, No. 4 <b>Operational</b> <b>Training</b> Unit (No. 4 OTU) was formed at RAAF Station Williamtown to train aircrews to operate the Vengeance in combat. The unit began its first operational conversion training course on 28 October that year. No. 4 OTU's fleet of Vengeances was augmented with several Wirraways in January 1943; from this time crews began their training on the simple-to-operate Wirraway before progressing onto the Vengeance.

A Do 17 was claimed on 19 October followed by another He 111 on 24 October. By 25 November 1941 he had claimed 7 enemy aircraft and was awarded a bar to his DFC. He was then promoted to flight lieutenant. After having little leave in 1941, Braham was rested to prevent exhaustion.

5|$|December 1942 {{also saw}} {{the return of the}} HZL bomber {{squadron}} to Croatia from service on the Eastern Front, where they had flown more than 1,500 sorties. Upon its return the squadron was redesignated 1./(Kroat.)KG after having flown its nine Dornier Do 17Z bombers from Russia back to the NDH. The Dorniers proved a welcome addition to the strike power of the Axis forces fighting the Partisans in Yugoslavian territory right up to the end of 1944. In late 1943, a second squadron, 2./(Kroat.)KG was formed to provide <b>operational</b> <b>training.</b> It was equipped with Italian designed and built CANT Z.1007 and Fiat BR.20 medium bombers.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, the RAAF {{established}} several <b>operational</b> <b>training</b> units (OTUs) {{to convert}} recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting techniques to the flying skills {{they had already}} learned. No.2 (Fighter) <b>Operational</b> <b>Training</b> Unit (No.2 OTU) was formed on 2April 1942 at Port Pirie, South Australia. Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey, a fighter ace who had led No.3 Squadron in North Africa. Jeffrey had recently brought on line Nos.75 and 76 Squadrons, two {{of the first three}} fighter units raised to help defend northern Australia as the Japanese advanced toward New Guinea. His team of instructors at No.2OTU included fellow aces from the North African campaign, Clive Caldwell and Wilf Arthur. Originally equipped with CAC Wirraways and Fairey Battles, the unit's complement was augmented by P-40 Kittyhawks, Vultee Vengeances, Avro Ansons, CAC Boomerangs, Supermarine Spitfires and Airspeed Oxfords after it relocated to RAAF Station Mildura, Victoria, in May. By September 1942, its fleet of aircraft included nine of the 106 Kittyhawks the RAAF had on hand at the time. During November, No.2OTU conducted comparative trials that pitted a Spitfire MkV against a P-40E; the final report of these trials judged that although the Spitfire had superior performance according to most criteria, the P-40E was also a useful design.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the war to mid-1941, Coastal Command had only one {{functioning}} <b>Operational</b> <b>Training</b> Unit (OTU). Officially it had to provide training for 17 units. The pressure on the OTU was such that it offered little more than a conversion programme for pilots and crews hoping to man land-based aircraft. In 1940, Bomber Command was asked to support Coastal forces, even though at that time in the war it overstretched itself. Requests to the Air Ministry to meet outstanding OTU requirements were largely ignored. The single landplane OTU was established to train 1.1 crews per month. This figure, on the outbreak of war, proved grossly inadequate.|$|E
