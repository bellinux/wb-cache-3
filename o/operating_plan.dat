5|$|Kheradpir became CEO of Juniper Networks in January 2014. He {{developed}} and executed a restructuring and cost-cutting plan that Juniper called its Integrated <b>Operating</b> <b>Plan</b> (IOP), {{in response to}} pressure from activist investors at Elliot Management. The plan included $160 million in cost cutting and returning $3 billion to shareholders over three years by buying shares and increasing dividends. It also consolidated many product and R groups, putting a major emphasis on the market segments of Web 2.0, Cloud-Builder & High-IQ Networks.

5|$|In January 2014, hedge fund, activist {{investor}} and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper {{reduce its}} cash reserves and cut costs, before Kheradpir was officially appointed. That February, Juniper {{reached an agreement}} with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated <b>Operating</b> <b>Plan</b> (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board. That April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses. In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer. An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.|$|E

500|$|The Coalition also {{pursued a}} {{different}} operational plan. The Coalition's operational strategy brought its different forces {{closer and closer}} together in concentric circles, to a single point in Saxony. Known as the Trachenberg Plan, the Sixth Coalition's <b>operating</b> <b>plan</b> established clear, concise and specific guidelines for commanders, from the Army through the basic company level: act offensively against an inferior foe; act defensively against a superior foe, underscoring to commanders at all levels the risk of underestimating the threat of Napoleon and his army. The new plan divided the Allied force into three armies: Silesia, Bohemia, and Northern Germany. The Silesian army, composed of Prussians and Russians, left 50,000 men in the Province of Silesia and moved the remaining 100,000 to join with 120,000 Austrians in Saxony. [...] The Crown Prince of Sweden, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, a former Marshal of France and a favorite of Napoleon's, established an army of observation at Hamburg and Lübeck, and another 70,000 concentrated [...] southwest of Berlin. Using this plan, the Coalition pushed Napoleon and his allies into an increasingly smaller circle of operation. In theory, while this concentrated Napoleon's force, it also limited his maneuvering options. Furthermore, it concentrated the Coalition forces around the French and Allied armies, ultimately at the Saxon cities of Dresden, and then Leipzig.|$|E

The National Basketball League, formed in 1937, was based in the Midwest and had [...] "limped along" [...] while being [...] "generally ignored" [...] by sports editors. [...] During the 1930s, Kase had discussions with Walter A. Brown, manager of the Boston Garden, about creating a truly national basketball league with franchises in the country's largest cities. In 1944, Kase organized a basketball exhibition in New York featuring two of the top barnstorming teams. The overflow crowd that turned out for the charity event reinforced Kase's belief that professional basketball could attract a following in New York. [...] Kase continued to press the idea in discussions with Walter A. Brown and even drafted the new league's charter and <b>operating</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{practical}} approach to defining flexible design and development strategies for maximizing the expected value of engineering systems. Specifically, the approach {{deals with the}} fact that it is generally computationally impractical to explore all the possible ways a system might be developed and operated, given the large number of possible scenarios in which the system might evolve. To make the analysis tractable within the computational resources available, it proposes that designers and program managers use a catalog of representative <b>operating</b> <b>plans</b> built from combinations of design elements and management decision rules. These are associated with a range of possible scenarios of uncertain variables that might affect the system’s expected value and performance.
