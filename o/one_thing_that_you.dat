6000|$|... "There is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have not}} told me," [...] Guy {{said when he}} ceased speaking. [...] "Having, as you say, good clients besides your gains here, why should you trouble to {{interest}} yourself in our affairs?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are jumping}} at the conclusion, Mort. If there is <b>one</b> single <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't understand, <b>you</b> must give <b>that</b> girl {{the benefit of}} the doubt. What did 'Loggy' say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Captain Nares was better," [...] she cried, when I had done. [...] "From your account, I {{have only}} learned <b>one</b> new <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are modest {{as well as}} brave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather {{think there}} is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have forgotten," [...] said Mr. Holiday, [...] "and which, it strikes me, is a decided {{objection}} to your plan; and that is, that the steamer for to-morrow, from New Haven, leaves at midnight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right. It {{is better}} for you,--it is better than to be William's darling, and the {{greatest}} earl in his court,--to feel that you are still an Englishman. Promise me but <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will make no fierce or desperate answer to the Duke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You argue well; {{but there}} is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> overlook, though I am sorry to have to pain you by saying it; young Mr. Heigham is no better than he should be. I have made {{inquiries}} about him, and think that I ought to tell you that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Child,' added her father, turning {{kindly to}} Diane, 'you have saved our fortunes. There is put <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must do. Make her obtain the pearls from him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{world knows}} that, glory be to God!" [...] cries she; {{and then to}} Mr. Henry: [...] "There is none but me to know <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> - <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were a traitor to him in your heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So had I," [...] {{the proud}} {{proprietor}} replied; [...] "but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't get {{here in the}} daytime. I reckon if they knew a feller was livin' in these boxes, they'd fire him out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} full of {{something}} very bad if I were to allow myself {{to stand at the}} altar with him. Drop it, Uncle Indefer. Get it out of your mind as a thing quite impossible. It is the one thing I can't and won't do, even for you. It is the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> ought not to ask me to do. Do as you like with the property,--as you think right." ...|$|E
60|$|If ever {{you make}} a journey into Italy, there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will like very much indeed; {{and that is the}} mode of {{travelling}} that prevails in that country. There are very few railroads there; and though there are stage coaches on all the principal routes, comparatively few people, except the inhabitants of the country, travel in them. Almost all who come from foreign lands to make journeys in Italy for pleasure, take what is called a vetturino.|$|E
6000|$|... "Catriona," [...] said I, [...] "what {{that mistake}} was I {{do not care}} to know. I know but the <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> went to Prestongrange and begged my life upon your knees. O, I ken well it was for your father that you went, but when you were there you pleaded for me also. It is a thing I cannot speak of. There are two things I cannot think of in to myself; and the one is your good words when you called {{yourself}} my little friend, and the other that you pleaded for my life. Let us never speak more, we two, of pardon or offence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no, you shan't do that,' {{cried the}} king, 'or if you do, {{it will be}} your own fault. You shall come with me into my palace, and you will {{feel as if you}} were in Paradise, I promise you. In return, I only ask <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> shall obey my orders exactly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you please, Aunt Lillian," [...] she answered. [...] "You know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may always stay here. I only beg of <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> have {{anything}} to complain of, you will bring it to me, and not mention it before Pa. He has enough to worry him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello, there!" [...] exclaimed Compton. [...] "What gets us out so early? And Harriet too! There is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{would bring}} <b>you</b> girls in here so early." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, men," [...] he said, [...] "there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should remember--these Welshmen {{are not to}} be despised. Doubtless {{you will}} be able to ride over them, but do not think that, when you have done so, you have {{defeated}} them. They will throw themselves down on the ground, leap up as you pass over them, stab your horses from below, seize your legs and try to drag you from your saddles, leap up on to the crupper behind you, and stab you to the heart. This is what makes them so dangerous a foe to horsemen, and at Crecy they did terrible execution among the French chivalry.|$|E
60|$|DEAR MRS. BAKER, - I am {{very much}} obliged {{to you for}} your letter and the {{enclosure}} from Mr. Skinner. Mr. Skinner says he 'thinks Mr. Stevenson must be a very kind man'; he little knows me. But I am very sure of <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a very kind woman. I envy you - my amanuensis being called away, I continue in my own hand, or {{what is left of}} it - unusually legible, I am thankful to see - I envy you your beautiful choice of an employment. There must be no regrets at least for a day so spent; and when the night falls you need ask no blessing on your work.|$|E

500|$|... "1 Thing" [...] was {{produced}} by Harrison and is built around a sample of The Meters' 1970 version of the theme song from Oh! Calcutta!, [...] "Oh, Calcutta!", written by Stanley Walden. Built around The Meters' funky beat-driven percussion, [...] "1 Thing" [...] finds Amerie lamenting an aspect of a relationship that keeps her satisfied. Even if other factors are less than positive, there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> keeps her hooked ("It's this <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that's</b> got me trippin'"). Amerie said that {{the inspiration for the}} song came from a conversation she had with Harrison [...] "about relationships and how there's always <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> keeps <b>you</b> attracted to someone. No matter what they do or how they act, there's <b>that</b> <b>one</b> undeniable <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> keeps <b>you</b> coming back." [...] She told Blender that the [...] "one thing" [...] "could be bringing flowers, or something more ... physical. People think I'm just this good girl, but there are other sides they don't see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I observe with {{pleasure}} {{that you are}} going to come forth in Britain. It is certainly not the very best way to publish on one's own accompt; for the booksellers set their face against the circulation of such works as do not pay an amazing toll to themselves. But they have lost the art of altogether damming up the road in such cases between the author and the public, which they were once able to do as effectually as Diabolus in John Bunyan's Holy War closed up the windows of my Lord Understanding's mansion. I am sure of <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have only to be known to the British public to be admired by them, and I would not say so unless I really was of that opinion.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are just}} as likely to get lost, or to fall over a rock, as anybody else," [...] he said, [...] "and it is better to have two men lost than three. But there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can do. You can go down to the beach, and make your way southward as far as possible. There you can find your way back, and if you take a gun, and fire it every now and then, you may attract the {{attention}} of Shirley and Burke, if they are on the hills above, and perhaps they may even be able to see you as you walk along. If they are alive, they will probably see or hear you, and fire in answer. It is a very strange thing that we have not heard a shot from them." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the utter}} {{contempt}} which Mrs. O'Hara now {{felt for the}} man she probably forgot that his immediate situation was one {{in which it was}} nearly impossible that any man should conduct himself with dignity. Having brought himself to his present pass by misconduct, he could discover no line of good conduct now open to him. Moralists might tell him that let the girl's parentage be what it might, he ought to marry her; but he was stopped from that, not only by his oath, but by a conviction that his highest duty required him to preserve his family from degradation. And yet to a mother, with such a demand on her lips as that now made by Mrs. O'Hara,--whose demand was backed by such circumstances,--how was it possible that he should tell the truth and plead the honour of his family? His condition was so cruel that it was no longer possible to him to be dignified or even true. The mother again made her demand. [...] "There is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must do for her before other things can be thought of. When shall she become your wife?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Strange {{it was for}} {{him then}} that she stood in his own rooms doing it, while, with an {{intensity}} now beyond any that had ever made his breath come slow, he waited for her act. [...] "There's but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can save <b>you</b> from my choice." ...|$|R

5000|$|October 9, 2016 {{the second}} U.S. Presidential Debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton refuse {{to shake hands}} at the {{beginning}} of the debate. Karl Becker, an uncommitted voter and audience member, stood up and asked the two candidates a question, [...] "Would either of <b>you</b> name <b>one</b> positive <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> respect in <b>one</b> another?" [...] "I respect his children," [...] said Clinton. [...] "I will say this about Hillary: she doesn't quit, she doesn't give up," [...] said Trump. This has come to be known as the 'Kumbayah' moment of the election.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, lad, {{it shall}} be as you say, for indeed I am but a poor hand at talking, but believe me that I feel as {{grateful}} as if I could express myself rightly, and that the Earl of Wisbech cannot feel one whit more thankful to you for having saved {{the lives of his}} three children than I do for your having saved my Nellie from the consequences of her own folly. There is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must let me do--it is but a small thing, but at present I have no other way of showing what I feel: you must let me take upon myself, as if you had been my son, the expenses of this outfit of yours. I was talking of the matter, as you may have guessed by what I said to the Earl, when Nellie burst into tears; and if I contemplated this when I knew only you had saved me from ruin, how much more do I feel it now that you have done this greater thing? I trust that you will not refuse me and my wife this small opportunity of showing our gratitude. What say you, John Wilkes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Six months, in the {{ordinary}} state of things, though of course something may occur to bring us in before that. Still, the change won't be as much trouble as you fancy. When we get there you can stay {{for two or three}} days with the Hunters till we have got the things to rights. There is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will be pleased about. Wade is going with us, at any rate for the present; you are a favorite of his, you know, and I think that is the principal reason for his going. At any rate, when he heard I was in orders, he told the Colonel that, as there was no illness in the regiment, he thought, if he did not object, he would change places for a bit with M'Alaster, the assistant surgeon, who has been with the detachment at Deennugghur for the last year, so as to give him a turn of duty at Cawnpore, and do a little shikaring himself. There is more jungle and better shooting round Deennugghur than there is here, and you know the Doctor is an enthusiast that way. Of course, the Colonel agreed at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|That night I dined {{with the}} Taipan in a palace. They say the {{merchant}} prince of Calcutta is dead--killed by exchange. Hong-Kong {{ought to be}} able to supply one or two samples. The funny thing in the midst of all this wealth--wealth such as one reads about in novels--is to hear the curious deference that is paid to Calcutta. Console yourselves with that, gentlemen of the Ditch, for by my faith, it is the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can boast of. At this dinner I learned that Hong-Kong was impregnable and that China was rapidly importing twelve and forty ton guns for the defence of her coasts. The one statement I doubted, but the other was truth. Those who have occasion to speak of China in these parts do so deferentially, as who should say: [...] "Germany intends such and such," [...] or [...] "These are the views of Russia." [...] The very men who talk thus are doing their best to force upon the great Empire all the stimulants of the West--railways, tram lines, and so forth. What will happen when China really wakes up, runs a line from Shanghai to Lhassa, starts another line of imperial Yellow Flag immigrant steamers, and really works and controls her own gun-factories and arsenals? The energetic Englishmen who ship the forty-tonners are helping to this end, but all they say is: [...] "We're well paid for what we do. There's no sentiment in business, and anyhow, China will never go to war with England." [...] Indeed, there is no sentiment in business. The Taipan's palace, full of all things beautiful, and flowers more lovely than the gem-like cabinets they adorned, would have made happy half a hundred young men craving for luxury, and might have made them writers, singers, and poets. It was inhabited by men with big heads and straight eyes, who sat among the splendours and talked business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] {{said the}} old lady, [...] "make it for him, and see how he likes it. There is <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> Mrs. Tolbridge, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should never forget, {{and that is that}} the doctor is not only your husband, but the {{mainstay}} of the community." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{said her}} aunt, [...] "there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> about this <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't {{understand}}, {{because you are}} such a little girl. You will understand it by-and-by, when you grow older; and I don't blame you for not knowing it now, because you are so young." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you!" [...] Ellen replied. [...] "Well, {{just you}} listen to me and answer my question. I left Alf alone with you while I changed my--while I looked after the washing the day you came, and what I want to know is, did you give him <b>one</b> of those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> talked to me about?" ...|$|R
