Importantly, one hundred percent effects were seen in concentrations above the ERM for acenaphthylene, 2-methyl napthalene, and low-molecular weight PAHs, and ninety percent or greater effects in this range were seen for chromium, lead, silver, benz(a)anthracene, and fluoranthene.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for the {{efficient}} treatment of organic polluted wastewaters by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) which calls for {{the determination of the}} mineralization order of ease for the <b>organic</b> <b>contaminants</b> with oxidants. The mineralization abilities of <b>organic</b> <b>contaminants</b> in AOPs are investigated in this work. Photocatalytic experiments for three representative <b>organic</b> <b>contaminants</b> are carried out, and their corresponding reaction rates are determined experimentally. Meanwhile, molar Gibbs free energy changes Delta(r) G(m) degrees for the reactions of 31 <b>organic</b> <b>contaminants</b> (10 chlorinated hydrocarbons, four brominated hydrocarbons, I I aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, three chloroacetic acid, and three chloroacetyl chloride) with oxidants of (OH) -O-center dot, H 2 O 2, O-center dot(-), O- 3, and O- 2 are calculated, and the mineralization order of ease is determined theoretically on the basis of Delta(r) G(m) degrees. The agreement of the theoretical and experimental mineralization abilities for most of the <b>organic</b> <b>contaminants</b> investigated implies the reliability of the determination of the mineralization ability from the magnitude of Delta(r) G(m) degrees for the mineralization of trace <b>organic</b> <b>contaminants.</b> Results also show that for most of the <b>organic</b> <b>contaminants</b> studied, the mineralization abilities are (OH) -O-center dot > H 2 O 2 > O-center dot(-) > O- 3 > O- 2, and the mineralization ability of the <b>organic</b> <b>contaminants</b> depends on not only the oxidants but also the structure and properties of the <b>organic</b> <b>contaminants</b> themselves, and the degradation reaction products.

50|$|The {{risks from}} waste {{leachate}} {{are due to}} its high <b>organic</b> <b>contaminant</b> concentrations and high concentration of ammonia. Pathogenic microorganisms that might be present in it are often cited as the most important, but pathogenic organism counts reduce rapidly with time in the landfill, so this only applies to the freshest leachate.

Most landfills containing organic material will produce methane, some of which dissolves in the leachate. This could, in theory, be released in poorly ventilated areas in the treatment plant. All plants in Europe must now be assessed under the EU ATEX Directive and zoned where explosion risks are identified to prevent future accidents. The most important requirement is the prevention of the discharge of dissolved methane from untreated leachate into public sewers, and most sewage treatment authorities limit the permissible discharge concentration of dissolved methane to 0.14 mg/l, or 1/10 of the lower explosive limit. This entails methane stripping from the leachate.|$|E

The hepatic biotransformation enzyme cytochrome P 4501 A (CYP 1 A) in vertebrates is specifically induced by organic contaminants such as aromatic hydrocarbons, PCBs and dioxins, and is involved in chemical carcinogenesis via catalysis of the covalent binding of organic contaminants to DNA (DNA-adducts).
