5|$|Logarithms {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences {{are related to the}} notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a nautilus is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This gives rise to a logarithmic spiral. Benford's law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> are also based on logarithms.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham and Rawnsley {{were soon}} ordered to staff positions. It was a {{compulsory}} order for fighter pilots {{even when the}} men considered themselves fit for operational duties. Before they departed Middle Wallop and 604, {{they had a chance}} to test the new 4-inch (10 cm) AI Mk. VIII radar which had a range of two or three miles (3–5 kilometres). The new radar was a radical improvement. All the information was displayed on a single tube. The ground echo was reduced but could still be seen on screen when flying low, but it did not interfere with the <b>overall</b> <b>picture.</b> Cunningham was to take over as director of all training units from Rory Chisholm who left 604 to become a staff officer at group headquarters. Rawnsley was due to take an instructors job at 62 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at Usworth. Cunningham managed to persuade the CAS to deploy him to headquarters at No. 81 Group RAF, the training organisation for RAF Fighter Command. Rawnsley was also promoted to squadron leader and was awarded the DFC and Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM). The pair remained grounded for six months until January 1943.|$|E

25|$|An Equality Commission {{review in}} 2004 of the {{operation}} of the anti-discrimination legislation since the 1970s, found {{that there had been a}} substantial improvement in the employment profile of Catholics, most marked in the public sector but not confined to it. It said that Catholics were now well represented in managerial, professional and senior administrative posts, although there were some areas of under-representation such as local government and security but that the <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> was a positive one. Catholics, however, were still more likely than Protestants to be unemployed and there were emerging areas of Protestant under-representation in the public sector, most notably in health and education at many levels including professional and managerial. The report also found that there had been a considerable increase in the numbers of people who work in integrated workplaces.|$|E
25|$|TfL {{reported}} in January 2014, that despite {{a reduction of}} traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, {{as well as an}} increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable <b>overall</b> <b>picture,</b> with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E

30|$|The {{findings}} {{of the current study}} should be of interest not only for researchers, but also for policy makers, teachers and parents. This study approaches to entrepreneurship by three environmental motives that are legal, educational and cultural supports, and illustrates countries profile on these aspects. On the practical level, our findings provide an opportunity to policy makers to note their global position and compare themselves to other countries in terms of entrepreneurship context. Also for researchers, the countries that each cluster contains and the position of the cluster among all clusters would be helpful for interpreting the results related to other environmental or individual motives of entrepreneurship. Besides the <b>overall</b> <b>pictures</b> of countries, this research also helps to demonstrate different country contexts (such as Latvia or Slovenia) on main environmental incentives.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{expensive}} strobe tuners is the Peterson Strobe Center, which has twelve separate mechanical strobe displays; one for each pitch of the equally tempered octave. This unit (about $3,500 US) can tune multiple notes of a sound or chord, displaying each note's overtone sub-structure simultaneously. This gives an <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> of tuning within a sound, note or chord that is not possible with most other tuning devices. (The TC Electronic Polytune can display the pitch accuracy of up to six pre-selected notes.) It is often used for tuning complex instruments and sound sources, or difficult-to-tune instruments where the technician requires a very accurate and complete aural picture of an instrument's output. For instance, when tuning musical bells, this model displays several of the bell's partials (hum, second partial, tierce, quint and nominal/naming note) as well as the prime, and each of their partials, on separate displays. The unit is heavy and fragile, and requires a regular maintenance schedule. Each of the twelve displays requires periodic re-calibration. It can be used to teach students about note substructures, which show on the separate strobing displays.|$|E
25|$|JPEG uses a lossy form of {{compression}} {{based on}} the discrete cosine transform (DCT). This mathematical operation converts each frame/field of the video source from the spatial (2D) domain into the frequency domain (a.k.a. transform domain). A perceptual model based loosely on the human psychovisual system discards high-frequency information, i.e. sharp transitions in intensity, and color hue. In the transform domain, the process of reducing information is called quantization. In simpler terms, quantization is a method for optimally reducing a large number scale (with different occurrences of each number) into a smaller one, and the transform-domain is a convenient representation of the image because the high-frequency coefficients, which contribute less to the <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> than other coefficients, are characteristically small-values with high compressibility. The quantized coefficients are then sequenced and losslessly packed into the output bitstream. Nearly all software implementations of JPEG permit user control over the compression-ratio (as well as other optional parameters), allowing the user to trade off picture-quality for smaller file size. In embedded applications (such as miniDV, which uses a similar DCT-compression scheme), the parameters are pre-selected and fixed for the application.|$|E
25|$|Within close {{proximity}} of Wentbridge reside several notable landmarks relating to Robin Hood. One such place-name location {{occurred in a}} cartulary deed of 1422 from Monkbretton Priory, which makes direct reference to a landmark named Robin Hood's Stone, which resided upon {{the eastern side of}} the Great North Road, a mile south of Barnsdale Bar. The historians Barry Dobson and John Taylor suggested that on the opposite side of the road once stood Robin Hood's Well, which has since been relocated six miles north-west of Doncaster, on the south-bound side of the Great North Road. Over the next three centuries, the name popped-up all over the place, such as at Robin Hood's Bay near Whitby Yorkshire, Robin Hood's Butts in Cumbria, and Robin Hood's Walk at Richmond Surrey. Robin Hood type place-names occurred particularly everywhere except Sherwood. The first place-name in Sherwood does not appear until the year 1700. The fact that the earliest Robin Hood type place-names originated in West Yorkshire is deemed to be historically significant because, generally, place-name evidence originates from the locality where legends begin. The <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> from the surviving early ballads and other early references indicate that Robin Hood was based in the Barnsdale area of what is now South Yorkshire, which borders Nottinghamshire.|$|E

500|$|Although angler {{effects are}} {{sometimes}} disregarded in the <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> today, recent population {{studies have shown}} that while all year classes are well represented up to the minimum legal angling size (now 60centimetres in most states), above that size, numbers of fish are dramatically reduced {{almost to the point of}} non-existence in many waters. Some emphasis has been made of the results of two small surveys which suggested a majority of Murray cod are released by anglers. However, there are valid questions as to the representativeness of these surveys, these surveys do not explain the dramatic disappearance of large numbers of young Murray cod at exactly the minimum size limit, and most importantly, any emphasis on these surveys miss the fundamental point — as a large, long-lived species with relatively low fecundity and delayed sexual maturity wild Murray cod populations are extremely vulnerable to overfishing, even with only modest angler-kill. A tightening of fishing regulations for wild Murray cod, as referred to above, and a switch by fishermen to a largely catch and release approach for wild Murray cod would alleviate this problem. Recognising these issues, in late 2014 the New South Wales and Victorian fishery departments amended their regulations so that a slot limit of 55 to 75cm now applies in these states. (I.e. Only Murray cod between 55 and 75cm may be taken; those above and below this size range or [...] "slot" [...] must be released.) This measure should have positive effects for the Murray cod population by protecting and increasing the proportion of large breeding Murray cod.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film {{three and a}} half out of four stars, praising its focus on [...] "characters, relationships, fear and mostly unseen menace" [...] rather than its visual effects, as well as the acting.

Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, gave it four stars out of five, described the film as a [...] "terrifically exciting sci-fi movie" [...] and concluded that Edwards [...] "channels the upriver nightmares of [...] Herzog and [...] Coppola, with a strong streak of Spielbergian wonder at the sight of two aliens apparently dancing". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune was critical of the performances but praised the film's [...] "considerable, crafty virtues", its premise, and its ending. Jeanette Catsoulis of The New York Times called the film [...] "wondrously atmospheric" [...] and [...] "effortlessly compel", and praised Edwards' [...] "beautiful, otherworldly" [...] visual effects. Dan Jolin of Empire echoed the comparison to Herzog, opining that the film [...] "exhibits the lyrical surrealism of [...] jungle excursions". He also praised the visual effects, Edwards' cinematography, and the [...] "simmering" [...] chemistry between McNairy and Able, concluding that the film was [...] "both shoestring and sci-fi filmmaking at its best". Michael Rechtshaffen of the Associated Press praised Edwards for [...] "add original touches to the genre" [...] and for his production design. He criticised the [...] "tentative" [...] and [...] "alienating" [...] performances of McNairy and Able, but stated that [...] "the <b>overall</b> <b>picture</b> still impresses".
