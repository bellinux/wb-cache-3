5|$|In 1755, Benedict Arnold was {{attracted}} {{by the sound of}} a drummer and attempted to enlist in the provincial militia for service against the French, but his mother refused permission. In 1757 when he was sixteen, he did enlist in the Connecticut militia, which marched <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> Albany and Lake George. The French had besieged Fort William Henry in northeastern New York, and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory. Word of the siege's disastrous outcome led the company to turn around; Arnold served for 13 days. A commonly accepted story that Arnold deserted from militia service in 1758 is based on uncertain documentary evidence.|$|E
5|$|On microscopy, {{the tumor}} cells are {{typically}} described as small, round and blue, and rosette patterns (Homer Wright rosettes) may be seen. Homer Wright rosettes are tumor cells around the neuropil, {{not to be}} confused with pseudorosettes, which are tumor cells around a blood vessel. They are also distinct from the pseudorosettes of an ependymoma which consist of tumor cells with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)–positive processes tapering <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> a blood vessel (thus a combination of the two). A variety of immunohistochemical stains are used by pathologists to distinguish neuroblastomas from histological mimics, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lymphoma and Wilms' tumor.|$|E

5|$|Tatars {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Kadan experienced a major failure in March 1242 at Klis Fortress, when they were hunting for Béla IV of Hungary. The Tatars believed that the king was in the Klis Fortress, and so they began to attack from all sides, launching arrows and hurling spears. However, the natural defenses of the fortress gave protection, and the Tatars could cause only limited harm. They dismounted from their horses and began to creep up hand over hand to higher ground. But the fortress defenders hurled huge stones at them, and managed to kill a great number. This setback only made the Tatars more ferocious, and they came right up to the great walls and fought hand to hand. They looted the houses in the outskirt of the fortress and took away much plunder, but failed to take Klis altogether. Upon learning that the king was not there, they abandoned their attack, and ascending their mounts rode off in the direction of Trogir, a number of them turning <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> Split.|$|E

25|$|According to the Dhërmi police post's chief, V. Kordhishta, at 17:40 his {{superiors}} were notified about the watercraft seen on radar, moving {{away at a}} mere 200 m from the shore. Afterwards, with other policemen, {{he went to the}} place where the embarkation occurred on the northern shores of Dhërmi and found an abandoned Peugeot car and some empty plastic cans of fuel. At 18:30, the radar in Vlorë tracked two watercraft, 3 miles off Karaburun's coast, publicly confirmed by a spokesman of the Ministry of Order during a transmission on Top-Channel. At 18:40 a patrol boat of the Delta Force unit, an inflatable dinghy of the Border Patrol and another patrol boat set <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> Dhermi. Due to the bad weather they could not progress beyond Mezokanal between Sazan Island and Karaburun Peninsula and docked in Shën Jan bay, near Cape of Gjuhëz. At 19:00 the boat's approximate coordinates were determined, and at 21:40 the Italian representatives of NATO in Durrës were notified. They additionally sent several watercraft and two helicopters. At 1 a.m. the search was stopped, to be resumed in the morning.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{the rebels}} {{concealed}} their motives, declaring that {{they intended to}} join the campaign. Yet their failure to arrive ultimately forced Köprülü Mehmed to depart without them, and he set <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> the frontier on 24 June 1658. It {{was only then that}} Abaza Hasan and his compatriots revealed their true intentions by sending an emissary to Sultan Mehmed IV, and declaring that continuing to serve the state was intolerable so long as Köprülü Mehmed was not killed. They stated that their revolt was a response to the grand vizier having killed so many innocent men, and their fear that he would turn on them next. The rebel army then began its march from Konya to Bursa, the premier city of Ottoman Anatolia. Along the way Abaza Hasan issued orders preventing his troops from looting the countryside in an attempt to establish his public image as a fighter for justice. Yet even when his army surrounded Bursa and occupied the nearby towns and villages, the sultan continued to decisively stand behind his grand vizier and reject the demands of the rebels, referring to them as the servants of the Devil. Bursa successfully resisted the rebels throughout thirty days of siege, despite the defection of its commander Kenan Pasha to the rebel side. Abaza Hasan's failure to capture this city proved decisive in undermining the long-term viability of his revolt.|$|E
500|$|... "The two Spanish destroyers {{fell out}} of the action quickly and beached themselves, damaged heavily. One by one, the larger enemy {{warships}} also succumbed to the combined fire of the American Fleet. Each, in turn, sheered <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> shore and beached herself. Thus, Texas and the other ships of the Flying Squadron annihilated the Spanish Fleet." [...] Texas was lightly damaged during the battle by a single [...] high explosive shell that hit her on the starboard side above the main deck, immediately forward of the ash hoist. Fragments from the shell badly damaged the ash hoist and destroyed the doors of both air shafts and the adjacent bulkheads. Splinters riddled much of the adjacent structure as well.|$|E

[...] The largest body of defenders fired on the raiders' right flank from behind trees and logs, but their fire was ineffective and they were driven off. [...] The raiders then entered the village and began plundering. [...] Some of the men broke into the liquor stores they found and began drinking, but Colonel Church quickly put a stop to that activity. [...] They {{spent the rest of the}} day destroying much of the village. [...] According to one of Church's dispatches, they destroyed 60 houses, 6 mills, and many barns, along with about 70 cattle.|$|E
500|$|NY227 {{begins at}} a fork off NY79 {{in the town}} of Hector. The route bends northward, passing the eastern {{extremities}} of Finger Lakes National Forest before turning eastward into the hamlet of Reynoldsville. It serves as the main east-west road through Reynoldsville, remaining two lanes wide as it runs through the small community. After leaving the hamlet, the route keeps its gradual northeastern progression, running parallel with the nearby Updyke Road, which forks <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> NY228. Not far from the junction, NY227 bends eastward for a short distance near a farm, {{the first in a series}} of eastward and northeastward turns over the next [...] It finally heads due east into the hamlet of Perry City, where it passes some houses ahead of the northern terminus of NY228.

500|$|The final {{stroke of}} the battle belonged to the British. Around 3 pm, Riedesel sent a {{messenger}} to Burgoyne for instructions. He returned two hours later with orders to guard the baggage train, but also to send as many men as he could spare toward the American right flank. In a calculated risk, Riedesel left 500 men to guard the vital supply train and marched <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> the action {{with the rest of}} his column. Two of his companies advanced on the double and opened vicious fire on the American right, and Fraser's force threatened to turn the American left flank. In response to the latter threat, [...] Arnold requested more forces, and Gates allowed him to dispatch Ebenezer Learned's brigade (2nd, 8th and 9th Massachusetts). (If Arnold had been on the field, these forces might have instead faced the larger danger posed by Riedesel's force.) Fortunately for the American right, darkness set in, bringing an end to the battle. The Americans retreated back to their defenses, leaving the British on the field.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{entering}} Rogers County, I-44/US-412/SH-66 {{parallel the}} southern {{boundary of the}} county, staying {{just north of the}} Rogers–Tulsa and, further east, Rogers–Wagoner county lines. In Rogers County, the three highways enter the city of Catoosa, one of Tulsa's eastern suburbs. In Catoosa, the freeway serves as the southern terminus of SH-167, which serves the city's port, and SH-66 splits <b>off</b> <b>toward</b> Claremore. I-44 and US-412 continue east for a short distance before going separate directions; I-44 exits from US-412 and joins the Will Rogers Turnpike. This interchange is also the northern terminus of the Creek Turnpike. US-412 becomes an expressway, and continues east of the interchange, passing through Fair Oaks on its way out of the Tulsa metro. In rural south-central Rogers County, it connects to SH-412P, a state highway spur to Port 33, before crossing the Verdigris River, a component of the McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System. US-412 continues east through unincorporated territory before reaching Inola, where it has an interchange with SH-88, [...] north of that highway's southern terminus. US-412 then heads eastward out of Rogers County.|$|E
500|$|Baum's Germans left Burgoyne's camp at Fort Edward on August 9 {{and marched}} to Fort Miller, where they waited {{until they were}} joined by the Indians and a company of British marksmen.

[...] On August 14 Baum's men {{encountered}} a detachment of Stark's men that had been sent out to investigate reports of Indians in the area. Stark's men retreated, destroying a bridge to delay Baum's advance. Stark, on receiving word of the approaching force, sent a request to Manchester for support, and then moved his troops out of Bennington toward Baum's force, setting up a defensive line. Baum sent a message to Burgoyne following the first contact indicating that the American force was larger than expected, but that it was likely to retreat before him. He then advanced a few miles further until he neared Stark's position. He then realized that at least part of his first message was incorrect, so he sent a second message to Burgoyne, requesting reinforcements.|$|E
