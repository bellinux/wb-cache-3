5|$|Ef: The Latter Tale begins {{once again}} with Yuko Amamiya and Yu Himura {{in the middle of}} a reunion in a church during Christmas time. Yuko tells Yu how she has {{influenced}} people in two separate stories (from Ef: The First Tale). After she is done with this, she asks him to tell her about the people he has influenced. Yu starts to tell his first story, that of Chihiro Shindo; the third chapter begins. Like Yuko, Yu also abruptly appears out of nowhere and disappears just as mysteriously. He often gives advice and warnings to Renji and others. Yu is close to Chihiro and takes care of her. After the conclusion of the third chapter, the story goes back to Yuko and Yu with Yu ending his recount of the third chapter, and goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about how he and Yuko were separated in the past. Yu starts his recount of the events from the fourth chapter. At the end of the fourth chapter, the story shifts one final time back to Yuko and Yu. Up to this point the two have been recounting individual tales to each other. The meaning of the overall title Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two is revealed to be in connection with Yuko and Yu.|$|E

Though Rogen wishes she would have apologized to him personally as opposed to publicly, he affirmed that he still really liked her, and that he never would have wanted the incident to hurt her career.|$|E
500|$|Stoddart {{is deeply}} {{critical}} of modernism and contemporary art, and scornful of [...] "public art", a phrase {{which makes him}} search for [...] "a glass of whisky and a revolver". He has repeatedly criticised winners of the Turner Prize, such as Damien Hirst [...] "there's plenty of them", [...] and Tracey Emin, whom he calls [...] "the high priestess of societal decline". Stoddart said of his own repeated public denouncements, [...] "Somebody will be exhibiting a bunch of bananas in a gallery, and they'll [...] get me <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> dirty about it". Stoddart has characterised modern art as dominated by left-wing politics, {{to the extent that}} [...] "certain artistic forms likewise became suspect: the tune; the rhyme; the moulding; the plinth" [...] as coercive and overly traditional. [...] He argued that an equestrian statue of the Mariner King, William IV should be placed on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, as originally intended.|$|E

500|$|The book {{is divided}} into six chapters: It begins with author Alina Simone walking around Bay City, Michigan and pondering why {{there was not a}} single {{commemoration}} to be found in the city about Madonna, who was born there. Simone's research began from that point and the essay continues analyzing Bay City and its culture. In the next chapter the author moves <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about 1980s music, Madonna's contribution and popularity after the release of albums, Like a Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986). One of the questions reiterated by Simone is about the singer's legacy and what would happen to her wealth and fortune after her death, seeing that Madonna was not receiving the respect she deserved. With this in mind, Simone talks about how pop culture has moved from one fad to another, and her analysis of the musical landscape in Bay City. In the last chapter titled as Flying Wedge, the author reviews hard rock music and the punk rock bands of the city, and finally how relentless artists can be to produce music. She researches the one-hit wonder bands like Question Mark and the Mysterians—best known for [...] "96 Tears"—and Flying Wedge, a Detroit band that released their record through Creem magazine in 1972 but disappeared. The author ends the book on a happy note that whether Madonna is remembered or not in her hometown, her musical outputs would never be forgotten. Final chapters are devoted to an epilogue about Simone's writing of the book and a thank-you section.|$|E
500|$|Cross was {{involved}} in coordinating {{the reconstruction of the}} country following the fall of Saddam Hussein's government, and was the most senior British officer involved in post-war planning for the country. Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, he appeared on BBC Breakfast with Frost, speaking to presenter Peter Sissons about his role. He praised the military campaign and went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the challenges of rebuilding the country, saying [...] "I think in relative terms we are not as badly off as me might have feared", but agreed that there were insufficient [...] "people on the ground" [...] to ensure security {{in the aftermath of the}} invasion and removal of Saddam Hussein's government. He was later deeply critical of the planning made for post-war Iraq, and stated that he attempted to raise the issue of insufficient planning with politicians. However, he was never [...] "overly concerned" [...] by warnings from aid agencies of a massive humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of the invasion which, in the event, never materialised, though he admitted he had been too optimistic about the state of the Iraqi infrastructure. In the Breakfast with Frost interview, he drew an analogy with London, [...] "if you imagine going into London and every Ministry building is completely empty of furniture, completely empty of people, most of the windows blown out, just trying to find the people who work in those Ministries, the equivalent of the Home Office and [...] out who worked there, getting them back to work, beginning to pay their salaries which we're now beginning to do, and encouraging them to come back and work with us is bound to take a bit of time." ...|$|E

[...] As for {{the meaning of the}} message: [...] "What remains was already evident when we began our reflections on the text of the 'secret': the exhortation to prayer as the path of 'salvation for souls' and, likewise, the summons to penance and conversion." ...|$|E

Henri Pélissier explained the problem – {{whether or not he}} had the right to take off a jersey – and went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of drugs, reported in Londres' race diary, in which he coined the phrase Les Forçats de la Route (The Convicts of the Road): ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1970s, he {{attracted}} former big-name Hollywood stars, such as Orson Welles, James Stewart, John Wayne, Mickey Rooney, David Niven, Gene Kelly, James Cagney and Robert Mitchum, not on {{the basis}} that they had a film to promote, but simply because they wanted a chat. Despite this, Parkinson has since asserted that then as now, [...] "...there was just as much plugging in the seventies as at any time later. To suggest otherwise is to misunderstand the reason people come <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> shows." [...] In particular, he cites Bette Davis as being the guest who [...] "more than anyone, made it clear she was there to plug a product, not because she was, or ever would be, your buddy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2016, in the Rolling Stone video series 'Her Sound, Her Story: Tina Arena', she {{discusses}} how {{the music}} industry squanders women as both they and their careers mature. [...] "You’ve got {{to give me a}} really damn good reason why somebody, who is in the prime of their career and are doing really good work, why on earth they should stop? Are you going to tell a male who {{is at the top of}} his game in whatever domain, that he needs to step down and retire?". Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. Arena says [...] "Get out of the ring. Take your boxing gloves off. Be convinced in the argument of your thoughts and your dreams".|$|E

2500|$|Kawabata's Nobel Lecture {{was titled}} [...] "Japan, The Beautiful and Myself" [...] (...) [...] Zen Buddhism {{was a key}} {{focal point of the}} speech; much was devoted to {{practitioners}} and the general practices of Zen Buddhism and how it differed from other types of Buddhism. He presented a severe picture of Zen Buddhism, where disciples can enter salvation only through their efforts, where they are isolated for several hours at a time, and how from this isolation there can come beauty. He noted that Zen practices focus on simplicity and it is this simplicity that proves to be the beauty. [...] "The heart of the ink painting is in space, abbreviation, what is left undrawn." [...] From painting he moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about ikebana and bonsai as art forms that emphasize the simplicity and the beauty that arises from the simplicity.

2500|$|Regarding the song, Vedder said in {{an online}} chat that it was written {{around the time of}} the Gulf War and added that [...] "it's an anti-patriotic song, actually." [...] On August 7, 2008, at a solo {{performance}} in Newark, New Jersey, at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Vedder took a question from the audience requesting that he explain the meaning of [...] "Yellow Ledbetter". At first, Vedder joked, saying, [...] "Wait...you mean there's lyrics?" [...] He went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about how the song took as its subject a friend of his from Seattle whose brother served in the first Gulf War. His friend received a [...] "yellow letter" [...] in the mail informing him that his brother had died in the war. Vedder and his friend then went for a walk. On this walk, the friend, whom Vedder described as [...] "alternative looking," [...] happened by a house with an American flag flying and people on the porch. He stopped and gestured to the flag, as if to salute it, but the people on the porch glared at him disapprovingly due to his appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Reg Whitaker, a {{professor}} of Political Science at York University in Toronto, gave a review at the Intelligence Forum about the book: [...] "The Mitrokhin Archive arrives from a cache under a Russian dacha floor, courtesy of the British intelligence community itself, and its chosen historian, Chris Andrew. The provenance of this archive is itself {{a matter of some}} controversy." [...] After questioning and discussing the source of the book he adds that [...] "the hand of British intelligence is evident, and Andrew clearly has a 'special relationship' with SIS." [...] Then, Reg Whitaker goes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the British Media when it comes to spies and says that [...] "ever since Burgess and Maclean made their run to Moscow in 1951, the British have treated espionage as a branch of pornography", adding that [...] "it is doubtful that many readers enticed by the advance publicity will actually get very far into this voluminous tome of close to 1000 name and date filled pages. A gripping read it ain't.","is remarkably restrained and reasonable in its handling of Westerners targeted by the KGB as agents or sources. The individuals outed by Mitrokhin appear to be what he says they were, but great care is generally taken to identify those who were unwitting dupes or, in many instances, uncooperative targets." ...|$|E
