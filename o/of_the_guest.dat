5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, {{in a letter}} to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that he had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him. He feared that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of the aforementioned manipulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> list.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to foreign dignitaries, the President's Guest House {{has traditionally been}} made available by the outgoing President of the United States to the President-elect in the five days prior to his inauguration. In 1992, Bill Clinton chose {{to stay at the}} Hay–Adams Hotel instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> house and, in 2009, a request by President-elect Barack Obama to take-up residence at the President's Guest House two weeks early was rejected because of its prior commitment to former Australian prime minister John Howard.|$|E

5|$|According to protocol, {{the flag}} may fly from sunrise until sunset; {{businesses}} and schools {{are permitted to}} fly the flag from opening to closing. When flying the flags of Japan and another country at the same time, the Japanese flag takes the position of honor and the flag <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> country flies to its right. Both flags must be {{at the same height}} and of equal size. When more than one foreign flag is displayed, Japan's flag is arranged in the alphabetical order prescribed by the United Nations. When the flag becomes unsuitable to use, it is customarily burned in private. The Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem does not specify on how the flag should be used, but different prefectures came up with their own regulations to use the Hinomaru and other prefectural flags.|$|E

5|$|In one of {{the worst}} {{disasters}} on the mountain in over thirty years, six climbers—two guides, and four clients—last heard from on May28, 2014, were presumed dead on May31, 2014, when low-flying search helicopters pinged the signals from the avalanche beacons worn by the climbers. Officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after the climbers fell 3,300 feet (1,000 m) while attempting or returning from the summit via the Liberty Ridge climbing route. Searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris field on the Carbon Glacier at , possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing, though the exact cause of the accident is unknown. The bodies of three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> climbers were spotted on August7, 2014, during a training flight and subsequently recovered on August19, 2014. The bodies of the fourth guest climber and two guides have not been located.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{instruments}} that some bands rely on in recording their studio albums can be a hindrance for live performances. While Orphaned Land are able to perform onstage with twenty musicians in their homeland of Israel, they {{have to rely on}} a computer to replicate the roles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> musicians for concerts elsewhere. Some folk metal acts confine themselves to studio recordings and are not known to perform any live concerts. This includes Folkearth, and Falkenbach. Other folk metal bands expand their regular roster to include more musicians and consequently, {{it is not uncommon to}} find bands in the genre featuring six or more members in their line-up. Some of the sextets in the genre are Schandmaul, Cruachan, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Midnattsol, while septets include Ithilien, Subway to Sally, In Extremo, and Lumsk. Both Silent Stream of Godless Elegy and Eluveitie boast eight members each while the line up of Mägo de Oz totals nine performers. Even when a band includes members dedicated to folk instruments, they might still rely on guest musicians to further enhance their sound. As an example, Lumsk added thirteen guest musicians to the band's seven members on their debut album Åsmund Frægdegjevar. At times, guest musicians are known to become full-fledged members of the band, as was the case in Skyforger and Turisas.|$|E
