40|$|Abstract: The paper {{researches}} {{the relationship}} between the operating performance and debt source structure of small and medium-sized enterprises of chemical industry (SMECI) to select the 50 samples of chemical industry from the small board and gem of china stock market. The findings are that it is a negative relationship between the financial liability and business performance for the SMECI. But it is a positive relationship between the <b>operating</b> <b>liability</b> and the business performance. Then, by comparing to the small and medium-sized enterprise of service industries, it is worse performance for the SMECI. The reason is that there may be lower operating leverage and higher financial leverage for the SMECI. So the paper proposes that the managers of the SMECI should be reduce the scale of financial liabilities as possible, and strengthening the debt of operating, in order to improve the operating performance. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to express a novel {{stewardship}} procedure to aid in the detection and identification of production execution and process instrumentation problems. The technique bridges the gap between well-known data reconciliation and production scheduling by formulating both quantity and timing constraints into two reconciliation problems to be described. The method requires the use of two quadratic programs to statistically adjust flows and inventories and then to adjust start and endtimes of actual production activities in order to help expose and isolate mis-specified, mis-logged and mis-operated production anomalies in the data. The value of such a procedure is to allow the production analyst to better understand and steward the performance, competency and efficiency of the manufacturing facility with respect to how well the plant is operated on a dailybasis. A poorly operated plant typically has higher direct manufacturing costs for its products, has lower customer service levels (less-reliable and less-predictable), has attenuated throughputs, is more prone to safety-related issues and is less environmentally sound leading to a higher overall <b>operating</b> <b>liability.</b> We demonstrate the technique using a small but representative illustrative example...|$|E
40|$|Barth, Hodder, and Stubben {{examine how}} the risk and {{expected}} return of existing shares varies {{as a function of}} the amount of outstanding employee stock options (ESOs), finding that the association is a negative one, consistent with ESOs being equity-like in character. They suggest that their approach could be used to address the question of how best to characterize other complex financial claims. The study is well executed and provides a thought-provoking contribution to the debate. However, it is far from obvious that the ‘‘debt or equity’’ question can be solved in this manner. Their approach effectively defines a liability as a financial claim that has characteristics akin to fixed-rate debt. I provide examples of the limitations of this perspective, starting by comparing ESOs that are settled with shares with those settled in cash. Whether a claim is treated as a liability or equity is of little con- sequence if it is simply a matter of balance sheet presentation. The real question is the implications for income measurement. I suggest progress might best be made if we start with Penman’s proposal that assets and liabilities be separated into oper- ating and financial items, an approach which would include many claims that have equity-like characteristics, such as unvested ESOs, within the <b>operating</b> <b>liability</b> category. Once a claim ceases to be an operating item—e. g. when an ESO vests—the approach suggested in the paper can then be used to determine how it should be classified...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a financial statement analysis that distinguishes leverage that arises in financing activities from leverage that arises in operations. The analysis yields two leveraging equations, one for borrowing to finance operations {{and one for}} borrowing {{in the course of}} operations. These leveraging equations describe how the two types of leverage affect book rates of return on equity. An empirical analysis shows that the financial statement analysis explains cross-sectional differences in current and future rates of return as well as price-to-book ratios, which are based on expected rates of return on equity. The paper therefore concludes that balance sheet line items for <b>operating</b> <b>liabilities</b> are priced differently than those dealing with financing liabilities. Accordingly, financial statement analysis that distinguishes the two types of liabilities informs on future profitability and aids in the evaluation of appropriate price-to-book ratios...|$|R

Operational assets are revenue-generating operations in the credit institutions, with their help the bank resources are used in different interest-bearing assets to maximize the profit and to reduce the risk margin, mainly aimed at reducing losses.

This impact evaluation is done through Natural experiment whose time span is two years. It was observed that in the base line period the participants of VSSU are comparatively in better economic position than the participants of SGSY scheme and non participants who are treated as control group in our experiment. It is established that increment of monthly income among the member households of VSSU is more than the member households under SGSY scheme but when we consider the outcome variable as increment of monthly per capita consumption expenditure we see the reverse picture. There is no significant difference on expenditure for human development purposes is observed among the participants of two different types of microfinance system and even at the end line period both the member households still consider expenditure for health and education is luxury. When we consider intra household decision making power through constructing Women’s Empowerment Index as an outcome variable then the change is maximum among the female SHG members under SGSY scheme.

If the lease has the same rent over its life, the net asset at any point is equal to the liability, plus the unamortized balance of initial direct costs and lease incentives. If the rents change during the lease term, the difference between the cash rent and average rent is added to or subtracted from the asset as well.|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{prominent}} accounting scandals of the past several years, investors and standard setters are demanding increased corporate transparency. Nowhere is the demand for transparency more salient than with off-balance-sheet financing, of which lease accounting plays a major role. At the end of 2004, total rental commitments by U. S. firms from off-balance-sheet operating leases exceeded $ 1 trillion. As standard setters reconsider leases as part of their broad reexamination of off-balance-sheet financing, they do so without the benefit of empirical research documenting whether capital market participants find the current leasing standard value relevant. This paper examines whether as-if capitalized <b>operating</b> lease <b>liabilities</b> and capital lease liabilities are both relevant and sufficiently reliable to be priced and explores whether equity investors value operating and capital leases differently. The results are consistent with the market viewing both operating and capital leases as economic liabilities of the firm. However, the results also indicate that capital market participants price operating and capital lease liabilities differently, consistent with the bright-line tests of the current leasing standard identifying economic differences in operating and capital leases. Thus, continuing to require lease disclosures by different lease classifications would assure that equity investors will not suffer from a loss of value relevant information in the pricing of leases.

Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions GmbH (formerly Lurgi GmbH) {{has been part of}} Air Liquide S. A. since 2007. Lurgi was the cable address of Metallurgische Gesellschaft founded on 5 February 1897. Its origin dates back to the technical branch of Metallgesellschaft, which had been established by Wilhelm Merton in 1881. By the end of World War I, the company had gained a foothold in the steam and absorption business and gathered expertise in the upgrading of solid fuels and the processing of the resulting gaseous and liquid products. As a consequence of this diversification, the company divided into process-specific subsidiaries, which from 1919 traded under the name of LURGI. In 1923, they jointly moved into offices at Gervinusstrasse, Frankfurt am Main. In order to meet the requirements of the international markets, Lurgi constituted itself as a German stock corporation in 1990. Its <b>operating</b> limited <b>liability</b> companies - chemistry, metallurgy and industry construction; energy and environmental techniques; gas- and mineral oil techniques - each had their own engineering and commercial staff. In 1991, Lurgi pooled its polymer activities by taking over Zimmer AG from the British Davy-McKee AG as the fourth operating company. In 2001 Lurgi sold their metallurgical division (Lurgi Metallurgie) to Outokumpu.

5000|$|One of {{the basic}} {{principles}} of modern corporate law is that people who invest in a corporation have limited liability. For example, as a general rule shareholders can only lose the money they invested in their shares. Practically, limited <b>liability</b> <b>operates</b> only as a default rule for creditors that can adjust their risk. Banks which lend money to corporations frequently contract with a corporation's directors or shareholders to get personal guarantees, or to take security interests their personal assets, or over a corporation's assets, to ensure their debts are paid in full. This means much of the time, shareholders are in fact liable beyond their initial investments. Similarly trade creditors, such as suppliers of raw materials, can use title retention clause or other device with the equivalent effect to security interests, to be paid before other creditors in bankruptcy. However, if creditors are unsecured, or for some reason guarantees and security are not enough, creditors cannot (unless there are exceptions) sue shareholders for outstanding debts. Metaphorically speaking, their liability is limited behind the [...] "corporate veil". The same analysis, however has been rejected by the US Supreme Court in Davis v Alexander, where a railroad subsidiary company caused injury to cattle that were being transported. As Brandeis J put it, when one [...] "company actually controls another and operates both as a single system, the dominant company will be liable for injuries due to the negligence of the subsidiary company." ...|$|R
