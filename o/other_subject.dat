Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them.|$|E

5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the <b>other</b> <b>subject</b> areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E

Œthelwald's ambivalent stance during the campaign which led to the Winwæd appears to have led to his removal as he disappears from the record at this time. Oswiu installed his adult son Eahlfrith as king of Deirans in Œthelwald's place. Penda's son Peada was installed as king of southern Mercia, while Oswiu took the north of the kingdom. <b>Other</b> <b>subject</b> rulers seem to have been established elsewhere in Mercia.|$|E

25|$|In the {{long-term}} historical perspective, this marked a seminal {{event in the}} collapse of the Ottoman Empire, despite the small size and the impoverishment of the new Greek state. For the first time, a Christian subject people had achieved independence from Ottoman rule and established a fully independent state, recognized by Europe. Whereas previously, only large nations (such as the British or the French) were judged worthy of national self-determination by the Great Powers of Europe, the Greek Revolt legitimized the concept of small, ethnically based nation-states, and emboldened nationalist movements among <b>other</b> <b>subject</b> peoples of the Ottoman Empire. The Serbs, Bulgarians, Romanians and Armenians all subsequently fought for and won their independence.|$|E
25|$|The Sasanian Empire during Late Antiquity is {{considered}} to {{have been one of}} Iran's most important and influential historical periods and constituted the last great Iranian empire before the Muslim conquest and the adoption of Islam. In many ways, the Sasanian period witnessed the peak of ancient Iranian civilisation. Persia influenced Roman culture considerably during the Sasanian period. The Sasanians' cultural influence extended far beyond the empire's territorial borders, reaching as far as Western Europe, Africa, China and India. It played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asian medieval art. Much of what later became known as Islamic culture in art, architecture, music and <b>other</b> <b>subject</b> matter was transferred from the Sasanians throughout the Muslim world.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Sina {{refers to}} the {{secondary}} education stage of maktab schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status.

He wrote that this was a transitional stage and {{that there needs to be}} flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduage, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.|$|E
