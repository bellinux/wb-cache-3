50|$|Tocino is {{traditionally}} {{boiled in water}} (just {{enough to cover the}} meat) or fried in oil, or is cooked <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> until the fat is rendered. The original tocino is marinated only with salt, sugar, and salitre (saltpetre), although pineapple juice may be added for a slightly tart flavor. The Kapampangans who make tocino mix it for four to six hours in order to achieve thickness and softness in the meat, then leave it overnight at room temperature before serving it as burong babi (fermented pork).|$|R
2500|$|In Indonesian cuisine, {{which is}} similar to Malay, the term kecap refers to {{fermented}} savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: kecap asin which translates to 'salty kecap' in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and kecap manis or literally [...] "sweet kecap" [...] in Indonesian. Kecap manis is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> until rather syrupy. A third type, kecap ikan, meaning [...] "fish kecap" [...] is fish sauce similar to the Thai nam pla or the Philippine patis. It is not, however, soy-based.|$|R
50|$|The {{flavor of}} some foods, such as meat and onions, can be {{improved}} by gently cooking with a little pre-heated cooking oil, butter or other fat in the open pressure cooker <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> (unless the manufacturer advises against this) before pressure cooking. It is important both not to overheat the empty pressure cooker and never to heat the empty cooker with the lid and gasket in place. Overheating can cause warping and other damage. The pressure cooker needs to cool briefly before adding liquid; otherwise some of the liquid will evaporate instantly, possibly leaving insufficient liquid for the entire pressure cooking time; if deglazing the pan, {{this has to be}} taken into account.|$|R
50|$|Soak the ham in four cups {{of water}} for about three hours to {{dissolve}} some of the salt. Discard the water. Par-boil both the smoked ham and the fresh ham shank in a stockpot with five {{cups of water}} on <b>medium</b> <b>heat.</b> Skim off any scum forming {{on top of the}} liquid. Cook for about 20 minutes. Remove the meat and put in a large Chinese clay pot. Strain the liquid from par-boiling through a fine sieve and pour into the clay pot. Or you can discard the liquid and use fresh water instead.Peel off the tough outer leaves from the bamboo shoots. The simplest way to accomplish this is to cut the shoot lengthwise into halves and then remove the leaves. Par-boil the bamboo shoots in a stockpot with about four cups of water <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> for about 5 minutes. Drain the shoots and let cool. Slice the shoots very thinly crosswise when cool. Put the bamboo shoot slices into the clay pot.|$|R
50|$|In the Philippines, Banana cue is {{a popular}} snack. The {{portmanteau}} 'Banana cue' may be a misnomer as {{it is not really}} cooked in a skewer over hot embers like a barbecue. Rather, the peeled flesh of an under ripe plantain is fried in hot <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> fire before it is held in a skewer ready for sale. There are two ways to prepare a banana cue. One way is to fry the peeled banana in oil with some amount of brown sugar thrown in to caramelize the flesh. Another way is to fry the flesh in oil until done. When done, they are scooped out of the cooking pan and placed on a dripping pan to allow the oil to drip, before a generous amount of refined sugar is sprinkled over them. A variant from Mindanao, known as Ginanggang, is different in that it is actually grilled over charcoal.|$|R

In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|R

In a regular heavy bottomed pot, rice can be cooked <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> high <b>heat</b> with the lid on for about ten minutes, stirred, and then left to simmer on low heat for additional five to ten minutes.|$|R
40|$|Effective exhaust hoods can {{mitigate}} the {{indoor air quality}} impacts of pollutant emissions from residential cooking. This study reports capture efficiencies (CE) measured for cooking generated particles for scripted cooking procedures in a 121 -m 3 chamber with kitchenette. CEs also were measured for burner produced CO 2 during cooking and separately for pots and pans containing water. The study used four exhaust hoods previously tested by Delp and Singer (Environ. Sci. Technol., 2012, 46, 6167 - 6173). For pan-frying a hamburger <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> on the back burner, CEs for particles {{were similar to those}} for burner produced CO 2 and mostly above 80 percent. For stir-frying green beans in a wok (high heat, front burner), CEs for burner CO 2 during cooking varied by hood and airflow: CEs were 34 - 38 percent for low (51 ? 68 L s- 1) and 54 ? 72 percent for high (109 ? 138 L s- 1) settings. CEs for 0. 3 ? 2. 0 ?m particles during front burner stir-frying were 3 ? 11 percent on low and 16 ? 70 percent on high settings. Results indicate that CEs measured for burner CO 2 are not predictive of CEs of cooking-generated particles under all conditions, but they may be suitable to identify devices with CEs above 80 percent both for burner combustion products and for cooking-related particles...|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} {{often include}} butter or margarine, molasses, sugar, and sometimes white vinegar. The molasses {{is the critical}} ingredient, for it is less sweet than sugar and has a slightly bitter flavour that gives bonfire toffee its unique taste. One recipe calls for 230 g of butter, 230 g of treacle, and 450 g of brown sugar. The mixture is cooked <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> until melted, and allowed to boil (while constantly stirring rapidly) for 15 minutes. The hot mixture is then poured into buttered forms (such as a cake pan or special forms). Recipes calling {{for the use of}} vinegar vary these ingredients. For example, one recipe from 1922 calls for 550 g of dark brown sugar, 280 ml of molasses, one tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, one tablespoon (15 ml) of butter, and one teaspoon (5 ml) of sodium bicarbonate (or baking soda). White vinegar gives the toffee a slightly sharper taste, and alters the chemistry of the toffee so that it is not so brittle. It also helps the toffee to set. Other recipes call for about 5 imppt L of water, and vary the amount of the other ingredients. Some recipes call for the use of golden syrup (In the US this is light molasses mixed with corn syrup) instead of molasses/treacle.|$|R
50|$|Cooking {{is done on}} a {{charcoal}} grill. The grates are greased with pork fat, bacon, oil, butter or cooking spray {{in order to prevent}} sticking. While the meat is gently cooked <b>over</b> light to <b>medium</b> <b>heat,</b> it is basted after every turn with the marinade or with beer, sprayed directly from a gently shaken bottle. This serves to improve the taste and prevents a drying of the meat on the cooking surface. Moreover, the cooking temperature is regulated by gently spraying beer directly on the charcoal; the rising steam helps to cook and flavour the meat.|$|R
25|$|Nitric acid, after {{distillation}} {{to increase}} the acid strength, is capable of dissolving the silver {{but it will not}} (by itself) dissolve the gold. However, nitric acid is not able to (fully) extract silver and other impurities from an alloy with a high content of gold. Therefore, one part of scrap gold was typically alloyed with three parts of copper (quartering) before parting with nitric acid. Another method uses Sterling silver instead of copper. One part pure gold is alloyed with three parts Sterling silver (inquarting). The resulting six karat (6K) gold can then be parted with dilute nitric acid (one part 68-70% nitric acid to one part DISTILLED water). With the karat gold this low (6K), and <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> high <b>heat,</b> the dilute nitric acid will dissolve the Sterling silver (and other base metals in the karat gold) starting on the outside surface of the 6K gold alloy, working its way into the gold alloy, forming a honeycomb structure as it works its way into the metals. Since nitric acid will not dissolve gold, nearly pure gold (very close to 99.5% pure) will be left behind after the reaction is complete. After removing the solid gold other elements like silver and copper may be extracted from the liquid. To get the gold to a very high level of purity (999 fine gold) it is sometimes processed further with aqua regia to effectively remove all the impurities.|$|R

Lateral force microscopy is used to identify the deformation modes, intra-crystalline slip, plastic grooving, fragmentation and fracture, of single particles The medium and agglomeration were found to dictate the deformation mode Steel on steel tribology lubricated by suspensions of these particles in liquid media was conducted over a range of contact pressure and sliding velocity. A scrutiny of the frictional data {{with the aid of}} Raman spectroscopy to identify the transfer film, suggested that the particle size, as it is at contact, is an important tribological parameter Ultrasonication of the suspension and dispersion of the particle by surfactants were used to control the apriori particle size fed into the suspension. Correspondence of friction data of the gently sonicated suspension with that of the ultrasonicated suspension with dispersants indicated the importance of liquid ingestion by these particles as it controls their mode of deformation and consequent tribology.

40|$|Summary- Ras cheese {{was made}} by the {{traditional}} process from fresh cow's milk and different recom-bined milks. The recombined milks were prepared by mixing recombined cream (20 % fat) with recon-stituted skimmilks obtained from classicallow <b>heat</b> and <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> powders, the latter one added or not with calcium caseinate and also from a new milk powder recently developed under an INRA paten-ted process using membrane microfiltration. Milks, wheys and fresh cheeses were carefully analyzed in order to determine reliable weight and cheese component recoveries. Organoleptic qualities deter-mined through f 1 avour, body and texture scorings were assessed during the 3 -month ripening period. The highest weight cheese yields were evidently observed with recombined milks enriched with-ealclum caseinate and the lowest with recombined milk made from <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> powder. 8 atisfactory weight cheese yield and milk component recoveries were achieved with INRA powder recombined milk; they were even higher than those of fresh milk.
