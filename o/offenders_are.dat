25|$|<b>Offenders</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely}} to be {{relatives}} or acquaintances of their victim than strangers. A 2006–07 Idaho study of 430 cases found that 82% of juvenile sex offenders were known to the victims (acquaintances 46% or relatives 36%).|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, Toews {{brought forward}} {{amendments}} to expand Canada's collection of DNA samples from convicted criminals, and later proposed amendments to ensure convicted sex <b>offenders</b> <b>are</b> automatically {{included in this}} registry. He also confirmed that his government would arm guards at the Canada-United States border, and would not revive plans by the previous Liberal administration to decriminalize simple possession of cannabis.|$|E
25|$|In law enforcement, {{the term}} pedophile is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} those accused or convicted {{of child sexual abuse}} under sociolegal definitions of child (including both prepubescent children and adolescents younger than the local age of consent); however, not all child sexual <b>offenders</b> <b>are</b> pedophiles and not all pedophiles engage in sexual abuse of children. For these reasons, researchers recommend against imprecisely describing all child molesters as pedophiles.|$|E

25|$|Croatian history {{recalls the}} burning of {{the flag of the}} Kingdom of Hungary during the 1895 visit of Emperor Franz Joseph to Zagreb. Two people {{involved}} in the incident, Stjepan Radić and Vladimir Vidrić, later pursued notable careers in politics and literature, respectively. In modern Croatia it is illegal to desecrate any flag or to treat any flag in a disrespectful manner. <b>Offenders</b> <b>are</b> punishable with up to one year of imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|In popular usage, {{the word}} pedophilia is often applied to any sexual {{interest}} in children or {{the act of}} child sexual abuse. This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse, and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors. Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse are sometimes pedophiles, child sexual abuse <b>offenders</b> <b>are</b> not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children, and some pedophiles do not molest children.|$|E
25|$|More <b>offenders</b> <b>are</b> male than female, {{though the}} {{percentage}} varies between studies (see female child molesters). The percentage of incidents {{of sexual abuse}} by female perpetrators that come {{to the attention of}} the legal system is usually reported to be between 1% and 4%. Studies of sexual misconduct in US schools with female offenders have shown mixed results with rates between 4% to 43% of female offenders. Maletzky (1993) found that, of his sample of 4,402 convicted pedophilic offenders, 0.4% were female. Another study of a non-clinical population found that, among those in their sample that had been molested, as many as a third were molested by women.|$|E
50|$|A 1991 {{study by}} L. Feder noted that {{although}} mentally ill <b>offenders</b> <b>were</b> significantly less like to receive support {{from family and}} friends upon release from prison, mentally ill <b>offenders</b> <b>were</b> actually less likely to be revoked on parole. However, for nuisance arrests, mentally ill <b>offenders</b> <b>were</b> less likely to have the charges dropped, although {{they were more likely to}} have charges dropped for drug arrests. In both cases, mentally ill <b>offenders</b> <b>were</b> more likely to be tracked into mental health. Finally, there were no significant differences in charges for violent arrests.|$|R
50|$|The age {{of consent}} in Taiwan is 16 {{regardless}} of sex. The sentence is reduced or exempted if the <b>offender</b> <b>is</b> under 19. If the <b>offender</b> <b>is</b> under 18, it's an offense indictable only upon a complaint.|$|R
5000|$|The above {{penalties}} for murder apply when an <b>offender</b> <b>is</b> {{convicted of a}} single murder. When an <b>offender</b> <b>is</b> convicted of multiple murder (either first or second-degree), the court has the option of imposing consecutive parole ineligibility periods for each murder.|$|R
25|$|Some {{scientists}} propose using brain imaging to help {{decide which}} soon-to-be-released <b>offenders</b> <b>are</b> {{at greater risk}} for reoffending. The brain imaging data would be used along with common factors like age, prior arrests, and marital status. To support this idea, in a 2013 study, Professor Kent Kiehl from the University of New Mexico studying the population of 96 male offenders in the state’s prisons found that offenders with low activity in the anterior cingulate cortex where twice as likely to commit an offense in the four years after their release as those who had high activity in this region. Similarly, Dustin Pardini conducted that which shows that men with a smaller amygdala are {{three times more likely to}} commit violence three years after their release.|$|E
25|$|<b>Offenders</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{required to}} submit a monthly supervision report within the first five days of the month to the U.S. Probation office. The report asks about employment; vehicles; finances (including bank accounts, past due debts, cash inflows and outflows, major expenditures, post office boxes, safe deposit boxes, and storage units); questionings by law enforcement; arrests; dispositions of charges; contacts with others who have criminal records; firearm possession and/or access; illegal drug use and/or possession; travel outside the probation district; special assessments, restitution, and fine balances and payments; community service obligations and hours completed, missed, and remaining; and drug, alcohol, and mental health aftercare and any sessions missed. It is a class D felony to make a false statement on this report.|$|E
25|$|Radcliffe has {{advocated}} {{a system where}} first time <b>offenders</b> <b>are</b> banned {{for four years and}} any future offense for life. However, she felt that in cases like that of Christine Ohuruogu, who missed three out-of-competition drugs tests, that she should be allowed to compete in the Olympics, as the BOA does not allow anyone who has served a doping ban to compete. However, when Ohuruogu admitted to not {{trying to get to the}} tests, Radcliffe expressed her disappointment and hoped that it was a lesson learned. When Marion Jones admitted to steroid use, Radcliffe stated that it was good for the sport that Jones was caught and that they had to keep testing and that people being caught is a big deterrent to would-be cheats.|$|E
50|$|When sentenced as a {{dangerous}} <b>offender,</b> the defendant <b>is</b> placed on an indefinite sentence, where the accused may apply for parole after 7 years and every 2 years thereafter.

25|$|Psychopathy {{has been}} {{associated}} with commission of sexual crime, with some researchers arguing that it is correlated with a preference for violent sexual behavior. A 2011 study of conditional releases for Canadian male federal offenders found that psychopathy was related to more violent and non-violent offences but not more sexual offences. For child molesters, psychopathy was associated with more offences. A study on the relationship between psychopathy scores and types of aggression in a sample of sexual murderers, in which 84.2% of the sample had PCL-R scores above 20 and 47.4% above 30, found that 82.4% of those with scores above 30 had engaged in sadistic violence (defined as enjoyment indicated by self-report or evidence) compared to 52.6% of those with scores below 30, and total PCL-R and Factor 1 scores correlated significantly with sadistic violence. Despite this, it is reported that offenders with psychopathy (both sexual and non-sexual <b>offenders)</b> <b>are</b> about 2.5 {{times more likely to be}} granted conditional release compared to non-psychopathic offenders.|$|E
25|$|MILESTONES program {{objective}} is to facilitate a transformation in the juvenile offender’s behavior from delinquent and addictive to pro-social and healthy. The program staff and treatment team develop individual and community strategies to help eliminate and/or manage undesirable behaviors and reinforce those that are socially acceptable with positive outcomes. The JCC–L program model incorporates mentoring, cognitive restructuring, social learning, and cause and effect reinforcement. JCC-L recognizes that most juvenile offenders, including those who are lower functioning, still possess a level of reasoning, response, {{and the ability to}} identify simple patterns. These juvenile offenders also possess the necessary tools to facilitate self-change. Consistent with cognitive theory, the expressed thoughts and beliefs of the juvenile <b>offenders</b> <b>are</b> tracked over time to establish patterns of thinking. Cognitive interventions target both beliefs and thoughts, identify those with positive and negative ultimate outcomes, and subsequently facilitate a change in behavior. In addition to providing alternative coping skills and competencies, the Milestone program also reduces risk levels. Any idea, belief, or circumstance which causes a juvenile to gravitate to inappropriate/illegal behavior is a risk factor.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the National Action Plan, a variety of people and organizationsincluding First Nations, human trafficking victims, law enforcement, and victim service providerscriticized Canada for failing to have such a plan. Charles Momy, president of the Canadian Police Association, said that despite existing efforts from local law enforcement agencies, Canada lacked and required [...] "a coordinated response to ensure the <b>offenders</b> <b>are</b> prosecuted, and put a stop to this modern day form of slavery." [...] In October 2008, John Fenn of Toronto's Streetlight Support Services expressed his frustration that there was still no national action plan on this subject despite the passing of the corresponding motion the previous year. Fenn said, [...] "Even if we make a muck of the thing if we get started, let's get started." [...] Benjamín Santamaria of Project Desert Roses, another Toronto-based organization, voiced the same complaint.|$|E

500|$|Law & Order: Criminal Intent {{is not an}} {{ensemble}} series, and therefore differs from Law & Order and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit which respectively featured six and eight actors receiving star billing during the same broadcast season. Movie actor Vincent D'Onofrio was offered the lead role of Detective Robert Goren, a hyper-intuitive contemporary Sherlock Holmes-type investigator {{who used to work}} for the US Military Police. Other than a 1998 guest role on [...] that earned him an Emmy nomination, this was D'Onofrio's first major television role. Goren's partner, former vice squad detective Alexandra Eames, was played by Kathryn Erbe who had just completed a role on Oz as convicted murderer Shirley Bellinger. Balcer stated Eames was cast because [...] "she just looked like a real cop." [...] Courtney B. Vance plays Assistant District Attorney Ron Carver, a graduate of John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Jamey Sheridan was the last actor to be cast in a main role, taking the part of James Deakins, a [...] "seasoned" [...] NYPD Captain. In a recurring role, Leslie Hendrix appeared as Assistant Chief Medical Examiner Elizabeth Rodgers, the same character she had played in the other two series.

50|$|The {{level of}} {{recidivism}} in sexual <b>offenders</b> <b>is</b> lower than is commonly believed. A 2002 {{study by the}} Office of Justice Programs (OJP) of the United States Department of Justice following 9,691 male sex offenders released from prisons in 15 US states in 1994 indicated that within the first 3 years following their release, rearrest and reconviction rates for new sex offenses were 5.3 and 3.5 percent, respectively; that is, about 1 in 19 of released sex <b>offenders</b> <b>were</b> arrested within three years for another sex crime. The same study found that during the same 3 years from release, 68 percent of released non-sex <b>offenders</b> <b>were</b> re-arrested for any crime (and 47.8 percent reconvicted), while 43 percent of the released sex <b>offenders</b> <b>were</b> rearrested for any crime (and 24 percent reconvicted).|$|R

2500|$|Several terms {{have been}} used to {{distinguish}} [...] "true pedophiles" [...] from non-pedophilic and non-exclusive offenders, or to distinguish among types of offenders on a continuum according to strength and exclusivity of pedophilic interest, and motivation for the offense (see child sexual offender types). Exclusive pedophiles are sometimes referred to as true pedophiles. They are sexually attracted to prepubescent children, and only prepubescent children. Showing no erotic interest in adults, they can only become sexually aroused while fantasizing about or being in the presence of prepubescent children, or both. Non-exclusive offenders—or [...] "non-exclusive pedophiles"—may at times be referred to as non-pedophilic offenders, but the two terms are not always synonymous. Non-exclusive <b>offenders</b> <b>are</b> sexually attracted to both children and adults, and can be sexually aroused by both, though a sexual preference for one over the other in this case may also exist. If the attraction is a sexual preference for prepubescent children, such <b>offenders</b> <b>are</b> considered pedophiles in the same vein as exclusive offenders.|$|E
