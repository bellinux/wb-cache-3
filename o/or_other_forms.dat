5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in {{people who have never}} smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.|$|E

Wearing the colours of one's team became an important aspect of Byzantine dress.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> of grid energy storage such as {{compressed air energy storage}} and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E
5|$|Within {{some of the}} {{destroyed}} suburbs, {{a limited}} postal system between various Robinson groups was established. Dawid Landau {{had served as a}} bodyguard to the courier of the Polish government in exile, Jan Karski, while Karski secretly entered the ghetto to gather information for a report on the extermination of Polish Jews by Nazi Germany for the Western allies, in 1943. Later, Landau fought in both of the Warsaw uprising as part of Żydowski Związek Wojskowy (Jewish Military Union, ŻZW) and afterward decided to stay in the ruins. In his memoirs he reports that the post functioned through the use of empty electrical socket boxes. Various groups would leave notes for others informing them of who was alive and in hiding, news from the front that had been obtained, as well as requests for special forms of assistance. According to Landau, the most common pleas were for doctors <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> of medical help.|$|E
