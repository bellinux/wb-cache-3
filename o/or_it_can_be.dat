5|$|PHP code may be {{embedded}} into HTML or HTML5 markup, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used {{in combination}} with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server software combines {{the results of the}} interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via amino acid transporters, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, {{occurring in the}} liver and kidneys, often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often {{the same as those}} used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E
5|$|The P90 has {{provisions}} for mounting {{a number of}} different types of accessories, including tactical lights and laser aiming devices. A sling can be attached to the P90 for greater ease of carry, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> fitted with various sound suppressors such as the Gemtech SP90, which was designed specifically for the weapon in cooperation with FN Herstal. This stainless steel suppressor with a black oxide finish is built according to MIL-SPECs, including saltwater corrosion resistance. It has a length of 184mm (7.2in), a diameter of 35mm (1.4in) and a weight of 680 g (1.5lb). When subsonic ammunition is used in conjunction with the suppressor, it reduces the sound signature of the P90 by 33dB. A small case collector pouch for the P90 is available which fits over the ejection port and collects spent cases as they are ejected downward; the pouch will collect up to one hundred cases before filling.|$|E

5|$|The two-colored bolete is an edible mushroom, {{although}} some {{may have an}} allergic reaction after ingestion that results in stomach upset. The mushroom has a very mild to no taste although {{it is said to}} have a very distinctive taste like that of the king bolete. It can be cooked several ways, and the varying color of the cap can be used to determine if the mushroom is ready to be eaten. If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat. Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the time it takes for the two-colored bolete to bruise when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to bruise compared to the instant bruising of Boletus sensibilis, which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.|$|E
