5|$|A similar {{housing and}} land {{shortage}} existed in nearby Smethwick County Borough, which {{also resulted in}} the authority acquiring land from adjoining council areas. By 1914; the urban area of Bearwood had already spread <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> of Oldbury Urban District as far as Rathbone Road and Warley Park. A further adjustment of the county boundary took place in 1928 and on this occasion however, Staffordshire gained territory from Worcestershire at Warley Woods (See Fig 4). This enabled Smethwick to build new housing estates at Londonderry and {{to the west of}} Rathbone Road.|$|E

5|$|The {{expansion}} of the railway network {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century meant most in the North lived within reach of the coast, and seaside towns saw a major tourism boom. By around 1870 Blackpool on the Lancashire coast had become overwhelmingly the most popular destination – not just for Northern families, but many from the Midlands and Scotland as well. Other resorts popular with Northerners included Morecambe in northern Lancashire, Whitley Bay near Newcastle, Whitby in North Yorkshire, and New Brighton on the Wirral, as well as Rhyl <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> in North Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the campaign was {{the defeat of the}} approximately 40,000 troops of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, also known as Viet Cong) in the eastern border regions of Cambodia. Cambodian neutrality and military weakness made its territory a safe zone where Vietnamese communist forces could establish bases for operations <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> With the US shifting toward a policy of Vietnamization and withdrawal, it sought to shore up the South Vietnamese government by eliminating the cross-border threat.|$|E
5|$|The story began {{serialisation}} in the Belgium's Tintin magazine from 30 March 1950, in the French language. It {{then began}} serialisation <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> in France, in that country's {{edition of the}} magazine, from 11 May 1950. During this time, there were changes to how Hergé conducted his work; on 6 April 1950, he established Studios Hergé as a public company. The Studios were based in his Avenue Delleur house in Brussels, with Hergé making a newly purchased country house in Céroux-Mousty his and Germaine's main abode. The Studios would provide both personal support to Hergé and technical support for his ongoing work. He hired Bob de Moor as his primary apprentice at the Studios in March 1951.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 7th {{millennium}} BCE, {{human populations}} {{moved into the}} Chadian basin in great numbers. By {{the end of the}} 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital {{and put an end to}} the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby. Since 2003 the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad. Unsustainable high birth rates and a lack of agriculture let the country persist in poverty.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. MacLachlan's {{squadron}} {{moved to}} France on 2 September, and Britain and her allies declared war the following day. 88 Squadron formed {{part of the}} RAF Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) commanded by Air Vice-Marshal Patrick Playfair. On 12 September 1939 88 Squadron was based southeast of Rheims. At this time the Luftwaffe was heavily engaged in Poland {{and only a few}} small-scale skirmishes were fought with a thin German fighter screen left to guard western Germany against a French attack. On 20 September elements of the squadron were intercepted by Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters from Jagdgeschwader 26 (Fighter Wing 26) <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> Four Fairey Battle aircraft were shot down. On 30 September 150 Squadron lost five Battles on unescorted missions into German airspace. It quickly became clear to the crews that the Battle was too slow and too poorly armed to defend itself and operations were shut down. The squadron took measures to increase its defensive power by adding a third machine gun {{in the back of the}} cockpit for the observer to use.|$|E
5|$|On 12 August 1921, the League {{was asked}} to settle the matter; the Council created a {{commission}} with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation. The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide {{the details of the}} interaction between the two areas – for example, whether goods should pass freely <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas. In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Out {{of sight}} of the band members, two of the gunmen placed a ten-pound (4.5kg) time bomb {{in the rear of the}} minibus. The UVF's plan was that the bomb would explode once the minibus had reached Newry, killing all on board. However, Martin Dillon alleged that the bomb was meant to go off in the Irish Republic. He {{suggested}} that had all gone according to plan, the loyalist extremists would have been able to clandestinely bomb the Republic of Ireland, yet claim that the band were republican bomb-smugglers carrying explosives on behalf of the IRA. They had hoped to embarrass the Government of Ireland, as well as to draw attention to its level of control of the border. This may have resulted in the Irish authorities enforcing tighter controls <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> thus restricting IRA operations. Dillon opined that another reason the UVF decided to target the Miami Showband was because Irish nationalists held them in high regard; to attack the band was to strike the nationalists indirectly.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tintin {{personally}} warns the King {{about the}} plot; whereupon Tintin and Muskar rush to Kropow Castle, where the sceptre is kept, {{to find that}} the imposter Alembick has smuggled it out of the building to his accomplices. With the aid of Thomson and Thompson, who have recently arrived in Syldavia, Tintin pursues the thieves, and is able to prevent the sceptre being carried <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> into neighbouring Borduria. A letter obtained from one of the thieves, reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by Müsstler, a political agitator who means Borduria to annex the country. In Borduria, Tintin commandeers a fighter plane and flies to Klow, but the Syldavian military shoot him down. He continues to Klow on foot, and (with the help of Snowy), restores the sceptre to the King.|$|E
5|$|Vilhelm Moberg, in {{his history}} of the Swedish people, {{provides}} a thoughtful discussion of the atrocities which were committed by {{both sides in the}} struggle <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> provinces, and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame the peoples' passions to continue the struggle. These lopsided representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides. As an example, Moberg compares the history texts he grew up with in Sweden which represented the Swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by Gustavus Adolphus celebrating the 24Scanian parishes he had helped level by fire, with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will, behavior that may well have been mirrored equally on the Danish side. Skåneland was a rather unpleasant place to dwell for an extended period.|$|E
