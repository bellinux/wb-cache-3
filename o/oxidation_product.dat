5|$|Boron was not {{recognized}} as an element until it was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard. In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate {{on one of the}} electrodes. In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element boracium. Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is an <b>oxidation</b> <b>product</b> of boron. Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified boron as an element in 1824. Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the {{absorption}} of a photon causes an electron to be excited into a singlet state of the Q band. The excited state undergoes an intersystem crossing from the singlet state to a triplet state {{in which there are}} two electrons with parallel spin. This species is, in effect, a free radical, and is very reactive and allows an electron to be transferred to acceptors that are adjacent to the chlorophyll in the chloroplast. In the process chlorophyll is oxidized. Later in the photosynthetic cycle, chlorophyll is reduced back again. This reduction ultimately draws electrons from water, yielding molecular oxygen as a final <b>oxidation</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E

40|$|Although several {{per cent}} of net carbon {{assimilation}} can be re-released as isoprene emissions {{to the atmosphere}} by many tropical plants, much uncertainty remains regarding its biological significance. In a previous study, we detected emissions of isoprene and its <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR) from tropical plants under high temperature/light stress, suggesting that isoprene is oxidized {{not only in the}} atmosphere but also within plants. However, a comprehensive analysis of the suite of isoprene <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> in plants has not been performed and production relationships with environmental stress have not been described. In this study, putative isoprene <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> from mango (Mangifera indica) branches under abiotic stress were first identified. High temperature/light and freezethaw treatments verified direct emissions of the isoprene <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> MVK and MACR together with the first observations of 3 -methyl furan (3 -MF) and 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol (MBO) as putative novel isoprene <b>oxidation</b> <b>products.</b> Mechanical wounding also stimulated emissions of MVK and MACR. Photosynthesis under (CO 2) -C- 13 resulted in rapid (< 30 min) labelling of up to five carbon atoms of isoprene, with a similar labelling pattern observed in the putative <b>oxidation</b> <b>products.</b> These observations highlight the need to investigate further the mechanisms of isoprene oxidation within plants under stress and its biological and atmospheric significance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Carotenoid <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> have various structures, {{among which}} {{epoxides}} and apo- or seco-carotenoids {{are the two}} main families. Although both these compound types are widely found in the natural world, the sensitivity of carotenoids to oxidation means {{they can also be}} an unwanted presence in in vitro assays. On the other hand, carotenoid <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> have also provided chemists with useful chemical tools for the structural identifica-tion of carotenoids, and in the natural world they are important biological mediators for plants and animals. In vitro, carotenoid <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> have been found to exert various effects which are either potentially beneficial or, on the contrary, detrimental to human health. However, to date, few carotenoid <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> have been found in humans. In order to isolate and characterize carotenoid <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> and identify their mechanism of formation, we set up two chemical oxidation systems. Lycopene was oxidized with potassium permanganate in a biphasic system to produce the fullest possible range of apo-lycopenals and some diapocarotene-dials. Biomimetic chemical systems of a heminic enzyme center were shown to oxidize lycopene and β-carotene into different families of mol-ecules. Analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array-UV/vis detector and a mass spectrometry detector (HPLC–DAD–MS) was used to gain in-sight into the possible mechanisms of formation of the carotenoid <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> formed by these biomimetic systems...|$|R

40|$|Moderate wine {{consumption}} {{has been}} shown to lower cardiovascular risk. One of the mechanisms could involve the control of postprandial hyperlipaemia, a well-defined risk factor for atherosclerosis, reasonably by reducing the absorption of lipid oxidised species from the meal. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether wine consumption with the meal is able to reduce the postprandial increase in plasma lipid hydroperoxides and cholesterol <b>oxidation</b> <b>products,</b> in human subjects. In two different study sessions, twelve healthy volunteers consumed the same test meal rich in oxidised and oxidisable lipids (a double cheeseburger), with 300 ml of water (control) or with 300 ml of red wine (wine). The postprandial plasma concentration of cholesterol <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> was measured by GCâ€"MS. The control meal induced a significant increase in the plasma concentration of lipid hydroperoxides and of two cholesterol <b>oxidation</b> <b>products,</b> 7 -β-hydroxycholesterol and 7 -ketocholesterol. The postprandial increase in lipid hydroperoxides and cholesterol <b>oxidation</b> <b>products</b> was fully prevented by wine when consumed with the meal. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that consumption of wine with the meal could prevent the postprandial increase in plasma cholesterol <b>oxidation</b> <b>products.</b> © 2011 The Authors...|$|R
