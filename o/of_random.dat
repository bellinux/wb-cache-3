The expectation and the variance <b>of</b> a fuzzy <b>random</b> variable {{is characterized by}} Fr'echet's principle in a metric space.

Keywords: Probability theory and statistics, Random fuzzy variables, Expectation and variance, Linear regression, Limit theorems 1 Introduction In many real situations the variability is given by two kinds of uncertainty: randomness (stochastic variability) and imprecision (vagueness). The concept <b>of</b> fuzzy <b>random</b> variables, introduced by Puri and Ralescu (1986) as a generalization <b>of</b> compact <b>random</b> sets, combines both randomness and imprecision.

When {{run on a}} finite array of cells with periodic boundary conditions, starting from a small seed <b>of</b> <b>random</b> cells centered within a larger empty neighborhood, it tends to fluctuate between ordered and chaotic states. However, with the same initial conditions on an unbounded set of cells its configurations tend to organize themselves into several types of simple moving particles.|$|E
5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} snare drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence <b>of</b> <b>random</b> sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch.

Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played, for example the pea whistle and siren.|$|E

A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.|$|E
