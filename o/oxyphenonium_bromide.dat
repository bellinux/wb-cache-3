Objectives: To compare the efficacy of treatment with Ispaghula husk and <b>Oxyphenonium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Methods: Total sixty patients diagnosed clinically as irritable bowel syndrome irrespective of subtype who fulfilled the Rome II criteria were included equally into two groups-Group-I (Ispaghula group) & Group-II (Oxyphenonium group). In Group-I patients were given 30 gm of Ispaghula husk at night daily and in Group-II patients were given 5 mg of <b>oxyphenonium</b> <b>bromide.</b> After six weeks the clinical parameters of both the groups recorded in the case record forms were taken for analysis. Results: The mean age of the patients in the Group- I were 33. 4 ± 11. 9 yrs and that of the patients in the Group-II were 31. 0 ± 17. 5 yrs. Male and female ratio in group I was 14 : 1 and in group II was 23 : 7. Most of the patients were recorded in the age group of 26 - 30 in both groups. Symptom free patients were graded in 16. 7 % patients in Group-I and in 20 % patients in Group- II. No improvement was occurred in 16. 7 % patients in Group-I and in 10 % patients in Group-II. Conclusions: Ispaghula husk shows the better efficacy to improve the symptoms of IBS like abdominal pain or discomfort and sense of well being than <b>Oxyphenonium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Oxephenonium bromide shows the better efficacy to decrease the stool frequency from base line than Ispaghula husk.
