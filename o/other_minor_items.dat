60|$|The Annuaire Statistique de la France, 1917, {{values the}} entire house {{property}} of France at $11,900,000,000 (59.5 milliard francs).[84] An estimate current in France of $4,000,000,000 (20 milliard francs) {{for the destruction of}} house property alone is, therefore, obviously wide of the mark.[85] $600,000,000 at pre-war prices, or say $1,250,000,000 at the present time, is much nearer the right figure. Estimates {{of the value of the}} land of France (apart from buildings) vary from $12,400,000,000 to $15,580,000,000, so that it would be extravagant to put the damage on this head as high as $500,000,000. Farm Capital for the whole of France has not been put by responsible authorities above $2,100,000,000.[86] There remain the loss of furniture and machinery, the damage to the coal-mines and the transport system, and many <b>other</b> <b>minor</b> <b>items.</b> But these losses, however serious, cannot be reckoned in value by hundreds of millions of dollars in respect of so small a part of France. In short, it will be difficult to establish a bill exceeding $2,500,000,000 for physical and material damage in the occupied and devastated areas of Northern France.[87] I am confirmed in this estimate by the opinion of M. René Pupin, the author of the most comprehensive and scientific estimate of the pre-war wealth of France,[88] which I did not come across until after my own figure had been arrived at. This authority estimates the material losses of the invaded regions at from $2,000,000,000 to $3,000,000,000 (10 to 15 milliards),[89] between which my own figure falls half-way.|$|E

The reasons why the Portuguese never succeeded in making themselves masters of Sonho are reduced by the missioner annalists to three. Firstly, the opposition of the people caused by fear; secondly, the objections of the Sonhese to buying arms and ammunition; and, thirdly, the small price paid by the Portuguese for [...] "captives." [...] The [...] "Most Reverend Cardinal Cibo," [...] writing {{in the name of}} the Sacred College, complained that the [...] "pernicious and abominable abuse of slave-selling" [...] was carried on under the eyes of the missioners, and peremptorily ordered them to remedy the evil. Finding this practically impossible, the holy men salved their consciences by ordering their flocks not to supply negroes to the heretical Hollanders and English, [...] "whose religion is so very contrary to ours," [...] but to the Portuguese, who would [...] "withdraw the poor souls out of the power of Lucifer." [...] One father goes so far, in his fear of heretical influences, as to remunerate by the gift of a slave the dealer Ferdinando Gomez, who had supplied him with [...] "a flask of wine for the sacrament and some other small things," [...] yet he owns F.

40|$|There {{has been}} much work {{regarding}} the deterministic EOQ with partial backordering. The majority of these studies assume no correlation in sales, so independent demands across items is applied in the models. However, it is generally recognized that cross-selling effects between items often appear in real contexts. Thus, incorporating such effects in the inventory model {{in the form of}} correlated demands makes it of more practical relevance. In this paper, the authors address a two-item inventory system where the demand of a <b>minor</b> <b>item</b> is correlated to that of a major item because of cross-selling. We firstly present a two-item EOQ model with identical order cycles, where the unmet demand of the major item can be partially backordered with lost sales whereas the demand of the <b>minor</b> <b>item</b> must be met without stockouts. This model is further extended to fit a more practical case where the order cycle of the major item is an integer multiple of that of the <b>minor</b> <b>item.</b> The optimal solutions of the two models, as well as the inventory decision procedures, are also developed. Comparative analysis on these two EOQ models has been drawn in the computational study which presents some insights into the parameter effect on the optimal inventory policy.
