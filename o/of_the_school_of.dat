5|$|Godwin is {{generally}} regarded as the founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>of</b> thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'.

He thought that {{the spread of the}} use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.|$|E
