25|$|A {{material}} is termed uniaxial {{when it has}} a single direction of symmetry in its optical behavior, which we term the <b>optic</b> <b>axis.</b> It {{also happens to be}} the axis of symmetry of the index ellipsoid (a spheroid in this case). The index ellipsoid could still be described according to the refractive indices, nα, nβ and nγ, along three coordinate axes, however in this case two are equal. So if nα = nβ corresponding to the x and y axes, then the extraordinary index is nγ corresponding to the z axis, which is also called the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> in this case.|$|E
25|$|When {{the light}} propagates either along or {{orthogonal}} to the <b>optic</b> <b>axis,</b> such a lateral shift does not occur. In the first case, both polarizations {{see the same}} effective refractive index, {{so there is no}} extraordinary ray. In the second case the extraordinary ray propagates at a different phase velocity (corresponding to ne) but is not an inhomogeneous wave. A crystal with its <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> in this orientation, parallel to the optical surface, may be used to create a waveplate, {{in which there is no}} distortion of the image but an intentional modification of the state of polarization of the incident wave. For instance, a quarter-wave plate is commonly used to create circular polarization from a linearly polarized source.|$|E

The optic elasticity axes were determined by the conoscopic figures with a polarizing microscope.

We developed and tested a system specifically aimed at CCAR measurements, based on low-cost commercial hardware, and that implements an adaptive research algorithm that selects and presents bright dots on a monitor to outline the borders of the blind spot, locate its center, and measure CCAR. We examined 10 healthy subjects who underwent four CCAR measurements to evaluate the reliability of the system and compared our results with those of fundus photographic examination. Our data showed an excyclophoria, with mean ocular torsion of 6. 4 ° in the right and 6. 7 ° in the left eye. These values are in keeping with those in the literature.

40|$|Purpose: The ideal lens-sparing {{radiotherapy}} {{technique for}} retinoblastoma calls for 100 % dose {{to the entire}} retina including the ora serrata and zero dose to the lens, Published techniques, most of which use photons, have not accomplished this ideal treatment. We describe here a technique that approaches this ideal configuration using electron beam therapy, Methods and Materials: Dose-modeling calculations were made using a computer program built around a proprietary algorithm, This program calculates 3 D dose distribution for electrons and photons and uses the Cimmino feasibility method for the inverse problem of beam weighting to achieve the prescribed dose, The algorithm has been verified in the ocular region by measurements in a RANDO phantom, To search for an ideal lens-sparing beam setup, a stylized phantom of an 8 -month-old infant was generated with built-in inhomogeneities, and a phantom of a 5 -year-old child was generated from a patient CT series, Results: Of more than 100 different beam setups tested, two 9 MeV electron beams at gantry angles plus and minus 26 degrees from the <b>optic</b> nerve <b>axis</b> achieved the best distribution. Both fields have a lens block and an isocenter between the globe and origin of the optic nerve. When equal doses are given to both fields, the entire extent of the retina (including ora serrata) received 100 %, while the lens received 10 % or less, Conclusion: The two-oblique-electron-beam technique here described appears to meet most of the stringent dosimetry needed to treat retinoblastoma, It is suitable {{for a range of}} ages, from infancy to early childhood years, (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R
25|$|A {{waveplate}} {{works by}} shifting the phase between two perpendicular polarization {{components of the}} light wave. A typical waveplate is simply a birefringent crystal with a carefully chosen orientation and thickness. The crystal is cut into a plate, with {{the orientation of the}} cut chosen so that the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> of the crystal is parallel to the surfaces of the plate. This results in two axes in the plane of the cut: the ordinary axis, with index of refraction no, and the extraordinary axis, with index of refraction ne. The ordinary axis is perpendicular to the <b>optic</b> <b>axis.</b> The extraordinary axis is parallel to the <b>optic</b> <b>axis.</b> For a light wave normally incident upon the plate, polarization component along the ordinary axis travels through the crystal with a speed vo = c/no, while the polarization component along the extraordinary axis travels with a speed ve = c/ne. This leads to a phase difference between the two components as they exit the crystal. When ne< no, as in calcite, the extraordinary axis is called the fast axis and the ordinary axis is called the slow axis. For nenbsp&> no the situation is reversed.|$|E
25|$|The stop {{determines whether}} the image will be vignetted. Larger stops {{can cause the}} {{intensity}} reaching the film or detector to fall off toward {{the edges of the}} picture, especially when, for off-axis points, a different stop becomes the aperture stop by virtue of cutting off more light than did the stop that was the aperture stop on the <b>optic</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{equally as}} {{important}} is optic character. Diamond and other cubic (and also amorphous) materials are isotropic, meaning that light entering a stone behaves {{the same way}} regardless of direction. Conversely, most minerals are anisotropic, which produces birefringence, or double refraction of light entering the material in all directions other than an <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> (a direction of single refraction in a doubly refractive material). Under low magnification, this birefringence is usually detectable as a visual doubling of a cut gemstone's rear facets or internal flaws. An effective diamond simulant should therefore be isotropic.|$|E
40|$|Craniopharyngiomas {{continue}} to be a challenge to manage, due to difficulty in complete excision and frequent recurrences. The management protocol remains controversial. They have a tendency to invade the normal brain tissues around them and due to their position in suprasellar region in close relationship with vital structures like <b>optic</b> apparatus, pituitary-hypothalamic <b>axis,</b> complete removal is often not feasible without causing serious morbidity and mortality. In this scenario, sub-total excision seems to be a better alternative, which is plagued by early and frequent recurrences. Radiotherapy has been used for increasing the progression free survival and to improve the overall quality of life. Recently Gamma knife radiosurgery has evolved as a promising technique of radiating the residual or recurrent tumor in a single session with great accuracy and precision. This helps in maximizing the radiation dose to the tumor with steep dose fall off to the surrounding tissue, and hence there is better control of the tumor and minimal radiation exposure to surrounding normal, vital brain tissues. We discuss the current strategies of Gamma knife treatment for craniopharyngioma and review the literature...|$|R
40|$|Laser wire {{cladding}} is a well-proven technology {{which came}} up with the first powerful laser sources already in 1974 in the United States [1]. The single-step metal deposition principle is commonly based on a lateral supply of the wire feedstock material. Important advantages are the complete material utilization, the clean and stable process, and the increased productivity in case of hot wire cladding. While the traditional technology is based on a single laser beam with the lateral and, thus, direction-dependent wire supply, special two-beam optics with centric wire supply have been developed. These optics enable an advantageous omni-directional welding operation in all technical welding positions [2]. Further developments at Fraunhofer IWS concern several designs of multi beam optics with centric wire supply to increase direction-independence and process stability [3]. The latest result with respect to industrial performance is a completely new generation of a beam splitting optic called IWS COAXwire. Special features of that new head are the low weight, compact design, easy handling as well as flexible interfaces to the operating system, laser source and wire feeder drive. For long-time stability, a cooling circuit for the optic elements and the wire supply, cross jets for deflection of splatters and down jets for dust protection have been integrated. Based on the reflective beam splitting concept, COAXwire aligns three single beams at 120 degrees to one and another around the <b>optic’s</b> center <b>axis</b> to a combined triple focus. With a fixed working distance, the focus diameter can be set by the choice of the fiber diameter and the collimation type. All common laser sources could be coupled via LLK-D, LLK-B or QBH connectors. As a very special feature, an integrated emergency-stop module protects the optic in the case of collision or process irregularities. COAXwire enables to use nearly all commercially available solid as well as cored wires, in fine or standard dimensions as filler material. Potential and current applications are wear protection of parts like hydraulic cylinders or forming dies with Fe-, Co- or Ni- base alloys, rapid design changes using similar materials as well as repair or generation of 3 D-parts with Ti- and Ni- aerospace alloys. The deposition rates at 4 kW laser power lie in the range of 100 to 250 cm³/h, depending on the material and the part’s geometry. Current developments aim at further improvement of the operating properties and conditions like process monitoring, closed shielding gas chamber to process oxygen affine materials, and also feeding drives for very fine wire diameters. Finally, the realization of advanced omni-directional cladding and buildup strategies on robot machines lies in the focus of process development...|$|R
40|$|To {{measure the}} optic disc {{rotation}} around the {{vertical and horizontal}} disc axis and to evaluate associations with general and ocular parameters. Population-based study. In the Beijing Eye Study, 3468 participants (mean age: 64. 6 ± 9. 8 years; range: 50 - 93 years) underwent an ophthalmological examination which included spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) with enhanced depth imaging. Using the OCT images, we determined {{the amount of the}} rotation of the optic disc (defined as Bruch´s membrane opening (BMO)) around the vertical axis and horizontal <b>axis.</b> <b>Optic</b> disc rotation measurements were available for 3037 (87. 6 %) individuals. In multivariate analysis, larger optic disc rotation around the vertical axis (range:- 4. 90 ° to 41. 0 °) was associated (regression coefficient r: 0. 27) with high axial myopia (axial length ≥ 26. 5 mm) (P< 0. 001;standardized regression coefficient beta beta: 0. 09), longer disc-fovea distance (P = 0. 001;beta: 0. 09) and wider parapapillary beta/gamma zone (P< 0. 001;beta 0. 12). Larger optic disc rotation around the horizontal axis (range:- 7. 10 ° to 26. 4 °) was associated (r: 0. 32) with high axial myopia (P = 0. 001;beta: 0. 08), larger optic disc-fovea angle (P< 0. 001;beta: 0. 13), thinner superior nasal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (P< 0. 001;beta:- 0. 19) and thicker inferior nasal RNFL thickness (P< 0. 001;beta: 0. 17). Vertical optic disc rotation was associated with highly myopic axial elongation, increased disc-fovea distance and development or enlargement of parapapillary, Bruch´s membrane free, gamma zone, while macular Bruch´s membrane length is not affected. Horizontal optic disc rotation was associated with inferior dislocation of the fovea, in addition to a thinner superior nasal RNFL and thicker inferior nasal RNFL. The latter association may be taken into account in the interpretation of RNFL thickness profiles...|$|R
25|$|Uniaxial {{birefringence}} {{is classified}} as positive when the extraordinary index of refraction ne {{is greater than the}} ordinary index no. Negative birefringence means that Δn = ne − no is less than zero. In other words, the polarization of the fast (or slow) wave is perpendicular to the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> when the birefringence of the crystal is positive (or negative, respectively). In the case of biaxial crystals, all three of the principal axes have different refractive indices, so this designation does not apply.

25|$|The second {{design is}} the top-entry holder {{consists}} of a cartridge that is several cm long with a bore drilled down the cartridge axis. The specimen is loaded into the bore, possibly using a small screw ring to hold the sample in place. This cartridge is inserted into an airlock with the bore perpendicular to the TEM <b>optic</b> <b>axis.</b> When sealed, the airlock is manipulated to push the cartridge such that the cartridge falls into place, where the bore hole becomes aligned with the beam axis, such that the beam travels down the cartridge bore and into the specimen. Such designs are typically unable to be tilted without blocking the beam path or interfering with the objective lens.|$|E
25|$|Apertures are annular {{metallic}} plates, {{through which}} electrons that are further than a fixed {{distance from the}} <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> may be excluded. These consist of a small metallic disc that is sufficiently thick to prevent electrons from passing through the disc, whilst permitting axial electrons. This permission of central electrons in a TEM causes two effects simultaneously: firstly, apertures decrease the beam intensity as electrons are filtered from the beam, which may be desired {{in the case of}} beam sensitive samples. Secondly, this filtering removes electrons that are scattered to high angles, which may be due to unwanted processes such as spherical or chromatic aberration, or due to diffraction from interaction within the sample.|$|E
25|$|In a {{birefringent}} material, a wave {{consists of}} two polarization components which generally are governed by different effective refractive indices. The so-called slow ray is the component for which the material has the higher effective refractive index (slower phase velocity), while the fast ray is the one with a lower effective refractive index. When a beam is incident on such a material from air (or any material with a lower refractive index), the slow ray is thus refracted more towards the normal than the fast ray. In the figure {{at the top of}} the page, it can be seen that refracted ray with s polarization in the direction of the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> (thus the extraordinary ray) is the slow ray in this case.|$|E
500|$|As a {{gemstone}} used in jewelry, {{silicon carbide}} is called [...] "synthetic moissanite" [...] or just [...] "moissanite" [...] after the mineral name. Moissanite {{is similar to}} diamond in several important respects: it is transparent and hard (9–9.5 on the Mohs scale, compared to 10 for diamond), with a refractive index between 2.65 and 2.69 (compared to 2.42 for diamond). Moissanite is somewhat harder than common cubic zirconia. Unlike diamond, moissanite can be strongly birefringent. For this reason, moissanite jewels are cut along the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> of the crystal to minimize birefringent effects. It is lighter (density 3.21 g/cm3 vs. 3.53 g/cm3), and much more resistant to heat than diamond. This results in a stone of higher luster, sharper facets and good resilience. Loose moissanite stones may be placed directly into wax ring moulds for lost-wax casting, as can diamond, as moissanite remains undamaged by temperatures up to 1800°C. Moissanite has become popular as a diamond substitute, and may be misidentified as diamond, since its thermal conductivity is closer to diamond than any other substitute. Many thermal diamond-testing devices cannot distinguish moissanite from diamond, but the gem is distinct in its birefringence and a very slight green or yellow fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Some moissanite stones also have curved, string-like inclusions, which diamonds never have.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} type of birefringence {{is described}} as uniaxial, meaning {{that there is a}} single direction governing the optical anisotropy whereas all directions perpendicular to it (or at a given angle to it) are optically equivalent. Thus rotating the material around this axis does not change its optical behavior. This special direction is known as the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> of the material. Light whose polarization is perpendicular to the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> is governed by a refractive index no (for [...] "ordinary"). Light whose polarization is {{in the direction of the}} <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> sees an optical index ne (for [...] "extraordinary"). For any ray direction there is a linear polarization direction perpendicular to the <b>optic</b> <b>axis,</b> and this is called an ordinary ray. However, for ray directions not parallel to the <b>optic</b> <b>axis,</b> the polarization direction perpendicular to the ordinary ray's polarization will be partly in the direction of the <b>optic</b> <b>axis,</b> and this is called an extraordinary ray. The ordinary ray will always experience a refractive index of no, whereas the refractive index of the extraordinary ray will be in between no and ne, depending on the ray direction as described by the index ellipsoid. The magnitude of the difference is quantified by the birefringence: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{different}} angles of refraction {{for the two}} polarization components are shown in the figure {{at the top of}} the page, with the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> along the surface (and perpendicular to the plane of incidence), so that the angle of refraction is different for the p polarization (the [...] "ordinary ray" [...] in this case, having its polarization perpendicular to the <b>optic</b> <b>axis)</b> and the s polarization (the [...] "extraordinary ray" [...] with a polarization component along the <b>optic</b> <b>axis).</b> In addition, a distinct form of double refraction occurs in cases where the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> is not along the refracting surface (nor exactly normal to it); in this case the electric polarization of the birefringent material is not exactly in the direction of the wave's electric field for the extraordinary ray. The direction of power flow (given by the Poynting vector) for this inhomogenous wave is at a finite angle from the direction of the wave vector resulting in an additional separation between these beams. So even in the case of normal incidence, where the angle of refraction is zero (according to Snell's law, regardless of effective index of refraction), the energy of the extraordinary ray may be propagated at an angle. This is commonly observed using a piece of calcite cut appropriately with respect to its <b>optic</b> <b>axis,</b> placed above a paper with writing, as in the above two photographs.|$|E
2500|$|In technology, {{molecules}} {{in which the}} <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> is subject to manipulation during a mesophase have become commercial products {{as they can be}} used to manufacture display devices.

2500|$|However {{materials}} {{in which all}} three refractive indices are different are termed biaxial and {{the origin of this}} term is more complicated and frequently misunderstood. In a uniaxial crystal, different polarization components of a beam will travel at different phase velocities, except for rays in the direction of what we call the <b>optic</b> <b>axis.</b> Thus the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> has the particular property that rays in that direction do not exhibit birefringence, with all polarizations in such a beam experiencing the same index of refraction. It is very different when the three principal refractive indices are all different; then an incoming ray in any of those principle directions will still encounter two different refractive indices. But it turns out that there are two special directions (at an angle to all of the 3 axes) where the refractive indices for different polarizations are again equal. For this reason, these crystals were designated as biaxial, with the two [...] "axes" [...] in this case referring to ray directions in which propagation does not experience birefringence.|$|E
2500|$|Georges Friedel (1922) called {{attention}} to the [...] "mesomorphic states of matter" [...] in his scientific assessment of observations of the so-called liquid crystals. Everyone knows a crystal is solid and to crystallize is to make solid. The oxymoron of the liquid crystal is resolved through the notion of mesophases.

But the catch-phrase of the liquid crystal caught on, even when displaced in technical writing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} the {{optically}} [...] "improved" [...] simulants was synthetic rutile (TiO2, pure titanium oxide). Introduced in 1947–48, synthetic rutile possesses plenty of life when cut—perhaps too much life for a diamond simulant. Synthetic rutile's RI and dispersion (2.8 and 0.33) are so much higher than diamond that the resultant brilliants look almost opal-like in their display of prismatic colors. Synthetic rutile is also doubly refractive: although some stones are cut with the table perpendicular to the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> to hide this property, merely tilting the stone will reveal the doubled back facets.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{uniaxial}} material, one ray behaves {{according to}} the normal law of refraction (corresponding to the ordinary refractive index), so an incoming ray at normal incidence remains normal to the refracting surface. However, as explained above, the other polarization can be deviated from normal incidence, which cannot be described using the law of refraction. This thus {{became known as the}} extraordinary ray. The terms [...] "ordinary" [...] and [...] "extraordinary" [...] are still applied to the polarization components perpendicular to and not perpendicular to the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> respectively, even in cases where no double refraction is involved.|$|E
2500|$|CZ had {{virtually}} no competition until the 1998 introduction of moissanite (SiC; silicon carbide). Moissanite is superior to cubic zirconia in two ways: its hardness (8.5–9.25) and low SG (3.2). The former property results in facets that are sometimes as crisp as a diamond's, while the latter property makes simulated moissanite somewhat harder to spot when unset (although still disparate enough to detect). However, unlike diamond and cubic zirconia, moissanite is strongly birefringent. This manifests as the same [...] "drunken vision" [...] effect seen in synthetic rutile, although to a lesser degree. All moissanite is cut with the table perpendicular to the <b>optic</b> <b>axis</b> in order to hide this property from above, but when viewed under magnification at only a slight tilt the doubling of facets (and any inclusions) is readily apparent.|$|E
2500|$|Setting {{either of}} the factors in {{equation}} (8) to zero will define an ellipsoidal surface {{in the space of}} wave vectors k that are allowed for a given ω.

The second defines a spheroid symmetric about the z axis. This solution corresponds to the [...] "extraordinary rays" [...] in which the effective refractive index is in between [...] no and [...] ne, depending on the direction of k. Therefore, for any arbitrary direction of propagation (other than {{in the direction of the}} <b>optic</b> <b>axis),</b> two distinct wavevectors k are allowed corresponding to the polarizations of the ordinary and extraordinary rays.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} mode of {{operation}} for a TEM is the bright field imaging mode. In this mode the contrast formation comes from the sample having varying thickness or density. Thicker areas of the sample and denser areas or regions with a higher atomic number will block more electrons and appear dark in an image, while thinner, lower density, lower atomic number regions and areas with no sample in the beam path will appear bright. The term [...] "bright field" [...] refers to the bright background field {{where there is no}} sample and most of the beam electrons reach the image. The image is assumed to be a simple two dimensional projection of the sample's thickness and density down the <b>optic</b> <b>axis,</b> and to a first approximation may be modelled via Beer's law, more complex analyses require the modelling of the sample image to include phase information.|$|E
2500|$|When {{those two}} {{propagation}} constants are equal then the effective refractive index {{is independent of}} polarization, and there is consequently no birefringence encountered by a wave traveling in that particular direction. For a uniaxial crystal, this is the <b>optic</b> <b>axis,</b> the z direction {{according to the above}} construction. But when all three refractive indices (or permittivities), nx, ny and nz are distinct, it can be shown that there are exactly two such directions (where the two ellipsoids intersect); these directions are not at all obvious and do not lie along any of the three principal axes (x, y, and z according to the above convention). Historically that accounts {{for the use of the}} term [...] "biaxial" [...] for such crystals, as the existence of exactly two such special directions (considered [...] "axes") was discovered well before polarization and birefringence were understood physically.
