25|$|The {{immediate}} ancestry of the cultivated olive is unknown. O. europaea {{may have}} arisen from O. chrysophylla in northern tropical Africa and was {{introduced into the}} countries of the Mediterranean Basin via Egypt and then Crete or the Levant, Tunisia, and Asia Minor. Fossil Olea pollen has been found in Macedonia and other places around the Mediterranean, indicating that this genus is an original element of the Mediterranean flora. Fossilized leaves of Olea were found in the palaeosols of the volcanic Greek island of Santorini (Thera) and were dated about 37,000 BP. Imprints of larvae of <b>olive</b> <b>whitefly</b> Aleurolobus (Aleurodes) olivinus were found on the leaves. The same insect is commonly found today on olive leaves, showing that the plant-animal co-evolutionary relations have not changed since that time. Other leaves found on the same island are dated back to 60,000 BP, making them the oldest known olives from the Mediterranean.|$|E
