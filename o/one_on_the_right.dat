5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve is paired, meaning {{there are}} two nerves, {{one on the left}} and <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> side of the body. Each is formed as three roots {{immediately}} converge above the upper border of the sacrotuberous ligament and the coccygeus muscle. The three roots become two cords when the middle and lower root join to form the lower cord, and these in turn unite to form the pudendal nerve proper just proximal to the sacrospinous ligament. The three roots are derived from the ventral rami of the second, third, and fourth sacral spinal nerves, with the primary contribution coming from the fourth.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August, General Guglielmo Nasi led 35,000 Italian troops, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of them native fighters, across the border into British Somaliland. The invaders were organized into three columns: one on the left advancing north to the coast before swinging east to Berbera, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> making the opposite motion on the Burao road, and a main central column, led by Carlo de Simone, containing the bulk of his forces. The central column would force the British positions at Tug Argan and make straight for Berbera, effectively ending the campaign in one fell swoop. Nasi advanced quickly upon Hargeisa, forcing harrying British camel soldiers to withdraw by 5 August. After a few days of rest and rearmament, the march was resumed on 8 August. After two days of probing, de Simone reached the Tug Argan gap and prepared for the major assault, scheduled for 11 August. In the meantime, General A. R. Godwin-Austen arrived to take command of the enlarged British army.|$|E

5|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Bouba/Kiki phenomenon is a case of ideasthesia. Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> Bouba. It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices. For example, according to that hypothesis, representations of sharp inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations of sharp inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al. have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and wine tasting is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed {{to sit on a}} flat surface, contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of the}} controller and three knobs: <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{emerge as}} {{branches of the}} left and right subclavian arteries. They travel upward through transverse foramina – spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the medulla. They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E

25|$|The French {{initially}} occupied {{both sides}} of the Chao Phraya in Bangkok, with two fortresses, one on the left bank (the Bangkok fortress) and <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> bank (the Thonburi fortress). Seeing that the position would be difficult to defend, especially since communications would become nearly impossible at low tide, the French decided to regroup in the larger fortress, on the left bank of the river. The French destroyed parts of the fortifications, split 18 cannons and spiked the rest. Soon after they left the smaller fort, Siamese troops invested it and began to set up cannons and mortars to bombard the French positions. Forty cannons were set up there, which were in a very good position to shoot at the French fortress {{on the other side of}} the river.|$|E

25|$|We take an illustrative {{synthetic}} bivariate {{data set}} of 50 points {{to illustrate the}} construction of histograms. This requires the choice of an anchor point (the lower left corner of the histogram grid). For the histogram on the left, we choose (−1.5,−1.5): for the <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> we shift the anchor point by 0.125 in both directions to (−1.625,−1.625). Both histograms have a binwidth of 0.5, so any differences are due to {{the change in the}} anchor point only. The colour-coding indicates the number of data points which fall into a bin: 0=white, 1=pale yellow, 2=bright yellow, 3=orange, 4=red. The left histogram appears to indicate that the upper half has a higher density than the lower half, whereas the reverse is the case for the right-hand histogram, confirming that histograms are highly sensitive to the placement of the anchor point.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} itself dates from {{a century later}} and was erected over the earlier burial ground. The building of this huge, oblong Gothic cloister began in 1278 by the architect Giovanni di Simone. He died in 1284 when Pisa suffered a defeat in a naval battle of Meloria against the Genoans. The cemetery was only completed in 1464. The outer wall is composed of 43 blind arches. There are two doorways. The <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> is crowned by a gracious Gothic tabernacle and contains the Virgin Mary with Child surrounded by four saints. It is the work from {{the second half of}} the 14th century by a follower of Giovanni Pisano. Most of the tombs are under the arcades, although a few are on the central lawn. The inner court is surrounded by elaborate round arches with slender mullions and plurilobed tracery.|$|E
25|$|This {{middle section}} stood on six arches, while both sides had smaller arches (<b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> and {{two on the}} left) which served as spillways in case the river overflowed. At its normal level, the river flowed between the three central arches, {{constrained}} by double-wedge-shaped reinforcements of masonry, placed at the two outer pillars and intended to prevent their undermining by the river. These masonry structures were - according to the archaeological record - markedly higher on the upstream side (8.15m) than on the downstream (4.76m). In addition, wedge-shaped breakwaters were added on the piers, although not all piers feature them on both sides. The clear spans of the three central arches have been determined at 23.52m for the central arch and 14.95m for the two flanking arches, while the two piers supporting the central arch were measured at 9.60m.|$|E
