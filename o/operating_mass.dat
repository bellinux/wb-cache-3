50|$|Solid rockets {{can provide}} high thrust for {{relatively}} low cost. For this reason, solids {{have been used}} as initial stages in rockets (for example the Space Shuttle), while reserving high specific impulse engines, especially less massive hydrogen-fueled engines, for higher stages. In addition, solid rockets have a long history as the final boost stage for satellites due to their simplicity, reliability, compactness and reasonably high mass fraction. A spin-stabilized solid rocket motor is sometimes added when extra velocity is required, such as for a mission to a comet or the outer solar system, because a spinner does not require a guidance system (on the newly added stage). Thiokol's extensive family of mostly titanium-cased Star space motors has been widely used, especially on Delta launch vehicles and as spin-stabilized upper stages to launch satellites from the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle.

Construction's design implemented an asymmetrical elastic characteristic by one flat spring with two absolutely rigid intermediate supports. Eigenfrequency is defined for corresponding location intermediate supports based on the finite element method. Stress-strain state of the elastic element is graphically represented {{at the expense of}} static displacement of local mass. Contact task is considered and contact force between the flat spring and cylindrical support is calculated. Also, contact stiffness is determinate. The parameters of volumetric stress state of the contact, calculated analytically and by modeling in SolidWorks Simulation are shown. The dynamics of the vibro-impact rod system with kinematic's disturbance is modeled. Contact and equivalent stresses during operation of the vibro-impact rod system are determined. 1. Introduction. Vibro-impact systems are the basis of technological machines and processes of environments with challenging physical and mechanical characteristics.

40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} calculations done {{to determine the}} relief capacity of the solenoid vacuum pumping line. The calculations were done by David Bell, a co-op student from the University of Wisconsin. The calculations are attached. The conclusion is that the vacuum pumping line has a venting capacity of 129 g/s warm helium or 298 g/s warm nitrogen. Both of these capacities are {{much larger than the}} expected <b>operating</b> <b>mass</b> flow rates of the liquid helium (5 to 15 g/s) or liquid nitrogen (2 or 3 g/s) circuits. The calculations assume the solenoid vacuum vessel is at 3 psig and the relief plate is set at 1. 5 psig. Additional calculations were done to prove that the venting capacity of the vacuum pumping line exceeded flowrates due to a failure mode. These calculations are attached. Since the system is not finalized, (pipe sizes not determined, components sized [...] .) the calculations were done by first picking reasonable line sizes based on known allowed pressure drops in the system and then doing a maximum delivery rate calculation if a line was completely severed in the vacuum space of the solenoid/control dewar. The numbers from these calculations say that failure mode flow rates are 80 g/s liquid helium or 80 g/s liquid nitrogen. Both these values are less than the capacity of the relief line. In the five months since the (12 / 92 Dave Bell) calculations were done, some changes occured to the relief path. The most notable is that the radiation shield is now considered to be 6. 625 -inch O. D. instead of 6. 00 -inch used in the venting calculation. This change would tend to lower the capacity numbers. Another change was that for about half the venting path the chimney vacuum shell size was increased to 10 -inch pipe. This change tends to increase the capacity numbers which were done assuming 8 -inch pipe. These changes taken together probably offset each other or make the capacity numbers better. In either case, since the margin of safety is large, the calculations have not been redone...|$|E
