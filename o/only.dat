5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies {{has been that}} most of the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies are associated with <b>only</b> a small increased risk of the disease, and have <b>only</b> a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with <b>only</b> a few showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies <b>only</b> account for a minority of this variance.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, <b>only</b> 43,000 Persians {{survived the}} battle. The number who died, of course, {{depends on how}} many there were in the first place; there would be 257,000 dead by Herodotus' reckoning. Herodotus claims that the Greeks as a whole lost <b>only</b> 159 men. Furthermore, he claims that <b>only</b> Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians died, since they were the <b>only</b> ones who fought. Plutarch, who had access to other sources, gives 1,360 Greek {{casualties}}, while both Ephorus and Diodorus Siculus tally the Greek casualties to over 10,000.|$|E
5|$|After the Test, Bradman managed <b>only</b> six as Australia scored 317 and 0/22 {{to defeat}} Middlesex by ten wickets in their <b>only</b> county match between Tests. He was again {{caught in the}} leg trap by Denis Compton.|$|E

5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects <b>only</b> human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can <b>only</b> react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can <b>only</b> attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that <b>only</b> infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent <b>only</b> {{a small percentage of}} all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents <b>only</b> a snapshot of evolution. The transition itself can <b>only</b> be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which never demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly divergent forms.|$|E
5|$|Burns and Rigby {{found several}} prototiles, {{including}} the Koch snowflake, {{that may be}} used to tile the plane <b>only</b> by using copies of the prototile in two or more different sizes. An earlier paper by Danzer, Grünbaum, and Shephard provides another example, a convex pentagon that tiles the plane <b>only</b> when combined in two sizes. Although the Pythagorean tiling uses two different sizes of squares, the square does not have the same property as these prototiles of <b>only</b> tiling by similarity, because it also is possible to tile the plane using <b>only</b> squares of a single size.|$|E
5|$|Cardinals who {{simultaneously}} {{were also}} bishops usually {{appear in the}} documents with both titles: cardinalitial and episcopal.

5|$|Despite playing <b>only</b> twelve {{seasons and}} 657 games (of which <b>only</b> his first nine seasons, totaling 621 games, were full seasons), and <b>only</b> playing 47 NHL games after his 27th birthday, Orr {{accomplished}} many records and achievements, {{a number of}} which still stand today, and are listed below.|$|E
5|$|During the drawn Third Test, Barnes {{was injured}} and Ian Johnson {{was used as}} a {{makeshift}} opener because Morris was the <b>only</b> specialist opener left in the team after the omission of Brown. In the meantime, Barnes's injury had opened up a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Harvey managed <b>only</b> ten and Brown <b>only</b> eight as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their <b>only</b> county match between Tests.|$|E
5|$|Earth (1 AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the largest}} and densest of the inner planets, the <b>only</b> one known to have current {{geological}} activity, and the <b>only</b> place where life is known to exist.

Earth's atmosphere is radically {{different from those of the}} other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the <b>only</b> large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Five {{players have}} scored two World Cup hat-tricks, Savea being the <b>only</b> one to have scored {{all of them}} in the same tournament. Of the six teams in the Six Nations and four in the Rugby Championship teams, <b>only</b> Italy have failed to score a hat-trick at the World Cup. Fiji, Namibia and Samoa are the <b>only</b> other teams to score a hat-trick, which were scored by Vereniki Goneva, Kotze and Alesana Tuilagi, respectively.

5|$|For instance, a 2008 {{study of}} medical systems in Zambia {{published}} by the International Anesthesia Research Society found that <b>only</b> 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency medical system that transported patients. Just 24 percent of ambulances carried oxygen, with <b>only</b> 40 percent carrying drugs of any kind. Furthermore, <b>only</b> 29 intensive care beds were available {{in all of the}} hospitals surveyed, and these were <b>only</b> found in major hospitals. This implies that the majority of critically ill patients are receiving care in general hospital wards.|$|E

5|$|If {{infinite}} matrices {{are used}} to describe linear maps, then <b>only</b> those matrices can be used all of whose columns have but {{a finite number of}} nonzero entries, for the following reason. For a matrix A to describe a linear map f: V→W, bases for both spaces must have been chosen; recall that by definition this means that every vector in the space can be written uniquely as a (finite) linear combination of basis vectors, so that written as a (column) vectorv of coefficients, <b>only</b> finitely many entries v'i are nonzero. Now the columns of A describe the images by f of individual basis vectors of V in the basis of W, which is <b>only</b> meaningful if these columns have <b>only</b> finitely many nonzero entries. There is no restriction on the rows of A however: in the product A·v there are <b>only</b> finitely many nonzero coefficients of v involved, so every one of its entries, even if it is given as an infinite sum of products, involves <b>only</b> finitely many nonzero terms and is therefore well defined. Moreover, this amounts to forming a linear combination of the columns of A that effectively involves <b>only</b> finitely many of them, whence the result has <b>only</b> finitely many nonzero entries, because each of those columns do. One also sees that products of two matrices of the given type is well defined (provided as usual that the column-index and row-index sets match), is again of the same type, and corresponds to the composition of linear maps.|$|E
