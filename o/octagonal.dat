5|$|The 12th-century font {{was removed}} {{when the church}} was made redundant; it {{is now in the}} nearby church of St Maelog, Llanfaelog. The church now houses a 15th-century <b>octagonal</b> font made of gritstone, {{positioned}} on an <b>octagonal</b> stem. The communion rails are dated 1764 and is of a simple design; the pulpit, also 18th-century, has recessed panels.|$|E
5|$|The <b>octagonal</b> Market Cross {{was built}} in 1846 by Benjamin Ferrey.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1483, it has {{a square}} base, a {{transitional}} segment leading into an <b>octagonal</b> shaft, then a 10 - sided polygon shaft, followed by a cylindrical shaft that consists of 8 brick pillars, each two adjoined by bricks in between. The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to {{have been used in}} Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is <b>octagonal</b> is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this shaft is the second <b>octagonal</b> shaft which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting. A second balcony separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft, decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the finial top of the minaret.|$|E
5|$|More of the <b>octagonal</b> $50 {{pieces were}} sold {{than of the}} round, as the former proved more popular because of the {{association}} with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. commemorative coin, about 483—the runner up being the <b>octagonal</b> with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern and}} the western <b>octagonal</b> courtyards lead to the central bathing complex.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Western Europe, {{in the nineteenth}} century there was a return to Medieval styles, grouped together into a Gothic revival. Early examples included Adams' St George's Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh (1792), which included <b>octagonal</b> lantern on ogival arches. Other examples included James Playfair's chapel-like Farnell Church (c. 1789) and Richard Crichton's towered Craig Parish Church (1799). In the early nineteenth century examples influenced by the English Perpendicular included Glenorchy Church (1810–11), built by the Earl of Breadalbane, John Paterson's <b>octagonal</b> reconstruction of St Paul's Church, Perth (c. 1800–07) and Fetteresso Church, Stonehaven (1810–12). Examples of a more explicitly perpendicular form can be seen in Gillespie Graham's Collace (1813), or David Hamilton's Old Erskine (1813–14).|$|E
5|$|Passage {{through the}} portal and <b>octagonal</b> chamber leads into the mosque's central {{courtyard}}. The courtyard measures approximately 160 feet by 130 feet, and features high arched galleries surrounding a central brick paved courtyard - a typical feature of imperial Persian mosques in Iran.|$|E
5|$|The Ashland City Band (ACB) was {{organized}} in the late 19thcentury as the Ashland Brass Band. The band used an <b>octagonal</b> gazebo-style bandstand in Lithia Park until the Butler Memorial Band Shell was built in Lithia Park in 1946. The ACB gives public concerts there each summer between June and August.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Point Light was {{designed}} by Alfred Hopkins and Associates to be a 41-foot (12m) <b>octagonal</b> tower. Construction of the tower was completed in March 1943; it is built of brown concrete blocks and topped with an <b>octagonal</b> wooden lantern. During the restoration effort, {{it was discovered that}} six different types of concrete blocks were used in the construction. The tower has a total of five windows, with two facing south and one for the north, east and west. The lantern gallery deck is constructed of concrete and lined with thirty two Italian marble balusters, originally imported from Italy around 1900. The interior has an iron ladder, originally wooden, that leads up to the watchroom level. The lighthouse design and masonry tower have Colonial Revival elements. It is the last lighthouse built in the state of Connecticut as an official navigational aid.|$|E
5|$|The House of Foryx is {{a magical}} house {{situated}} somewhere deep in another forest, surrounded by perpetual winter. It is an <b>octagonal</b> building flanked by four <b>octagonal</b> pillars. Here all times meet, and characters {{can go from}} one time to another. Characters can come into the building from any time, but can leave it in their own time only if another from that time stands outside the main door; otherwise they are lost in time, and may even {{end up in a}} time when the House of Foryx did not exist, giving them no chance of ever returning. The house is named after Foryx, a huge elephantine creature in the Septimus Heap universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{is considered to}} be postmodern. Four sides of granite and silver-tinted glass make up the base, which give way to stepped transitions, eventually resulting in an <b>octagonal,</b> entirely glass curtain wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{church of}} Maribojoc resembled a cross or {{cruciform}} with a low, four-sided pyramidical roof and <b>octagonal</b> cupola. Walls were consistently divided into {{thick and thin}} portions designed with finely cut coral stones on the sides.|$|E
5|$|The west front has two {{flights of}} broad, balustraded steps {{leading up to}} the central door. Inside is a full-height hall with a part-hipped valley roof. On either side of this are <b>octagonal</b> turrets with cupolas and delicately pierced parapets. To the left of the hall is the former medieval kitchen with a balustraded parapet and {{buttress}}es. To the right is a range of parapetted rooms with a stepped buttress at the corner. The south front was plain, being the inside north wall of the original abbey church which was pulled down, but was rebuilt by William Talbot in 1828 to include bay windows. At this end of the building is Sharington's tower, an <b>octagonal,</b> three-storey tower, topped with a belvedere, balustrade and stair turret.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the organ}} is an <b>octagonal</b> pulpit {{approached}} by two flights of stairs. The stairways to the pulpit have cast iron balustrades and hardwood handrails. On {{each side of}} the pulpit is a communion rail.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{architectural}} historian John Harvey, the <b>octagonal</b> chapter house, built about 1332 by William Ramsey, was the earliest example of Perpendicular Gothic. This {{is confirmed by}} Alec Clifton-Taylor, who notes that the chapter house and St Stephen's chapel at Westminster Abbey predate the early Perpendicular work at Gloucester Cathedral by several years. The foundations of the chapter house were recently made visible in the redeveloped south churchyard of the new cathedral.|$|E
5|$|After 1728, Hylton's second son, John Hylton, de jure 18th Baron Hylton added a {{complementary}} south wing (its foundation wall still extant), crenellations to both wings {{and removed the}} door on the north wing. He also changed the circular bartizan on {{the north end of the}} west front, to an <b>octagonal</b> turret and removed the portcullis from the west entrance.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} $50 pieces, public or private, are very rare and {{valuable}} today: One of Humbert's <b>octagonal</b> pieces, dated 1851 {{and with a}} lettered edge, sold at auction in 2010 for $546,250. The only $50 piece produced by the United States Bureau of the Mint prior to 1915 was the 1877 pattern half union, produced experimentally at the Philadelphia Mint, {{though it was not}} approved as a circulating coin.|$|E
5|$|An <b>octagonal</b> baptistry {{connected}} to the near the altar of Saint Mary Magdalene in the gospel transept was constructed in 1853. Inside the baptistry is an earlier image of San Juan Bautista, a baptismal font and an unusual retablo built in 1852 housing the Santo Entierro in a glass coffin and the Nuestra Señora de los Dolores in the central niche.|$|E
5|$|Canberra is {{a planned}} {{city and the}} inner-city area was {{originally}} designed by Walter Burley Griffin, a major 20th-century American architect. Within the central area of the city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid. Griffin's proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and <b>octagonal</b> streets emanating from several radii. However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.|$|E
5|$|Centralized {{buildings}} of circular or <b>octagonal</b> plan also became used for baptistries and reliquaries {{due to the}} suitability of those shapes for assembly around a single object. Baptisteries began {{to be built in}} the manner of domed mausolea during the 4th century in Italy. The <b>octagonal</b> Lateran Baptistery or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been the first, and the style spread during the 5th century. The Church of the Holy Apostles, or Apostoleion, probably planned by Constantine but built by his successor Constantius in the new capital city of Constantinople, combined the congregational basilica with the centralized shrine. With a similar plan to that of the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites, four naves projected from a central rotunda containing Constantine's tomb and spaces for the tombs of the twelve Apostles. Above the center may have been a clerestory with a wooden dome roofed with bronze sheeting and gold accents.|$|E
5|$|Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century, Henry VIII {{sold it to}} Sir William Sharington for £783, who {{demolished}} {{the abbey}} church and converted the abbey into a house, starting work in about 1539. So {{as not to be}} incommoded by villagers passing close to his residence, he is said to have sold the church bells and used the proceeds to erect a bridge over the River Ray for their convenience. Few other alterations were made to the monastic buildings themselves: the cloisters, for example, still stand below the living accommodation. About 1550, Sir William added an <b>octagonal</b> tower containing two small chambers, one above the other; the lower one was reached through the main rooms, and was for storing and viewing his treasures; the upper one, for banqueting, was only accessible by walking across the leads of the roof. In each chamber is a central <b>octagonal</b> stone table, carved with up-to-date Renaissance ornament. A mid-16th century stone conduit house stands over the spring from which water was conducted to the house. Further additions were made over the centuries, and the house now has various grand reception rooms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of Somerton the wide market square, with its <b>octagonal</b> roofed market cross, is {{surrounded}} by old houses, while close by is the 13th century Church of St Michael and All Angels. Somerton also had links with Muchelney Abbey in the Middle Ages. The BBC drama The Monocled Mutineer was filmed in Somerton from 1985 to 1986.|$|E
5|$|Justinian and {{his successors}} modernized {{frontier}} fortifications throughout the century. The example at Qasr ibn Wardan (564) {{in the desert}} of eastern Syria is particularly impressive, containing a governor's palace, barracks, and a church built with techniques and to plans possibly imported from Constantinople. The church dome is unusual in that the pendentives sprang from an <b>octagonal</b> drum, rather than the four main arches, and {{in that it was}} made of brick, which was rare in Syria.|$|E
5|$|Like many Elizabethan mansions, Barrington {{is built}} in an 'E' shape with large {{projecting}} wings with square projections that contain staircases. The {{house is not}} truly symmetrical as the hall has two lights and the buttery one. The south front has seven gables supported by <b>octagonal</b> buttresses and decorated with twisted finials with ogee scale-work caps and English Crockets.|$|E
5|$|The American {{architect}} Walter Burley Griffin won {{the contest}} and {{was invited to}} Australia to oversee {{the construction of the}} nation's new capital after the judges' decision was ratified by King O'Malley, the Minister for Home Affairs. Griffin's proposal, which had an abundance of geometric patterns, incorporated concentric hexagonal and <b>octagonal</b> streets emanating from several radii.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{memorial}} in Grove Park, containing a sculpture by Alfred Drury, was unveiled in 1922, with additions by Walter Cave for the Second World War. It contains {{the names of}} 402 men from the area who fell in the First World War. It consists of a winged allegorical figure of Victory holding an olive branch, which stands on an <b>octagonal</b> column. The memorial is a grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The Grade II listed {{main wings}} (known as East and West Market) are {{separated}} by the Grand Avenue, a wide roadway roofed by an elliptical arch with decorations in cast iron. At the two ends of the arcade, four prominent statues represent London, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Dublin depicting bronze dragons charged with the City's armorial bearings. At {{the corners of the}} market four <b>octagonal</b> pavilion towers were built, each with a dome displaying carved stone griffins.|$|E
5|$|The Watts Brothers Tool Works square {{drill bit}} has {{the shape of}} a Reuleaux triangle, {{modified}} with concavities to form cutting surfaces. When mounted in a special chuck which allows for the bit not having a fixed centre of rotation, it can drill a hole that is nearly square. Although patented by Henry Watts in 1914, similar drills invented by others were used earlier. Other Reuleaux polygons are used to drill pentagonal, hexagonal, and <b>octagonal</b> holes.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{blend of}} numerous schools shows clearly {{because of the}} different cultural groups involved in the mosque's construction, including the architecture of Europe, the Middle East, China, and the Minangkabau. The mosque's roof goes upwards in five steps, with the dome at the top; {{the first step is}} square, while the rest are <b>octagonal.</b> Each part of the roof has slits in it for lighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was altered in 1890, with two additions of Victorian architecture, the first being the main entrance, above the fanlight, is an arched awning with incised consoles. The other addition was the <b>octagonal</b> cupola {{on the roof}} over the original bell tower which dates from 1830. The exterior of the school has complementary colors. The walls are painted a cream color while the foundation, doors, window trims, and cornices are a chocolate-brown.|$|E
5|$|The canons {{built an}} <b>octagonal</b> {{dovecote}} {{a short distance}} {{to the west of}} the west range. The dovecote is extant, though it cannot be visited and is not part of the priory grounds. Built in the 14th century, it was modified in the mid-18th century with the addition of a pyramidal roof tiled with Welsh slate and capped with an open-sided timber cupola. The original nesting boxes have been removed and the dovecote is used as a garden store.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} chapel (Ohel) at the Jewish {{burial ground}} is Grade II-listed. Designed in 1893 by Lainson and Son and {{built by the}} Garrett building firm, it is a red-brick <b>octagonal</b> structure in the Queen Anne style, with a tiled turreted roof and corbel-topped piers at each corner, a pedimented entrance and arched windows set below recessed panels. The burial ground is surrounded by walls, stucco-faced gate piers and wrought iron fences which are listed separately at Grade II.|$|E
5|$|The dome, <b>octagonal</b> in shape, stands {{prominently}} {{on top of}} {{the centre}} of the cella. It was supported by four now-destroyed columns which were located directly beneath it. The integrated bell tower has been built {{on top of the}} narthex, as was customary in contemporary Byzantine church architecture, and extends from the rectangular main structure. The bell tower was originally rectangular, though it is now partially ruined. It was reached from the south by means of a stone staircase.|$|E
5|$|The {{fittings}} {{are from}} the late 19th century, although the <b>octagonal</b> font (made of gritstone) is of uncertain date, possibly 14th century. The bell is dated 1647. A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire recorded {{the presence of an}} 18th-century communion table, an Elizabethan cover-paten dated 1574, and a silver cup dated 1769–1772.|$|E
5|$|The {{limestone}} {{building has}} a slate hipped roof. It is rectangular with a projecting doric portico entrance and an extension to the rear. The interior {{is laid out}} in a U shape, with the larger Ball Room and Tea Room along either side with the <b>octagonal</b> Card Room at the end. The rooms have Whitefriars crystal chandeliers and are decorated with pictures by Thomas Gainsborough, Allan Ramsay (artist), Edwin Long and William Hoare.|$|E
5|$|The older {{part of the}} brick-built hall {{consists}} of seven bays, over two floors. There are projecting bays {{at either end of}} the building, dressed with ashlar quoins. A central doorway is flanked with plain pilasters, also of ashlar. The roof is of a hipped design, with a central <b>octagonal</b> bellcote, topped by a small dome.|$|E
