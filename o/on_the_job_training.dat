25|$|The training, knowledge-base, {{and skill}} sets of both paramedics and {{emergency}} medical technicians (EMTs) were typically determined by local medical directors, {{what it was}} felt the community needed, and what was affordable.

25|$|The third {{method is}} to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), a {{four-year}} degree that also prepares nurses for graduate-level education. For {{the first two years}} in a BSN program, students usually obtain general education requirements and spend the remaining time in nursing courses. In some new programs the first two years can be substituted for an active LPN license along with the required general studies. Advocates for the ADN and diploma programs state that such programs have an <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>training</b> approach to educating students, while the BSN is an academic degree that emphasizes research and nursing theory. Some states require a specific amount of clinical experience that is the same for both BSN and ADN students. A BSN degree qualifies its holder for administrative, research, consulting and teaching positions that would not usually be available to those with an ADN, but is not necessary for most patient care functions. Nursing schools may be accredited by either the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) or the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{settled into}} a two-year training pattern, with the first consisting of General Service training and the second Specialist, while continuing to accept new recruits as each course graduated. The squadron also provided an introduction to Air Force life for those who been awarded RAAF Undergraduate Scholarships as recipients were posted to University Squadrons. Biouvouacs and survival training were held at Greenbank and the Jungle Training Centre at Canungra {{under the control of}} Army personnel, and at Beechmont, Lake Manchester and Colleges Crossing. General Service Training and/or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>training</b> was held at RAAF establishments at Rathmines, Richmond, Laverton, Elizabeth, Wagga, Williamtown, Garbutt, and Amberley (almost exclusively from the late 1960s). During the academic year, training was held on Wednesday evening. Members enlisted into the PAF under the Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme were required to attend Wednesday parades to undertake the basic Officer Training Course. Graduation parades after about 1958 were held at the squadron's base. However, in the late 1960s when the squadron's continuous training camps were held at Amberley a good relationship between the RAAF base and the squadron developed. With the encouragement of the then Air Commodore Deryck Kingwell CBE DSO, graduation parades were held at Amberley.|$|E

2500|$|In the 21st century, though {{women still}} face some degrees of {{discrimination}} in the Japanese job market, {{there have been a}} number of companies that both foster women's equality and reward them on a talent based system. [...] New fields, such as banking, journalism, insurance sales, and advertising; companies in the information industry, are very appealing to women, because they reward them based on individual ability. [...] These companies are also keen to rotate workers out every two or three years, giving women the opportunity to explore a number of different departments without job hopping, fostering trust in the company and versatility in the women workers. [...] Aside from the information industry, several foreign companies have taken an interest in Japan. [...] The companies provide Japanese women, who have some foreign language proficiency, work in challenging fields with pay comparable to their male counterparts. [...] Women also have a better chance of promotion to managerial positions in foreign companies and are hired based on their skills, rather than potential abilities that can be mastered through <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>training,</b> as is popular with Japanese firms.

First, mainstreaming these projects within the competitive tourism commodity chain proves highly challenging and costly; second, communities' institutional and managerial capacity is weak and thus CBTEs' viability is limited; finally, inadequate support by donors and non-governmental organisations fails to tackle challenges faced by community tourism ventures. community-based tourism, livelihoods, institutional arrangements, global commodity chains,...|$|R
