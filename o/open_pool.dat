5|$|The Baths {{were built}} around hot springs, {{the only ones}} {{naturally}} occurring in the United Kingdom. Archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} main spring in its natural state was treated as a shrine by the Celts. During the early Roman occupation of Britain, in the 60s or 70s AD, engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. These still survive. At this early stage the spring was an <b>open</b> <b>pool</b> {{in the corner of the}} temple precinct. It fed a bathing complex on its south side within a barrel-vaulted building. The complex was gradually built up over the next 300years. All the stonework above the level of the baths is from more recent periods including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, when the city corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) to the south of the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger; visitor access is via an 1897 concert hall by J M Brydon, which is an eastward continuation of the Grand Pump Room with a glass-domed centre and single-storey radiused corner.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Edwards {{began his}} own firm in Raleigh (now named Kirby & Holt) with a friend, David Kirby. He {{became known as}} the top plaintiffs' {{attorney}} in North Carolina. The biggest case of his legal career was a 1996 product liability lawsuit against Sta-Rite, the manufacturer of a defective pool drain cover. The case involved Valerie Lakey, a three-year-old girl who was disemboweled by the suction power of the pool drain pump when she sat on an <b>open</b> <b>pool</b> drain whose protective cover had been removed by other children at the pool, after the swim club had failed to install the cover properly. Despite 12 prior suits with similar claims, Sta-Rite continued to make and sell drain covers lacking warnings. Sta-Rite protested that an additional warning would have made no difference because the pool owners already knew the importance of keeping the cover secured.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the ship}} was {{purchased}} by Kloster in 1979 many of the original 1960s interiors were lost as rooms were either demolished within larger renovations, or redecorated to suit Caribbean cruising, {{under the direction of}} maritime architect Tage Wandborg and New York interior designer Angelo Donghia. [...] Areas that were completely remodelled included all of the Tourist Class public rooms, and their indoor promenade areas were filled with prefabricated [...] "junior suite" [...] cabins. The former Versailles dining room, now the Leeward, , the wall finish and etched glass mural remaining; however, carpeting and furniture was replaced, the open well was lined with smoked glass and aluminium handrails, an aluminium chandelier was placed over the two-storey space, and a spiral staircase was installed to connect the two levels. The former Salon Saint Tropez became the Norway's North Cape Lounge for cabaret and other shows; the décor more dark and muted. Further forward on the same deck, the old Café Rive Gauche was transformed into the ship's Monte Carlo casino. With the promenade windows now within cabins, no daylight penetrated to the casino, and so all windows were filled in. The Tourist Class swimming pool, its glass dome gone after the construction of the <b>open</b> <b>pool</b> deck above, was filled with neon lights and covered with a glass dance floor as part of the remodelling of the entire space into the ship's Dazzles disco.|$|E

40|$|The Southwestern Atlantic harbors {{unique and}} {{relatively}} understudied reef systems, including the only atoll in South Atlantic: Rocas atoll. Located 230 km off the NE Brazilian coast, Rocas is formed by {{coralline red algae}} and vermetid mollusks, and is potentially {{one of the most}} "pristine" areas in Southwestern Atlantic. We provide the first comprehensive and integrative description of the fish and benthic communities inhabiting different shallow reef habitats of Rocas. We studied two contrasting tide <b>pool</b> habitats: <b>open</b> <b>pools,</b> which communicate with the open ocean even during low tides, thus more exposed to wave action; and closed pools, which remain isolated during low tide and are comparatively less exposed. Reef fish assemblages, benthic cover, algal turfs and fish feeding pressure on the benthos remarkably varied between <b>open</b> and closed <b>pools.</b> The planktivore Thalassoma noronhanum was the most abundant fish species in both habitats. In terms of biomass, the lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris and the omnivore Melichtys niger were dominant in <b>open</b> <b>pools,</b> while herbivorous fishes (mainly Acanthurus spp.) prevailed in closed pools. Overall benthic cover was dominated by algal turfs, composed of articulated calcareous algae in <b>open</b> <b>pools</b> and non-calcified algae in closed pools. Feeding pressure was dominated by acanthurids and was 10 -fold lower in <b>open</b> <b>pools</b> than in closed pools. Besides different wave exposure conditions, such pattern could also be related to the presence of sharks in <b>open</b> <b>pools,</b> prompting herbivorous fish to feed more in closed pools. This might indirectly affect the structure of reef fish assemblages and benthic communities. The macroalgae Digenea simplex, which is uncommon in closed pools and abundant in the reef flat, was highly preferred in herbivory assays, indicating that herbivory by fishes might be shaping this distribution pattern. The variations in benthic and reef fish communities, and feeding pressure on the benthos between <b>open</b> and closed <b>pools</b> suggest that the dynamics in <b>open</b> <b>pools</b> is mostly driven by physical factors and the tolerance of organisms to harsh conditions, while in closed pools direct and indirect effects of species interactions also play an important role. Understanding the mechanisms shaping biological communities and how they scale-up to ecosystem functioning is particularly important on isolated near-pristine systems where natural processes can still be studied under limited human impact...|$|R

60|$|Years afterward, {{hundreds}} of miles away on the Dungarvon, {{in the heart of the}} wilderness, every detail of the scene came back to me again. I was standing on snowshoes, looking out over the frozen river, when Keeonekh appeared in an <b>open</b> <b>pool</b> with a trout in his mouth. He broke his way, with a clattering tinkle of winter bells, through the thin edge of ice, put his paws against the heavy snow ice, threw himself out with the same wriggling jump, and ate with his back arched--just as I had seen him years before.|$|E
60|$|Just {{below me}} was a deep <b>open</b> <b>pool</b> {{surrounded}} by double fringes of ice. Early in the winter, while the stream was higher, the white ice had formed thickly on the river wherever the current was not too swift for freezing. Then the stream fell, and a shelf of new black ice formed at the water's level, eighteen inches or more below the first ice, some of which still clung to the banks, reaching out in places two or three feet and forming dark caverns with the ice below. Both shelves dipped towards the water, forming a gentle incline all about {{the edges of the}} open places.|$|E
60|$|So the long, hard winter passed away, {{and spring}} came again with its abundance. Grouse drummed a {{welcome in the}} woods; the honk of wild geese filled {{the air with a}} joyous clangor, and in every <b>open</b> <b>pool</b> the ducks were quacking. No need now to cling like shadows to the herds of caribou, and no further need for the pack to hold together. The ties that held them melted like snows in the sunny hollows. First the old wolves, then the cubs, one by one drifted away whither the game or their new mates were calling them. When the summer came there was another den on the high hill {{overlooking}} the harbor, where the little brown cubs could look down with wonder at the shining sea and the slow fishing-boats and the children playing on the shore; but the wolves whose trail began there were far away over the mountains, following their own ways, waiting for the crisp hunting cry that should bring them again together.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that emigration {{of individuals in}} excess of resource carrying capacity acts as a population regulatory mechanism was tested experimentally using the desert pupfish (Cyprinodon macularius). When emigration was prevented, four pupfish populations monitored from May 1982 to March 1984 were unable to regulate numbers to resources. Numbers increased to a mean peak size 1. 4 times greater than four <b>pools</b> <b>open</b> to emigration, followed by high mortality, a decline in body condition, reduced recruitment, and stunting. The pattern of overpopulation {{was similar to that}} observed in fenced populations of rodents. In contrast, pupfish in <b>open</b> <b>pools</b> had lower numbers, higher recruitment, better condition and growth, and higher total production. Emigration patterns were similar in all four <b>open</b> <b>pools.</b> Population size, rate of increase, and temperature affected emigration rates. Nearly twice as many males than females emigrated. Emigrant pupfish usually had poorer condition factors than residents. Pupfish showed a rapid and uniform increase in emigration when resources were reduced. Nearly one-half (42. 2 and 41. 8 %) of pupfish populations emigrated from two <b>open</b> <b>pools</b> wherein resources were suddenly reduced by 50 %. Many fewer fish emigrated from undisturbed control pools (15. 2 and 16. 0 %). The results suggest that residency-emigratory behavior of pupfish can reliably and precisely effect changes in numbers to be in consonance with resources. They support emigration as sufficient to regulate pupfish numbers to resources in open systems without the need for other factors or mechanisms...|$|R
