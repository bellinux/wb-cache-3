40|$|Continuous fibre-reinforced {{thermoplastics}} {{often are}} offered as impregnated and consolidated semi-finished products which {{are known as}} organic sheets. The thermoplastic matrix leads to several advantages including the thermoformability and weldability. Parts made of organic sheets are frequently produced by forming the semi-finished product into half-shells and stiffening those shells {{in the course of}} the process e. g. by the injection moulding of ribs. Larger and more complex parts with hollow body structures can be manufactured e. g. by forming the semi-finished products into half-shells and joining the half-shells. However, the currently available manufacturing technologies for parts made of organic sheets have cap profile shaped joints which prevent the use of the reinforcing fibres across the joint plane. Investigations have proven that <b>overlapping</b> <b>weld</b> joints in organic sheets show much higher strengths than cap profile shaped joints which can be explained by the fibre use across the joint plane. Furthermore, the infrared welding technology was verified as an appropriate process for the welding of organic sheets since no need for additional welding material is given, short heating times can be realized and no contact of the infrared emitters to the joining parts is required.

This is quite the opposite of traditional subtractive manufacturing where components are formed from an oversized raw material, forming the desired shape of a component involves the removal of unwanted material by means of various machining processes such as milling, shaping, turning and others.

Numerical simulations for a heat transfer model in welding process were conducted to test the effect of various kinds of welding conditions on the melt depth of plastics. The temperature profile variations in plastics to be welded during heating process were obtained by manipulating different parameters, such as the heat sink, the plastic material, the thickness of the plastic, the absorption coefficient, the incident radiation power density and the irradiation time. The results show that the melt depth and the starting time of melting greatly depend upon the radiation absorption and thermal diffusion in the plastics. For example, as the absorption coefficient of plastics increases, the starting position of melting in the plastics approaches the irradiated surface.

40|$|Nickel alloys {{are very}} {{important}} in many aerospace applications, especially to manufacture gas turbines and aero engine components, where high strength and temperature resistance are necessary. These kinds of alloys have to be welded with high energy density processes, {{in order to preserve}} their high mechanical properties.

40|$|The <b>overlapping</b> <b>welding</b> {{was carried}} out in keyhole mode between {{austenitic}} stainless steel 304 l and aluminum alloy 5083 using a low power fiber laser in continuous irradiation. The significant content of magnesium as the alloying element with low boiling point and high vapor pressure inside the AA 5083 matrix can induce the spatter formation and depression on surface of the weld beads upon laser beam absorption and temperature growth which can deteriorate the mechanical properties and appearance of the joints. To reduce these defects, a variety of single and multi-components activating fluxes including oxide-based TiO 2 and halide-based CaF 2 flux powders were pre-placed on the surface of welding material prior to laser welding. The EDX and XRD analyses in addition to microhardness and shear tests were carried out to characterize the joints. The obtained results showed that, the oxide and halide activating fluxes can significantly improve the joints' strength up to 1. 48 and 1. 85 times in average respectively compared with autogenous joint. It was deduced that the simultaneous effect of significant decrease in joints' surface depression leading to welds' geometry improvement in addition to less formation of interfacial Fe-Al intermetallics, were the major causes for considerable strength improvements.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the weldability of a metal polymer sandwich structure. The welding of the sandwich material proceeds first by welding of the skin layer. The material selected for this research is Steelite, a sandwich structure developed by Corus, with 0. 12 mm thick mild steel skin layers adhesively bonded to a 0. 62 mm thick polypropylene core. The primary concerns when welding the skin layers of a metal polymer sandwich structure are degradation of the polymer core, and how this may affect the welding of the skin layer. For this reason low heat input pulsed laser welding was chosen, which enables precise control over {{the amount of energy}} delivered to the workpiece, and thus the heat build-up. Three types of pulsed laser welding were investigated, single spot <b>welds,</b> <b>overlapping</b> spot <b>welds,</b> and stitched welds. The single spot weld experiments reveal {{that it is possible to}} create almost defect free partial penetration spot welds in the skin layer of Steelite. The formation of the single spot welds occurs in three stages: initial heating where no melting occurs then melting and a rapid increase in size to a diameter dependant on the focal spot size of the laser beam, and finally growth proceeding at a decreased rate until the end of the pulse or until a blowhole is formed. <b>Overlapping</b> spot <b>weld</b> experiments were carried out with varying welding parameters. It was observed that an increase in heat input not only increases the width of the weld, as expected, but also changes the surface appearance. At low heat inputs the surface has a typical <b>overlapping</b> spot <b>weld</b> appearance. With an increase in heat input, a splash feature appears first with striking regularity. At the highest heat inputs where a weld is formed, the âsplashâ feature gives way to a rough and pocked appearance. The variation in surface appearance is of import as it is related to the depth of penetration and microstructure. The <b>overlapping,</b> discrete, spot <b>weld</b> appearance corresponds to partial penetration welds. The "splash" features appears once the welds are fully penetrated and indicate the presence and the location of flues, which have a different structure from the rest of the weld and a high carbon content. The last, pocked, surface appearance corresponds to high heat input full penetrations welds. These pocked welds have fully dendritic structures, carbon contents of approximately 5 wt. %, and Vickers hardnesses of up to 960 HV, the combination of which indicates a white cast iron structure. The absorption of carbon shifts the composition of the original mild steel towards the eutectic point on the iron carbon phase diagram, reducing the melting point. Stitching is a method of making a seam <b>weld</b> from <b>overlapping</b> spot <b>welds</b> while preventing the heat build up responsible for the degradation of the polymer core. Experiments show that the degradation under the stitched welds is significantly reduced in comparison to pulsed laser seam welds of comparable depth. Analytical and finite element modelling were carried out. The analytical model is based on Martin and Bowmans model which assumes a Gaussian heat source and a semi-infinite work piece. The results for the weld diameter of the single spot welds are quite accurate for short pulse times, however the results become less accurate with increasing pulse time. Finite element modelling proved more successful for predicting weld diameter for varying combinations of pulse parameters. Although the weld diameter can be predicted within 15 %, the weld penetration is almost always over predicted. Despite this, the prediction for the degraded area in the core is reasonably accurate to first order. Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology had {{developed}} the SHADOW (R) welding technique, in which high speed joining with minimal distortion is possible using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The possibility of high speed, high quality welding had been also reported {{by use of}} a single-mode fiber laser. The combination of micro-beam and high speed laser scanning offers potential advantages for thin metal sheet welding. Therefore, the characteristics of micro-welding for thin stainless sheet were investigated here by high speed laser scanning with both single-mode fiber laser and pulsed Nd: YAG laser. The results were a narrow welding region obtained using a laser beam with a large focus diameter of 160 mu m without pulse control, while a small focus diameter of 22 mu m was found in general to provide good control of the welding state. A small focus diameter can result in an excellent welding seam from the start, even without pulse control. The penetration depth could be controlled by the energy density with a small focus diameter. For the smaller beam foucus diameter, an unique periodic structure appeared at high beam scanning velocities.

40|$|The here {{presented}} {{monitoring method}} {{is based on}} the UV-Iight detection being emitted by the welding plasma plume and the measurement of the near-IR radiation of the glowing spatters which are thrown out of the welding pool. The results of the above mentioned spatter detection are used to approximate the size of the occurred holes in the weld. A third sensor is used for monitoring the workpiece temperature. This additional signal is very important when welding thin metal sheets (e. g. <b>overlap</b> <b>welds).</b> Further the implementation of the presented monitoring method in an industrial instrument is described (LWM 900; see Figs 3 if.). This instrument is a self-learning real-time monitoring system which needs several teach welds for creating a position-true process reference.

Using fuzzy-logic routines the probability is determined that a metallographically important welding failure has happened. The LWM 900 has been developed initially for monitoring the C 02 - welding process. The Nd-YAG laser welding process differs slightly from it. This fact has to be considered accor-dingly for a proper signal detection. Additionally, {{due to the fact that}} most of the used de-tectors are sensitive to the wavelength of the Nd-YAG laser, some measures have to be considered to reject unwanted influences in this connection. 1...|$|R
40|$|Solid state Friction stir welding (FSW) is {{of major}} {{interest}} in the welding of aluminium since it improves the joint properties. Many applications where Al-alloys are used are subject to varying load conditions, making fatigue failure a critical issue. In {{the scope of this}} thesis, the fatigue performance of friction stir welded AlMgSi-alloy 6082 has been investigated. Static and dynamic properties of different joint configurations and welds produced with varying process parameters have been determined. Microstructures of fractured surfaces have been studied to evaluate the effect of weld discontinuities on fatigue. The mechanical strength of the friction stir welds was set in relation to that of conventional fusion welds, and that of other FS welded Al-alloys. The friction stir process produced aluminium butt welds with high and consistent fatigue strengths, which exceeded the strengths of similar fusion welded samples. A smooth weld geometry showed to be of great importance for the fatigue performance, favouring the friction stir welds. Welding speed in a tested range of 0. 35 - 1. 4 m/min had only a modest influence on the properties of the friction stir welds; properties were not deteriorating at the highest speed. The softening of the alloy around the weldline was modelled. A fair description of the hardness profiles across the weld was obtained. At a low and high welding speed a full and partial softening respectively was predicted, indicating that full softening is not required to obtain a flawless weld. In case of friction stir <b>overlap</b> <b>welds,</b> tool design is even more important than in butt welding to secure weld quality. A broad tool shoulder with a concave pin end gave the best performance. In particular, the minimal influence on the sheet interface when welding with such a tool was beneficial for the fatigue strength. The stress distribution in overlap and T-type test specimens has been modelled. The stress intensity factors were determined. The corresponding crack propagation rates were in fair accordance with the experimental results.

The high alloy content and the presence of alloy-rich carbides in the as-supplied parent plate can significantly retard the kinetics of transformation to austenite, resulting in both incomplete austenitisation and inhomogeneous austenite. <b>Overlapping</b> <b>weld</b> thermal cycles in multi-pass welds add further complexity to the progressive development of microstructure {{over the course of the}} welding process. In order to clarify structural evolution, thermal simulation has been used to study the effects of successive thermal cycles on the structures and properties of the HAZ of 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel. The results showed that, before post-weld heat treatment (PWHT), the HAZ microstructures and properties, particularly in doubly reheated sub-zones, were highly heterogeneous and differed markedly from those of the base steel. It is concluded that close control of the thermal cycle by pre-heat, weld heat input and post-heat is necessary to obtain a heat affected zone with microstructures and properties compatible with those of the base plate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{describes}} {{the mechanisms of}} emergence and propagation of fatigue cracks caused by mechanical tension stress fluctuations in dissimilar steels butt and <b>overlap</b> <b>welded</b> joints under axial tension fatigue loads. A structural (ASTM A 537, class I) and a stainless (ASTM A 240, 304 L) were soldiers through GMAW, Argon as protecting gas and a stainless (ASTM A 240, 308 L) as a supplier material, not being submitted to pre and post welding thermal treatment. Microstructures (Scanning Electron Microscopy, SEM) were contrasted in different zones of each joint, focus on Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) and fusion lines. Samples were inspected by not destructive test (penetrating liquids and ultrasound), to discard surface and internal defects. The following mechanical tests were compared between both welding joint (WJ) : Vickers hardness profile, tension, bending, impact, axial fatigue, and speed of propagation of fatigue cracks. Vickers show high values of micro hardness in the HAZ, near the fusion line between weld and stainless. Tension and axial fatigue tests indicated similar behavior between WJ and structural (butt joint); and similar behavior between WJ and stainless (overlap joint). Pre-cracked test evidence a faster growth of crack in the fusion line between structural steel and stainless. Dissimilar unions (butt and overlap) have mechanical and microstructure properties, which can be considered adequate to withstand the mechanical requirements in service conditions, despite relatively high values of hardness in the HAZ, particularly in the fusion line between the welding cord and the stainless 304 L, as well as inclusions between the structural and the stainless one...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{since the}} size of {{component}} becomes smaller, then the welding of thin metal sheet has been required. Besides, the flexibility of process is important according to the accessibility especially for small components. Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology had developed the SHADOW® welding technology, in which the high speed joining with small distortion is possible using pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The possibility of high speed and high quality welding had been reported by using single-mode fiber laser. The combination of micro beam and high speed laser scanning has the advantages for thin metal sheet welding. Therefore, the characteristics of micro-welding for thin metal sheet were investigated by high speed laser scanning, in which the welding {{was carried out by}} high speed scanner system with single-mode fiber laser and pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The proper welding region was narrow by the laser beam with a large focus diameter of 160 µm without pulse control, while a sma ll focus diameter of 22 µm can control the welding state widely. A small focus diameter can perform the excellent welding seam from the extreme beginning without pulse control. The penetration depth can be controlled by the energy density with a small focus diameter of 22 m at the energy densities less than 1 J/mm 2. Besides, the unique periodic structure appeared at the high velocity of beam scanning with a small focus diameter. Moreover, the <b>overlap</b> <b>welding</b> of 25 m thickness sheet can be performed regardless of small gap distance between two sheets by the laser beam with a small focus diameter of 22 µm...|$|R
