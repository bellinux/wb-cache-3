25|$|During the siege, the Mafeking Cadet Corps {{of white}} boys below {{fighting}} age stood guard, carried messages, assisted in hospitals, and so on, freeing grown men to fight. Baden-Powell did not form the Cadet Corps himself, {{and there is}} no evidence that he took much notice of them during the Siege. But he was sufficiently impressed with both their courage and the equanimity with which they performed their tasks to use them later as an <b>object</b> <b>lesson</b> in the first chapter of Scouting for Boys.|$|E
25|$|A {{quarter of}} a century earlier, the nearby town of Indianola on Matagorda Bay was {{undergoing}} its own boom and was second to Galveston among Texas port cities. Then in 1875, a powerful hurricane blew through, nearly destroying the town. Indianola was rebuilt, though a second hurricane in 1886 caused residents to simply give up and move elsewhere. Many Galveston residents took the destruction of Indianola as an <b>object</b> <b>lesson</b> on the threat posed by hurricanes. Galveston is built on a low, flat island, little more than a large sandbar along the Gulf Coast. These residents proposed a seawall be constructed to protect the city, but their concerns were dismissed by {{the majority of the population}} and the city's government.|$|E

25|$|Those Protestants who {{do believe}} in the {{importance}} of a future rebuilt temple (viz., some dispensationalists) hold that the importance of the sacrificial system shifts to a Memorial of the Cross, given the text of Ezekiel Chapters 39 and following (in addition to Millennial references to the Temple in other Old Testament passages); since Ezekiel explains at length the construction and nature of the Millennial temple, in which Jews will once again hold the priesthood; some others hold that perhaps it was not completely eliminated with Jesus' sacrifice for sin, but is a ceremonial <b>object</b> <b>lesson</b> for confession and forgiveness (somewhat like water baptism and Communion are today); and that such animal sacrifices would still be appropriate for ritual cleansing and for acts of celebration and thanksgiving toward God. Some dispensationalists believe this will be the case with the Second Coming when Jesus reigns over earth from the city of New Jerusalem.|$|E

500|$|During {{his years}} in Venice Monteverdi {{published}} his sixth (1614), seventh (1619) and eighth (1638) books of madrigals. The sixth book consists of works written before the composer's departure from Mantua. Hans Redlich {{sees it as a}} transitional work, containing Monteverdi's last madrigal compositions in the manner of the prima pratica, together with music which is typical of the new style of expression which Monteverdi had displayed in the dramatic works of 1607–08. The central theme of the collection is loss; the best-known work is the five-voice version of Lamento d'Arianna, which, says Massimo Ossi, gives [...] "an <b>object</b> <b>lesson</b> in the close relationship between monodic recitative and counterpoint". The book contains Monteverdi's first settings of verses by Giambattista Marino, and two settings of Petrarch which Ossi considers the most extraordinary pieces in the volume, providing some [...] "stunning musical moments".|$|E

500|$|... "Enlighten Me", {{released}} in October 1990, {{was the only}} single {{to be released from}} Reverberation. The single fared badly on the UK Singles Chart only reaching number ninety-six, although it reached number eight on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States. The album's release followed in December 1990, and Echo & the Bunnymen immediately went on a seventeen-date tour that focused on the United Kingdom and Ireland. The tour received good reviews, with Melody Maker describing the band as [...] "an <b>object</b> <b>lesson</b> in how to survive and prosper". However, the reviews of the album were not as good. Awarding the album {{two and a half stars}} out of five, Tim DiGravina, who reviewed the album for Allmusic, said, [...] "Echo & the Bunnymen doesn't exist without the distinctive voice of Ian McCulloch". Although he added that the album would have been a [...] "great debut" [...] had the band decided to record under a different name. Bob Mack, reviewing the album for Entertainment Weekly was more forceful in putting the album down. He described the sound of the album as [...] "hopelessly in thrall to the brand of pale pseudo-psychedelia [...] helped popularise during the past decade". He went on to describe Burke and most of the songs as [...] "nondescript". He finished his review by saying [...] "this is a turkey best left to be gobbled up by the band's relatives, close friends, and diehard fans".|$|E
500|$|As late as 1974, the Olympic Review {{listed the}} United States team of John Flanagan, Robert Garrett, Truxton Hare, Josiah McCracken, Lewis Sheldon and Richard Sheldon as the gold medalists for the 1900 tug of war. A {{report in the}} Paris edition of the New York Herald {{described}} the tug of war contest at the Olympic Games as being [...] "an <b>object</b> <b>lesson</b> in how not to do a thing". The report mentioned the Scandinavian team's defeat of France, before detailing a second match, between an American team and the Scandinavians. The New York Herald recorded that in the second contest, a group of Americans formed a team {{to take on the}} victorious Scandinavians, beating them in two pulls, the second of which took over five minutes. In contrast, the Journal des Sports suggested that the Americans initially wanted to wear spiked shoes {{to take part in the}} match, but were then forced to remove them after protests. They then won the first pull against the mixed Swedish/Danish team, but during the second pull, some of their compatriots joined in pulling the rope to help the tiring team. A fight nearly broke out, but was avoided by the intervention of officials. Irrespective of the result of this second contest, it was not considered to be part of the official competition, but rather a private contest, and the United States were not considered to have officially taken part.|$|E

500|$|In particular, the console's {{status as}} an add-on and poor timing after the {{announcement}} of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega's video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers. [...] Allgame notes that [...] "very add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales." [...] GamePro criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system. [...] According to reviewer Blake Snow, [...] "Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if {{you were one of the}} unlucky souls who completely bought into Sega's add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Reparaz noted that [...] "developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an <b>object</b> <b>lesson</b> in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons." [...] Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that [...] "(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out." [...] Writing for IGN, Buchanan also notes that [...] "Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And that's a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience." ...|$|E

It is housed in buildings dating back to 1845 between Praed Street and Paddington Basin. In October 2000, the London Regional Office of the NHS approved a plan for a Paddington Health Campus that would replace three run-down hospitals - St Marys, the Royal Brompton and Harefield. The initial cost was estimated at £411m at 2005 prices with completion in 2006, to be financed by PFI, but it became apparent that the scheme was too big for the original St Mary's site. Various locations north of the canal basin were investigated but the scheme was finally abandoned in May 2005 after costs had spiralled to £894m and the completion date put back to 2013. £15m was spent on the project, leading a member of the Commons Public Accounts Committee to describe it as [...] "an <b>object</b> <b>lesson</b> in how not to build hospitals....a shambles of the first order", and a colleague called it [...] "incompetence on a massive scale".|$|E
