500|$|... "Never Been Kissed" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, who were polarized by Kurt's storyline. While CNN's Lisa Respers France {{thought it was}} Glee best episode thus far and IGN's Robert Canning rated it 9 out of 10, which signifies an outstanding episode, Linda Holmes <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio</b> dismissed it as [...] "one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced", and Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

[...] The Huffington Post Leah Anthony Libresco found it an [...] "extraordinarily counterproductive" [...] response to the string of teenage gay suicides in early 2010. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle and James Poniewozik of Time approved of the storyline in principle—the former opined that Glee willingness to raise mainstream awareness of such issues was [...] "incredibly courageous", and the latter appreciated that it would span a multi-episode arc—but both were critical of its depiction in practice.|$|E

Eriq Gardner of Adweek {{noted that the}} case had strategic import for the field of politics, referring to Beck's style of commentary as exemplified in the interview with Congressman Keith Ellison. Chris Matyszczyk of CNET News commented on the legal issues of the case; he asked whether it should hold to U.S. law as it involved two citizens, and additionally wondered if Beck was asserting trademark over his full name or his individual first and last names as well. Ed Brayton of ScienceBlogs called Randazza's request that Beck stipulate to United States law intellectually creative. Daily Kos pointed out the inherent hypocrisy in Beck's legal position of seeking redress in an international agency when compared to his prior statements criticizing foreign law in favor of U.S. law.|$|E

The episode received generally positive reviews. Marc Hirsh <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio</b> said {{the addition of the}} no-nonsense Charles Miner character infused a sense of reality into The Office, which he said was growing increasingly wacky and out of control: [...] " [...] may, in fact, {{have been one of the}} most important episodes of the entire series, acting as a corrective to the show's increasing flirtations with ridiculousness. The characters of The Office have lived in a bubble for long enough." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said [...] "New Boss" [...] brought a badly needed change to the series, which he said had been in a [...] "stagnant state" [...] over the last several episodes. Fickett said Steve Carell gave [...] "a tour de force" [...] as Michael saw his power slip away, and he called the final scene when Michael quit as one of the show's biggest moments. He said, [...] "Watching Miner work like a monkey wrench thrown into the works is the most fun I've had watching this show in a long time." [...] Shahzad Abbas of TV Guide said, [...] "Overall, this was a terrific episode, tightly structured, some nice laugh-out loud moments, and a genuine shocker at the end that was completely consistent with Michael's personality." ...|$|E
500|$|Wikimedia Foundation {{spokesman}} {{and head}} of communications, Jay Walsh, stated the decision was focused on reducing hostility within the subject and getting articles back to an appropriate state. Walsh emphasized to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that edits which {{serve the interests of}} organizations are acceptable, but must be within the procedure of [...] "adding valuable context" [...] to articles. In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Walsh said, [...] "This is about people reducing the hostility around the topic, and getting the articles back to a state where they make sense. I think the arbitration committee wants to send the message that Wikipedians have to be neutral on all accounts and all fronts. They don't take these situations lightly. They understand there's a perspective of: Are we censoring people or individuals? It's really about what can we do that's best for Wikipedia and the people who read it." [...] When asked by Ross Reynolds <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio</b> affiliate KUOW-FM why the Arbitration decision included a [...] "ban on IP addresses at the Church of Scientology", Walsh answered, [...] "So the simple answer is that within looking at these computers and where these edits were coming from, the decision is that ultimately most of the edits within these ranges have been from single-user-accounts, people who have a single intention to change or move or in some cases remove information, which could be considered censorship, which is really something that doesn't work out well on Wikipedia. And this is an effort to kind of calm that effect, and to bring some neutrality and some quality back to these articles." ...|$|E
500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio,</b> he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first time}} Karofsky {{received}} significant notice from critics {{was for the}} second season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience {{as much as it}} did Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into [...] "a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own." [...] MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage in the face of discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment. Linda Holmes <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio</b> dismissed [...] "Never Been Kissed" [...] as [...] "one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced", and felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and [...] "emotionally unsound". His appearances over the next few episodes drew only oblique commentary, such as The Atlantic Kevin Fallon's characterization in his review on [...] "Furt" [...] of the bullying storyline as a [...] "very important arc that's been well-acted by all parties involved". In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "I thought giving Kurt's bully, Karofsky (...), a miniature story arc that resolved itself only partially was a smart move. Up until now, he's been kind of a walking cliché, and now he gets to be someone who's not all repressed sexuality and monstrous tendencies." [...] Reiter commented, [...] "And best of all, we got to watch Karofsky's character develop a bit more. It was nice to see him let loose a little and dance, but all his back-and-forthing about glee was a little confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were mostly positive. Linda Holmes <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio</b> felt that [...] "most of Ortved's work {{provides}} a solid basic history." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a [...] "B+", writing, [...] "you have to admire all the work that went into this unauthorized history." [...] He noted that he [...] "felt a little bad afterward for the central players who got sucker punched. [...] The subsequent testimony about the empire Groening created is contentious and mesmerizing. It's also conflicting and compromised, since {{some of the biggest}} fishies of all did not talk to Ortved. [...] The reader should be wary when sources assert that Groening is little more than an affable frontman for the show or that Brooks sometimes wielded his power imperiously: The guys aren't there to defend themselves. In most cases, though, Ortved amasses quotes from many sources to establish such points, so the negative stuff doesn't seem gratuitous." [...] Michael C. Lorah of Newsarama described the book as a [...] "very effective, very worthwhile read" [...] but felt that Ortved's [...] "editorializing" [...] was [...] "probably the most distracting element {{of the book}}." [...] Michael Hingston of See Magazine called the book [...] "a well-told patchwork that shines formidable light on the show" [...] and gave it three and a half stars. However, he felt the book was released prematurely and should have been published {{after the end of the}} show, also criticizing Ortved's narration and the lack of quotes from Matt Groening or James L. Brooks. Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club pointed out that the book has [...] "numerous factual errors" [...] that [...] "may only trip the alarms of hardcore fans, but even casual readers may be put off by the book's redundancy." [...] He concluded that despite flaws, the [...] "insight into its routines and eccentric personalities can't help but fascinate." ...|$|E
