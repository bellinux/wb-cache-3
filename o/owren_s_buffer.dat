To explain the better {{efficiency of the}} sample with nano ZnS In 2 <b>S</b> 3 <b>buffer</b> layer, combined transmission electron microscopy, atom probe tomography, and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies were performed. In the pure In 2 <b>S</b> 3 <b>buffered</b> sample, a CuIn 3 Se 5 ordered defect compound is observed at the CIGSSe surface, whereas in the nano ZnS In 2 <b>S</b> 3 <b>buffered</b> sample no such compound is detected. The absence of an ordered defect compound in the latter sample is explained either {{by the presence of}} the ZnS nanodots, which may act as a barrier layer against Cu diffusion in CIGSSe hindering the formation of CuIn 3 Se 5, or by the presence of Zn at the CIGSSe surface, which may disturb the formation of this ordered defect compound. In the nano ZnS In 2 S 3 sample, Zn was found in the first monolayers of the absorber layer, which may lead to a downward band bending at the surface. This configuration is very stable Fermi level pinning at the conduction band, as observed for Cd in Cu In,Ga Se 2 and reduces the recombination rate at the interface. This effect may explain why the sample with ZnS nanodots possesses a higher efficiency.

It shows that the morphology of Zn(O, S) layer deposited on CIGSe using CBD process is made of {{a thin layer of}} well oriented ZnS sphalerite-(111) and/or ZnS wurtzite-(0002) planes parallel to CIGSe chalcopyrite-(112) planes at the interface with CIGSe followed by misoriented nanometer-sized ZnS crystallites in an amorphous phase.

40|$|In this thesis, a novel {{concept of}} {{depositing}} sulfidic buffers of Cu(In,Ga) (S,Se) 2 "CIGSSe" solar cells is developed. This {{alternative to the}} chemical bath deposition process {{is based on the}} Ion-Layer-Gas-Reaction (ILGAR) method, which recently was developed at the Hahn-Meitner-Institute. Moreover, the heavy metal containing CdS usually used in such chalcopyrite solar cells is replaced by an alternative, more ecological zinc-sulfur compound. Beside the systematic increase in solar cell efficiency the electronic properties of such an alternative device and the physical properties of the buffer material are investigated. After the presentation of the ILGAR-method {{the first part of this}} work illustrates that ILGAR-sulfide layers, deposited on smooth substrates and at temperatures below 100 °C, show a significant blue shift in their optical absorption due to the quantum size effect. This effect is used to investigate the growth behavior of ILGAR-films in a quick and uncomplicated way. A specially developed computer program simulating the optical absorption edge and taking into account the distribution of crystallite size, the quantum size effect and the phonon-photon-coupling is presented. It facilitates the understanding of the complex growth process of the ILGAR-sulfide layer. The main result of this growth study is that the crystallization behavior of the precursor salt has a significant influence on growth characteristic. The second part of this work concerns the development of the novel deposition concept and the alternative buffer with respect to CdS. It is shown that the use of ammonia free metal salt solutions at room temperature in the ILGAR process makes a chemical pretreatment of the CIGSSe absorber necessary. XPS-analysis shows that ammonia and KCN dissolved in water remove sodium carbonate and selenium dioxide from the absorber surface. Moreover, the results are an indication of a reduction of oxygen bound to the absorber. For the first time XPS analysis and optical spectroscopy have been used to prove that there is a deposition of cadmium hydroxide and zinc hydroxide on the absorber surface by the corresponding treatments. In the case of buffer free solar cells an increase in open circuit voltage is observed with increasing temperature of a zinc-dimethylsulphoxide treatment, confirming the assumption of a diffusion of metal ions into the absorber surface. The chemical pretreatment is one substantial part of the novel deposition concept. Moreover, the composition of the sulfidic buffer is important in this concept. It is shown that for a well working device this layer must be a mixture of sulfide, hydroxide and oxide. An ILGAR-Zn(OH,O) <b>S</b> <b>buffered</b> CIGSSe-solar cell than reaches an efficiency of eta= 14. 2 %; the CBD-CdS buffered reference cell leads to eta= 14. 1 %.

40|$|In 2 S 3 thin layers can be {{prepared}} by Spray ILGAR Ion Layer Gas Reaction from indium trichloride or from indium triacetylacetonate solutions. In the first case, the film contains a controllable amount of Cl. The concentration of H 2 O or Cl was varied systematically in the precursor solutions that {{were used for the}} deposition of In 2 <b>S</b> 3 <b>buffer</b> layers on commercially available Cu Ga,In S,Se 2 absorbers. The layers were characterized by ultraviolet photo electron spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, modulated surface photovoltage spectroscopy and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy, combined with a sequential etching procedure. The latter allowed to estimate an element specific depth profile. Experimental findings were correlated with the performance of the corresponding solar cells. The presence of H 2 O or Cl in the precursor solutions has a strong influence on the diffusion of Cu and Na cations from the absorber into the buffer layer. The open circuit voltage of solar cells with In 2 <b>S</b> 3 <b>buffer</b> layers prepared from Cl free, H 2 O containing precursor solutions was higher by up to 100 mV than those from Cl containing, but H 2 O free solutions. For this reason, the average solar energy conversion efficiency of cells of the first buffer type was higher 14. 7 than for solar cells of the second type 12. ...|$|R

Effects such as passivation of surface states, partial electron transfer from ZnO into In 2 S 3, decrease of the ideality factor after deposition of ZnO and slow electron transfer through In 2 S 3 were demonstrated. The results show that SPV measurements open opportunities for dedicated studies of charge separation at hetero junctions between ordered and disordered semiconductor...|$|R

Different precursor compositions and processing conditions were studied {{to define a}} reproducible and robust process. By adjusting the ink properties, this method can be applied in different printing and coating techniques. Here we report on two techniques, namely spin coating and inkjet printing. Active area efficiencies of 12. 8 and 12. 2 have been achieved for In 2 <b>S</b> 3 <b>buffered</b> solar cells respectively, matching the performance of CdS buffered cells prepared with the same batch of absorber...|$|R
30|$|In this work, {{numerical}} simulations {{were performed}} for CZTS solar cell using three different buffer layers such as CdS, ZnS, and Cd 0.4 Zn 0.6 S {{and the performance}} parameters were observed by varying buffer layer thickness, absorber layer thickness and temperature. The buffer layer thickness for all these three types was found 50 nm to obtain high efficiency CZTS solar cell. Among them the CdS buffer layer used in the CZTS solar cell exhibited higher efficiency (11.20 %). In all cases  performance parameters are affected significantly with the increased buffer layer. Because the loss of incident photons increases with increased buffer thickness which results in lower short circuit density leading to lower efficiency of the solar cell. The lower limit of thickness of CZTS absorber layer was obtained 500 nm to avoid the recombination of photogenerated carriers for all three buffer layers. In contrast the higher limit of thickness of CZTS absorber layer were found 1000 nm, 1400 nm and 1800 nm respectively for CdS, ZnS and Cd 0.4 Zn 0.6 <b>S</b> <b>buffer</b> layers to avoid the effect of minority carrier recombination. The best obtained efficiency (10.69 %) was found for 900 nm thick CZTS layer using CdS buffer layer. The effect of temperature in CZTS solar cell was also important. In all cases (using different buffer layers) the efficiency decreased if we go beyond 290 K, as in higher temperature there is an enhancement of internal recombination of photogenerated carriers. The optimization of this study can lead to fabrication of high-efficiency CZTS solar cell.|$|R
