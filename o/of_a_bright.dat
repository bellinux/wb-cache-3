5|$|Kyle {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire which consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> green ushanka, a bright orange jacket, dark green pants, and lime-green mittens/gloves. The rare {{instances in which}} he is shown without his cap, he has a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. His hat and hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey, a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal! The Musical. While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.|$|E
5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen in}} the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level. When a large enough charge is built up, a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E

5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds were}} first {{detected}} from space by an instrument on the OGO-6 satellite in 1972. The OGO-6 observations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> scattering layer over the polar caps {{were identified as}} poleward extensions of these clouds. A later satellite, the Solar Mesosphere Explorer, mapped {{the distribution of the}} clouds between 1981 and 1986 with its ultraviolet spectrometer. The clouds were detected with a lidar in 1995 at Utah State University, even when they were not visible to the naked eye. The first physical confirmation that water ice is indeed the primary component of noctilucent clouds came from the HALOE instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Jan Smuts {{was born}} in 1870, the second son of a {{traditional}} Boer farming family. By rural tradition, the eldest son {{would be the only}} child to receive a full formal education; however, on the death of his elder brother in 1882, 12-year-old Jan was sent to school for the first time. After four years of education he had made exceptional progress, gaining admission to study at Victoria College in Stellenbosch. He graduated in 1891 with first-class honours in Literature and Science. With this strong academic background, he applied for, and won, the Ebden scholarship for overseas study, electing to read Law at Christ's College, Cambridge. After further academic success, and the recipient of many prestigious academic awards, he graduated in 1894 with double First-class honours. After graduating, Smuts passed the examinations for the Inns of Court, entering the Middle Temple. In 1895, despite the prospect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> future in the United Kingdom, the homesick Smuts returned to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{their hotel}} room, Spears {{and her boyfriend}} start {{screaming}} at each other. When he tries to make amends and get close to her, she brushes off his attempts and walks away. Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head {{and looks at her}} hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, the blood in her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed. The ghost of Spears in a white shirt, watches herself in the bed and walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born. Spears is then seen running away from the camera into the light. The music video ends with her rising from under the water, resting her head and smiling, suggesting the whole scene of her death was a dream or a morbid fantasy.|$|E

25|$|The Copernican {{period is}} the {{youngest}} geological period of the Moon. Originally, the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> ray system surrounding an impact crater was used to define Copernican units, but as mentioned above, this {{is complicated by the}} presence of compositional ray systems. The base of the Copernican period does not correspond to the formation of the impact crater Copernicus. The age of the base of the Copernican is not well constrained, but a commonly quoted number is 1.1 Ga. The Copernican extends until the present day.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{accounts}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> {{flash in}} the sky were dismissed as occurring {{too late in the}} evening to have caused the crash.

Sergeant Harold Julien, who initially survived the crash but died days later, indicated that there was a series of explosions that preceded the crash. The official inquiry found that the statements of witnesses who talked with Julien before he died in hospital five days after the crash were inconsistent.|$|E
