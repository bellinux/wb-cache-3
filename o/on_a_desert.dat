5|$|Drake is a playable {{character}} in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. Nathan's rival {{in the game}} is Sly Cooper, the reason being that Drake found pages of Sly's book the Thievius Racoonus and {{at the start of}} his storyline was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> island with Sully similar to that found on Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. When Drake reaches the boss arena, he starts to decipher the pages of the Thievius Racoonus, then Sly appears and explains he's the rightful owner of the pages that Nathan possesses. Drake refuses and Sly mocks his abilities in an attempt to intimidate him, as a result Drake responds insultingly and the two battle. After defeating the boss in the game, Nathan returns to the same island as before and using the All-Star Power he obtained from the boss, he greatly enhanced Sully's plane, as the screen turns to black, Drake randomly says 'I punched a chicken'.|$|E

5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The plot was likened by Walton of The Moving Picture News to Enoch Arden, but the story differs in several ways. Published by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1864, the poem tells of the eponymous character who becomes shipwrecked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> island and returns home a decade later to find his wife has remarried {{and they have a}} new child. For the sake of his wife's happiness, he never lets her know that he is alive. The plot differs because the husband willingly fakes his death and returns {{on the day of the}} wedding. Rather than announce himself, he attempts to leave and dies in the process, his body is removed by the prospective husband before marrying her. The similarity with the poem comes from refusing to confront or interrupt the wedding by revealing the fact that he is alive is ensured by John's true death at the climax. The New York Dramatic Mirror noted that the journalists arrived to photograph and cover the apparent suicide too quickly, making it illogical that the fake suicide would not have been revealed.|$|E
5|$|While {{some parts}} of the book were inventions, she also made use of real-life incidents. The opening chapter of The Danger Tree {{describes}} the accidental death of the young son of Sir Desmond and Lady Hooper. The incident was based on fact: Sir Walter and Lady Amy Smart's eight-year-old boy was killed when he picked up a stick bomb while <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> picnic in January 1943. Just as described in the novel, his grief-stricken parents had tried to feed the dead boy through a hole in his cheek. Manning had long been resentful at the Smarts' failure to include her and Reggie in their artistic circle in Cairo. However, the scene was considered in poor taste even by Manning's friends, who were also outraged that the quiet and faithful Lady Smart was associated with Manning's very different Lady Hooper. Though both Sir Walter and his wife had died by the time of publication, Manning's publisher received a solicitor's letter written on behalf of the Smart family, objecting to the scene and requiring {{that there should be no}} further reference to the incident or to the couple in future volumes. Manning ignored both requests. She based the character of Aidan Pratt on the actor, writer and poet Stephen Haggard, whom she had known in Jerusalem. Like Pratt, Haggard committed suicide on a train from Cairo to Palestine, but in Haggard's case it followed the end of a relationship with a beautiful Egyptian woman, rather than unrequited homosexual love. After years of complaints about her publisher Heinemann, Manning moved to Weidenfeld & Nicolson, and remained with them until the end of her life. The Danger Tree was a considerable critical success, and though Manning was disappointed yet again that her novel was not shortlisted for the Booker prize, the Yorkshire Post selected it as their Best Novel of 1977. This award followed her 1976 appointment to the Order of the British Empire.|$|E

25|$|A similar Islamic {{theological}} novel, Theologus Autodidactus, {{was written}} by the Arab theologian and physician Ibn al-Nafis in the 13th century.

25|$|In 1901 and 1902, he had {{back-to-back}} successes; Quality Street {{was about}} a respectable, responsible old maid who poses as her own flirtatious niece {{to try to win}} the attention of a former suitor returned from the war. Following that, The Admirable Crichton was a critically acclaimed social commentary with elaborate staging, about an aristocratic family and their household servants shipwrecked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> island. Under these difficult circumstances, a male household member seems better suited to taking on the responsibilities of leadership than the lord of the manor.|$|E
25|$|Some skills {{also have}} a Tech Level (TL) rating {{attached}} to them, to differentiate between Skills that concern similar concepts, but whose tasks are accomplished in different ways when used with differing levels of technology. This helps during time traveling scenarios, or when characters are forced to deal with particularly outdated or advanced equipment. For instance, a modern boat builder's skills will be of less use if he is stuck <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> island and forced to work with primitive tools and techniques. Thus, the skills he uses are different when in his shop (Shipbuilding/TL8) and when {{he is on the}} island (Shipbuilding/TL0).|$|E
25|$|Besides {{scientific}} and philosophical literature, works of Arabic fictional literature were also translated into Latin and English during the 17th and 18th centuries. The {{most famous of}} these was the One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights), which was first translated into English in 1706 and has since then had a profound influence on English literature. Another famous work was Ibn Tufail's philosophical novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, which was translated into Latin as Philosophus Autodidactus by Edward Pococke the Younger in 1671 and then into English by Simon Ockley in 1708. The English translation of Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, set <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> island, may have inspired Daniel Defoe to write Robinson Crusoe, considered the first novel in English, in 1719. Later translated literary works include Layla and Majnun and Ibn al-Nafis' Theologus Autodidactus.|$|E

25|$|The borders between Egypt and Libya are porous, and {{cross-border}} {{crimes are}} not unusual. According to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, in 1993 Egyptian agents abducted a prominent Libyan dissident and U.S. resident in Cairo and turned {{him over to}} the Libyans, who executed him. Libya is rich in ancient Greek and Roman ruins. Recently there has been a growing trade in looted coins, statues and other artifacts found by Libyans who sell them to Egyptian middlemen for eventual sale to rich American and European collectors. In September 2008, a group of eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian guides <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> safari in south Egypt were kidnapped and taken south to Sudan. From there, Sudanese officials say the hostages were taken to Libya. The Libyans said that after investigations they had determined the hostages were still in Sudan.|$|E
25|$|The Islamic philosophers, Ibn Tufail (Abubacer) and Ibn al-Nafis, were {{pioneers of}} the {{philosophical}} novel. Ibn Tufail wrote the first fictional Arabic novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan (Philosophus Autodidactus) {{as a response to}} al-Ghazali's The Incoherence of the Philosophers, and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a fictional novel Theologus Autodidactus as a response to Ibn Tufail's Philosophus Autodidactus. Both of these novels had protagonists (Hayy in Philosophus Autodidactus and Kamil in Theologus Autodidactus) who were autodidactic individuals spontaneously generated in a cave and living in seclusion <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> island, both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone on the desert island for most of the story in Philosophus Autodidactus, the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in Theologus Autodidactus, developing into the first example of a science fiction novel.|$|E
25|$|Adshead {{was born}} in Bloomsbury, London, {{the only child of}} Stanley Davenport Adshead, architect, watercolourist, and Professor of Civic Design first at Liverpool, and later at London University, and his wife Mary. Mary Adshead {{attended}} Putney High School from 1916 to 1919 and then spent six months in Paris. Due to her fathers' position within London University she was able to enroll at the Slade School of Art in 1921, aged just sixteen. There Henry Tonks recognised her ability and arranged her first mural commission, for a boys' club in Wapping, working with Rex Whistler. This success led to further commissions. Her next mural, carried out in 1924, was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> island theme for the professor of architecture at Liverpool University, Charles Reilly. This mural still exists and is on display at Liverpool University Art Gallery. A large mural by Adshead, The Housing of the People, was shown at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley.|$|E

25|$|The happenings or adventures {{all take}} place at the fictional St Denis Bay, {{inspired}} by Minnis Bay at Birchington-on-Sea, which setting may be partly informed by Scott's residence nearby at Herne Bay. The map of St Denis Bay on the book's endpapers, possibly by Scott himself, shows similarity to Minnis Bay along the beach, but the town is imaginary. The stories start with a message in a bottle and end with a haunted sea front. It was published in French in 1963 by Rouge et Or Dauphine as Les Cherry au Bord de la Mer, illustrated by Pierre Le Guen. In 1970 it was published by Estudios Cor in Portuguese as Uma aventura na praia (A Familia Cherry). Happenings: The message in the bottle; The watch on the coast (coastguarding); On the trail of the Oozlum (reference to Oozlum bird, description of wanted man and manhunt, coastguarding); Alone <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>desert</b> isle (shipwreck and rescue); Follow my leader (how the Cherrys met the Pringles, inspired by the Woozle story by A.
