40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influence}} of systemically administered Metrazol on behavior, electroen-cephalogram and body temperature {{has been studied}} in young and adult chickens. Distinct convulsions were induced by 30 - 50 mg. /kg. Metrazol administered intravenously in adults: they consisted of an initial excited state, a tonic convulsion accompanied with <b>opisthotonos,</b> and finally, convulsive movements. During recovery from these convulsions, three distinct behaviors were observed: violent peck-like movement, watchful state and finally panting behavior. All of the birds receiving higher intravenous doses (60 - 100 mg. /kg.) exhibited vigorous convulsions immediately after injection and death occurred in 100 % of the birds receiving these doses. An intraperitoneal injection of 75 - 100 mg. /kg. Metrazol produced typical convulsions in young and adult chickens. At these doses, convulsions consisted of an initial excited state, a tonic convulsion accompanied with <b>opisthotonos,</b> and convulsive movements which involved clonic and tonic phases. The threshold for evoking typical convulsions with intraperitoneal injection ranges between 50 and 60 mg. /kg. Metrazol in young chickens. The intravenous threshold doses for evoking high amplitude (1 - 2 mV.) in the EEG of adult chickens was 60 mg. /kg. Metrazol. High intraperitoneal doses of Metrazol (75 - 100 mg. /kg.) produced typical spikes with large amplitude which were synchronous in the two hemispheres in both young and adult chickens. There was a marked increase in body temperature within 10 minutes after injection in all cases of 50 mg. /kg. intravenous dose: maximum increase (at 40 min.) was 1. 5 ° C. as compared with controls, however, it decreased rapidly with panting behavior. The highest dose (100 mg. /kg.) produced a maximum increase in body temperature of 3 ° C.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the fall}} of 1992, 250 (10 %) of 2, 500 Rambouilet cross feeder lambs grazing Sorghum bicolor {{developed}} neurologic signs including weakness, ataxia, head shaking, knuckling of the fetlocks, inability to rise, and <b>opisthotonos.</b> One hundred fifteen (46 %) of the affected lambs died. Twenty of the surviving lambs exhibited residual neurologic signs of ataxia when stressed. At the same time, 275 (25 %) of 1, 100 ewes grazing a nearby sudex pasture (S. sudanese x S. bicolor) gave birth to lambs that were weak and unable to rise. Newborn lambs exhibited extensor rigidity and <b>opisthotonos</b> when assisted to a standing position. The dystocias that occurred were due to lambs with contracted limbs (arthrogryposis). All affected lambs died or were euthanized. Histologic examination of the brains of 3 feeder lambs and 9 newborn lambs revealed similar microscopic lesions. The predominant change was the presence of focal axonal enlargements (spheroids) in the proximal segments of axons, which were restricted to the nuclei of the medulla, cerebellum, and midbrain. In addition, the spinal cord contained spheroids in the ventral horn gray matter of the 6 newborns examined. Ultrastructurally, the spheroids were composed of aggregates of neurofilaments, mitochondria, vesicular bodies, and dense bodies bounded by a thin myelin sheath. There was mild gliosis in the more severely affected animals of both groups. There was minimal Wallerian degeneration in the white matter adjacent to affected nuclei {{in the brain and}} the ventromedial and dorsolateral funiculi of the spinal cord.

A microemulsion (MICRO) or lipid emulsion (EMU) of propofol was administered intravenously (IV) for induction and maintenance of anesthesia.

On postoperative day 15, patient-ventilator asynchrony was apparent. The patient showed recurrent tachypnea and bradypnea, which seemed typical of Cheyne-Stokes respiration. A neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) catheter was inserted transnasally, and electrical activity of the dia-phragm (Edi) was monitored. Readings showed regular attempts to breathe at 40 – 50 breaths/min with periodic changes in Edi amplitude. NAVA mode improved patient-ventilator synchrony. Pe-riodic breathing continued for 2 weeks. We stopped monitoring Edi on postoperative day 39. He began respiratory rehabilitation and was transferred to a hospital for rehabilitation on postoper-ative day 80. We encountered periodic respiration in a patient with tetanus. Edi monitoring revealed periodic amplitude change.

Materials and Methods: Blood samples were collected from 20 healthy pregnant and 45 pregnancy toxemic goats and analyzed biochemically. Results: The most significant clinical findings were observed in naturally affected goats with pregnancy toxemia included anorexia, recumbency, lethargy, <b>opisthotonos,</b> dropped head, periodic convulsion, sweetish fruity odor from breath, apparent blindness, bloat, grinding of teeth, and frothy salivation. In this study, the level of serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (84. 23 ± 1. 44 IU/L), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (216. 01 ± 4. 07 IU/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (22. 24 ± 0. 31 mg/dl), creatinine (2. 13 ± 0. 09 mg/dl), β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) (0. 46 ± 0. 83 mmol/L), and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) (1. 67 ± 0. 71 mmol/L) was significantly higher whereas glucose (30. 89 ± 0. 38 mg/dl) and calcium (8. 10 ± 0. 20 mg/dl) levels were significantly decreased in pregnancy toxemic goats as compared to healthy goats. Conclusion: The goats with pregnancy toxemia exhibited clinical signs include anorexia, recumbency, sweetish fruity odor from breath, apparent blindness, bloat, grinding of teeth, and frothy salivation. Biochemically, there were significantly decreased the level of glucose and calcium, and increased level of SGPT, SGOT, BUN, creatinine, BHBA, and NEFA in the pregnancy toxemic goats...|$|E
