40|$|Background Contrast-enhanced {{ultrasound}} (CEUS) {{has recently}} been proposed as a minimally- invasive, alternative method for blood volume measurement. This study aims at comparing the accuracy of CEUS and the classical thermodilution techniques for volume assessment in an in-vitro set-up. Methods The in-vitro set-up consisted of a variable network between an inflow and <b>outflow</b> <b>tube</b> and a roller pump. The inflow and outflow tubes were insonified with an ultrasound array transducer and a thermistor was placed in each tube. Indicator dilution curves were made by injecting indicator which consisted of an ultrasound-contrast-agent diluted in ice-cold saline. Both acoustic intensity- and thermo-dilution curves were {{used to calculate the}} indicator mean transit time between the inflow and <b>outflow</b> <b>tube.</b> The volumes were derived by multiplying the estimated mean transit time by the flow rate. We compared the volumes measured by CEUS with the true volumes of the variable network and those measured by thermodilution by Bland-Altman and intraclass-correlation analysis. Results The measurements by CEUS and thermodilution showed a very strong correlation (rs = 0. 94) with a modest volume underestimation by CEUS of - 40 ± 28 mL and an overestimation of 84 ± 62 mL by thermodilution compared with the true volumes. Both CEUS and thermodilution showed a high statistically significant correlation with the true volume (rs = 0. 97 (95 % CI, 0. 95 - 0. 98;...|$|E
5000|$|Cryoloops are cooling {{devices that}} use 23 gauge {{stainless}} steel hypodermic tubing shaped into a loop that can fit into sulci {{or on the}} gyri of the section of interest of the cerebral cortex. A pump draws methanol from a reservoir, and the fluid flows through a dry ice bath to be cooled. The cooled methanol flows through Teflon tubing into the cryoloop’s metal tubing, which is secured by passing through a threaded post. A thermocouple connector receives the wires from a microthermocouple {{at the base of}} the loop (where the inflow and <b>outflow</b> <b>tubes</b> meet) that measures the tubing temperature. The post, the thermocouple connector, and heat-shrink Teflon tubing, which envelopes the microthermocouple wires and the inflow and <b>outflow</b> <b>tubes</b> between the post and microthermocouple, are sealed using dental acrylic. [...] After implantation, when the animal is not participating in an experiment, a protective cap is placed over the open inflow and <b>outflow</b> <b>tubes.</b> During experimentation, the inflow and <b>outflow</b> <b>tubes</b> are attached to the Teflon tubing connected to the reservoir setup. The thermocouple connector is connected to a switchbox and a thermometer so cryoloop temperature can be monitored. [...] Cryoloops are considered the most adaptable form of cooling available due to the customization necessary for each experiment. The investigator must form the functional cooling loop of the cryoloop to fit with whatever part of the brain he/she wishes to study, and several cryoloops can be used for one brain. Each device can cool a range of tissue areas from less than 10 mm3 to 75 mm3. Although it may be considered a hassle to have to form each device for each section of interest, this customization allows for a more controlled region of cooling and for more efficient animal use because of the possibility for multiple cooling sites within each animal. Head restraint is unnecessary because the loops are chronically implanted and secured to the skull by screws and dental acrylic.|$|R
40|$|In eight mesocosms (land based basins) macroalgae {{communities}} with associated fauna were transplanted {{from the sea}} and established during two years. Then, different doses of nutrients (N and P) {{were added to the}} basins throughout the following three years. During the period of nutrient addition, macroinvertebrate grazers showed seasonal fluctuations with densities usually between 500, 000 and 1 million individuals per mesocosm during summer and to a level of about 100, 000 during winter. The macroinvertebrate grazers mainly consisted of about 10 species of amphipods and isopods, among which the amphipod Gammarus locusta dominated strongly by biomass. Although the number of predators was very low, the grazer populations never reached a density where considerable grazing impact could be found on the macroalgae. No increase in grazer density was found in the basins with improved nutrient conditions. Thus food quality may be insufficient for further population growth, or density dependant regulation mechanisms may have prevented the grazers from flourishing and overgrazing the system. In aquarium experiments we showed that G. locusta could grow and reproduce on Fucus serratus, Ulva lactuca, periphyton and detritus, and that cannibalism by adult G. locusta on juveniles may have great impact on the population growth. The basins were run with a water flow through system. Nets were placed in front of the inflow and <b>outflow</b> <b>tubes</b> to measure immigration and emigration. Only few individuals (and no Gammarus sp.) were recorded in the inflowing water, while high numbers of both amphipods and isopods were found in the outflowing water. Emigration reached peak values during night-time, and it was then two to three times as high as during day-time. Emigration of mobile grazers from the basins amounted to 1 - 2 % of the standing stock daily. These mechanisms that regulate grazers do contribute to maintenance of the seaweed dominance and thus the stability of the seaweed community...|$|R
30|$|Each snake was weighed at the {{beginning}} of the experiment, and we used this mass to calculate the meal size. Thirty minutes before measuring oxygen consumption, we habituated a snake to a 790 -mL opaque test chamber with a ventilated lid. Just prior to data collection, we replaced the ventilated lid with a tightly fitting lid that housed both air inflow and <b>outflow</b> <b>tubes.</b> Air passed from the test chamber through a tube of Drierite and a tube of soda lime and on to a Qubit Systems Flow Through Oxygen Sensor (S 102, Qubit Systems Inc., Kingston, Ontario, Canada). The oxygen sensor was calibrated with nitrogen gas and then room air. Room air at 25 °C (range, 24.3 °C to 26.3 °C) passed through the system at 160  ml/min. Oxygen consumption was monitored for 15  min unless the oxygen concentration in the outflow air was variable (due to snake activity). In that case, monitoring continued until the oxygen concentration in the outflow air became constant. Data were gathered by Logger Pro 3.2 software (Vernier Software and Technology, Beaverton, OR, USA). Oxygen consumption was measured before feeding and at 6, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 72, and 96  h after a snake had eaten a mouse meal equivalent to 10 % of its body mass (mean, 10.08 %[*]±[*] 0.41 %; range, 9.4 %– 10.9 %). All measurements were made at 8 : 00 to 19 : 00 CDT to avoid any influence of a diel cycle in oxygen consumption. To obtain measurements that occurred outside this time, a snake was fed a second time after obtaining measurements that occurred at 8 : 00 to 19 : 00 CDT. Instead of feeding the snakes in the morning, the second feeding occurred in the evening, and data for the missing times were gathered beginning the next day. After each test session, the snake was removed from the chamber and placed in its home container.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop two methods to predict the volume of whole Alaska pollock and to compare the results with the experimentally measured volumes. One hundred fifty-five whole pollock, obtained from a Kodiak processor, were individually immersed in a graduated cylinder equipped with an <b>outflow</b> <b>tube</b> to catch the displaced water as a result of immersion. The weight of the water was recorded. Then the fish were placed in a light box equipped with a digital video camera, and the side view and top view recorded (2 images for each fish). A reference square of known surface area was placed by the fish. A cubic spline method to predict volume by integration of cross-sectional area slices based on the top and side views and an empirical equation using dimensional (length L, width W, depth D) measurements at three locations of the fish image were developed. The R 2 value for the correlation between the L × W × D versus measured volume was 0. 987. The best R 2 for the correlation of the predicted volume by the cubic spline method versus the measured volume was 0. 99.

40|$|A 55 -year-old male {{presented}} with progressively worsening nausea over a one-year period. It {{began when he}} started peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal disease. His nausea progressed {{to the point that}} he could not tolerate oral intake. He also had difficulty with exchanges, but the exchange fluid was clear. He denied any fever, chills, abdominal pain, change in bowel movements, hematochezia, or hematemesis. The physical exam was unremarkable except for mild discomfort in the right lower quadrant. The peritoneal dialysis catheter was intact and appeared to be clean. The laboratory exam showed a normal white cell count and a negative peritoneal fluid culture. A KUB showed a large amount of free intra-peritoneal air. Further questioning of the patient revealed improper use of the peritoneal dialysis system as a cause of the pneumoperitoneum. The prevalence and clinical significance of pneumoperitoneum in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients is not defined fully in the current literature. Some reports suggested that, unlike in non-PD patients, it rarely is caused by gastrointestinal perforation. 1 Intestinal perforation can be ruled out by rapid clinical improvement with standard therapy, growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the peritoneal effluent culture, reduction of pneumoperitoneum after correction of the technical fault, and in contrast to the Gram-negatives and/or anaerobes usually found during bowel perforation. 2 - 3 Computed tomography is more sensitive than x-ray film in detecting sub-diaphragmatic free air. No agreement exists whether the amount of sub-diaphragmatic air can differentiate bowel perforation from other causes of pneumoperitoneum. Opening the <b>outflow</b> <b>tube</b> and manua...|$|E
40|$|After weaning piglets {{frequently}} have diarrhoea {{associated with an}} enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection. Alternative plant protein sources such as peas, faba beans and lupins may contribute in preventing gastrointestinal problems. In the small intestinal segment perfusion model, the anti-diarrhoea effect of pea and faba bean fractions on net absorption of fluid was investigated. Segments with a cranial inflow tube and a caudal <b>outflow</b> <b>tube</b> were fitted in the small intestine of 5 -week old anaesthetized piglets. The odd numbered segments were infused with ETEC and the even segments with PBS, whereupon the segments were perfused over 8 h. Pea meal, pea hulls, protein-enriched pea meal and starch-enriched pea meal were perfused in 4 piglets in 4 pairs of segments (an uninfected and an adjacent ETEC-infected) with saline as a control in another pair of segments. Faba bean meal, faba bean hulls, protein-enriched faba bean meal and starch-enriched faba bean meal were perfused in another 4 piglets. Net fluid absorption was calculated from {{the difference between the}} volumes of inflow and outflow divided by the surface area. ETEC induced loss of net intestinal fluid absorption was shown to be decreased in the segments perfused with pea hulls and faba bean hulls, while there was no effect of the other pea or faba bean products. Although hulls of pea and faba bean did not completely eliminate the decreased fluid absorption after ETEC challenge, these results indicate that hulls of pea and faba bean may promote net fluid absorption in piglets during post weaning diarrhoea...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is proposed to simulate brackish karstic springs. Rainfall data constitutes model input information while output information is the discharge and the chloride {{concentration of the}} water versus time. The model was constructed by considering the mass and mechanical energy balance on the hydrodynamic analog, which includes three reservoirs <b>outflowing</b> in a <b>tube</b> that lies adjacent to the spring. Two reservoirs emulate the karstic system, and the third one emulates the sea. The discharge of the spring is given by {{the sum of the}} discharge of the reservoirs, and the chloride concentration by the solution of the mixing problem between the fresh and the salty water, which exists in the tube leading to the spring. The model is applied to the spring of Almiros at Heraklion, Crete, Greece.

In the {{experiments}} iron hydroxide {{was removed from}} sand by HCl by, subsequently the sand was boiled off with water and under water filled into 2 cm wide glass tubes. The tubes were sealed by an bored-through stopper provided at the lower, rear end a thin wire gauze and eventually a thin cotton wool plug, and the <b>outflow</b> <b>tube</b> pushed into the same leads into a container with water under constant pressure; the other tube end was provided with an inlet tube, which was also connected also to a water container under constant pressure. During off-time of {{the experiments}} the tubes were sealed air-proof. Both the tubes and the container intended for the in-take of the water flowed through were placed beside each other and were subjected thus in same way to the by the way almost constant temperature. An indispensable condition {{for the success of}} the experiments is the uniform grain size of the sand, which by the way may be put into the tubes only by small amounts. The substantial results of these investigations touching different hydrologic and soil science controversial issues are the subsequent: 1. The velocity of water circulating in horizontal direction in a sand does is not in reverse relation to the thickness of the filter and in straight relation to the applied pressure. In thick filter columns the pressure effect decreases more and more, and the movement of the water is only based on the imbibition. The effect even of a very strong pressure stops after short extending, and the water flows, as if no pressure was applied, therefore a pressure locally applied on a sand layer does not propagate on a considerable distance. 2. With the filtration in vertical direction according results are obtained only for same particle size of the sand; since this condition in nature is hardly fulfilled, no generally valid mathematical formula can be set up for this circulation. Under influence of the water movement in vertical direction the fine parts of the sand move upward, so that the water passage is hindered here and a to a certain extent an automatic rational filter is formed. 3. The resistance of the filter exerted on the passed water decreases apparently proportional to the filter thickness, the POISEUILLE law is only valid for thin filters. 4. If the water percolating the sand filter contains air, so it sticks at the sand grains on certain positions and hinders to a high degree the descending of the water. 5. The runoff from a vertically placed filter decreases only proportional to the thickness at the point, when the pressure reached a certain intensity. If this pressure is only weak, then the filtrate quantity increases with the filter thickness, because then the weight of the water column makes an effect. From this the conclusion is to be drawn that the seepage water quantities supplied to a groundwater stream are not pressed down by any means by the thickness of the layer to be percolated. 6. The volume of the water moistening the sand predominates the volume of the voids of the sand grains in apparent contact the more, the finer the sand is. The free space between the sand grains influnces therefore enormously the mobility of the sand impregnated with water (swimming sand). 7. Temperature increase accelerates the action of a filter due to the reduction of the inner friction of the filter fluid, however for a doubling of the filtrate quantity a rise in temperature to almost 30 ° is required. 8. The loess loam from the Hesbaye is still permeable for water at a thickness of 8 m (and probably still further). The same applies to clay, as long as he does not stand under pressure, thus it can be unhinderedly expanding correspondingly to the infiltration. 10. From all that it follows that the down flow of the meteoric water cannot take place regularly through the soil in parallel layers. Flowing on into the depth takes place only in limited space, because of the soil air which has to be displaced, since channels must remain for escaping air. Here the water penetrates only if the surface is sprinkled or covered by a rather high water layer or by melting snow, respectively. If the water begins to penetrate, then its velocity increases with the height of the water column. Subsequently on the superficial layers a suction effect is then carried out, which stops only then if the flow downward is in equilibrium with the capillary impregnation, and so the movement is downward annihilated.

In mice, this nascent tube contains the future left ventricle and atrioventricular canal. Mesenchymal cells subsequently recruited to the cardiac lineage at the intake and the <b>outflow</b> of the <b>tube</b> will form the atria {{and the right}} ventricle and outflow tract, respectively. Shortly after its emergence, the embryonic heart tube starts to loop, and {{the first signs of}} left ventricular chamber differentiation become visible on the outer curvature of the middle portion of the tube. Subsequently, the right ventricle differentiates cranially, and the atria caudally, while the inflow tract, atrioventricular canal, inner curvatures, and outflow tract form recognizable components flanking the chambers. The latter, nonchamber regions in turn provide signals for the formation of the cushion mesenchyme, are involved in remodeling of the heart, and form the nodes of the conduction system.

40|$|Cardiac {{progenitor}} {{cells are}} multipotent stem cells isolated from both embryonic and adult hearts in several species {{and are able}} to differentiate at least into smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. The embryonic origin of these cells has not yet been demonstrated, but {{it has been suggested that}} these cells may derive from the first and secondary heart fields and from the neural crest. In the last decade, two different popula-tions of cardiac progenitor or stem cells have been identified and isolated, i. e., the Islet 1 positive (Isl 1 +) and c-Kit positive (c-Kit+) /Stem Cell Antigen- 1 positive (Sca- 1 +) cells. Until 2012, these two populations have been considered two separate entities with dif-ferent roles and a different origin, but new evi-dence now suggests a connection between the two populations and that the two populations may represent two subpopulations of a unique pool of cardiac stem cells, derived from a com-mon immature primitive cell. To find a com-mon consensus on this concept is very impor-tant in furthering the application of stem cells to cardiac tissue engineering. Islet 1 positive cells duringheart development At the end of 2003, the research group of Prof. Evans, using a mouse mutant for the LIM homeodomain transcription factor (Islet 1, Isl 1), demonstrated that an Isl 1 positive (Isl 1 +) population is localised in the secon-dary heart field (SHF), contributing to the out-flow tract, right ventricle, atria and (to a small extent) the left ventricle. 1 Isl 1 is considered a marker of SHF cells that contribute to the venous and arterial poles of the cardiac tube, while the other cells from the SHF contribute only to the arterial pole. 2 The SHF or anterior heat field (AHF) was identified as a splanchnic mesoderm underlying the caudal pharynx, which provides myocardium to the <b>outflow</b> tract during <b>tube</b> looping. 3, 4 In 2005, the same research group also identified Isl 1 +/c-Kit negative (c-Kit-) /Stem Cell Antigen- 1 negative (Sca- 1 -) progenitors in the postnatal heart, demonstrating that these cells persist after birth and that these organ-specific progenitor cells may be isolated, purified, expanded and differentiated into mature cardiac myocytes for future cardiac applications...|$|R
