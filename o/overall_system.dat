Based on the improved organization, the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert late on November6, and at 00:00UTC the next day initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 03B just west of the Andaman Islands. Six hours later, the IMD likewise classified the system as a depression.|$|E

5|$|Aoki {{ultimately}} produced Chrono Trigger, while director credits were {{attributed to}} Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. Toriyama designed the game's aesthetic, including characters, monsters, vehicles, and the look of each era. Masato Kato also contributed character ideas and designs. Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him, but he was cut early in development. The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style. Sakaguchi and Horii supervised; Sakaguchi {{was responsible for the}} game's <b>overall</b> <b>system</b> and contributed several monster ideas. Other notable designers include Tetsuya Takahashi, the graphic director, and Yasuyuki Honne, Tetsuya Nomura, and Yusuke Naora, who worked as field graphic artists. Yasuhika Kamata programmed graphics, and cited Ridley Scott's visual work in the film Alien as an inspiration for the game's lighting. Kamata made the game's luminosity and color choice lay between that of Secret of Mana and the Final Fantasy series. Features originally intended to be used in Secret of Mana or Final Fantasy IV, also under development at the same time, were appropriated by the Chrono Trigger team.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} week of September, a cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States and stalled over the Atlantic Ocean. By September 8, a weak frontal wave began {{developing}} along the cold front. Late on September 9, convection increased over the broad low pressure area, and the <b>overall</b> <b>system</b> intensified beneath an upper-level low. Subsequently, the system abandoned its frontal features as its appearance became more circular. With persistent but limited convection near and {{to the west of the}} center, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September 10 about 375mi (604km) west-southwest of Bermuda; it was considered subtropical because the upper-circulation was believed to have been cold-core. Operationally, advisories on the system were not initiated until 21hours later.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the storms}} {{originated}} from the intertropical convergence zone. In late December into early January, tropical storms Bentha and Christelle persisted {{to the east}} of Madagascar, undergoing the Fujiwhara effect with each other. Later in January, Dorina became the second of three intense tropical cyclones, but weakened before passing near Rodrigues. Tropical Depression Eliceca and Tropical Storm Fodah both formed in the Mozambique Channel toward the end of January, bringing gusty winds and rainfall to the region. In February, Gail produced gusty winds on Rodrigues, and Tropical Storm Heida entered the basin from Australian region. Later in the month, Ingrid brought strong winds to Mauritius. Tropical storms Josta and Kylie developed toward the beginning of March from the same <b>overall</b> <b>system,</b> affecting Madagascar and Réunion, respectively. After they dissipated, Tropical Depression Lidy caused flooding and damage on Rodrigues due to heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|The Intertropical Convergence Zone {{produced}} {{an area of}} convection in the southeastern Arabian Sea {{toward the end of}} October 2011. The <b>overall</b> <b>system</b> moved west-northwestward, developing a distinct low pressure area on October27. By that time, the thunderstorm activity was still disorganized and associated with a weak circulation. Environmental conditions were unfavorable initially, consisting of strong wind shear and dry air. An anticyclone over the system caused the shear to decrease by October28, amid warm water temperatures of , both more favorable conditions. By that time the circulation became well-defined, although still elongated, and the convection was still scattered. On October29, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as Depression ARB 02 about 885km (550mi) east of the Yemeni island of Socotra.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear {{began to}} {{increase}} earlier than forecast models anticipated, causing the storm to weaken into a minimal tropical storm later that morning. Around 1830UTC, {{the center of}} Erika passed over the island of Guadeloupe with winds of 40mph (65km/h) as the storm entered the eastern Caribbean Sea. The circulation later became elongated and began to degenerate into a trough of low pressure. The NHC noted that due to the large size of the <b>overall</b> <b>system,</b> the center of Erika could reform elsewhere and restrengthen. Following a brief increase in convective activity, the storm slightly intensified before succumbing to wind shear once more. By the afternoon of September3, the center of Erika was fully devoid of convection and the NHC downgraded it to a tropical depression. Shortly after, the system degenerated into a remnant low, coinciding with the issuance of the final advisory from the NHC. The following day, the remnants approached the southern coast of Puerto Rico, producing heavy rainfall across the island. The system was last noted later on September4 as it dissipated roughly 80mi (140km) south of Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} strengthened slightly {{further to}} a peak intensity of 80mph (130km/h) by 00:00UTC on September 2. At around 05:30UTC (1:30a.m.EDT) that day, Hermine made landfall {{just east of}} St. Marks, Florida, at peak intensity, with a minimum pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 29.00inHg). Hermine became the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma on October 24, 2005. Within four hours of landfall, the winds dropped below hurricane force as the appearance on radar imagery degraded. The convection diminished while Hermine crossed into Georgia, with the strongest winds near the Atlantic coast. The center elongated as it continued quickly northeastward ahead of the trough. With the convection {{far ahead of the}} circulation, Hermine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 12:00UTC on September3 as it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Dry air wrapped into the eastward-moving center, while convection pulsed north of the former hurricane, possibly due to the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream. By September5, the system devolved into several rotating circulations as the <b>overall</b> <b>system</b> slowed and turned to the northwest, steered by a ridge to the north. The convection began waning on the next day, as the storm turned due westward. At 18:00UTC on September6, the NHC ceased issuing advisories on the post-tropical cyclone as Hermine continued to weaken, due to cooler waters and convective instability. The remnants continued to meander offshore New Jersey and Long Island, until dissipating near Chatham, Massachusetts, late on September8.|$|E
