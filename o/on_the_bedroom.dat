5|$|Krug {{was born}} Judith Fingeret in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 15, 1940. Her {{interest}} in {{freedom of speech}} was fostered from an early age. She recalled reading a book about sex education under the covers in her bedroom with a flashlight {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked what she was doing. When she held up the book, her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her to turn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> light so she could read properly and avoid damage to her eyes.|$|E
25|$|Not {{everything}} at Princes Gate was bequeathed to the Courtauld as the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna was bequeathed two paintings: a copy by Van Dyck of a Titian called 'Madonna and Child with St Dorothy' and {{a painting by}} Domenico Fetti called 'The Return of the Prodigal Son' and Seilern's nephews and nieces received substantial bequests of groups of art works in the collection, like the Dürer engravings, Greek vases, German and Austrian paintings not in the published catalogue (that hung principally <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> floor at Princes Gate), and the pictures at the farm in Buckinghamshire.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Mildred became pregnant. In June 1958, {{the couple}} {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. to marry, thereby evading Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which made marriage between whites and non-whites a crime. They returned to {{the small town of}} Central Point, Virginia. Based on an anonymous tip, local police raided their home {{in the early morning hours}} of July 11, 1958, hoping to find them having sex, given that interracial sex was then also illegal in Virginia. When the officers found the Lovings sleeping in their bed, Mildred pointed out their marriage certificate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> wall. They were told the certificate was not valid in the Commonwealth.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the day, Clair and Cliff {{settle into}} bed. As he becomes amorous, she reminds him that was how they got all those {{troublesome}} kids. This puts him off for a few seconds. Then Vanessa and Rudy knock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> door because Rudy was scared of [...] "the Wolf Man" [...] in their closet. Clair invites the kids to sleep with her and Cliff.|$|E
500|$|The Sex Pistols {{film was}} {{completed}} by Temple, who received sole credit for the script after McLaren had his name taken off the production. Finally released in 1980, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle still largely reflects McLaren's vision. It is a fictionalised, farcical, partially animated retelling of the band's history and aftermath with McLaren in the lead role, Jones as second lead, and contributions from Vicious (including his memorable performance of [...] "My Way") and Cook. It incorporates promotional videos shot for [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] and [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] and extensive documentary footage as well, much of it focusing on Rotten. In Temple's description, he and McLaren conceived it as a [...] "very stylised...polemic". They were reacting {{to the fact that}} the Pistols had become the [...] "poster <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> wall of the day where you kneel down last thing at night and pray to your rock god. And that was never the point.... The myth had to be dynamited in some way. We had to make this film in a way to enrage the fans". In the film, McLaren claims to have created the band from scratch and engineered its notorious reputation; much of what structure the loose narrative has is based on McLaren's teaching a series of [...] "lessons" [...] to be learned from [...] "an invention of mine they called the punk rock".|$|E
2500|$|On 1 March 1953, Stalin's staff {{found him}} semi-conscious <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{floor of his}} Volynskoe dacha, having urinated down himself. He had {{suffered}} a burst blood vessel in the brain. He was moved onto a couch and remained there for three days. He was hand-fed using a spoon, given various medicines and injections, and leeches were applied to him. Svetlana and Vasily were called to the dacha on 2 March; the latter was drunk and angrily shouted at the doctors, resulting in him being sent home. Stalin died on 5 March 1953. According to Svetlana, it had been [...] "a difficult and terrible death".|$|E

60|$|On {{the ninth}} the wagon arrived with the furniture, {{and the men}} set to work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> From this moment Morgan retired {{definitely}} {{to the top of}} the tower, and Owen became too nervous to lay the necessary amount of paint on the Earthquake at Lisbon.|$|E
60|$|The {{tiny room}} was inexpressibly hot and stuffy. Hardly {{a breath of}} outside air came in through the narrow window, which only gave <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> beyond.

60|$|It was as he expected. The bed, {{the room}} also, was empty. And what was stranger, even to his heavy intelligence, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> chair {{and along the}} rail of the bed were {{scattered}} the garments, the only garments so far as he knew, and the bandages of their guest. His big slouch hat even was cocked jauntily over the bed-post.|$|E
60|$|Before {{leaving the}} house and the town forever, he gave {{instructions}} to a friend and neighbor to sell his furniture for anything that it would fetch, and apply the proceeds to employing the police to trace her.

60|$|The answer really shocked me--there {{was such}} a glaring impropriety in {{permitting}} an under-housemaid to fill the place of confidential attendant on Lady Glyde. I went upstairs at once, and met Margaret <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> landing. Her services had not been required (naturally enough), her mistress having sufficiently recovered that morning {{to be able to}} leave her bed. I asked next after Miss Halcombe, but I was answered in a slouching, sulky way, which left me no wiser than I was before.|$|E
6000|$|Very slowly Babbie {{climbed the}} stairs. I suppose {{she is the}} only person who was ever afraid of Margaret. Her first knock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> door was so soft that Margaret, who was sitting up in bed, did not hear it. When Babbie entered the room, Margaret's first thought was that there could be no other so {{beautiful}} as this, and her second was that the stranger seemed even more timid than herself. After a few minutes' talk she laid aside her primness, a weapon she had drawn in self-defence lest this fine lady should not understand the grandeur of a manse, and at a [...] "Call me Babbie, won't you?" [...] she smiled.|$|E
60|$|On her {{way back}} she noticed an object which had {{previously}} escaped her attention. It was a low truckle-bed, placed parallel with the wall, and close {{to one of the}} doors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> side. In spite of its strange and comfortless situation, the bed was apparently occupied at night by a sleeper; the sheets were on it, and the end of a thick red fisherman's cap peeped out from under the pillow. She ventured on opening the door near which the bed was placed, and found herself, as she conjectured from certain signs and tokens, in the admiral's sleeping chamber. A moment's observation of the room was all she dared risk, and, softly closing the door again, she returned to the kitchen regions.|$|E

60|$|For {{all that}} touched his past among his fellows, or their remembrance of him, {{he might have}} been in another planet; and Sophie, whose life had been very largely spent among husbandless wives of lofty ideals, had no wish to leave this present of God. The unhurried meals, the foreknowledge of deliciously empty hours to follow, the breadths of soft sky under which they walked {{together}} and reckoned time only by their hunger or thirst; the good grass beneath their feet that cheated the miles; their discoveries, always together, amid the farms--Griffons, Rocketts, Burnt House, Gale Anstey, and the Home Farm, where Iggulden of the blue smock-frock would waylay them, and they would ransack the old house once more; the long wet afternoons when, they tucked up their feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom's</b> deep window-sill over against the apple-trees, and talked together as never till then had they found time to talk--these things contented her soul, and her body throve.|$|R
