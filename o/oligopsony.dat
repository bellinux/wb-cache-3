40|$|Witnessing {{the long-standing}} {{resource}} insufficiency in Hungarian agriculture, the question arises: aside from obviously low efficiencies, {{to what extent}} have unfavorable prices led to this situation. In my presentation I will try {{to answer the question}} whether, assuming some kind of value-categories or other as given and measured against this, the permanent erosion of agricultural prices can be established. If so, could declining prices be connected to specific features of the agricultural sector? These answers may be useful for experts in make arrangements for decisions of agricultural policy. Research on micro-economic principles, shows that for an analysis of the value-distortion of our prices the equilibrium prices of the so-called “Walras market” (a hypothetical market model) may be used as a starting point. In comparison with these can be shown that oligopol and oligopson market players tend to raise sales prices and reduce purchase prices, and reduce quantities. Due to the nature of their business farmers as suppliers must accept further drop in prices from oligopolies (selling production capacity in a strong market position) and from <b>oligopsonies</b> purchasing agricultural products. Subsidies acquired legally for other purposes have been used by farmers to compensate created by the steady erosion of prices over the past few decades, a phenomenon not seen in other sectors and essentially attributed to agriculture. forráshiány, ár értékaránytalanság, támogatás, élelmiszerláncok, lack of sources, price - value unballane, subsidies, food-chain, Agricultural and Food Policy, Demand and Price Analysis, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

This chapter {{argues for}} {{connecting}} models of {{several kinds of}} macro- and microprocesses as they affect structure and dynamics in the globalization of networks of trade. The purpose is to explore multiple levels of structure, process, and adaptation and to loosen assumptions about determinacy in models of networks and globalization. As do many models of emergence, it questions the notions of inevitability that too often surround studies of globalization. Particularly useful for comparison of cases are the models of “world system” developed by Modelski and Thompson (1996, see Devezas and Modelski, 2008). These focus on national policy-driven innovation and processes of European “evolutionary learning” {{that began in the}} 1400 s. They put into context the models that focus on core-periphery structure as developed by Braudel (1973), or the “world-system” core-periphery model that for Wallerstein (1974) begins in the 1600 s. Study of structures of core-periphery in world systems can benefit from added dimensions, improved measurement of network structure, and understanding the effects of periodic crises in terms of historical dynamics. An unexpected outcome of this survey for issues of policy is that it develops a deeper historical understanding of how certain kinds of exchange systems develop several kinds of inequalities that are inimical to the concept of fair pricing in the operation of market equilibria, {{even in the absence of}} economic oligopolies (monopoly, duopoly) and <b>oligopsonies</b> (monopsony, duopsony).

Abstract The present work {{tries to}} {{understand the importance of}} the cooperation practiceamongst familiar rural workers in a region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul from theinternal and external socio-economical relations. From the analysis of internalrelations comes the comprehension of economic logic of the family of rural workers inproducing only the necessary for their self-support with adequate use of availablefamiliar labour. The external relations of the rural workers are comprised of severaltraditions, culture and symbolism which are present on social relations in the familyincluding the reciprocity relations and, at the same time, it is understood how andwhy the latter changes in rural workers integrated to the market and the agroindustrialcomplexes. Thus, this is the merchant integration of milk producers and theconfrontation with the <b>oligopsonies</b> of dairy products, which have the power to dictate the price of products. In order to balance this power, the producers organizethemselves into joint network trades in order to increase their bargain capabilities,better price and product conditions. The comprehension of the process oforganization in formal and informal exerted the efforts of this study, in order tounderstand how and why these cooperation networks amongst such producers andnot amongst others. Besides, it may be verified whether this organization givesopportunities to obtain a better socio-economical performance. The results led to twoconclusions: the cooperation networks formed amongst milk producers are generatedfrom the work and social relations of reciprocity, where the main concepts play animportant role on trust formation amongst them; these cooperation networks havegiven better results on the social and economical indicators. </div...|$|R

40|$|Optimal {{allocation}} of irrigation {{water is a}} modern economic and social concern of growing importance in Australia, {{as well as in}} many other countries. The market based mechanism has been advocated in the economics literature as an efficient and effective measure for {{allocation of}} irrigation water. Water markets and water rights trading have been operating for many years aiming to improve the efficiency of water allocation in the Murray–Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia. Several stages of the Council of Australian Government's water reform agenda have been implemented. Water right and land ownership have been separated so that allocations or entitlements of water rights become transferable. Farmers can therefore trade their water rights in water markets without having to transfer their land ownership. Few empirical studies have been conducted into the efficiency and effectiveness of water markets. This study examines economic efficiency, competitiveness, and irrigators’ response to the changes of economic and non economic variables in allocation water markets in Victoria that permit trading in irrigation water rights. This study begins with an analysis of the economic theory of efficient allocation of water, the theory of goods underlying water markets, the public and private nature of these markets, along with attention of externalities, market structures and the role of natural monopolies in water industry. It provides an examination of the systems of water rights found in the literature, a discussion of the legislative basis of the water right systems that govern access to and use of irrigation water in each of Australian states and territories including the institutional arrangements shaping trade in Victorian water markets. The legislative water right in Australia is the contemporary water allocation system and governs water entitlements and allocations. Water rights are essentially a bundle of entitlements that define the rights, privileges and limitations {{for the use of the}} water of an owner. The characteristics of water rights include universality, exclusivity, transferability and enforceability. In Victoria, under the Water (Resource Management) Act 2005, new regulations were issued, and a number of major changes to the water trading landscape were made, including the creation of an environmental water reserve; the unbundling of existing water entitlements into water shares, and the creation of the Victorian water register. On a national level, the key water policies are specified in the National Water Initiative in 2004. The Water Act 2007 (Commonwealth) secures the water supply and water allocation equitably including the allocation for the riverine environment in MDB. The demand and supply for irrigated water, the markets for water rights trading and the contestability of Australian water markets is analysed. Also, the existing water market mechanisms and trading including the evolution of the markets, their structure, and the trading rules and institutional arrangements in the Murray–Darling Basin region in Australia is described. The Murray–Darling Basin region is the most active region of irrigation water trading in Australia. The relevance of the determinants of demand and supply for irrigation water and the price elasticity of demand are discussed. The auction form of water trading in the water market is also described, and the Watermove water market in Victoria is analysed. Empirical evidence on the economic efficiency of three water markets in northern Victoria is provided. The stochastic time series properties of water prices are established through statistical tests commonly used to evaluate market efficiency in financial and commodity markets. The random walks of the stochastic properties of water price time series for the three markets are tested. The results of Augmented Dickey–Fuller’s unit test, Zivot and Andrews unit root test with one structural break, and Lee-Strazicich LM unit root test with one structural break and two structural breaks suggest that the water price time series in the three markets that the water price time series are non stationary and follow random walks. The findings are very important, and prove that the three markets are efficient according to the theory of Efficient Market Hypothesis since the water prices cannot be predicted based on the available market information for traders. More conventional scrutiny of industry efficiency is achieved through measures of the size distribution of firms. The measures which include concentration ratio, Herfindahl– Hirschman index, and Gini coefficient, are applied to analyse the three markets’ concentration and competitiveness in terms of the market size, the number of traders who participated, the number of successful traders, and the quantity of water traded. These measures for the three water markets have consistent results. The outcomes of the three measures in the market structure, and the competitiveness for the three markets suggest that there are no monopolies and oligopolies in supply, and there are no monopsonies and <b>oligopsonies</b> in demand in the three water markets. Also, the outcomes of the analyses suggest that there are many irrigators participating in the three water markets, either as sellers or buyers, and they are price takers. However, one market is a relatively moderate concentrated market and a monopolistic competitive. The results suggest that the three water markets are between perfect competition and monopolistic competition. Finally, models of water demand for the three water markets are developed and estimated with a view to measuring the strength of price and non-price factors driving changes in the demand for irrigation water. The estimated OLS models of demand for water for the three water markets in this study suggests that the macro economic variables in relation to agriculture including the rural commodity index, the rural GDP and the rural export in Australia do not have influence on the demand for water in the three water markets. The estimated water demand models for the three water markets show that the evaporation has positive impact on the demand for water, and the water price and the rainfall have negative impact on the demand for water. The findings are consistent with the economic logic. The findings suggest that the direct explanatory variables, the water price, the rainfall and the evaporation, influence the demand for water in the three water markets, but they are water demand inelastic...|$|R
5000|$|Monopsony {{theory was}} {{developed}} by economist Joan Robinson in her book The Economics of Imperfect Competition (1933). Economists use the term [...] "monopsony power" [...] {{in a manner similar}} to [...] "monopoly power" [...] as a shorthand reference for a scenario in which there is one dominant power in the buying relationship, so that power is able to set prices to maximize profits not subject to competitive constraints. Monopsony power exists when one buyer faces little competition from other buyers for that labor or good, so they are able to set wages and prices for the labor or goods they are buying at a level lower than the marginal revenue created by that labor or good, minimizing costs and maximizing profits. A classic example is a mining town, where the company that owns the mine is able to set wages low since they face no competition from other employers in hiring workers since they are the only employer in the town and geographic constraints prevent workers from seeking employment in other locations. Since there is rarely truly only one employer, more realistic examples include school districts where teachers have little mobility across districts so the district faces little competition from other schools in hiring teachers so they can set salaries lower than they would be in a competitive market.

Where Domar argues that labor scarcity {{is a necessary}} but exogenous political factor needed for serfdom, Rosa challenges his view by showing that “in an agrarian subsistence economy the complementary conditions of serfdom are (a) <b>oligopsony</b> power in labor demand, sustained by (b) an oligopolistic supply of violence by large land owners.” In addition, Professor Erik Green of Lund University argues that Domar’s model fails in explaining the origins of slavery in Cape Colony, South Africa, where {{the consensus is that}} slavery evolved as an urban phenomenon, which would call into question the land/labor ratio Domar uses to explain the causes of slavery and serfdom. Moreover, Professor Jonathon Cunning of Hunter University authored a paper titled “On the Causes of Slavery or Serfdom and the Roads to Agrarian Capitalism: Domar’s Hypothesis Revisited” In his paper, Cunning offers a “simple general equilibrium formalization of Domar’s famous hypothesis on the causes of slavery or serfdom that emphasizes the interactions between factor endowments, the nature of the production technologies, and the initial distribution of property rights over land.” Cunning’s paper is viewed more so as an expansion upon Domar’s model rather than a direct challenge to his hypothesis.|$|E
