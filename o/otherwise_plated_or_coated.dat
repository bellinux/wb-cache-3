5000|$|Rare-earth magnets {{are strong}} {{permanent}} magnets made from alloys of {{rare earth elements}} (elements in the lanthanide series, plus scandium and yttrium). [...] Developed in the 1970s and '80s, rare-earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets made, producing significantly stronger magnetic fields than other types such as ferrite or alnico magnets. The magnetic field typically produced by rare-earth magnets can exceed 1.4 teslas, whereas ferrite or ceramic magnets typically exhibit fields of 0.5 to 1 tesla. There are two types: neodymium magnets and samarium-cobalt magnets. Magnetostrictive rare-earth magnets such as Terfenol-D also have applications—e.g. in loudspeakers.

50|$|Shot peening and {{abrasive}} blasting can apply materials on metal surfaces. When the shot or grit particles are blasted through a powder or liquid containing the desired surface <b>coating,</b> the impact <b>plates</b> <b>or</b> <b>coats</b> the workpiece surface. The {{process has been}} used to embed ceramic coatings, though the coverage is random rather than coherent. 3M developed a process where a metal surface was blasted with particles with a core of alumina and an outer layer of silica. The result was fusion of the silica to the surface. The process known as peen plating was developed by NASA. Fine powders of metals <b>or</b> non-metals are <b>plated</b> onto metal surfaces using glass bead shot as the blast medium. The process has evolved to applying solid lubricants such as molybdenum disulphide to surfaces. Biocompatible ceramics have been applied this way to biomedical implants. Peen plating subjects the coating material to high heat in the collisions with the shot and the coating must also be available in powder form, limiting the range of materials that can be used. To overcome the problem of heat, a process called temperature moderated-collision mediated coating (TM-CMC) has allowed the use of polymers and antibiotic materials as peened coatings. The coating is presented as an aerosol directed to the surface {{at the same time as}} a stream of shot particles. The TM-CMC process is still in the R&D phase of development.|$|R

50|$|In the Military {{of ancient}} Rome, heavy {{infantry}} made {{up most of}} the Roman army. The heavy infantry of the pre-Marian Roman republic included the Hastati, Principes, and Triarii. (although depending how the hastati was armed and armored, it could also be considered light infantry) The hastati, the youngest men in the line, were armed with a sword, or gladius, and two javelins, or pila. The pila (singular pilum) were usually thrown at a charging enemy before they were engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Hastati were also equipped with a helmet, a shield and a bronze breast <b>plate</b> <b>or</b> <b>coat</b> of mail (if they could afford it). The principes were armed just like the hastati, but they were older, more experienced and, because they had more money, were more likely to own better-quality arms. The final type of heavy infantry were the triarii. They were armed and armored just like the hastati except that instead of holding pila to throw at the enemy, they used a large spear known as the hasta. Incidentally, the hastati were originally armed with this weapon, which gave them their name, but the hasta were eventually abandoned except by the triarii. The triarii were usually called in to end the battle and break the lines of the enemy. Rome's use of heavy infantry and a general lack of major cavalry forces meant they were stronger in pitched battle but more vulnerable to ambushes. After the Marian reforms of the late 2nd century BCE, property requirements were dropped and the three-lined maniples were replaced in favor of a single type of heavy infantry, the legionary, all equipped in nearly identical fashion to hastati and principes.|$|R
50|$|Gauge blocks {{are usually}} made either from {{hardened}} alloy tool steels or from cemented carbides (such as tungsten carbide or tantalum carbide). Often the carbide has a hardness of 1500 Vickers hardness. Long series blocks {{are made from}} high-quality steel having cross section (35 × 9 mm) with holes for clamping two slips together. These are also available in carbon steel material. Steel blocks are hardened and tempered. The hardness {{is important because it}} slows down the gauge's rate of wear during use (this is why other kinds of gauges, such as pins, thread plugs, and rings, are also hardened.) The cutting of the blocks to size is accomplished with grinding followed by lapping. Usually no <b>plating</b> <b>or</b> other <b>coating</b> is involved. Blocks are kept very lightly oiled, and are stored and used in dry climate-controlled conditions; unplated, uncoated steel gauge blocks can last for decades without rusting.|$|R
30|$|The major {{resource}} {{of renewable energy}} comes from the sun. Solar energy utilization {{is very important in}} the background of global warming and reduction of carbon dioxide emission. Solar energy has been explored through solar thermal utilization, photovoltaic power generation, and so on [1 – 3]. Solar thermal utilization is the most popular application among them. In conventional solar thermal collectors, <b>plates</b> <b>or</b> tubes <b>coated</b> with a layer of selectively absorbing material are used to absorb solar energy, and then energy is carried away by working fluids in the form of heat [4, 5]. This type of collector exhibits several shortcomings, such as limitations on incident flux density and relatively high heat losses [6]. In order to overcome these drawbacks, direct solar absorption collector has been used for solar thermal utilization. In this kind of collector, solar energy is directly absorbed by the working fluids meanwhile the generated heat is carried out by the working fluids [4].|$|R

40|$|Presentation of antigen to T {{lymphocytes}} {{without the}} appropriate co-stimulatory signals {{results in a}} state of antigen-specific unresponsiveness. Despite the presumed importance of the B 7 -CD 28 interaction for the initiation and maintenance of T cell-mediated immune responses, relatively few studies have addressed the regulation of B 7 expression. We have studied the expression of the CD 80 (B 7 - 1) and B 7 - 2 molecules on peripheral blood monocytes following different activation signals, and it was demonstrated that not only IFN-gamma, but also granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor can induce CD 80 expression on monocytes. In addition, we found that cross-linking of FcR on monocytes strongly inhibits the up-regulation of CD 80 and B 7 - 2, with as a functional consequence that the capacity to function as antigen presenting cells (APC) and to stimulate T cell activation is severely impaired. When cultures were prepared in 96 -well plates coated with human IgG, stimulation of T cells with allogeneic monocytes resulted only in modest T cell proliferation and no detectable IL- 2 secretion as compared with untreated culture <b>plates</b> <b>or</b> <b>plates</b> <b>coated</b> with Fab fragments of human IgG. Under these conditions cross-linking of CD 28 on the T cells with specific mAb completely reverted the inhibitory effect observed after culture on IgG-coated plates. Furthermore, FcR cross-linking on monocytes strongly inhibited the capacity of monocytes to induce a specific memory T cell response to viral, bacterial and fungal antigens, whereas the treatment did not impair the capacity of the T cells to respond to pokeweed mitogen, phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A. We conclude that after FcR cross-linking, the impaired APC function is most likely due to the inability of monocytes to provide the essential co-stimulatory signals to the T cells via the B 7 -CD 28 /CTLA- 4 interaction.

40|$|Direct {{contact between}} hematopoietic cells and viral {{packaging}} cell lines or {{other sources of}} stroma {{has been shown to}} increase the efficiency of retroviral-mediated gene transfer into these target cells compared with infection with viral supernatant. We have investigated the role of defined bone marrow extracellular matrix molecules (ECM) in this phenomenon. Here we report that infection of cells adhering to the carboxy-terminal 30 / 35 -kD fragment of the fibronectin molecule (30 / 35 FN), which contains the alternatively spliced CS- 1 cell adhesion domain, significantly increases gene transfer into hematopoietic cells. Two retroviral vectors differing in recombinant viral titer were used. Gene transfer into committed progenitor cells and long-term culture-initiating cells, an in vitro assay for human stem cells, was significantly increased when the cells were infected while adherent to 30 / 35 FN-coated plates compared with cells infected on BSA-coated control <b>plates</b> <b>or</b> <b>plates</b> <b>coated</b> with other bone marrow ECM molecules. Although gene transfer into committed progenitor cells and to a lesser degree into long-term culture-initiating cells was increased on intact fibronectin as well, increased gene transfer efficiency into hematopoietic cells on 30 / 35 FN was dependent on CS- 1 sequence since infection on a similar FN fragment lacking CS- 1 (42 FN) was suboptimal. 30 / 35 FN has previously been shown by our laboratory and other investigators to mediate adhesion of primitive murine and human hematopoietic stem cells to the hematopoietic microenvironment. Additional studies showed that neither soluble 30 / 35 FN nor nonspecific binding of hematopoietic cells to poly-L-lysine-coated plates had any appreciable effect on the infection efficiency of these cells. Our findings indicate that hematopoietic stem cell adhesion to specific ECM molecules alters retroviral infection efficiency. These findings should aid in the design of gene transfer protocols using hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells for somatic gene therapy...|$|R
50|$|All metal strings are {{susceptible}} to oxidation and corrosion. Wound strings commonly use metals such as brass or bronze in their winding. These two metals are very vulnerable to corrosion. The sebaceous gland in the player's skin produces oils that can be acidic. The oils, salts, and moisture from the player's fingers are the largest source of corrosion. The composition of the oil and the oxygen in the air also helps to oxidize and corrode the strings. In steel strings the oxygen reacts with the iron in the steel and it creates the rust. As a result, the string loses its brilliance over time. Water, another by-product of oxidation, increases the potential acid corrosion in oils. Wound strings such as bronze acoustic strings, {{are very difficult to}} keep fresh sounding {{due to the lack of}} corrosion resistance. To help solve the corrosion problem strings are either metal <b>plated</b> <b>or</b> polymer <b>coated.</b> The polymer coating is claimed to reduce finger squeak and fret wear, and has better tuning capability. Some companies sell lubricating oils that slow down the oxidation process, increasing the string's life-span. These special lubricating oils are applied to the strings as a barrier to the air, to help slow the oxidation process.|$|R
5000|$|Ionic polymer-metal {{composites}} (IPMCs) are synthetic composite nanomaterials {{that display}} artificial muscle behavior under an applied voltage or electric field. IPMCs {{are composed of}} an ionic polymer like Nafion or Flemion whose surfaces are chemically <b>plated</b> <b>or</b> physically <b>coated</b> with conductors such as platinum or gold. Under an applied voltage (1-5 V for typical 10mmx40mmx0.2mm samples), ion migration and redistribution due to the imposed voltage across a strip of IPMCs result in a bending deformation. If the plated electrodes are arranged in a non-symmetric configuration, the imposed voltage can induce all kinds of deformations such as twisting, rolling, torsioning, turning,twirling, whirling and non-symmetric bending deformation. Alternatively, if such deformations are physically applied to an IPMC strips they generate an output voltage signal (few millivolts for typical small samples) as sensors and energy harvesters. IPMCs are a type of electroactive polymer. They work very well in a liquid environment {{as well as in}} air. They have a force density of about 40 in a cantilever configuration, meaning that they can generate a tip force of almost 40 times their own weight in a cantilever mode. IPMCs in actuation,sensing and energy harvesting have a very broad bandwidth to kilo HZ and higher. IPMCs were first introduced in 1998 by Shahinpoor, Bar-Cohen, Xue, Simpson and Smith (see references below) but the original idea of ionic polymer actuators and sensors goes back to 1992-93 by Adolf, Shahinpoor, Segalman, Witkowski, Osada, Okuzaki, Hori, Doi, Matsumoto, Hirose, Oguro, Takenaka, Asaka and Kawami as depicted below: ...|$|R
