25|$|A film shot using a {{mechanically}} controlled camera programmed, in its movement, {{to spell}} <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'CINEMATOGRAPHY'. The footage is {{of a film}} apparatus workshop used by JC Harry Harrison (a motion-control pioneer) in New Zealand involved {{in the making of}} The Lord of the Rings. The camera moves around the location filming hardware and shelving to the sound of motor noises.|$|E
25|$|The video depicts Yamaguchi in {{a darkened}} room, behind a row of naked women who are lying {{down on the ground}} in a line. He traces the {{contours}} that their bodies made, as he walks past the bodies. These scenes are interspersed with footage of Tokyo. In the final scene, a wider top-down angle shows that the naked women are spelling <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> eureka in capital letters.|$|E
25|$|After each clue was given, the {{contestant}} sought <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> {{and circled}} {{it with an}} electronic pencil on the screen once he/she found it. Passing was allowed if a contestant got stuck on a word, and if time permitted the champion could play those words again once all ten clues were given. Finding all ten words before time ran out won the contestant the jackpot. If not, $100 was given for each word that had been found before time expired.|$|E

5000|$|The {{treaty was}} quite {{controversial}} for many reasons. Originally, the treaty referred to Muhammad as the Messenger of God, {{but this was}} unacceptable to the Quraish ambassador Suhayl ibn Amr. Muhammad compromised, and told his cousin Ali to strike <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>wording.</b> But Ali said, [...] "I {{will not be the}} person to rub it out", after which Muhammad himself rubbed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> ( [...] , [...] ).|$|R

500|$|Shinkai {{originally}} envisioned Takao {{as a boy}} {{who wants}} to help people, but also felt {{that he should have}} a passion for making something, since creative work can be rewarding and fulfilling. On a list he made of potential crafts, he picked <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "shoes". After testing it out with his initial plans for the story, he found that it worked out, and in hindsight, he realized that shoemakers also assist people with walking.|$|E
500|$|Bolívar's fate {{is known}} from the beginning, and García Márquez {{constantly}} uses images which foreshadow this ending. For instance, a clock stuck at seven minutes past one, the exact time of the General's death, appears repeatedly in the novel. This sense of fate is introduced in the epigraph, which comes from a letter written by the historical Bolívar to General Santander on August 4, 1823: [...] "It seems that the devil controls the business of my life." [...] As Palencia-Roth points <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> used for devil here is [...] rather than the more familiar [...] [...] derives from the Greek word , which can equally mean divine power, fate, or destiny. Accordingly, the General succumbs to his fate and accepts his death as destiny.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{occupying the}} ridge, Rogers' men {{came under heavy fire}} from two {{directions}} from Oka's forces. Major Rogers {{was hit by}} a mortar shell that blew him in half, killing him instantly. Captain Charles Kelley—commander of one of the companies—took command and deployed the Marines in a perimeter defense around the ridge to fight back. The Marines on Hill 84 were without radio communication and thus could not call for help. The Marines improvised by using white undershirts to spell <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "H-E-L-P" [...] on the ridge. A Cactus Air Force (the name for the Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson Field) SBD Dauntless supporting the operation spotted the undershirt message and relayed the message to Edson by radio.|$|E

500|$|Three more Bonanno made {{men would}} choose to {{cooperate}} before Massino came to trial. The first was James Tartaglione; anticipating he would shortly be indicted as well {{he went to the}} FBI and agreed to wear a wire while he remained free. The second was Salvatore Vitale. In custody Massino again put <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> to a receptive Bonanno family, that he wanted Vitale killed. After learning of Massino's earlier plans to kill his brother-in-law from Coppa and Cantarella, prosecutors informed Vitale. Vitale was already dissatisfied by the lack of support he and his family received from Massino after his arrest. On the day he was arraigned with Massino, Vitale decided to flip {{as soon as it was}} safe to do so; he formally reached a deal with prosecutors in February. He was followed in short order by Lino, knowing Vitale could implicate him in murder as well. [...] Also flipping was longtime Bonanno associate Duane Leisenheimer, concerned for his safety after an investigator for Massino's defense team visited to find out if he intended to flip.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{commercial}} breaks, a brief {{image of a}} glyph is shown. Abrams revealed {{in an interview that}} the glyphs had a hidden meaning. [...] "It's something that we're doing for people who care to figure it out and follow it, but it's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show." [...] Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi (Φ) imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance {{within the context of the}} series, saying [...] "it's part of the code of the show." [...] The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode; for example, the pilot episode's eight glyphs spell <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "observer". Whether there is a further second-order code to be solved remains to be seen. Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (such as the moth/butterfly from [...] "Johari Window", the seahorse strain of DNA from [...] "The Bishop Revival"). In [...] "Jacksonville", behind Walter as he speaks to Olivia about her treatment where the nootropic Cortexiphan was first studied as a trial, each of the glyphs is clearly visible on the daycare wall. An episode-by-episode key to the various glyphs was made available on Fringepedia.|$|E
500|$|On Day 4, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Big Brother Rave" [...] Have-Not competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were {{required}} to construct a series of pipes to spell <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "Have" [...] while neon [...] "Rave Juice" [...] flowed through the piping. If done correctly, the pipes would cause the juice to spill onto a wheel and cause it to spin; the last team {{to complete the task}} would be the Have-Nots for the week. The Brains clique lost the competition, meaning Chima, Michele, and Ronnie were the Have-Nots for the week. This greatly upset Chima, who stated on numerous occasions afterwards that she was debating walking from the game. Jessie took an immediate dislike to Laura, and hoped to put her up, though his clique members attempted to convince him that Lydia should be evicted that week. Due to Ronnie refusing to be nominated as a pawn, Chima later agreed to be nominated as a pawn. On Day 5, Jessie chose to nominate Chima and Lydia for eviction, with Lydia being his target for eviction. Worried they might not have the votes to keep Chima, Jessie and Russell formed an alliance with Laura in attempt to get her to evict Lydia. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Russell, Natalie, and Jeff were selected to compete for the Power of Veto; Casey was selected to host. On Day 7, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Pop Goes the Veto!" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to pop [...] "pimples" [...] on an over-sized face, with various Scrabble tiles inside of them. The HouseGuests would collect tiles and attempt to spell a word with their collected tiles; the HouseGuest with the longest correctly spelled word would win the Power of Veto. Russell was the winner of the Power of Veto. Following the competition, Jeff engaged in numerous arguments with Russell and Natalie, causing a rift in their clique. In an attempt to save herself, Lydia attempted to convince Russell and Jessie to backdoor Braden that week by taking her off the block as a way to hurt Jeff. Russell later told Ronnie that this was the plan, with Ronnie telling Braden, Jeff, and Jordan about the plan. On Day 9, Russell chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Lydia from the block, with Braden being nominated in her place. Following Braden's nomination, Jordan and Laura began campaigning to get the votes for him to stay, and appeared to have themselves, Casey, Jeff, Michele, and Ronnie in agreement; Ronnie, however, was playing both sides and had no intention of keeping Braden in the game. On Day 12, Braden became the first HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Jessie cast the tie-breaker vote in Chima's favor.|$|E

2500|$|The Ducks' logo {{features}} a webbed foot forming a [...] "D". The text itself is gold (which sometimes may appear as bronze as well) with orange and black accents (forming a three-dimensional appearance). The entire logo is in turn outlined by silver.

2500|$|Originally, the Fourteenth Amendment did not forbid sex {{discrimination}} {{to the same}} extent as other forms of discrimination. On the one hand, Section Two of the amendment specifically discouraged states from interfering with the voting rights of [...] "males", which made the amendment anathema to many women when it was proposed in 1866. On the other hand, as feminists like Victoria Woodhull pointed <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "person" [...] in the Equal Protection Clause was apparently chosen deliberately, instead of a masculine term that could have easily been used instead.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1867, Pierrepont {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the New York Constitutional Convention serving on the Judiciary Committee. A total of 19 {{committees}} were created to study each constitutional revision with Pierrepont's larger Judiciary Committee having a total of 15 members. The Constitutional Convention {{turned out to be a}} long drawn-out process of deliberation that lasted into June 1867 whose purpose was to root out any constitutional defects from the previous 1846 New York Constitution. One contentious issue was whether to allow women suffrage and to strike <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "male" [...] that defined New York voters.|$|E
2500|$|Folk {{spelling}} of Anishinaabemowin is not {{a system}} per se, as it varies {{from person to person}} writing speech into script. [...] Each writer employing folk spelling would write <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> as how the speaker himself would form the words. [...] Depending on if the reference sound representation is based on English or French, a word may be represented using common reference language sound representation, thus better able to reflect the vowel or consonant value. [...] However, since this requires the knowledge of how the speaker himself speaks, folk spelling quickly becomes difficult to read for those individuals not familiar with the writer.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 and 18 March 2007, Swiss Scouts {{planned to}} build an igloo village with each {{construction}} representing one of the member countries and territories of WOSM. [...] The event was held on the glacier of the Plaine Morte near the resort of Crans-Montana, in Switzerland. A total of 130 igloos were built, short of the planned number, but this still beat the previous world record of 100 igloos. [...] Additionally, every team composed a message of peace for the Scout organisation represented by their igloo. [...] These letters will be sent including {{a photo of the}} igloo village taken at night-fall, when the igloos were illuminated by torches laid out in the snow spelling <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> peace. The public was encouraged to attend the event, in order to show how igloos are made and to involve them in the construction.|$|E
2500|$|The name The Salvation Army {{developed}} from {{an incident in}} May 1878. William Booth was dictating {{a letter to his}} secretary George Scott Railton and said, [...] "We are a volunteer army." [...] Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, [...] "Volunteer, I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!" [...] Railton was instructed to cross <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "volunteer" [...] and substitute the word [...] "salvation". The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own music, often with Christian words to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in [...] "God's Army" [...] would wear the Army's own uniform, 'putting on the armour,' for meetings and ministry work. He became the [...] "General" [...] and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as [...] "officers". Other members became [...] "soldiers".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there may}} be another meaning to Ozu's title derived from ancient Japanese culture. When Noriko and Shukichi attend the Noh play, the work {{performed}} is called Kakitsubata or [...] "The Water Iris." [...] (The water iris in Japan is a plant which blooms, usually in marshland or other moist soil, in mid-to-late-spring.) In this play, a traveling monk arrives {{at a place called}} Yatsuhashi, famous for its water irises, when a woman appears. She alludes to a famous poem by the waka poet of the Heian period, Ariwara no Narihira, in which each of the five lines begins with one syllable that, spoken together, spell <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> for [...] "water iris" [...] ("ka-ki-tsu-ba-ta"). The monk stays the night at the humble hut of the woman, who then appears in an elaborate kimono and headdress and reveals herself to be the spirit of the water iris. She praises Narihira, dances and at dawn receives enlightenment from the Buddha and disappears.|$|E
