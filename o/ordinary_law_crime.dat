50|$|Historical studies {{reveal that}} {{policing}} agents have undertaken {{a variety of}} cross-border police missions for many years (Deflem, 2002). For example, in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance {{because of concerns about}} anarchist agitators and other political radicals. A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London. The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and <b>ordinary</b> <b>law</b> <b>crime</b> were primarily initiated in Europe, which eventually led to the establishment of Interpol before the Second World War. There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century (Nadelmann, 1993). It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception. It is also generally agreed that in the post-Cold War era this type of practice became more significant and frequent (Sheptycki, 2000).|$|E

50|$|An <b>ordinary</b> <b>law</b> is {{a normal}} law, {{generally}} distinguished from a constitutional law, organic law, or other similar <b>law.</b> Typically, <b>ordinary</b> <b>laws</b> are subordinate to constitutional and organic laws, and are more easily changed than constitutional or organic laws, though {{that should not be}} assumed to be the case in all jurisdictions. (For example, the Constitutional Court of Spain has ruled that Spain's Organic Laws are not hierarchically superior to <b>ordinary</b> <b>laws,</b> but simply apply to different matters.) <b>Ordinary</b> <b>laws</b> often govern areas beyond the scope of constitutional or organic laws.|$|R

It was settled in the case of United States v. Hudson , which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common <b>law</b> <b>crimes,</b> and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.|$|R

This form of application, which aims at creating harmony between the Bill of Rights and <b>ordinary</b> <b>law,</b> is called the indirect application of the Bill of Rights. When indirectly applied, the Bill of Rights does not override ordinary law; nor does it generate its own remedies.

The special constitutional rules relating to the procedural issues of standing and the jurisdiction of the courts are also irrelevant to this form of application.

Many recent statutes, such as the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 and the Equality and Administrative Justice Acts are intended to implement the Bill of Rights.
