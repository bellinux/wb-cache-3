The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated a surge of membership in the <b>organization.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> same year, because of the society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote.|$|E

5|$|ATV Music Publishing {{remained}} a successful <b>organization</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music industry throughout the 1970s.

Despite the success of the music publishing organization, other ventures formed by Grade were not performing as well. Pye Records, which continued to distribute music from artists such as Carl Douglas and Barry White, was failing to bring in large amounts of money. The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into Central Independent Television.|$|E
