5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is choral music about {{everyday}} life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An {{example of this}} is his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind the mountain) in which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo and the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of the choir gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between different groups of the choir, recreating the clamorous atmosphere of the New Year's Eve.|$|E

25|$|Every hymn {{begins with}} a verset with a {{continuous}} cantus firmus: the hymn melody is stated in long note values in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices,</b> usually the bass, while the other voices provide contrapuntal accompaniment. Other versets are only occasionally cast in this form. More frequently the 16th century motet practice is used: the hymn melody either migrates from one voice to another, with or without imitative inserts between verses, or is treated imitatively throughout the piece. In three versets (Veni Creator 3, Ave maris stella 3, and Conditor 2) the melody in one voice is accompanied by two voices that form a canon, in two (Ave maris stella 4 and Annue Christe 3) one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> provides a pedal point. In most versets, counterpoints to the hymn melody engage in imitation or fore-imitation, {{and more often than}} not they are derived from the hymn melody. All of the pieces are in four voices, except the canonic versets, which use only three.|$|E

25|$|The {{exposition}} usually concludes {{when all}} voices {{have given a}} statement of the subject or answer. In some fugues, the exposition will end with a redundant entry, or an extra presentation of the theme. Furthermore, in some fugues the entry of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> may be reserved until later, for example in the pedals of an organ fugue (see J. S. Bach's Fugue in C major for Organ, BWV 547).|$|E
25|$|A fugue {{begins with}} the {{exposition}} of its subject in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> alone in the tonic key. After the statement of the subject, a second voice enters and states the subject with the subject transposed to another key (usually the dominant or subdominant), which {{is known as the}} answer. To make the music run smoothly, it may also have to be altered slightly. When the answer is an exact copy of the subject to the new key, with identical intervals to the first statement, it is classified as a real answer; if the intervals are altered to maintain the key it is a tonal answer.|$|E
25|$|Two {{things should}} be noted about the second {{complete}} draft of Das Rheingold. Firstly, the full score of the Prelude (in ink) and the instrumentation draft of {{the remainder of the}} opera (in pencil) together constitute a single manuscript (WWV 86A Musik III). In WWV this is called a Partiturerstschrift, a term usually reserved for Wagner's full scores: strictly speaking only the section in ink is a Partiturerstschrift. Secondly, the manuscript is fragmentary: thirty-three measures are missing, which include the closing measures of the Prelude and the opening measures of Scene 1. As ink is used before this lacuna and pencil after it, it is generally assumed that Wagner switched from one medium to the other at the entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> (i.e. the first measure of Scene 1); but until and unless the missing sheets are recovered, this must remain an assumption.|$|E

25|$|Although most of {{them are}} brief, the {{subjects}} are extremely varied (see Example 1). Frequently some form of note repetition is used to emphasize a rhythmic (rather than melodic) contour. Many feature a dramatic leap (up to an octave), {{which may or may not}} be mirrored in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> sometime during an episode– a characteristic Pachelbel technique, although it was also employed by earlier composers, albeit less pronounced. Minor alterations to the subject between the entries are observed in some of the fugues, and simple countersubjects occur several times. An interesting technique employed in many of the pieces is an occasional resort to style brisé for a few bars, both during episodes and in codas. The double fugues exhibit a typical three-section structure: fugue on subject 1, fugue on subject 2, and the counterpoint with simultaneous use of both subjects.|$|E
25|$|One Christmas was so {{much like}} another, in those years, around the sea-town corner now, and out of all sound except the distant {{speaking}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the afternoon, on the best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and we threw a snowball at her niece, and my hands burned so, with {{the heat and the}} cold, when I held them in front of the fire, that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.|$|E
25|$|President Childers died {{suddenly}} in November 1974. The replacement agreed with other parties was Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, a former Chief Justice and former Attorney General. Ó Dálaigh was identified with Fianna Fáil. Ó Dálaigh {{was also a}} noted critic of the curtailment of free speech and was {{highly critical of the}} introduction of Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, which forbade the broadcast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of Sinn Féin members. This put him at odds with Cosgrave, whose government had strengthened the Act. Cosgrave also briefed President Ó Dálaigh only once every six months, which was, in the President's opinion, too infrequently as well as too inadequately, in violation of article 28 (6) (3) of the Constitution. In addition, Cosgrave frequently interfered in Ó Dálaigh's constitutional role as the state's representative to foreign governments; he was not permitted to receive the Legion of Honour from France, although former president Seán T. O'Kelly had previously received it, and Cosgrave attended the United States' bicentennial celebrations in 1976 in Ó Dálaigh's place.|$|E

25|$|Replicating the newscasts from WWOR, {{the video}} in the queue {{monitors}} was real; production for the audio in the ride work and pre-show videos was handled by John Miceli, Tony Miceli, David Kneupper; Stan Winston; {{at the time}} with Magic Lantern Productions and later Soundelux, who contracted all audio and video design for the ride. Since WWOR had passed from the prior corporate owners (RKO General) to MCA, there were still conflicts in the prior audio from broadcast use, as it was not cleared for location-based entertainment use, and the script was stylized for the ride experience. The announcer for the script as the WWOR reporter was provided by voiceover talent Ron Knight, who also provided voice work for many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of the chopper pilots, radio dispatch, sheriffs and other characters, as well as voice-over work {{for two of the}} other premiere attractions, E.T.'s Adventure, and Jaws. Knight also became the national announcer for Nickelodeon for all show promotion and network branding announcements originating from the Nickelodeon Studios facilities inside the park.|$|E
25|$|With his contemporaries, Willaert {{developed}} the canzone (a form of polyphonic secular song) and ricercare, which were forerunners of modern instrumental forms. Willaert also arranged 22 four-part madrigals for voice and lute written by Verdelot. In an early 4-part vocal work, Quid non ebrietas? (In some sources called the Chromatic Duo) Willaert uses musica ficta {{around the circle}} of 5ths in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> resulting in an augmented 7th in unison with the ending octave, an outstanding experiment with chromatic enharmonicism. Willaert {{was among the first}} to extensively use chromaticism in the madrigal. Looking forward, we are given an image of early word painting in his madrigal Mentre che'l cor. Willaert, who was fond of the older compositional techniques such as the canon, often placed the melody in the tenor of his compositions, treating it as a cantus firmus. Willaert, with the help of De Rore, standardized a five-voice setting in madrigal composition. Willaert also pioneered a style that continued until the end of the madrigal period of reflecting the emotional qualities of the text and the meanings of important words as sharply and clearly as possible.|$|E
25|$|The preludes {{are quite}} varied {{in style and}} structure, and are {{therefore}} hard to categorize, as no two praeludia are alike. The texture of Buxtehude’s praeludia {{can be described as}} either free or fugal. They consist of strict diatonic harmony and secondary dominants. Structure-wise, there usually is an introductory section, a fugue and a postlude, but this basic scheme is very frequently expanded: both BuxWV 137 and BuxWV 148 include a full-fledged chaconne along with fugal and toccata-like writing in other sections, BuxWV 141 includes two fugues, sections of imitative counterpoint and parts with chordal writing. Buxtehude’s praeludia are not circular, nor is there a recapitulation. A fugal theme, when it recurs, does so in a new, changed way. A few pieces are smaller in scope; for example, BuxWV 144, which consists only of a brief improvisatory prelude followed by a longer fugue. The sections may be explicitly separated in the score or flow one into another, with one ending and the other beginning in the same bar. The texture is almost always at least three-voice, with many instances of four-voice polyphony and occasional sections in five voices (BuxWV 150 being one of the notable examples, with five-voice structure in which two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> are taken by the pedal).|$|E

25|$|The {{third of}} the studio's {{partially}} completed features, The Pebble and the Penguin, was also dogged by production difficulties. MGM/UA stepped in to become distributors for the film in the US, and at a relatively late stage in production insisted on making extensive changes, cutting some sequences, removing some characters and re-recording many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices.</b> The changes meant that the animation, the effects animation in particular, fell behind, {{and some of the}} ink-and-paint work had to be farmed out to a Hungarian animation studio (in this case, Reflex Animation Ltd.) to meet the release deadline. Directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman were so dissatisfied at the enforced changes that they insisted on their names being removed from the credits (though the company name “Don Bluth Entertainment Ireland, Ltd.” remained). The Pebble and the Penguin was released in April 1995, and again made a loss at the box office, grossing US$3.9M in the US and went bankrupt. The film performed better on home video when released that August, becoming a fast seller alongside other animated films released in the same month. Bluth did not remain disassociated with The Pebble and the Penguin, supervising a high-definition remastering in 2007 that corrected some of the animation and shooting errors caused by the rushed production.|$|E
