25|$|The {{empirical}} {{data to support}} the media equation is thorough and expansive. Studies have tested {{a wide variety of}} communication characteristics with the media – manners, personality, emotion, social roles and form. Below are explanations of some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> findings that support the media equation.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} birds in India {{during the colonial}} period began with hunting and it was only later that more careful {{observations}} were made. Many civil servants and army officers took an interest in hunting for sport and often made notes on the birds that they shot while some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> species were skinned and sent back to museums in England for identification.|$|E
50|$|These routes require basic alpine {{equipment}} for crossing the glaciers and knowledge <b>of</b> climbing. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> climbing routes are {{concentrated on the}} south face, the most famous among them being the Steinerweg (graded V) and the Pichlweg (graded IV).|$|R

50|$|Lowertown's diverse {{population}} makes it one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> neighbourhoods. Its main stretch along Rideau Street is very bustling and includes many African, Asian, South Asian, Caribbean, and Lebanese businesses, a large grocery store, <b>the</b> Rideau Branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottawa Public Library, and an Orthodox Jewish synagogue.|$|R
25|$|These anecdotes provide {{glimpses of}} {{other aspects of}} these {{prominent}} people, sharing, actually, greater realization of their humanity and the human concerns of their officials and ordinary subjects. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> passages is {{the account of the}} symposium held at the home of Harun al-Rashid's famous vizier Yahya the Barmakid on the topic of love. A dozen leading thinkers provide their definition of love and then a thirteenth, a Magian judge, speaks at greater length on that theme.|$|E
25|$|This final {{critique}} of writing {{with which the}} dialogue concludes {{seems to be one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> facets of the conversation for those who seek to interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, comes down to us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper to recall that Plato's ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato's description of the dialectician perfectly, and never wrote a thing.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> discoveries {{were the}} avian remains found in Unit II. The {{skeletal}} remains of an immature sea bird was found, careful positioned with small fish and crab remains, {{in association with}} a right handprint pressed into {{a large piece of}} mortar. Another bird skeleton was found along with carefully arranged sticks parallel to one another. Two more sets of avian related materials were found: a large amount of bird guano and a scattering of bird down.|$|E
6000|$|Here one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guests {{observed}} {{that he had}} never met a woman yet who was not capable of turning out quite exceptional under circumstances that would engage her feelings strongly. [...] "That sort of superiority in recklessness they have over us," [...] he concluded, [...] "makes <b>of</b> them <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> half <b>of</b> mankind." ...|$|R
25|$|The city's main {{police station}} in Little Park Street also hosts {{a museum of}} Coventry's police force. The museum, based underground, is split into two sections—one {{representing}} <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's police force, and the other compiling some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> unusual, <b>interesting</b> and grisly cases from the force's history. The museum is funded from charity donations—viewings {{can be made by}} appointment.|$|R
5000|$|Bernard Lewis {{claims that}} the charter was not a treaty in the modern sense but a {{unilateral}} proclamation by Muhammad. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitution's <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> aspects was <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish tribes in the ummah because although the Jewish tribes were [...] "one community with the believers", they also [...] "have their religion and the Muslims have theirs".|$|R
25|$|Following {{submission}} of their application, TVS were anticipating {{that they would}} be forced into a shotgun marriage with Southern, but in the event TVS won outright against the seven other contenders since their plans for a better mix of programmes and greater investment were considered good enough to operate the franchise alone. This was the official line given by the IBA, but it was also considered that Southern's non-local ownership (the majority shareholders were companies based in London and Dundee) and their very conservative nature led to it being dropped in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> proposals made by TVS in their franchise application.|$|E
25|$|When copies are not {{sufficient}} for accurate transcription, PJM staff may travel to the repositories to view the originals of Madison's papers. Many originals are held by the Library of Congress and the National Archives of the United States. The Library of Congress makes digital images of their collection available free for online public viewing via American Memory. This resource allows interested scholars {{to become familiar with}} the evolution of Madison's style over his lifetime, and also gives them the opportunity to see the varieties of penmanship and languages Madison had to decipher. Interpreting some of these more complex documents, particularly those from non-native English speakers and from correspondents with limited formal education, is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> challenges the PJM staff deals with on a regular basis.|$|E
25|$|In the end, {{options for}} the {{financing}} of the purchase came down to two companies, Westpac and Allco Leasing. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> notes to the Allco proposal {{was the nature of}} the financing arrangements it was proposing. At the time of the proposed financing deal, interest rates in Australia were around 16-17%, placing a significant burden on companies in their business dealings. To work around this, Allco proposed a financing structure that involved a cross-border financing arrangement in Japan. It also required the establishment of a special purposes lessor company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to minimise withholding tax liabilities from the Japanese and Australian taxation agencies. Allco refused to release specific information on the proposed structure, due to its policy prohibiting the release of specific details of this financing arrangement until it had secured a mandate for their services.|$|E
5000|$|Alpine is a {{historic}} plantation house in Alpine, Alabama, United States. [...] Completed in 1858, the two-story Greek Revival-style house was built for Nathaniel Welch by a master builder, Almarion Devalco Bell. The wood-frame house has several unusual features that make it one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> architecturally <b>interesting</b> antebellum houses in the state. These features include the foundation materials, interior floor-plan, and the window fenestration.|$|R
5000|$|Like the System/34 and {{the older}} System/32, the System/36 was {{primarily}} programmed in the RPG II language. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine's <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> optional features was an off-line storage mechanism (on the 5360 model) that utilized [...] "magazines" [...] - boxes of 8-inch floppies that the machine could load and eject in a nonsequential fashion. The System/36 also had many mainframe features such as programmable job queues and scheduling priority levels.|$|R

500|$|Greg Burgas, of Comic Book Resources, critiqued Anarky as [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> {{characters}} of the past fifteen or twenty years [...] {{because of what he}} wants to accomplish..." [...] Burgas continued, comparing the nature of Anarky as a change agent against Batman: [...] "He is able to show how ineffective Batman is against the real problems of society, and although Batman stops his spree, we find ourselves sympathizing much more with Anarky than with the representative of the status quo." ...|$|E
500|$|In Andrew Niccol's {{science fiction}} film Gattaca (1997), [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> scripts" [...] Hawke {{said he had}} read in [...] "a number of years", he {{played the role of}} a man who infiltrates a society of genetically perfect humans by {{assuming}} another man's identity. Although Gattaca was not a success at the box office it drew generally favorable reviews from critics; The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reviewer wrote that [...] "Hawke, building on the sympathetic-but-edgy presence that has served him well since his kid-actor days, is most impressive".|$|E
500|$|In a {{generally}} positive review, Winnie McCroy from The Villager enjoyed {{the song and}} the Harajuku Girls' contribution, and thanked them for [...] "add some international flavor to an already stellar track". A critic from Sputnikmusic awarded [...] "Harajuku Girls" [...] {{four out of five}} stars, declaring it [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> songs of the year", in addition to complimenting its [...] "interesting, dancable beat" [...] and [...] "rather brilliant" [...] production. As part of Renowned for Sound's [...] "Record Rewind" [...] column, Marcus Floyd also appreciated the track for [...] "how fantastically poppy it is".|$|E
50|$|It used {{to offer}} {{comprehensive}} athletic facilities, sports lessons, spa services, fine dining, and overnight accommodations. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building's <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> features include a pool {{on the third}} floor, full basketball and squash courts, a 16 lane bowling alley, and a room dedicated to former University of Pittsburgh football coach Johnny Majors. The club has several annual events, the most popular including an Easter brunch, a lobster dinner, and collegiate boxing events.|$|R
50|$|The poem {{actually}} {{featured the}} Safety bicycle. However, the poem has been inaccurately illustrated by various illustrators with a depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visually <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> Penny-farthing {{which had been}} superseded {{at the time the}} poem was written. <b>The</b> introduction <b>of</b> safety cycles gave rise to a bicycling boom with millions being manufactured in the decade 1890-1900. They were very popular in the Australian outback, widely used by shearers and itinerant workers at the time that Paterson wrote this poem.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{characters}} in the novel were {{very similar to the}} real-life people that Dostoyevsky met while in prison. While many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters do mirror real-life people, he has also made some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters appear <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> than their real-life counterparts.|$|R
500|$|The {{exact nature}} of the {{substance}} that is deposited on Michael's carpet is never explicitly made clear. Fischer only described it as [...] "soft [...] smelly [...] brown". In fact, the circumstance in which the substance is viewed by the camera is still ambiguous; Television Without Pity reviewer M. Giant noted that the viewer only gets [...] "the merest out-of-focus Blair Witch glimpse" [...] of the substance. Fischer also noted that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> aspects of the episode was the [...] "you [...] finally see Pam and Roy getting along." [...] She explained that this was because Roy and Pam returned from [...] "a romantic vacation in the Poconos." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mirror sympathised with Danielle {{over the}} storyline which saw her {{manipulated}} by Archie, deeming it one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> EastEnders plot strands. Gareth McLean of The Guardian described Danielle as a [...] "wet weekend incarnate", criticising the drawn out {{nature of the}} secret Mitchell storyline. Fellow Guardian critic Grace Dent was similarly critical of the storyline, particularly the scripting. The Daily Mirror Tony Stewart wrote that [...] "when a downcast Danielle walks into a room, it's like all the lights have been switched off", and his colleague Jane Simon christened the character [...] "Drippy Danielle", writing that [...] "If she's half Mitchell, her father {{must have been a}} marshmallow." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaif then {{featured}} in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011) with Imran Khan and Ali Zafar, She was cast as Dimple Dixit, a [...] "talkative", [...] "unpredictable" [...] girl, a role she described as challenging as the character's personality contrasted with her own. While the film earned mixed reviews, Kaif was generally praised for her portrayal. The book Mother Maiden Mistress called Dimple one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> female {{characters of the}} year and Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times said the film was watchable because of [...] "Katrina's live-wire energy wherein she never goes overboard and keeps bustling with vivacity through the runtime". For this performance, Kaif received her second Filmfare nomination in the Best Actress category.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on archival {{sources and}} {{incorporating}} new archaeological evidence, in Lawrence <b>of</b> Arabia’s War: <b>The</b> Arabs, The British and <b>The</b> Remaking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle East in WWI, Neil Faulkner presents a multi-dimensional account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{conflict in the}} Middle East during the First World War with <b>the</b> centralised figure <b>of</b> T. E. Lawrence providing the skeletal narrative. While Mahon Murphy finds this a vividly written attempt to understand <b>the</b> totality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict, he questions whether the focus on Lawrence obscures some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study’s <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> strands <b>of</b> analysis...|$|R
2500|$|Lexa {{has been}} well {{received}} by critics and fans, [...] who consider her to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> and complex characters. She {{has been a source}} of frequent debate; one topic is how she was written off the series. Her relationship with Clarke, which was viewed as compelling, significantly impacted the LGBT community, and many viewers embraced it as a positive or tempestuous depiction of friendship, love, and betrayal. The relationship was, however, criticized for being unnecessarily tragic, leading the [...] "bury your gays" [...] trope to rise to a national debate.|$|R
40|$|International audienceConcurrent Kleene algebras support equational {{reasoning}} about computing {{systems with}} concurrent behaviours. Their natural semantics {{is given by}} series(parallel) rational pomset languages, a standard true concurrency semantics, which {{is often associated with}} processes of Petri nets. We use constructions on Petri nets to provide two decision procedures for such pomset languages motivated by the equational and <b>the</b> refinement theory <b>of</b> concurrent Kleene algebra. The contribution to the first problem lies in a much simpler algorithm and an ExpSpace complexity bound.

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jakob Dorof of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "Hands All Over" [...] is [...] "the one real gamble"; {{despite the fact}} that it tries to hard to find a missing connection between the works of Prince, Queen and Nine Inch Nails, [...] "it's certainly one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> things the band has ever recorded." [...] Similarly, McAlpine of BBC Music wrote that on songs like [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Stutter", the Maroon 5 shows a band [...] "who are really at their best when they play pop music like the sleazy rockers they clearly are." [...] Contactmusic's Banimaer stated that although the track is a little repetitive, it shows what kind of band Maroon 5 wants to be.|$|E
500|$|Peter Duval Smith, in the Financial Times, was in two {{minds about}} the book, believing {{on the one}} hand that [...] "the {{background}} is excellent... Mr. Fleming has caught the exact 'feel' of Japan", and on the other that You Only Live Twice [...] "is not really a success and it's Bond's fault mainly. He just doesn't add up to a human being". Maggie Ross, in The Listener was also a little dissatisfied, writing that the novel can be read as a thriller and, [...] "if interest flags, as it may do, the book can be treated as a tourist guide to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> parts of Japan." [...] She {{went on to say that}} [...] "since not very much in the way of real excitement happens until the latter half of the book, perhaps it is better to ignore the whole thing".|$|E
500|$|Capuano {{considered}} {{running for}} Governor of Massachusetts in 2014. On January 21, 2013, former Mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts {{and member of}} the Massachusetts Governor's Council Michael Albano endorsed Capuano to run, posting on his Facebook page: [...] "while the Congressman has not made a decision to compete for the [...] nomination [...] at this time, it is not too early to make the case and encourage his candidacy." [...] When asked in February 2013 whether he might run for governor, Capuano responded: [...] "Part of me thinks that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting,</b> more important fights {{over the next several years}} might be conducted at statehouses around the country and not necessarily on Capitol Hill." [...] In a statement in September 2013, Capuano announced he would not run for governor, and would instead focus on running for re-election to Congress. His decision was attributed to his loss against Martha Coakley in the Democratic primary for Senate, virtually closing any possibility for running for higher office.|$|E

60|$|To {{explain the}} undue {{prominence}} given to Miss Lavinia, {{it should be}} stated that she is an old and intimate friend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compiler <b>of</b> this frivolous work; and therefore her views on all subjects, though less valuable, were easier to obtain than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> younger and <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> shawl-strappists.|$|R
5000|$|Noel Kirkpatrick from TV.com gave a good {{review to}} the episode saying that after two episodes, <b>the</b> second season <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show seems <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> than <b>the</b> first one.
