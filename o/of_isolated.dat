40|$|Background. We {{report the}} results of a 3 -year Salmonella {{surveillance}} study of persons with diarrhea; asymp-tomatic children; and retail pork, poultry, and beef in Yucatan, Mexico. Methods. Isolates were characterized according to serotype, antimicrobial susceptibility, and genetic relatedness with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Results. Salmonella Typhimurium was the most common serotype found in ill humans (21. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>isolates),</b> followed by Salmonella Agona (21 % <b>of</b> <b>isolates).</b> Salmonella Enteritidis was a minor serotype (4. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>isolates).</b> Asymptomatic children carried S. Agona (12. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>isolates),</b> Salmonella Meleagridis (11. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>isolates),</b> Salmonella Anatum (8 % <b>of</b> <b>isolates)</b> and S. Enteritidis (5. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>isolates).</b> A high percentage of retail meat samples contained Salmonella; it was most commonly found in pork (58. 1 % of samples), followed by beef (54 % of samples) and poultry (39. 7 % of samples). Resistance to oral drugs used for the treatment of salmonellosis was observed for ampicillin (14. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> were resistant), chloramphenicol (14. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>isolates),</b> and trimethoprim-sulfameth-oxazole (19. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>isolates).</b> Resistance to ceftriaxone emerged in 2002 and was limited to the serotype S.
