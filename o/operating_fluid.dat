50|$|In practice, modern turbine designs {{use both}} {{reaction}} and impulse concepts {{to varying degrees}} whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs {{similar to those used}} in gas turbines. At low pressure the <b>operating</b> <b>fluid</b> medium expands in volume for small reductions in pressure. Under these conditions, blading becomes strictly a reaction type design with the base of the blade solely impulse. The reason is due to the effect of the rotation speed for each blade. As the volume increases, the blade height increases, and the base of the blade spins at a slower speed relative to the tip. This change in speed forces a designer to change from impulse at the base, to a high reaction style tip.|$|E
50|$|One of KBKhA {{priority}} directions was {{the completion}} of defense contracts - creation of LREs with high energy characteristics and reliability, with low production costs, without servicing during entire life. In 1957, using extensive experience acquired during the development of engines RD0100, RD0101, RD0102 for interceptors, the Design Bureau started the creation of engines for antiaircraft missiles (SAM) on self-ignited components. The first LRE RD0200 (chief designer A. Golubev) was developed for {{the second stage of}} S. Lavochkin 5В11 SAM. The engine was designed as open cycle engine with 1 : 10 throttle capability. The engine passed all types of tests and was serially manufacturedLRE RD0201 (chief designer L. Pozdnyakov) was designed for the third stage of P. Grushin B1100 SAM. The difference of the engine from RD0200 was four swivel combustion chambers due to which flight navigation was performed. In the end of the 50th, the question about the creation of a more powerful rocket R-9 arose, which was to replace rocket 8K72. In 1959-1962 the Design Bureau developed oxygen-kerosene engine RD0106 for LV second stage (block B) (chief designer - Y. Gershkovitz).High energy characteristics, optimum mounting, relatively small height, simple operation, development time (on ground and flight) were the basis {{for the development of a}} variety of engines for Korolev’s space rockets, including RD0110 for the third stage (block И) of Soyuz LV. In the beginning of the 60th, long-term and prolific cooperation of KBKhA and Chelomey Design Bureau started, for whose LVs our design bureau developed about 20 LREs.The creation of powerful LVs during these years required considerable increase of energy characteristics and operational features of LREs. And KBKhA was among the first to start the development of such LREs. In 1961-1964 RD0203 and RD0204 LREs (chief designer V. Kozelkov) for the first stage of rocket UR200 and RD0206 and RD0207 LREs (chief designer L. Pozdnyakov) for the second stage of the same rocket were developed.These new engines were of advanced design, operate on storable fuel components and for the first time staged combustion cycle was used. The application of such schematic allowed double combustion chamber pressure (up to 150 kg/cm2 as compared to 70 kg/cm2 for open cycle engines) and excluded Isp losses for TPA turbine drive.Powerful and highly economical engines created in short time, went through ground development and flight tests. The engines were a basis for the creation of new LREs. In 1963, Chelomei Design Bureau started the creation of the new rocket RS-10 for first stage KBKhA developed engines RD0216 and RD0217 were used in 1963-1966 (chief designer V. Koshelnikov). Higher technical and operational requirements to LV defined the necessity of high engine efficiency and reliability, protection of its inner cavities from the environment, etc. All these requirements were fulfilled and confirmed by ground and flight development testing as rocket component.The experience acquired was the basis for development of new generation engines with higher combustion chamber pressures. First engines of this type were RD0233 and RD0234 (chief designer V. Kozelkov, lead designer V. Ezhov), created in 1969-1974 for RS-18 rocket first stage.Further on, two engines were developed: staged combustion RD0235, and open cycle steering engine RD0236 (chief designer V. Kozelkov, lead designer Y. Garmanov) for RS-18 rocket second stage. Engine RD0235 was developed on the basis of RD0216 engine but it is more reliable due to better design and technology possibilitiesThe experience of LRE development was the basis for the engagement of KBKhA in 1967 in the development of engine RD0208 (lead designer Y. Gershkovich) for the second stage of rocket RS-20, designed by general designer M. Yangel. The engine was developed on the basis of a third stage engine RD0212, used in “Proton”, but it was more powerful and was differently applied within the stage.The First Nuclear Rocket EngineIn 1965 KBKhA was involved into project of the development of nuclear rocket engines RD0410 and RD0411 (chief designer G. Chursin, lead designers - L. Nikitin, M. Biryukov, A. Belogurov, Y. Mamontov). The engines were specified for the acceleration and deceleration of spacecrafts and orbit correction for deep space explorations. Due to <b>operating</b> <b>fluid</b> high thermodynamic properties and high heating temperatures in the nuclear reactor, (up to 3 000 K), the engine possesses high efficiency (vacuum Isp 910 kg s/kg). For time and costs saving, the nuclear reactor and “cold” engine (feed system, regulation and control components) were developed in parallel. The nuclear reactor is designed according to heterogeneous schematic - its design utilizes block-mounting principle, which allowed to develop uranium-containing (fuel cell) assemblies and reactor separately. The results of the development of RD-0410 nuclear rocket engine were used for development of main turbopump of RD-0120 engine and were the basis for development of multimode space nuclear power plants.|$|E

For example, the use of water as an <b>operating</b> <b>fluid</b> may create problems with the pavement structure if leakage occurs. Moreover, the design of such systems is not trivial, as the systems need auxiliary machinery to work (e. g., pumps or additional heaters to control the temperature of the working fluid). These problems can be solved if air is used as the <b>operating</b> <b>fluid.</b> This paper presents the prototype of an energy-harvesting pavement that uses air as the <b>operating</b> <b>fluid</b> and has been built, tested, and analyzed. The prototype consists of a set of pipes buried in an aggregate layer that is covered by a layer of a dense asphalt mixture. The pipes are connected to an updraft chimney. The pavement surface is irradiated with infrared light; thus, heat travels through the layers until it reaches the air in the pipes. Through natural convection, air flows through the chimney. The prototype provides satisfactory thermal properties that show a noticeable withdrawal of energy. The performance of the prototype is heavily influenced by the height of the chimney. Moreover, an air mass flow ranging from 0 (obstructed pipes) to 0. 5 m/s (chimney 1 m high) is measured. Analysis of the results shows that the prototype proved useful in reducing the urban heat island effect by lowering the pavement surface temperature by more than 6 °C...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} make thermal solar power compete with the {{traditional}} sources of energy, the efficiency must increase and one {{way of doing it}} is by changing the <b>operating</b> <b>fluid.</b> Among the alternate fluids is the use of molten salts {{as a part of the}} process; either for thermal storage and later utilization for electrical production during the hours without sun or as a substitute of the <b>operating</b> <b>fluid</b> to provide higher temperatures resulting in better efficiency. The difficulty of using molten salts is the lack of physical properties in literature; such as viscosity, boiling point, vapor pressure and volumetric absorption of solar radiation, thus making the selection of a suitable salt a very difficult endeavor. As a part of the Multidisciplinary Research Initiative (MURI) of the Department of Energy in the project of High Operating Fluids, this work will focus on the optical properties of the molten salts (volumetric absorption). The objective of this Thesis is to design, build and test a device capable of measuring the light attenuation coefficient; which is directly related to volumetric absorption of solar radiation, as well as determine the attenuation coefficient of various eutectic systems for the ternary salt mixture of ZnCl 2, NaCl and KCl. Based on the little existent literature, a device capable of measuring the attenuation coefficient was designed, built, validated and tested. This was done by projecting a stable beam of light simulating sun radiation through the molten salt sample and to a spectrometer with a wavelength range going from 400 nm to 1000 nm with operating temperatures going from 350 oC to 600 oC. This device is capable of controlling the thickness, from 1 to 60 mm, of the molten salt sample by a computer controlled linear stage with an accuracy of 0. 1 mm. Quartz was used as a container for the molten salts because of its high melting point and transparency. A ceramic heater was used as a heat source, which can heat up the sample to temperatures up to 1200 oC if necessary. Two validation tests for the device were done by measuring the light attenuation coefficient of clear water and extra virgin olive oil and then they were compared to the ones in literature. The eutectic systems were tested next; the results characterized the attenuation coefficient as a function of wavelength and temperature, something that no other experimental work has done before for this specific fluid. These values will help to determine an optimal <b>operating</b> <b>fluid</b> for high temperature thermal applications...|$|E
