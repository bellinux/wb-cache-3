5|$|After {{experimenting with}} poison fails {{to kill the}} larvae in Charlie's body, Walter {{believes}} that mixing the chimera's blood with Charlie's will stop the larvae from attacking and bursting out of his body, {{as they did in}} the other victims' corpses. Olivia learns one of the victims, Jonathan Swift, was the son of a scientist who tests on animals, and was killed while breaking into his father's lab. They also realize the chimera was created based <b>on</b> <b>work</b> by one of Walter's peers, not Walter himself.|$|E
5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building <b>on</b> <b>work</b> with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.|$|E

5|$|Historians like Milcíades Peña {{consider}} this historical {{period of the}} Americas as pre-capitalist, as most production of the coastal cities was destined to overseas markets.

Norberto Galasso and Enrique Rivera consider that it was neither capitalist nor feudalist, but an hybrid system result of {{the interaction of the}} Spanish civilization, on the transition from feudalism to capitalism, and the natives, still living in the prehistory.|$|E

5|$|The underpowered engines {{made the}} fighter sluggish, and the hydro-skis {{were not as}} {{successful}} as hoped; they created violent vibration during takeoff and landing, despite the shock-absorbing oleo legs they were extended <b>on.</b> <b>Work</b> on the skis and legs improved this situation somewhat, but {{they were unable to}} resolve the sluggish performance. The Sea Dart proved incapable of supersonic speed in level flight with the J34 engines; not helping was its pre-area rule shape, which meant higher transonic drag.|$|E

5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 15 July, eight teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 17–20 July {{to prepare for}} the upcoming German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. Ricardo Zonta set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz. Michael Schumacher lost control of the rear-end of his car at the Seconda Variante chicane, causing him to slide along the barriers and his car rested in the tyre barriers. Testing was suspended for one hour for the barriers to be repaired. Ferrari later found the crash occurred by a broken diffuser from riding on the kerbs which created a loss of downforce under braking. Michael Schumacher took a medical check and was declared fit to race. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the second day where it was held in wet weather conditions during the afternoon. Sauber and BAR went to Circuit Ricardo Tormo for three days where aerodyamic and set-up testing was undertaken. Coulthard was scheduled to join Wurz during the session but withdrew because of food poisoning. Irvine was quickest on the third and final days of testing. Arrows elected not to perform any testing and concentrated <b>on</b> <b>work</b> on aerodynamics at their headquarters at Leafield.|$|E

5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons was based <b>on</b> <b>work</b> {{done at the}} Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E
