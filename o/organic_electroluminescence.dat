40|$|We {{report the}} {{generation}} and detection of bipolar <b>organic</b> <b>electroluminescence</b> of porphyrin molecules from a nanoscale junction in an ultrahigh vacuum {{scanning tunneling microscope}} (STM). Clear molecular fluorescence from porphyrin molecules near metal substrates has been realized through highly localized electrical excitation of molecules in proximity to a sharp tip apex. The molecular origin of the luminescence, arising from the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) radiative transitions of neutral molecules, is clearly established by the observed well-defined vibrationally resolved fluorescence spectra that match perfectly with conventional photoluminescence data from molecular thin films. The molecules fluoresce at low onset voltages for both bias polarities, presenting an example of bipolar <b>organic</b> <b>electroluminescence</b> at the nanoscale. Such bipolar operation suggests a double-barrier model for electron transport, with hot electron injection into unoccupied states of molecules in both polarities. The optical behavior of molecules in the tunnel junction is also found sensitive to the electronic properties of molecules and energy level alignment at the interface. These results offer new information to the optoelectronic behavior of molecules in a nanoscopic environment and may open up new routes {{to the development of}} single-molecule science and molecular scale electronics.

In <b>organic</b> compounds, <b>electroluminescence</b> {{has been known}} since the early 1950s, when Bernanose and coworkers first produced electroluminescence in crystalline thin films of acridine orange and quinacrine. In 1960, researchers at Dow Chemical developed AC-driven electroluminescent cells using doping. In some cases, similar light emission is observed when a voltage is applied to {{a thin layer of}} a conductive organic polymer film. While electroluminescence was originally mostly of academic interest, the increased conductivity of modern conductive polymers means enough power can be put through the device at low voltages to generate practical amounts of light.

40|$|We report low {{operating}} voltage and high efficiency <b>organic</b> <b>electroluminescence</b> devices {{by using an}} ultrathin CsF layer with the conventional Mg:Ag cathode.

In addition, the insertion of the CsF layer increases the maximum power efficiency from 1. 6 to 3. 3 lm/W. Mechanism responsible for this performance improvement is attributed to the substantial reduction of electron injection barrier by the free Cs metal atoms released at the organic/metal interface.

Doped charge transport layers are used for generation of charge carriers within the device, hence {{eliminating the need for}} injecting charge carriers from external electrodes. The device is an organic-inorganic hybrid: We exploit the mechanical strength and chemical stability of inorganic semiconductors and combine it with better optical properties of organic materials whose emission color can be chemically tuned so that it covers the entire visible spectrum.

Organic light {{emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) have {{been the focus of}} intense study since the late 1980 s, when the low voltage <b>organic</b> <b>electroluminescence</b> in small organic molecules such as Alq 3, and large organic molecules such as polymers (PPV), was reported. Since that time, research has continued to demonstrate the potential of OLEDs as viable systems for displays and eco-friendly lighting applications. OLEDs offer full colour display, reduced manufacturing cost, larger viewing angle, more flexible, lower power consumption, better contrast, slimmer, etc. which help in replacing the other technologies such as LCD. The operation of OLEDs involves injection of charge carriers into organic semiconducting layers, recombination of charge carriers, formation of singlet and triplet excitons, and emission of light during decay of excitons. The maximum internal quantum efficiency of fluorescent OLEDs consisting of the emissive layer of fluorescent organic material is 25 % because in this case only the 25 % singlet excitons can emit light. The maximum internal quantum efficiency of phosphorescent OLEDs consisting of the emissive layer of fluorescent organic material mixed with phosphorescent material of heavy metal complexes such as platinum complexes, iridium complexes, etc. is nearly 100 % because in this case both the 25 % singlet excitons and 75 % triplet excitons emit light. Recently, a new class of OLEDs based on thermall...|$|E
