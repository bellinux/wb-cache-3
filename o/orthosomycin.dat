40|$|SummaryThe {{ribosome}} {{is a major}} {{target in}} the bacterial cell for antibiotics. Here, we dissect the effects that the thiopeptide antibiotics thiostrepton (ThS) and micrococcin (MiC) {{as well as the}} <b>orthosomycin</b> antibiotic evernimicin (Evn) have on translational GTPases. We demonstrate that, like ThS, MiC is a translocation inhibitor, and that the activation by MiC of the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of EF-G is dependent on the presence of the ribosomal proteins L 7 /L 12 as well as the Gâ€² subdomain of EF-G. In contrast, Evn does not inhibit translocation but is a potent inhibitor of back-translocation as well as IF 2 -dependent 70 S-initiation complex formation. Collectively, these results shed insight not only into fundamental aspects of translation but also into the unappreciated specificities of these classes of translational inhibitors...|$|E
