40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{mechanism}} to detect, model and track <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> a contaminant cloud boundary using air borne sensor swarms. <b>The</b> <b>cloud</b> consists <b>of</b> a transparent gas of nuclear, biological or chemical con-taminants and is spreading slowly in an urban environ-ment. A group of Uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs), having the required sensors, are made to fly through <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> to detect <b>the</b> boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> <b>The</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> is modeled using splinegon and <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> is tracked using an observer. <b>The</b> output <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observer is used in <b>the</b> path planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UAVs. A simple path planning algorithm is proposed that along with the observer can accurately track <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moving <b>cloud</b> without <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> Simulated experiments are car-ried out to test <b>the</b> proposed <b>cloud</b> tracking algorithm...|$|R

The individuals walking in Los Angeles stop for a moment, and look towards the sky, which is cut off screen. As close-up shots of Amuro finish {{by the end of}} the bridge section of the song, the camera pans towards rainbow-coloured clouds, which puts all the citizens in surprise and glee. The final chorus has Amuro {{and the children}} dancing and singing at Pershing Square, surrounding by several lighting effects and rainbow-coloured clouds. Several scenes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> start to float within the city, above and near skyscrapers, and the video ends with Amuro, the children, and the citizens smiling.|$|E

Soon {{after arriving in}} England, on 4 October 1943, his and another aircraft were sent out on patrol. They were attacked by six Ju 88s. The other aircraft sought the protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> but Guest decided to fight it out. He did not return. He was pronounced missing in January 1944. Guest is commemorated on the Runnymede Memorial.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, {{there were few}} new {{insights}} into the nature of noctilucent clouds. Wegener's conjecture, that they were composed of water ice, was later shown to be correct. Study was limited to ground-based observations and scientists had very little knowledge of the mesosphere until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed {{for the first time that}} the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> coincided with very low temperatures in the mesosphere.|$|E

The caravan leaves Ulthar that night, shortly before the townspeople notice that all of their cats have gone missing. The townspeople suspect both the old couple and the wanderers, but the innkeeper's son Atal witnesses the felines circling {{the property of the}} cotter. The next morning, the cats have returned to their owners well-fed, but the cotter and his wife have vanished. When the townspeople explore their abandoned house, they discovered nothing more than two skeletons that have been picked clean. The local burgesses, after reviewing the evidence and stories of the townspeople, decide to pass a law that forbids the killing of cats in Ulthar.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds were}} first {{detected}} from space by an instrument on the OGO-6 satellite in 1972. The OGO-6 observations {{of a bright}} scattering layer over the polar caps were identified as poleward extensions of these clouds. A later satellite, the Solar Mesosphere Explorer, mapped the distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> between 1981 and 1986 with its ultraviolet spectrometer. The clouds were detected with a lidar in 1995 at Utah State University, {{even when they were}} not visible to the naked eye. The first physical confirmation that water ice is indeed the primary component of noctilucent clouds came from the HALOE instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{obscuration}} {{caused by}} yellow clouds had been {{noted in the}} 1870s when they were observed by Schiaparelli.

He discovered that Mars appeared more yellow during oppositions when the planet was closest to the Sun and was receiving more energy. He suggested windblown sand or dust as the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|E

Loyalist tanks and armoured personnel carriers rushed to their battle stations and anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, nearly hitting the loyalist aircraft from Bien Hoa Air Base in pursuit of the two rebel planes. Two tanks and a number of jeeps armed with 50-calibre machine guns patrolled the smoke-filled streets as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> {{varies with}} depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with {{the temperature in}} the range 100–160K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185–270K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10–20 bar and temperatures are 270–330K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is part of}} a popular hiking area, with the Appalachian Trail crossing the summit and one of the Appalachian Mountain Club's eight mountain huts, the Lakes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clouds</b> Hut, located on one of the mountain's shoulders. Winter recreation includes Tuckerman Ravine, famous for its Memorial Day skiing and its 45-degree slopes. The ravine is notorious for its avalanches, of which about 100 are recorded every year, and which have killed six people since 1849. Scores of hikers have died on the mountain in all seasons, due to harsh and rapidly changing conditions, inadequate equipment, and failure to plan for the wide variety of conditions which can occur above tree line.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{attempts}} {{a portrait}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Cloud</b> in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> {{its position in}} <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Christian mysticism. That the anonymous work owed much to spiritual writers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preceding twelve hundred years is not debatable; what it owed maybe slightly less obvious. <b>The</b> <b>Cloud</b> is essentially a work of Dionysian mysticism, and various writers within that tradition who may have influenced or affected <b>the</b> teaching <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Cloud</b> are examined. At the same time, however, the anonymous writer owes much to <b>the</b> western tradition <b>of</b> Augustinian theology, and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> this, complementary to the Dionysian mysticism, is also considered. In Chapter II {{we look at the}} theological doctrine underlying <b>the</b> mystical doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cloud</b> corpus. Chapter III has two major parts, both concerned with <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Cloud</b> on <b>the</b> subsequent development <b>of</b> spiritual writing in England.

5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} over the northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper level wind shear kept John a tropical storm. Intensity fluctuated considerably, however, as shear levels varied. More than once, shear cleared away most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> above John and nearly {{caused it to}} weaken to a tropical depression. However, after eight days of slow westward movement across the Pacific Ocean, shear lessened greatly on August 19, and John intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 1700 PDT. During an eighteen-hour period between August 19 and August 20, John further strengthened from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a major Category 3 hurricane. Around 1100 PDT on August 20, it crossed into the central Pacific, {{the first of three}} basin crosses John would make.|$|E
