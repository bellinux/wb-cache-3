30|$|Magnetic {{observatories}} {{belonging to}} the global INTERMAGNET (International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network; [URL] network provide <b>one-minute</b> <b>values</b> of the three components of the geomagnetic field. However, vector magnetometers used in magnetic observatories, often of fluxgate-type, usually drift in time due to several factors such as temperature variations and ageing of the electronics. In order to periodically recalibrate the vector magnetometer and, if needed, correct for the tilt of the pillar on which the magnetometer is mounted, absolute measurements are performed {{on a regular basis}} (typically once a week). Such measurements are made by a trained observer using a single-axis fluxgate magnetometer mounted onto a non-magnetic theodolite, and a scalar magnetometer (see, e.g., Jankowski and Sucksdorff, 1996). Absolute measurements are used to calculate a calibration curve, called a baseline. INTERMAGNET currently distributes two types of data products: preliminary data, which are made available in quasi-real time (less than 72 hours), and definitive data, which are produced only once a year, typically {{a few months after the}} end of the civil year. Definitive data are corrected for baseline variations, whereas preliminary data may not have any baseline corrections applied and can thus only be used for studying rapid variations of external origin.|$|R
40|$|High {{resolution}} global irradiance {{time series}} {{are needed for}} accurate simulations of photovoltaic (PV) systems, since the typical volatile PV power output induced by fast irradiance changes cannot be simulated properly with commonly available hourly averages of global irradiance. We present a two-step algorithm {{that is capable of}} synthesizing one-minute global irradiance time series based on hourly averaged datasets. The algorithm is initialized by deriving characteristic transition probability matrices (TPM) for different weather conditions (cloudless, broken clouds and overcast) from a large number of high resolution measurements. Once initialized, the algorithm is location-independent and capable of synthesizing <b>one-minute</b> <b>values</b> based on hourly averaged global irradiance of any desired location. The one-minute time series are derived by discrete-time Markov chains based on a TPM that matches the weather condition of the input dataset. One-minute time series generated with the presented algorithm are compared with measured high resolution data and show a better agreement compared to two existing synthesizing algorithms in terms of temporal variability and characteristic frequency distributions of global irradiance and clearness index values. A comparison based on measurements performed in Lindenberg, Germany, and Carpentras, France, shows a reduction of the frequency distribution root mean square errors of more than 60 % compared to the two existing synthesizing algorithms.

40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) operate seven {{magnetic}} observatories; {{three in}} the United Kingdom and four at remote locations worldwide. All seven are now INTERMAGNET Magnetic Observatories or IMOs. BGS also help to operate two other worldwide observatories {{on behalf of a}} directional drilling company. The processing of all nine observatories is carried out in the BGS office in Edinburgh, where rigorous quality-control operations are in place to ensure the quality of data and products. This is considered in relation to the real-time supply as well as next day delivery of quasi-definitive and longer term definitive data products. The data processing operations carried out on daily, weekly and annual time-scales are described, and the current practice is demonstrated. A single observatory system includes a fluxgate magnetometer - to measure variations in two perpendicular horizontal components and in the vertical component - and a proton precession magnetometer to measure absolute total field values. A fluxgate-theodolite is also required to enable weekly manual observations of declination and inclination, which supplement the other continuous and automatic measurements as per standard observatory operations. We compare processing techniques used for single-system observatories, which are in place at the seven remote locations, with those possible at the three UK observatories, where three systems are run in parallel. We describe the data correction processes that are used and the differences between those applied to one-second and <b>one-minute</b> <b>values.</b> Various sets of results are presented and some examples of their usefulness for scientific research discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{assesses the}} {{performance}} of five transposition models that estimate the global and diffuse solar irradiance on tilted planes based on the global horizontal irradiance. The modelled tilted irradiance values are compared to measured <b>one-minute</b> <b>values</b> from pyranometers and silicon sensors tilted at different angles at Hannover (Germany) and NREL (Golden, CO, USA). It can be recognized that the deviations of the model of Liu and Jordan, Klucher and Perez from the measurements increases as the tilt angle increases and as the sensors are oriented away from the south direction, where they receive lower direct radiation than south-oriented surfaces. Accordingly, the vertical E, W and N planes show the highest deviation. Best results are found by the models from Hay and Davies and Reindl, when horizontal pyranometer measurements and a constant albedo value of 0. 2 are used. The relative root mean squared difference (rRMSD) of the anisotropic models does not exceed 11 % for south orientation and low inclination angles (β = 10 – 60 °), but reaches up to 28. 9 % at vertical planes. For sunny locations such as Golden, the Perez model provides the best estimates of global tilted irradiance for south-facing surfaces. The relative mean absolute difference (rMAD) of the Perez model at NREL ranges from 4. 2 % for 40 ° tilt to 8. 7 % for 90 ° tilt angle, when horizontal pyranometer measurements and a measured albedo value are used; the use of measured albedo values instead of a constant value of 0. 2 leads to a reduction of the deviation to 3. 9 % and 6. 0 %, respectively. The use of higher albedo values leads to a significant increase of rMAD. We also investigated the uncertainty resulting from using horizontal pyranometer measurements, in combination with constant albedo values, to estimate the incident irradiance on tilted photovoltaic (PV) modules. We found that these uncertainties are small or negligible...|$|R

The primary {{objective of this}} project has been to provide advice in the planning phase of a roof-top wind project to ensure its success. As secondary objectives, this research has assessed the turbulence characteristics at a recommended site and evaluated the suitability of the small wind turbine design standard for roof-top installations. A monitoring mast was designed and installed on the roof-top of the Bunnings warehouse in Port Kennedy to measure the effect of turbine mounting height on average wind speed and wind turbulence intensity. As a consequence of this wind data analysis, planning applications were modified to increase the turbine height from 2 m to 4 m above the roof. This change is predicted to increase power output {{by a factor of}} four. The predicted capacity factor of approximately 9 % at the site is low by commercial standards but compares favourably with published values for roof-top systems. The Class II Swift turbines proposed for the project are designed to withstand higher wind speeds than observed, but fatigue from high levels of turbulence (especially when the wind is from the southern sector) may reduce their safe operating life. At present, procedures for turbulence measurement and characterisation are not satisfactorily standardised in the small wind field. Various research groups apply a range of sampling rates and measurement intervals when calculating turbulence intensity, which can make comparison of results difficult. In the absence of a standard, a one-minute measurement interval is recommended and a method for calculating longer-interval turbulence intensity <b>values</b> from <b>one-minute</b> <b>values</b> is presented.

40|$|International audiencePresent {{needs in}} {{concentrating solar power}} systems require {{knowledge}} of the solar irradiation temporal evolution. Daily or hourly generation of irradiation synthetic series is normally used in the estimation of solar resource, as measured series of radiation are only available for a reduced number of locations. Notwithstanding, the flickering nature of instantaneous solar irradiance is lost in hourly series, {{and it has a}} considerable impact on the non-linear behaviour of solar energy conversion systems. The study of the statistical behaviour of short term values of solar irradiation will facilitate more precise one minute synthetic generation of solar irradiation series, and consequently will facilitate more accurate estimations of concentrating solar power systems performance characterized by a fast and non-linear response to the incoming solar radiation. In this work, the probability density function of one minute values of clearness index kt (solar global horizontal irradiance to extraterrestrial horizontal irradiance ratio) conditioned to the optical air mass m (relative thickness of the air path traversed by a sun's ray when it reaches the earth's surface) and hourly kt in Carpentras (France) has been investigated.

40|$|Incorporation of {{wind energy}} into the {{electricity}} generation system requires {{a detailed analysis of}} wind speed in order to minimize system balancing cost and avoid a significant mismatch between supply and demand. Power generation and consumption in the electricity networks have to be balanced every minute, therefore it is necessary to study wind speed on a one-minute time scale. In this thesis, we examine the statistical characteristics of <b>one-minute</b> average <b>values</b> of wind speed. One-minute wind speed is available from a single site in Great Britain while there are records of ten-minute wind speed available. We apply a modified Gibbs sampling algorithm to generate one-minute wind speed required for optimization modelling from the available ten-minute wind speed. System balancing costs are estimated through optimization modelling of the short-term electricity generation with wind energy contributing to the total supply. Two main drivers of additional system cost caused by wind energy are variability and unpredictability of one-minute wind speed. Further, a linear mathematical optimization model for a problem of short-term electricity generation is presented to calculate an additional balancing cost that appears as a result of wind energy variability. It is then shown that this additional balancing cost can be estimated using the statistical characteristics of wind energy present in the system. The unpredictable characteristic of wind speed is analysed with the techniques of stochastic programming. Uncertainty of the expected wind speed is represented through scenario trees and stochastic linear optimization models are used to calculate the extra cost due to uncertainty. Alternative optimization models are compared by calculating the additional balancing cost and the extent of imbalance between power generation and consumption in the system.

40|$|Odorous {{emissions}} {{can result}} in physiological and psychological discomfort when released and subsequently perceived by people in the neighbouring community. Regulatory agencies, as well {{as members of the}} industrial and agricultural sectors, are obliged to develop methods for mitigating or preventing odorous impacts on communities. It has been proposed that combined application of the Industrial Source Complex-Short Term 3 (ISCST 3) dispersion model and the Odour Impact Model (OIM) can provide an improved basis for predicting odorous impacts. The objective of this investigation was to validate the use of ISCST 3 and the OEM to predict the impact of emissions from a hog farm in rural Quebec in terms of probability of response and degree of annoyance. This was accomplished by predicting the impact through modelling for comparison with on-site field measurements that were conducted on three different occasions. The ISCST 3 dispersion model was used to predict odour concentrations in the region in the immediate vicinity of the farm. Subsequently, the predicted concentrations were used in combination with the dose-response curves of the OIM to predict the probability of response and annoyance that would be experienced in the region surrounding the hog farm. When compared to field measurements, it was concluded that the model resulted in reasonably accurate predictions provided that the predicted one-hour time-averaged concentrations from the dispersion model were first transformed to <b>one-minute</b> timeaveraged <b>values.</b> Overall, once this transformation was made, there was a tendency to slightly under predict the probability of response and to slightly over predict the degree of annoyance.
