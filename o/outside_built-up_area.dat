30|$|It {{is widely}} known that road users choose their speed {{based on their}} visual {{impression}} of the road scene, rather than on speed limit signs. Unclear road design can cause uncertainty to the drivers.

40|$|The safe {{speeds and}} also the general speed limits are quite {{different}} outside and within built-up areas. If {{it does not follow}} from the road design, whether the given scene is within or <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>area,</b> drivers are uncertain about their appropriate speed. This paper shows two approaches to assess the degree of uncertainty of the drivers. The first was a questionnaire survey of requested speeds at various road scenes. In the second method, the recognition process of drivers was simulated by image classification software. Output indicators of these methods (standard deviation of speeds and certainty score) can serve as tools to identify road scenes and road elements leading to uncertain and therefore risky situations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{number of}} {{accidents}} with serious personal injuries, fatalities and injured persons on German roads <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> has been falling since 1970 : due not least to improvements in vehicle safety, in particular from self-sufficient Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Engineers hope for ADAS {{that help to}} avoid or reduce severe accidents. But how and where do relevant accidents occur? What do {{they have in common}} and what information is required in order to indicate imminent danger? To answer these questions, accidents on roads <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> were examined, and the general requirements to be met by suitable cooperative systems were identified. It was revealed that, due to the high level of investment these systems require, both in terms of technical input and finance, there are really only a few applications for which it makes sense to use infrastructure-based driver assistance systems...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{accident}} study into Dutch roundabouts carried out by SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research in the year 1990. The study selected 46 "new" roundabouts divided into: 38 roundabouts within <b>built-up</b> <b>areas,</b> and 8 roundabouts <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas.</b> The new priority rule at roundabouts implies that traffic approaching them should give priority to traffic on roundabouts. The accident data were based on more than 1360 accidents occurred on these locations in the 1984 - 1989 period. It is concluded that, among other things: (1) roundabouts were considerably safer than intersections; (2) there was a higher {{decline in the number}} of car occupant victims than in the number of victims among both cyclists and moped riders; (3) no statement could be made about which types of engineering facility were most suitable for cyclists and moped riders. One recommendation is that more roundabouts should be applied to dangerous junctions, both within and <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas.</b> For the abstract of the second study see C 1640...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{surveillance}} method used in 1990 to ascertain the development of seat belt usage in the Netherlands are described in this report.

The increase in seat belt use since 1986 seems to have definitively come to a standstill...|$|R
50|$|The limits {{shown above}} apply {{only if there}} are no other signs present, as the signs may {{prescribe}} a lower or a higher speed limit. The speed limit <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> is in many places, especially in the Flemish Region, restricted to 70 km/h (43 mph). Around almost all schools, 30 km/h (19 mph) zones are found.|$|R
40|$|During October 1991, a {{combined}} survey was done into {{the presence and}} use of safety belts and child seats on the back seats of cars. Contrary to previous years, it also looked at the belt use by both drivers and front seat passengers. The use of seat belts by car drivers in 1991 was practically {{the same as in}} 1990, and amounted to 77 %. The belt use by drivers on roads within <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> increased to 62 %. In view of this, the strong decrease of belt use started in 1990 was stopped in 1991. On roads <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas,</b> the belt use by front seat passengers decreased to 78 %. An increase of the belt use by front seat passengers to 68 % was found on locations within <b>built-up</b> <b>areas.</b> Differences in seat belt use by car drivers appeared to correlate significantly with the type of the road. Per province, great differences were found in belt use on roads within and <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas,</b> both for drivers and front seat passengers. In this context, the northern provinces showed the highest percentages of wearing rates. Contrary to locations <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas,</b> the presence of an occupant on {{the front seat of the}} car appeared to influence belt use by the driver. Sex still appeared to influence belt use on the front seats of cars: seat belts were more often worn by women than by men. These percentages were respectively 83 % and 75 % on roads <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas,</b> and 69 % and 59 % respectively on locations within <b>built-up</b> <b>areas.</b> On the survey locations, it was found that in about 47 % of the cars a safety system was present on the side back seats, and in the middle of the seat the presence was 34 %. Compared with 1990, this means an increase of the belt use on side back seats of 8 % for locations <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas,</b> and for inside <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> an increase of approximately 12 %. These percentages were for the middle of the seat 6 % and 14 % respectively. In comparison with 1990, the use of seat belts on the back seats of cars in 1991 decreased strongly. This use appeared to relate strongly with the age of the car occupants. Compared with 1990, a substantial increase of the use of a safety system on the rear seats of cars in 1991 was found among the children in the age groups up to 5 years old and 5 - 12 years old. The belt use by the driver appeared to have an influence on the use of a safety system by occupants on the back seats of cars. If a safety system is present on the rear seats, the difference in wearing rates between roads <b>outside</b> and within <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> amounted to 5 %: 24 % versus 29 %. It is shown that the belts on the back seats were not often used by adults. In view of the wearing rates among adults, additional policy to be directed at publicity is needed to enhance the use of belts on rear seats...|$|R
50|$|The default {{speed limits}} in the Netherlands are 50 km/h (31 mph) inside <b>built-up</b> <b>areas,</b> 80 km/h (50 mph) <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas,</b> 100 km/h (62 mph) on expressways (autowegen), and 130 km/h (81 mph) on {{motorways}} (autosnelwegen).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the relevant data on: (1) the current general speed limits on roads <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> in the Netherlands; (2) the 80 km/h road classification; (3) driving speeds, according to road type; (4) the accident rate, according to road type; and (5) the relationship between driving speed, accidents and speed limit. Based on this overview, the paper considers the possible effects of an increase in the passenger car speed limit from 80 km/h to 90 km/h on 80 km/h roads <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas.</b> It is concluded that this increase is not advisable, from the traffic safety point of view. However, it is better to lower the current 80 km/h speed limit for the one-lane rural roads with access to all traffic. It is also recommended to develop a differentiated system of general speed limits, particularly below the 80 km/h. However, specific speed limits should be introduced, when a differentiated system of general speed limits is not required...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a pilot study into driving speeds of 46 "snorfietsers" and 387 moped riders. Radar speed measurements were carried out within and <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> {{in the western part of}} the Netherlands in April 1992. One result is that the maximum legal speed limit of 25 km/h for "snorfietsen" is exceeded by 48 % of the "snorfietsers", mainly younger male riders. It can be concluded that the speed limits is exceeded by a considerably number of: (1) moped riders within built-up areas; and (2) "snorfietsers". It seems that "snorfietsers" are more inclined to exceed the speed limit <b>outside</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>areas.</b> However, it was not possible to measure the actual number of speed offenders due to the technical failure of the radar apparatus. It is recommended that this pilot study should be on a larger scale spread all over the Netherlands in order to investigate a greater number of "snorfietsers"...|$|R
