Standard programmed-temperature vaporizing or <b>on-column</b> large volume injection systems cannot be used, mainly due to instrumental difficulties.

If short, wide-bore columns are used at carrier gas velocities above optimum, the cloud of vapor formed upon evaporation of the solvent can be rapidly discharged from the system by the column flow alone. Hence, in medium-resolution GC, large sample volumes (e. g., 50 L) can be injected using a standard <b>on-column</b> injector. Neither a retention gap nor a solvent vapor exit is needed. The absence of column connectors makes this setup extremely rugged. The optimization of the direct <b>on-column</b> large volume injection is described.

Although comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) can offer high resolution and sensitivity compared with traditional one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 DGC), sample preparation is still essential for trace component analysis. An <b>on-column</b> cold trap device {{was used as a}} part of GC×GC or GC×GC combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) systems. The <b>on-column</b> cold trap device using a homemade double layer CO 2 jet was mounted on the GC×GC or GC×GC-TOFMS, and performed at - 60 ℃- 70 cryogenic ℃temperature. Based on large volume injection, the trace compounds were focused at the head of column by cold trap and stationary phase, and thermally desorbed and reinjected by oven. The performance of <b>on-column</b> cold trap was evaluated. Due to no extra increment of system dead volume by the on-line enrichment, the bandwidths of <b>on-column</b> cold trap were equal to those of directly injection. Components whose boiling points were no less than that of nonane could be captured entirely by this method. The system was applied to trapping trace components in gas, liquid or solid matrix.

In this work, three sizes of micromachined electrical field-flow fractionation (m-ElFFF) systems, with complementary <b>on-column</b> electrical and optical detection modalities were fabricated to achieve this objective. Field-flow fractionation (FFF) technology is capable of fractionating (or separating) a wide variety of materials and is capable of hundreds of consecutive analysis runs using a single system.

Simulation of exchange-deformed HPLC profiles using a computer program based on the stochastic model yielded the apparent rate constants for the <b>on-column</b> enantiomerization and the corresponding free energy activation barriers. At − 20 °C the enantiomerization barriers, ΔG≠, for diazepam, prazepam and tetrazepam were determined {{to be in the}} range 17. 6 – 18. 7 kcal/mol. At − 55 °C ΔG≠ for flunitrazepam was determined to be in the 15. 6 – 15. 7 kcal/mol range. The experimental dynamic chromatograms and the corresponding interconversion barriers reported in this paper call for a reinterpretation of previously published results on the HPLC behavior of diazepam on chiral stationary phases...|$|E

[...] University of Washington, 2012 To achieve faster gas chromatographic (GC) {{analysis}} of increasingly complex samples requires improved peak capacity production (peak capacity per separation run time) from the separation. The increased peak capacity production {{was achieved by}} selecting appropriate experimental conditions based on theoretical modeling of <b>on-column</b> band broadening, by reducing the injection pulse width, and by {{the implementation of a}} second, serially connected column to make a GC × GC instrument. Modeling to estimate the <b>on-column</b> band broadening from experimental parameters provided insight to achieving GC separations in the absence of off-column band broadening (the additional band broadening not due to the <b>on-column</b> separation process). In order to optimize separations collected on a traditional GC platform, off-column band broadening from injection was significantly reduced by using a variety of modified injection devices (includeing diaphragm valves, commercially available thermal modulators, and a custom built high speed cryofocusing injector) to generate narrow pulses on the separation column for both isothermal and temperature programmed separations. Additionally, off-column band broadening from detection was minimized by implementation of fast detectors such as flame ionization detectors (FID) and time-of-fligh mass spectrometry (TOFMS) collecting data at rates greater than 500 Hz. This resulted in a 2 to 3 -fold improvement in peak capacity production compared to standard GC practice. The optimized injection techniques and separation conditions described above were also applied to GC × GC instrumentation with both valve and thermal modulators, resulting in 5 to 10 -fold improvement in peak capacity production relative to traditional instruments...|$|E
