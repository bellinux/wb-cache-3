40|$|We {{consider}} zigzags in thin complexes. The main result {{states that}} <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> all zigzags in an $n$-complexe {{is equal to}} <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> all zigzags in all $(n- 1) $-faces of this complex, and this sum also is <b>the</b> twice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> all zigzags in all $(n- 2) $-faces.

5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> {{of the body and}} through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E

5|$|The {{last two}} shipsQ and Rwere {{enlarged}} versions: 188 meters long at the waterline and 196 m overall. Their beams were 1 meter wider, at 18 meters. The ships' draft was lower at 5.4 meters. The ships {{were designed to}} displace 9,300 tons, and displaced 8,568 tons standard. All six ships were to have steel-made, and up to 85% welded construction.

5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover.

To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E
