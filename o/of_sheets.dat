They are composed <b>of</b> <b>sheets</b> of papyrus joined together, the individual papyri varying in width from 15cm to 45cm. The scribes working on Book of the Dead papyri took more care over their work than those working on more mundane texts; care was taken to frame the text within margins, and to avoid writing on the joints between sheets. The words peret em heru, or 'coming forth by day' sometimes appear on the reverse of the outer margin, perhaps acting as a label.|$|E
5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction {{can be obtained}} from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set <b>of</b> <b>sheets</b> is identified by its three Miller indices (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{prior to}} 1840 the postal system was expensive, {{confusing}} and seen as corrupt. Letters were {{paid for by}} the recipient rather than the sender, and were charged according to the distance the letter had travelled and the number <b>of</b> <b>sheets</b> of paper it contained. Sir Rowland Hill reformed the postal system based on the concepts of penny postage and pre payment. In his proposal Hill also called for official pre-printed envelopes and adhesive postage stamps as alternative ways of getting the sender to pay for the postage, at a time when prepayment was optional, which led to the invention of the postage stamp, the Penny Black.|$|E
25|$|Crystals {{can have}} certain special electrical, optical, and {{mechanical}} properties that glass and polycrystals normally cannot. These properties {{are related to}} the anisotropy of the crystal, i.e. the lack of rotational symmetry in its atomic arrangement. One such property is the piezoelectric effect, where a voltage across the crystal can shrink or stretch it. Another is birefringence, where a double image appears when looking through a crystal. Moreover, various properties of a crystal, including electrical conductivity, electrical permittivity, and Young's modulus, may be different in different directions in a crystal. For example, graphite crystals consist of a stack <b>of</b> <b>sheets,</b> and although each individual sheet is mechanically very strong, the sheets are rather loosely bound to each other. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the material is quite different depending on the direction of stress.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{attention}} {{concentrated on}} the pole of bulge profile, tensile instability which results in the fracture of forward acting rupture discs has been studied. A formula was developed to calculate the theoretical limit pressure of rupture discs, and the theoretical predictions were compared with the measured data. It is found that the strain-hardening exponent <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> metals has no influence on the limit pressure, whereas the limit pressure is {{in direct proportion to}} the strength coefficient <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> metals. It is important to realize that the strength coefficient <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> metals can be acquired easily from the limit pressure.

25|$|Differences {{in crystal}} {{structure}} and chemistry greatly influence other physical {{properties of the}} mineral. The carbon allotropes diamond and graphite have vastly different properties; diamond is the hardest natural substance, has an adamantine lustre, and belongs to the isometric crystal family, whereas as graphite is very soft, has a greasy lustre, and crystallises in the hexagonal family. This difference is accounted by differences in bonding. In diamond, the carbons are in sp3 hybrid orbitals, which means they form a framework where each carbon is covalently bonded to four neighbours in a tetrahedral fashion; on the other hand, graphite is composed <b>of</b> <b>sheets</b> of carbons in sp2 hybrid orbitals, where each carbon is bonded covalently to only three others. These sheets are held together by much weaker van der Waals forces, and this discrepancy translates to big macroscopic differences.|$|E
25|$|Phyllosilicates consist <b>of</b> <b>sheets</b> of {{polymerized}} tetrahedra. They {{are bound}} at three oxygen sites, which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5. Important {{examples include the}} mica, chlorite, and the kaolinite-serpentine groups. The sheets are weakly bound by van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds, which causes a crystallographic weakness, in turn leading to a prominent basal cleavage among the phyllosilicates. In addition to the tetrahedra, phyllosilicates have a sheet of octahedra (elements in six-fold coordination by oxygen) that balanced out the basic tetrahedra, which have a negative charge (e.g. 4−) These tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O) sheets are stacked {{in a variety of}} combinations to create phyllosilicate groups. Within an octahedral sheet, there are three octahedral sites in a unit structure; however, not all of the sites may be occupied. In that case, the mineral is termed dioctahedral, whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s {{at least}} 12½% of all British mail was {{conveyed}} under the personal frank of peers, dignitaries {{and members of}} parliament, while censorship and political espionage were conducted by postal officials. Fundamentally, the postal system was mismanaged, wasteful, expensive and slow. It had become inadequate {{for the needs of}} an expanding commercial and industrial nation. There is a well-known story, probably apocryphal, about how Hill gained an interest in reforming the postal system; he apparently noticed a young woman too poor to redeem a letter sent to her by her fiancé. At that time, letters were normally paid for by the recipient, not the sender. The recipient could simply refuse delivery. Frauds were commonplace; for example, coded information could appear {{on the cover of the}} letter; the recipient would examine the cover to gain the information, and then refuse delivery to avoid payment. Each individual letter had to be logged. In addition, postal rates were complex, depending on the distance and the number <b>of</b> <b>sheets</b> in the letter.|$|E
