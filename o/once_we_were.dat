500|$|The Americans {{were pulling}} out of Southeast Asia as quickly as {{negotiations}} with the North Vietnamese would allow them. Ambassador Godley, stunned by the diplomatic developments, ruminated that [...] "We had led him (Souvanna) down the garden path. Let's face it, we were cutting and running... <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> out of Vietnam {{the only way we}} could have protected Laos was with an Army corps. It was totally out of the question and we knew it. We were licked." [...] Souvanna then faced a dilemma, sign a separate agreement with the Pathet Lao on almost any terms, or continue the war with no prospect of success. Hanoi was also desirious to obtain a quick agreement with Vientiane. The sooner the fighting in Laos ceased, the sooner the Hanoi would obtain unimpeded use of the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E

2500|$|Khan {{became the}} only Indian actor to have filmed in Germany, a country known for refusing permits for foreign film shoots. A {{production}} executive said, [...] "Unlike the US, UK and Thailand, it isn't easy to obtain permission to shoot in Germany. The rules are very strict ... Shahrukh Khan is so famous in Germany and that made a great difference to shoot Don 2 there." [...] Sidhwani said, [...] "We are the first Indian film which has managed to do that. There were certain pre-conditions that we were required to meet {{and we had to}} be very careful. Eventually they did open the doors for us. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> together on making the film, they proved to be extremely helpful." ...|$|E

2500|$|During a {{sold out}} Paris concert, {{multiple}} fans {{who were not}} able to get in to see the performance because of its 2,000 person limit began to throw stones at the venue, and were consequently tear gassed by police. It was also popular to see moshing and stage diving at their shows, but the band members discouraged this type of behavior. [...] "They hated it and they tried to stop it as much as possible," [...] artist Arturo Vega recalled, [...] "but it would happen. Kids are really resourceful. Once the lawsuits started coming in, a lot of clubs tried to ban it, too. Sometimes the security made it difficult for them, you know. <b>Once,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in Tijuana--and of coursem in Tiuana, who cares! They were jumping from a balcony that was at least 20 feet high. Jumping into the crowd. It was too much. It was great." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{recording}} of Go, the band {{set out on the}} [...] "4 Albums. 2 Nights. 7 Cities" [...] tour, which found the band performing their past discography over two nights. During that time period, they searched for the label to release Go, which was being mixed at the time. Several labels were interested from samples the band sent them. Another plan the band had was to pay entirely for mastering and manufacturing, and to then find a distributor. The band took meetings with various label heads, including with Brett Gurewitz, former Bad Religion guitarist and head of Epitaph Records, where the band was signed from 2003 to 2008. It was clear from the first meeting that the band would return to their [...] "first home," [...] with Pierre noting that, [...] "We had always enjoyed working with [...] and we loved the people there. We were taking meetings, but <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> hanging out with Brett, we got right back into the swing of things." ...|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
