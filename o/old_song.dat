500|$|The {{principal}} theme (C) {{for this}} movement {{is based on}} an <b>old</b> <b>song,</b> [...] "The little grey dove is cooing", for which Prokofiev provided an optional [...] part for baritone voice. The song theme is developed using a range of instruments, before giving way to a second theme introduced by the tenor saxophone; this in turn is replaced, as the movement draws to its close, with the return of the [...] "little grey dove" [...] tune, now ornamented by birdsong.|$|E

Pytka later stated that it was [...] "heartbreaking" [...] that Harrison had not played the role, particularly after Harrison's death in 2001 and upon discovering that the ukulele was not a sample of an <b>old</b> <b>song</b> as Pytka had assumed. The video won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video in 1997.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} songs are {{commonly}} played and sung at various {{events such as}} commencement, convocation, and athletic contests, including the [...] "Queen's College Colours" [...] (1897) also known as [...] "Our University Yell" [...] and [...] "Oil Thigh", with words by A.E. Lavell, sung to the tune 'John Brown's Body'. Oil Thigh, which was created in 1891, consists of the <b>old</b> <b>song</b> [...] "Queen's College Colours". The name [...] "Oil Thigh" [...] comes from the chorus of the song, which begins with the Gaelic words oil thigh. The modern version of the song was crafted in 1985, when a line was changed to include Queen's woman athletes in the cheer.|$|E

The beloved town physician, Dr. Seldon (who resembles the Starkeeper) advises the graduating class not to rely on their parents' success or be held back by their failure (words directed at Louise). [...] Seldon prompts everyone to sing an <b>old</b> <b>song,</b> [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone". [...] Billy, still invisible, whispers to Louise, telling her to believe Seldon's words, and when she tentatively reaches out to another girl, she learns {{she does not have}} to be an outcast. [...] Billy goes to Julie, telling her at last that he loved her. [...] As his widow and daughter join in the singing, Billy is taken to his heavenly reward.|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} to be {{attempted}} was [...] "Killer", {{which came out}} of a rehearsal that attempted to join fragments of songs together in a deliberate attempt to create something that would be commercially successful. The track was a composite of a basic song structure written by group leader Peter Hammill in 1968, an <b>old</b> <b>song</b> written by founding member Judge Smith called [...] "A Cloud as Big as a Man's Hand", and a rock riff composed by organist Hugh Banton that he later said was influenced by The Move's [...] "Brontosaurus". The lyrics referred to a shark in the ocean, who becomes lonely through killing everything. [...] "Killer" [...] quickly became a live favourite with fans, and the group's signature track.|$|E

500|$|When she was {{six years}} <b>old,</b> <b>Song</b> moved with her mother to Los Angeles, California, to support her acting career; {{the rest of the}} family {{followed}} two years later. As a young girl, Song wanted to do ballet, while her younger brother wanted to take taekwondo. She said, [...] "My mom only wanted to take us to one place," [...] so they settled on taekwondo. Although Song cried all the way through her first class, she now holds a black belt in taekwondo. Song was named an All-American Scholar in the ninth grade. She was homeschooled and earned a high school diploma at age 16, then took courses at a community college and online from the University of California, Berkeley, with a major in psychology and a minor in business.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} were {{inspired}} by 1960s and 1970s rock bands. [...] "Between the Lines" [...] was written with The Animals, The Zombies and Paul Revere & the Raiders in mind, and Weiland considered [...] "Cinnamon" [...] to {{be a combination of}} 1960s British pop and Ian Curtis (of Joy Division). [...] "Huckleberry Crumble" [...] was inspired by Aerosmith, specifically [...] "Same <b>Old</b> <b>Song</b> and Dance". Dean admitted to the similarities: [...] "The arrangement is almost the same: riff, solo, verse, chorus, solo, back to a second verse—it's pretty much the same setup." [...] He also noted how the song sounded different {{depending on the type of}} instruments used to play it. [...] "It's amazing how, if you were to present that opening riff on a Tele really clean, it's almost a country riff. But if you present it with a Les Paul through a Marshall, it takes on this whole different thing." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, Madonna said, [...] "I {{wanted to}} throw an <b>old</b> <b>song</b> for fun, and 'Holiday' {{seemed to be}} a {{universal}} favourite. In addition to that it's one of the only old songs I've done that I can still sing and not feel I've totally outgrown it." [...] Performing it {{as a part of the}} encore, Madonna appeared on the stage in a polka-dotted blouse with matching flounces at the bottom of white trousers and hair in a top knot with a ponytail. The costume was adopted from a My Fair Lady dress and was designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier. Three different performances are found in the Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90 VHS, the Blond Ambition World Tour Live VHS and the [...] documentary. The performance included in the documentary was used as a music video to promote it. The performance received four nominations at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Female Video, Best Dance Video, Best Choreography in Video and Best Cinematography in Video, but did not win any of the categories.|$|E

Randy Bachman and Fred Turner, known for their rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, made an {{appearance}} in the episode as themselves. They perform on stage at the state fair during {{the beginning of the}} episode. When Bachman and Turner tell the audience {{that they are going to}} play some songs from their new album, Homer immediately yells out demands for them to play their <b>old</b> <b>song</b> [...] "Takin' Care of Business". The band starts the song and Homer then yells, [...] "Get to the 'workin overtime' part!" [...] The band obliges, skipping straight to the chorus. Bachman had left the band when [...] "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] was recorded and because of tension between him and Turner, the two recorded their lines separately on different occasions. Long has said that the Simpsons staff members [...] "were thrilled to have [...] on the show" [...] and that the pair [...] "could not have been nicer." ...|$|E
500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode {{were given a}} mostly positive reception by reviewers. Rachel and Blaine's duet of [...] "Don't You Want Me" [...] was called [...] "the best number of the episode" [...] by VanDerWerff. Semigran went further {{and said it was}} the [...] "best number by far", and Hankinson went beyond that: [...] "it may be one of my favorite Gleeformances of all time". Futterman called it [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "flirty", and noted that [...] "it pits Glee most well-rounded pop vocalists against each other". Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times and Gonzalez both gave the performance an [...] "A"; Benigno wrote that [...] "it sounds like a modernized version of an <b>old</b> <b>song</b> and it totally, 1000% works", and Gonzalez declared that [...] "Blaine needs to join New Directions so we can get more duets between him and Rachel". Harper, while she characterized it as a [...] "really cute duet", said she was [...] "not super-keen on seeing them pair up again". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair was even less enthusiastic, and gave it two stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles from The New York Times {{believed}} that [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] {{was able to}} raise sentiments likened by other people and was prone to introspection, unlike other Madonna tunes. Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club considered the song [...] "emotionally resonant", but characterized {{the introduction of a}} choir as [...] "busy". Instead of praising [...] "Nothing Fails", Chuck Taylor from Billboard said that the song [...] "illustrates everything that makes [...] a grind". Ben Ratliff from Rolling Stone compared it negatively to [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and commented it is much closer to what she's become good at: the idea of transfiguration through love, declaring that the difference in 2003 is she doesn't have the ambition. Stylus Magazine also compared it negatively to [...] "Like a Prayer", calling it [...] "an off-hand denouncement of religion" [...] and stating that [...] "the same <b>old</b> <b>song,</b> over 10 years later, just doesn't cut it anymore". Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times found the lyric [...] "I'm not religious" [...] to be [...] "confusing and befuddling", as Madonna references Jesus Christ and Satan in other songs on the album.|$|E

500|$|Aerosmith {{signed with}} Columbia in mid-1972 for a {{reported}} $125,000 and issued their debut album, Aerosmith. Released in January 1973, the album peaked at number 166. The album was straightforward {{rock and roll}} with well-defined blues influences, {{laying the groundwork for}} Aerosmith's signature blues rock sound. Although the highest-charting single from the album was [...] "Dream On" [...] at number 59, several tracks, such as [...] "Mama Kin" [...] and [...] "Walkin' the Dog", would become staples of the band's live shows and receive airplay on rock radio. The album reached gold status initially, eventually went on to sell two million copies, and was certified double platinum after the band reached mainstream success over a decade later. After constant touring, the band released their second album Get Your Wings in 1974, the first of a string of multi-platinum albums produced by Jack Douglas. This album included the rock radio hits [...] "Same <b>Old</b> <b>Song</b> and Dance" [...] and [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'", a cover done previously by the Yardbirds. The album also contained several fan favorites including [...] "Lord of the Thighs", [...] "Seasons of Wither", and [...] "S.O.S. (Too Bad)", darker songs that have become staples in the band's live shows. To date, Get Your Wings has sold three million copies.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Guitar Hero: Aerosmith came about during the {{development}} of Guitar Hero III. Originally, a cover version of [...] "Same <b>Old</b> <b>Song</b> and Dance" [...] was present in the game, but Neversoft president Joel Jewett noted {{that the quality of}} the recording was poor. After getting in contact with Joe Perry, Perry was able to provide the original masters for the song, and, according to Neversoft developer Alan Flores, [...] "that sort of established the relationship." [...] This also came at a time where Activision was attempting to expand the Guitar Hero franchise, and fans expressed a strong interest in playing a game focused solely on Aerosmith's works, according to RedOctane's Dusty Welch. Another producer for the game, Aaron Habibipour, stated that Aerosmith was one of the five [...] "holy grail" [...] musical groups as polled by Activision. Newsweek reported that Aerosmith's license allows for exclusive use of their songs within the Guitar Hero series for a limited amount of time, preventing their use within other rhythm games such as Rock Band. This {{is not the first time}} Aerosmith has appeared in a video game. The band was previously featured in both Quest for Fame and Revolution X.|$|E
500|$|The {{track that}} {{underwent}} {{the most extensive}} change was [...] "I Miss You", an <b>old</b> <b>song</b> from the Debut era, {{the result of the}} input of Howie Bernstein (a protégé of Hooper and an aspiring programmer), who gave the song its [...] "Latin-tinged [...] ". Back in London, Björk contacted [...] "old standby" [...] Talvin Singh to record additional percussion parts for it. Fellow former Sugarcubes member Einar Örn Benediktsson was also contacted to play the trumpet on [...] "Enjoy". Renowned English sessionist Gary Barnacle was enlisted to play the saxophone. Although he had not been involved in music for a long time, Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato immediately agreed to participate on the album at Björk's request. The singer decided to contact him after being impressed by his arrangements of a rare Milton Nascimento song called [...] "Travessia". Deodato's presence as composer and conductor [...] "immediately bolstered" [...] "Hyperballad", [...] "You've Been Flirting Again" [...] and [...] "Isobel". This addition of strings, brass and percussion elements gave Post the balance Björk felt her original recordings had lacked. By the time the album was finished in April 1995, the list of co-producers included: Björk, Hooper, Bernstein, Massey, and Tricky. Björk has said: [...] "The people I collaborated with were all people I was hanging out with in clubs in London. I had known them all for a while before we ended up working together." ...|$|E
