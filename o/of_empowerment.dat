5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African American men, who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. African American women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree <b>of</b> <b>empowerment</b> as white women once African American men had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than black male suffrage.|$|E

A combination of thematic and framework analysis was used to integrate and map themes underpinning published definitions <b>of</b> patient <b>empowerment</b> with the views of key UK stakeholders. Results The scoping literature review identified 67 articles that included a definition <b>of</b> patient <b>empowerment.</b> A range <b>of</b> diverse definitions <b>of</b> patient <b>empowerment</b> was extracted. Thematic analysis identified key underpinning themes, and these themes were used to develop an initial coding framework for analysis of interview data. 19 semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders. Transcripts were analysed using the initial coding framework, and findings were used to further develop the conceptual map. The resulting conceptual map describes that patient empowerment can be conceived as a state ranging across a spectrum from low to high levels <b>of</b> patient <b>empowerment,</b> with the level <b>of</b> patient <b>empowerment</b> potentially measurable using a set of indicators. Five key components of the conceptual map were identified: underpinning ethos, moderators, interventions, indicators and outcomes. Relationships with other constructs such as health literacy, self-management and shared decision-making are illustrated in the conceptual map.

25|$|Unger {{sees the}} Christian-Romantic {{tradition}} {{as the one}} tradition that puts the individual {{at the center of}} the world and gives him the tools for the liberation of self and environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to the predicament of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to the defeat of the imagination. Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology <b>of</b> <b>empowerment</b> and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project begins here.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{empowerment}} movements {{that use the}} social action model, aiming for disadvantaged people to become empowered, organized, and educated {{so that they may}} create change. These programs advocate for constructive confrontations to enhance the social power of people who are considered disadvantaged. Another model is the 5C's model that focuses on emphasizing competence, confidence, connection, character and caring. A sixth C of contribution to society was later added. This model focuses primarily on engagement as a key marker of positive youth development, emphasizing the need to foster initiative. Youth-adult partnerships are another type <b>of</b> <b>empowerment</b> method used around the world. This method has been defined as a developmental process and a community practice. The partnership involves people of different ages working together on community issues over a period of time. The method emphasizes reciprocity among adults and youth with a focus on shared decision making and reflective learning. The concept of shared control is key for empowering youth.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is to examine the}} extent <b>of</b> {{employee}} <b>empowerment</b> within Australian manufacturing business units using an adapted version of the Pardo del Val and Lloyd instrument. The paper also examines the influence of organizational (business unit size, training, and link to rewards) and cultural (innovation, team work, and outcome orientation) factors on the extent of adoption <b>of</b> employee <b>empowerment.</b> Design/methodology/approach - Data was collected by survey questionnaire distributed to one business unit within 250 manufacturing organizations. Findings - The results reveal a moderate level <b>of</b> employee <b>empowerment</b> in Australian organizations, with the cultural factor, teamwork, and the organizational factors, training and link to rewards, found to {{have a significant impact on}} the overall level of adoption <b>of</b> employee <b>empowerment.</b> In addition, specific cultural and organizational factors were found to be associated with four different dimensions <b>of</b> employee <b>empowerment</b> (collaboration, formalization, directness, and degree of influence), and the <b>empowerment</b> <b>of</b> employees at three different stages of the decision making process. Practical implications - The Pardo del Val and Lloyd measure provides a means by which organizations can gain an improved insight into their current employee empowerment initiatives and assess the critical preconditions that are most effective in enhancing employee empowerment initiatives. Originality/value - This study confirms the validity of a new measure <b>of</b> employee <b>empowerment.</b> Furthermore, the study provides the first empirical analysis of the association between organizational and cultural factors with the level <b>of</b> employee <b>empowerment</b> as assessed by this measure. 26 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Dot Robinson {{was born}} April 22, 1912 in Australia. James Goulding, Robinson's father, was a {{motorcyclist}} {{who worked as}} a sidecar designer and an amateur racer. When Robinson was about six years old her father moved him and his family to the United States in 1918 in hopes to expand his sidecar designing business. Robinson was almost destined to ride a motorcycle because Robinson's father was into the business and ran a motorcycle dealership, so at a young age Robinson became well acquainted with operating a bike. In high school Dot met her future husband Earl who she would eventually marry in 1931 and together they partook in multiple races. Dot entered herself in a Jack Pine National Endurance Championship in 1934, and by 1940 she won Jack Pine and became known as the first woman to win an AMA national competition. In 1935 Harley-Davidson asked Dot and her high school sweetheart, Earl, to run a dealership. Shortly after Davidson requested they help him by opening a dealership the Robinsons moved to Detroit where they operated a successful Harley-Davidson dealership until 1971. Linda Dugeau and Dot Robinson met in 1940 at the Laconia national and within months the Motor Maids organization was in full motion. Dot was president of the organization and Linda secretary of the organization. The motorcyclist image was always black with leather until Dot Robinson changed the attire allowing women to continue to have their femininity. Robinson was always seen as a very classy lady and she wanted all women who were included in her organization to have the same image. The change Dot made the attire of her organization made a statement <b>of</b> <b>empowerment</b> while still feminine. When the Robinsons retired from the dealership in 1971 they begin to travel together by motorcycle until Earl died I 1996. Even after Dot's husband died she continued to ride and explore until 1998 when a knee replacement slowed her down, and on October 8, 1999 Dot Robinson died at age 87.|$|E
