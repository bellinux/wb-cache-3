5|$|With ultra-violent {{films such}} as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Thirst (2009), Park Chan-wook of South Korea {{has been the most}} {{prominent}} director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium. The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with the odd bit of color. The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Another comic book adaptation with similar style and elements is The Spirit (2008). This film is adapted from the comic book of the same name originally created by cartoonist Will Eisner. Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for Road to Perdition (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and A History of Violence (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film {{of the year in the}} annual Village Voice poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson's Brick (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series Veronica Mars (2004–07) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> generic crossover have been dubbed teen noir.|$|E

An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> lexical distinction is the sign translated 'not yet', which {{requires that the}} tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side, {{in addition to the}} manual part of the sign. Without these features it would be interpreted as 'late'.|$|E

A prominent example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> application is Lowe’s use of CSP and the FDR refinement-checker to discover a previously unknown attack on the Needham-Schroeder public-key authentication protocol, and then to develop a corrected protocol able to defeat the attack.|$|E
25|$|In {{low-level}} languages, {{the concept}} of macros has become synonymous with textual substitution of source-code due to {{the widespread use of}} the C preprocessor. However, high-level languages such as Lisp pre-dated C in their use of macros that were far more powerful. It is this Lisp-like macro concept that Perl 6 will take advantage of. The power <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> macro {{stems from the fact that}} it operates on the program as a high-level data structure, rather than as simple text, and has the full capabilities of the programming language at its disposal.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral {{responses}} to escape predation include burrowing into substrate and being active {{only through a}} restricted period of the day. Furthermore, insects may feign death, a response termed thanatosis. Beetles, particularly weevils, are especially fond <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> acting. Bright colors may also be flashed underneath cryptic ones. A startle display occurs when prey takes advantage of these markings after being discovered by a predator. The striking color pattern, which often includes eyespots, is intended to evoke prompt enemy retreat. Better formed eyespots seem to result in better deterrence.|$|E

Since volumetric data has no limitation regarding {{the shape of the}} object that ordinary mesh algorithms has we can fully reconstruct anything using the Marching cubes algorithm.

25|$|In prehistoric times, chert {{was often}} used as a raw {{material}} {{for the construction of}} stone tools. Like obsidian, as well as some rhyolites, felsites, quartzites, and other tool stones used in lithic reduction, chert fractures in a Hertzian cone when struck with sufficient force. This results in conchoidal fractures, a characteristic of all minerals with no cleavage planes. In this kind of fracture, a cone of force propagates through the material from the point of impact, eventually removing a full or partial cone; this result is familiar to anyone who has seen what happens to a plate-glass window when struck by a small object, such as an air gun projectile. The partial Hertzian cones produced during lithic reduction are called flakes, and exhibit features characteristic <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> breakage, including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures, which are small secondary flakes detached from the flake's bulb of force.|$|E

[...] The two forces met near the Flint River when the Apalachee made a predawn attack on the Apalachicola camp. [...] Anticipating the possibility <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> attack, Dodsworth and the Apalachicolas had arranged their blankets to appear occupied and concealed themselves near the camp. [...] When the Apalachee attacked the false camp, the Apalachicolas fell upon them. [...] With the superiority of their weapons, the British-supported Indians routed the Spanish force. [...] Uriza was reported to have only 300 men when he returned to Apalachee.|$|E
500|$|Commodity fetishism {{provides}} an example of what Engels called [...] "false consciousness", which relates closely to the understanding of ideology. By [...] "ideology", Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which contemporaries see as universal and eternal. Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths, as they serve an important political function. Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production includes not only the production of food or manufactured goods and it includes the production of ideas as well (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to their own interests). An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> analysis is Marx's understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface to his 1843 Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right: ...|$|E

500|$|Developed {{over the}} years 1926–1929 at Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) at Langley Field in Virginia, a forward-looking {{doctrine}} of daylight precision bombing was promulgated by four instructors who argued that an enemy's army and navy could be defeated intact due {{to the destruction of}} industrial and military targets deep within enemy-held territory. This theory was first espoused by Italian General Giulio Douhet, though his ideas included the terror bombing of population centers that the American theorists eschewed. In contrast, American theorists devised a strategy of pin-point bombing that targeted the enemy economy and the production of weapons. Though unproven, the major attraction <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> strategic bombing doctrine was that a war was expected to be won relatively quickly, with minimal casualties, and that grinding, static trench warfare as seen in World War I could be avoided. In November 1932 when British Lord President of the Council Stanley Baldwin said [...] "the bomber will always get through", {{he was talking about the}} terror bombing of cities. The US Bomber Mafia agreed with Baldwin only in that the bomber would prevail in its mission. They intended the mission to be against military and industrial targets, not populations.|$|E

Siriol Hugh-Jones wrote for The Times Literary Supplement, [...] "The Phantom Tollbooth is something every adult seems sure will turn into a modern Alice... The obvious {{guess is that the}} appeal <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> writing is directed towards just the sort of adults who derive a perfectly grown-up pleasure from regularly rereading the Alices. As one might expect, it is illustrated by every grown-up's favourite child-like pictures with the built-in sad sophistication, the work of Jules Feiffer." [...] Jennifer Bourdillon reviewed it for The Listener, [...] "This is the story of an imaginary journey, a sort of Pilgrim's Progress of a little boy in his car... One would hardly have thought from the sound of this that it would have so magnetic an appeal, but the brilliant verbal humour and the weird and wonderful characters (the Dodecahedron. the Watchdog, Faintly Macabre) make it that rare delight, a book which parents and children can share." [...] It reached Australia in 1963; The Canberra Times reviewer, J.E.B., deemed it memorable, causing readers to quote from it and leaf through its pages again.|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} Liberal leadership, Macdonald {{travelled}} the province on speaking tours helping organize party support in every constituency. As Liberal leader, he {{proved to be}} an effective platform speaker. According to biographer John Hawkins, Macdonald's [...] "plain talk and simplicity" [...] persuaded audiences of his honesty. He developed the ability to explain political issues with a [...] "clarity that every voter could understand". When the legislature was in session, he led the Liberals from the public galleries because he had no seat in the House. There were six vacancies, but the Conservatives refused to call by-elections fearing they would lose their five-seat majority. Macdonald publicly criticized Premier Gordon Harrington for depriving so many Nova Scotians of representation. He deplored what he called [...] "the loss of responsible government." [...] It was a message that struck a chord in the province that had been the first in Canada to achieve responsible government in 1848 thanks to the efforts of the great liberal Reformer Joseph Howe. Privately however, Macdonald rejoiced that the government couldn't risk calling a by-election telling one supporter years later, [...] "If the truth must be told, I was sometimes afraid that they would open up a seat and deprive me <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> ammunition".|$|E

2500|$|The first {{practical}} example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird.

However, Baird {{was not happy}} with the design, and as early as 1944 had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.|$|E
2500|$|In English cricket {{since the}} first half of the 18th century, various ad hoc teams have been formed for {{short-term}} purposes which have been called England (or sometimes [...] "All-England"; i.e., in the sense of [...] "the rest of England") to play against, say, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) or an individual county team. The key factor is that they were non-international and there is a significant difference between them and the official England cricket team which takes part in international fixtures. Conceptually, there is evidence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> team being formed, or at least mooted, since the 1730s.

2500|$|Sometimes {{the stops}} were dropped immediately, but on many {{occasions}} the G-cars would circle the scene several times [...] before the operational commander made his final decisions. Very often the K-car occupants would spot the enemy, and then the Helicopter Gunner/Technician would attack them with his 20mm cannon, using short bursts of fire. The accuracy <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> fire was extraordinary, due to the helicopter flying in tight counter-clockwise circles {{just a few hundred}} feet above the ground. The 20mm cannon poked out of the port side, thus there was no [...] "lead in", and the exploding high velocity shells would impact right next to and often on their intended targets. Very few persons were ever found alive after being hit by fire from the 20mm cannon.|$|E
