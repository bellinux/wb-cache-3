50|$|In {{accounts}} payable, {{a simple}} mistake {{can cause a}} large overpayment. A common example involves duplicate invoices. An invoice may be temporarily misplaced or still in the approval status when the vendors calls to inquire into its payment status. After the A/P staff member looks it up and finds {{it has not been}} paid, the vendor sends a duplicate invoice; meanwhile the <b>original</b> <b>invoice</b> shows up and gets paid. Then the duplicate invoice arrives and inadvertently gets paid as well, perhaps under a slightly different invoice.|$|E

50|$|Over the decades, the House of Chaumet has {{designed}} hundreds of items of jewellery or original editions that have acquired heritage or historical status. From the 1970s, {{the house has}} been involved in an initiative to give its pieces their true worth in terms of aesthetic and historical value. This aim came to fruition with the creation of a museum in 1980 under the impetus of Béatrice de Plinval. The museum’s archives contain 200 items of jewellery, 19,800 <b>original</b> <b>invoices,</b> 80,000 drawings, 2,500 diadems and replicas of diadems in nickel silver - hundreds of which have been created since 1780. The museum is not open to the public but regularly organises events or exhibitions based on its collections.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the dates}} [...] "1797 and 1897" [...] on the Egg, {{for many years}} the Pelican Egg was {{ascribed}} to 1897, but when the <b>original</b> Fabergé <b>invoice</b> was found it showed that this Egg was presented to Maria Feodorovna for Easter 1898.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2010, an Apple I {{sold for}} £133,250 ($210,000) at Christie's auction house in London. The high price was {{likely due to}} the rare {{documents}} and packaging offered in the sale {{in addition to the}} computer, including the original packaging (with the return label showing Steve Jobs' parents' address, the original Apple Computer Inc 'headquarters' being their garage), a personally typed and signed letter from Jobs (answering technical questions about the computer), and the <b>original</b> <b>invoice</b> showing 'Steven' as the salesman. The computer was brought to Polytechnic University of Turin where it was fixed and used to run the BASIC programming language.|$|E
50|$|For {{transactions}} {{where the}} <b>original</b> <b>invoice</b> {{was signed by}} the consumer, the merchant may dispute a chargeback {{with the assistance of}} the merchant's acquiring bank. The acquirer and issuer mediate in the dispute process, following rules set forth by the corresponding bank network or card association. If the acquirer prevails in the dispute, the funds are returned to the acquirer, and then to the merchant. Only 21% of chargebacks lodged globally are decided in favour of the merchant. The 2014 Cybersource Fraud Benchmark Report found that only 60% of chargebacks are disputed by merchants, and that merchants have a success rate of about 41% with those they do re-present.|$|E
50|$|A {{credit note}} lists the products, {{quantities}} and agreed prices for {{products or services}} the seller provided the buyer, but the buyer returned or did not receive. It may be issued {{in the case of}} damaged goods, errors or allowances. In respect of the previously issued invoice, a Credit Memo will reduce or eliminate the amount the buyer has to pay. Note: A Credit Memo is not to be substituted as a formal document. The Credit Memo rarely contains: PO #, Date, Billing Address, Shipping Address, Terms of Payment, List of products with quantities and prices. Usually it references the <b>original</b> <b>Invoice</b> and sometimes states the reason for issue.|$|E

40|$|The Productivity Commission’s {{inquiry report}} into ‘Tasmanian Freight Subsidy Arrangements’ was tabled in Parliament in May 2007. The Commission {{was asked to}} report on {{arrangements}} for subsidising containerised and bulk shipping between the mainland and Tasmania and to recommend an appropriate future approach and/or arrangements. The Commission found that the current arrangements do not operate as intended. Different ways of claiming rebates for the same freight task can result in different TFES (Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme) payments. This can lead to overestimated freight costs and result in higher than appropriate rebates. The Commission recommended that rebates be based on <b>original</b> <b>invoices</b> from carriers that include a specific wharf-towharf charge. The Commission also recommended that wheat no longer be eligible for assistance under the TFES. The TWFS (the freight equalisation scheme for wheat) would pay {{the same level of}} assistance per tonne to wheat shipped in containers and in bulk, with assistance based on the disadvantage of the least cost method of shipping (plus intermodal costs, less a rail freight equivalent cost). bulk shipping, container shipping, Freight costs, Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme, Tasmanian Wheat Freight Scheme...|$|R

50|$|Scandrett {{named the}} farm Lisadian after his {{hometown}} in Ireland and gradually brought it into production. In the 1870s, a Norfolk pine, which as of 2011 is still {{growing on the}} park, and oak trees, gifts from Sir George Grey were planted on the property. At first, the family lived in a wooden house on the farm before moving into the present concrete house which was built around 1885 and is made of an early type of concrete instead of kauri timber. The <b>original</b> <b>invoice</b> for the house was discovered and is being preserved by the council with a copy {{on display at the}} farm.

5000|$|After the October Revolution the egg was {{acquired}} by the Rumyantsev Museum in Moscow. It disappeared once again after the museum closed in January 1927 and was presumed lost. In 1999 Fabergé's great-granddaughter Tatiana published drawings of the designs for the Birch and Constellation Eggs, but {{it was assumed that}} they were both incomplete. The Birch Egg publicly reappeared in 2001 when a private collector from the United Kingdom, the descendant of Russian emigrants, sold it to Alexander Ivanov, the Moscow collector who owns the Faberge Museum in Baden-Baden. The complete purchase, which cost the museum [...] "millions of dollars", consisted of the egg itself, the case, the wind-up key for the surprise, Fabergé's <b>original</b> <b>invoice</b> to Nicholas II, and a letter from Fabergé to Alexander Kerensky complaining about not being paid and asking that the egg be delivered. The [...] "surprise" [...] itself was not in the collector's possession and was likely stolen by soldiers during the October Revolution.|$|E
5000|$|On April 18, 2010, a blue {{prototype}} Spirit II (double-humbucker) XPL originally sold to Chris Hayes of Huey Lewis's News fame {{was sold}} on eBay. The auction included the <b>original</b> Gibson <b>invoice</b> with Hayes's name and shipping address, {{as well as}} a letter of appraisal from vintage guitar expert George Gruhn. The guitar's humbuckers had been changed to rail types, and the tremolo system was a floating Kahler style that used standard Gibson adjustable bridge posts, rather than the production Flyer tremolo that mounts to the body with a trim ring. A coil-tap switch had also been added amongst the guitar's standard controls.

5000|$|The {{name of the}} egg {{refers to}} the fact that it was made in the Empire Style, from nephrite. The <b>original</b> Fabergé <b>invoice</b> reads: [...] "Egg, [...] "Empire", from nephrite, with gold, two {{diamonds}} and miniature". The egg reappeared in the mid-1990s and some Fabergé researchers were the mistaken opinion that this egg was decorated with a medallion portrait of Alexander III of Russia, though the original bill did not refer to a portrait of Alexander III. This mistake was result of a misinterpretation of the Moscow Armory Chamber valuables selection list. This list noted an [...] "Egg from nephrite, on a golden base, and with portrait of the Emperor Alexander III in a medallion". Because of this, many researchers were certain, that the 1902 Imperial egg featured an Alexander III portrait, though there is no evidence to support that.|$|R
50|$|Carbonless {{copy paper}} was first {{produced}} by the NCR Corporation. Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use carbon paper, which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the copy. Carbonless paper was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the <b>original,</b> such as <b>invoices</b> and receipts. The copies were often paper of different colors (e.g. white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with carbonless copy paper can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as continuous stationery for printers designed to use it.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a company}} decides to factors account {{receivables}} invoices to a principles factors or broker, {{it needs to}} understands the risks and rewards involved with factoring. Amount of funding can {{vary depending on the}} specific accounts receivables, debtor and industry that factoring occurs in. Factors can limit and restrict funding in such occasions where the debtor is found not credit worthy, or the invoice amount represents too big of a portion of the business' annual income. Another area of concern is when the cost of invoice factoring is calculated. It's a compound of an administration charge and interest earned overtime as the debtor takes time to repay the <b>original</b> <b>invoice.</b> Not all factoring companies charge interest over {{the time it takes to}} collect from a debtor, in this case only the administration charge needs to be taken into account although this type of facility is comparatively rare.

Millennia of erosion had balanced it so finely that one person could move it easily. In 1824, a group of sailors led by Lieutenant Hugh Calville Goldsmith, nephew of the poet Oliver Goldsmith, and the worse for drink climbed up to Logan Rock armed with crowbars and dislodged it, allowing it to fall down the cliff. Such was the disgust of the local people at this blatant act of vandalism, that they complained to the Admiralty and Goldsmith was ordered to replace the rock at his own expense. It took seven months, 60 labourers and cost Goldsmith £130 8s d at 1824 prices (...) to replace it.

2500|$|... 1969 Chevelles were {{billed as}} [...] "America's most popular {{mid-size}} car." [...] They showed only minor changes for 1969, led by revised front-end styling. A single chrome bar connected quad headlights (which became a familiar Chevrolet trademark with its concurrent light duty pickup trucks) with a revised front grille, now cast in ABS plastic, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. Taillight lenses were {{larger and more}} vertical, flowing into the quarter panels. Front vent windows (hardtop and convertibles only) began to fade away now that Astro Ventilation (first introduced on the 1966 Buick Riviera which was used a year earlier on the Camaro and Caprice) was sending outside air into several Chevelle models. The Chevelle lineup slimmed down to Nomad, 300 Deluxe/Greenbrier, Malibu/Concours, and Concours Estate series, and the base 300 series was history.
