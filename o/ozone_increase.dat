Data over the South Pole from ozone sondes confirm the increase. A similar <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> is produced in a chemistry climate model that allows feedback between constituent changes and the stratospheric circulation through radiative heating. A simulation that excludes the radiative coupling between predicted ozone and the circulation does not capture this <b>ozone</b> <b>increase.</b> We show that the <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> in our model simulations {{is caused by a}} dynamical feedback in response to the changes in the stratospheric wind fields forced by the radiative perturbation associated with the Antarctic ozone hole...|$|E

Using the currently a~pted reaction rate coefficients, we find that this upper tropospheric ozone source may be significantly larger than the direct injection of ozone from the stratosphere. Many features of the observed tropospheric temporal and spatial ozone distributions appear to be better explained by this upper tropospheric ozone source hypothesis than by either the classical 'dynamical control ' or 'photochemical control ' hypotheses. In addition, we find that NOx emissions from high flying subsonic aircraft in the northern hemisphere may cause an <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> in the troposphere.

40|$|In {{this second}} {{part of a series}} of two papers which aim to study the local impact of deep {{convection}} on the chemical composition of the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (UTLS), we focus on ozone simulation results using a mesoscale model that includes on-line chemistry. A severe convective system observed on 8 February 2001 at Bauru, Brazil, is studied. This unorganised convective system is composed of several convective cells that interact with each other. We show that there is an increase in the ozone concentration in the tropical transitional layer (TTL) in the model during this event, which is compatible with ozone sonde observations from Bauru during the 2004 convective season. The model horizontal variability of ozone in this layer is comparable with the variability of the ozone sonde observations in the same area. The calculation of the ozone budget in the TTL during a 24 h period {{in the area of the}} convective system shows that the ozone behaviour in this layer is mainly driven by dynamics. The horizontal flux at a specific time is the main contribution in the budget, since it drives the sign and the magnitude of the total ozone flux. However, when averaged over the 24 h period, the horizontal flux is smaller than the vertical fluxes, and leads to a net decrease of ozone molecule number of 23 %. The upward motions at the bottom of the TTL, related to the convection activity is the main contributor to the budget over the 24 h period since it can explain 70 % of the total <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> in the TTL, while the chemical ozone production inside the TTL is estimated to be 29 % of the <b>ozone</b> <b>increase,</b> if NO x production by lightning (LNO x) is taken into account. It is shown that downward motion at the tropopause induced by gravity waves generated by deep convection is non negligible in the TTL ozone budget, since it represents 24 % of the <b>ozone</b> <b>increase.</b> The flux analysis shows the importance of the vertical contributions during the life time of the convective event (about 8 h). The TTL ozone is driven out of the domain horizontally by the convective outflow during this period, limiting the <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> in this layer...|$|E

Consequently, reactive nitrogen species produced from N 2 O and reactive hydrogen species produced from CH 4 are expected to play an increasingly important role in determining stratospheric ozone concentrations. Eight chemistry-climate model simulations were performed to assess the sensitivity of stratospheric ozone to different emissions scenarios for N 2 O and CH 4. Global-mean total column <b>ozone</b> <b>increases</b> through the 21 st century in all eight simulations {{as a result of}} CO 2 -induced stratospheric cooling and decreasing stratospheric halogen concentrations.

In the simulation with the largest N 2 O increase, global-mean total column <b>ozone</b> <b>increased</b> by 4. 3 DU through the 21 st century, compared with 10. 0 DU in the simulation with the smallest N 2 O increase.

When energy transfer rate constants {{similar to those of}} Toumi et al.

There was no distinguishable radical signal on any of the cloudy days, whereas there was a clear diurnal variation, maximizing in the mid afternoon on sunny days.

Anthropogenic ozone precursor emissions decreased over Europe and North America {{since the early}} 1990 s. However, ozone concentrations at JFJ over the 19 year period show significant positive trends in the 1990 s and no significant trends after 1999. Ozone trends were further studied with respect to air mass origin using 20 day back trajectories. The <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> during winter was particularly large in air masses with recent contact with the European planetary boundary layer (PBL), most probably {{in response to the}} steady decrease in European NO emissions leading to less ozone titration.

Ozone from all source regions other than European PBL has a similar temporal pattern, exhibiting an increase for about the first 10 years, then leveling off to either no trend or insignificant decrease.

40|$|Interannual {{variability}} {{and long-term}} trends of tropospheric ozone are both {{of environmental and}} climate concerns. Ozone measured at Mt. Waliguan Observatory (WLG, 3816  m asl) on the Tibetan Plateau over the period 19947 ndash; 2013 has increased significantly by 0. 2 – 0. 3  ppbv year - 1 during spring and autumn, but shows a much smaller trend in winter and no significant trend in summer. Here we explore the factors driving the observed ozone changes at WLG using backward trajectory analysis, chemistry-climate model hindcast simulations (GFDL-AM 3), a trajectory-mapped ozonesonde dataset and various climate indices. A stratospheric ozone tracer implemented in GFDL-AM 3 indicates that stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) can explain ~  70  % of the observed springtime <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> at WLG, consistent {{with an increase in}} the NW air mass frequency inferred from the trajectory analysis. Enhanced STT associated with the strengthening of the mid-latitude jet stream contributes to the observed high-ozone anomalies at WLG during the springs of 1999 and 2012. During autumn, observations at WLG are more heavily influenced by polluted air masses originated from Southeast Asia than in the other seasons. Rising Asian anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors is the key driver of increasing autumnal ozone observed at WLG, as supported by the GFDL-AM 3 model with time-varying emissions, which captures the observed <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> (0. 26  ±  0. 11  ppbv year - 1). AM 3 simulates a greater <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> of 0. 38  ±  0. 11  ppbv year - 1 at WLG in autumn under conditions with strong transport from Southeast Asia and shows no significant ozone trend in autumn when anthropogenic emissions are held constant in time. During summer, WLG is mostly influenced by easterly air masses but these trajectories do not extend to the polluted regions of eastern China and have decreased significantly over the last two decades, which likely explains why summertime ozone measured at WLG shows no significant trend despite ozone increases in Eastern China. Analysis of the Trajectory-mapped Ozonesonde dataset for the Stratosphere and Troposphere (TOST) and trajectory residence time reveals increases in direct ozone transport from the eastern sector during autumn, which adds to the autumnal <b>ozone</b> <b>increase.</b> We further examine the links of ozone variability at WLG to the QBO, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the sunspot cycle.

The environmental effects of enhanced air traffic along polar routes and of possible changes in cruising altitude are investigated, taking into account effects of flight route changes on fuel consumption and emissions. In a reference case including both civil and military aircraft the model predicts aircraft-induced maximum increases of zonal-mean NO y (=total reactive nitrogen) between 156 pptv (August) and 322 pptv (May) in the tropopause region of the Northern Hemisphere. Resulting maximum <b>increases</b> in zonal-mean <b>ozone</b> vary between 3. 1 ppbv in September and 7. 7 ppbv in June.

There are some substantial differences between the sondes and other data, particularly in the early 1990 s. The alpine and aircraft data show that <b>ozone</b> <b>increased</b> from late 1994 until 1998, but the sonde data do not. Time series of differences in ozone between pairs of locations reveal inconsistencies in various data sets.

The comparison shows systematic differences between all satellites and SAOZ TOC of different amplitude between the stations although the instruments and the data processing are identical. Indeed, the SAOZ TOC is always larger in Bauru and the difference SAT-SAOZ displays a seasonal variation of larger amplitude there than in Reunion.

Despite the decreased amounts of ozone, the planet orbiting the K 2 star would have a visible O_ 3 spectral signature {{as a result of the}} temperature contrast between the surface and the atmosphere. However, the planet orbiting the F 9 star would have no distinguishable ozone spectral signature, despite the planet’s higher atmospheric ozone levels.|$|R

Low level winds transported the forest fire plume towards Santiago causing a striking decrease in visibility and a marked increase in the concentration of both primary (PM 10 and CO) and secondary (Ozone) pollutants in the urban atmosphere. In particular, ozone maximum concentrations in the Santiago basin reached hourly averages well above 80 ppb, the national air quality standard. This <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> took place at the three sampling sites considered in the present study. These large values can be explained in terms of high NOx concentrations and NO 2 /NO ratios in biomass burning emissions. FONDAP 	 1511000...|$|E
40|$|Total ozone {{trends are}} {{typically}} studied using linear regression models that assume a first-order autoregression of the residuals [so-called AR(1) models]. We consider total ozone time series over 60 °S– 60 °N from 1979 to 2005 {{and show that}} most latitude bands exhibit long-range correlated (LRC) behavior, meaning that ozone autocorrelation functions decay by a power law rather than exponentially as in AR(1). At such latitudes the uncertainties of total ozone trends are greater than those obtained from AR(1) models and the expected time required to detect ozone recovery correspondingly longer. We find no evidence of LRC behavior in southern middle-and high-subpolar latitudes (45 °– 60 °S), where the long-term ozone decline attributable to anthropogenic chlorine is the greatest. We thus confirm an earlier prediction based on an AR(1) analysis that this region (especially the highest latitudes, and especially the South Atlantic) is the optimal location {{for the detection of}} ozone recovery, with a statistically significant <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> attributable to chlorine likely to be detectable {{by the end of the}} next decade. In northern middle and high latitudes, on the other hand, there is clear evidence of LRC behavior. This increases the uncertainties on the long-term trend attributable to anthropogenic chlorine by about a factor of 1. 5 and lengthens the expected time to detect ozone recovery by a similar amount (from ∼ 2030 to ∼ 2045). If the long-term changes in ozone are instead fit by a piecewise-linear trend rather than by stratospheric chlorine loading, then the strong decrease of northern middle- and high-latitude ozone during the first half of the 1990 s and its subsequent increase in the second half of the 1990 s projects more strongly on the trend and makes a smaller contribution to the noise. This both increases the trend and weakens the LRC behavior at these latitudes, to the extent that ozone recovery (according to this model, and in the sense of a statistically significant <b>ozone</b> <b>increase)</b> is already on the verge of being detected. The implications of this rather controversial interpretation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The future {{evolution}} of tropical ozone {{in a changing}} climate is investigated by analysing time slice simulations made with the chemistry–climate model EMAC. Between {{the present and the}} end of the 21 st century a significant increase in ozone is found globally for the upper stratosphere and the extratropical lower stratosphere, while in the tropical lower stratosphere ozone decreases significantly by up to 30 %. Previous studies have shown that this decrease is connected to changes in tropical upwelling. Here the dominant role of transport for the future ozone decrease is confirmed, but it is found that in addition changes in chemical ozone production and destruction do contribute to the ozone changes in the tropical lower stratosphere. Between 50 and 30 hPa the dynamically induced ozone decrease of up to 22 % is amplified by 11 – 19 % due to a reduced ozone production. This is counteracted by a decrease in the ozone loss causing an <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> by 15 – 28 %. At 70 hPa the large ozone decrease due to transport (− 52 %) is reduced by an enhanced photochemical ozone production (+ 28 %) but slightly increased (− 5 %) due to an enhanced ozone loss. It is found that the increase in the ozone production in the lowermost stratosphere is mainly due to a transport induced decrease in the overlying ozone column while at higher altitudes the ozone production decreases as a consequence of a chemically induced increase in the overlying ozone column. The <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> that is attributed to changes in ozone loss between 50 and 30 hPa is mainly caused by a slowing of the ClO x and NO x loss cycles. The enhanced ozone destruction below 70 hPa can be attributed to an increased efficiency of the HO x loss cycle. The role of ozone transport in determining the ozone trend in this region is found to depend on the changes in the net production as a reduced net production also reduces the amount of ozone that can be transported within an air parcel...|$|E
40|$|In {{this short}} note, {{the effect of}} {{enhanced}} circulation due to doubling CO 2 on ozone is investigated. The difference of Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC) between the doubled CO 2 and control run from an idealized atmospheric general circulation model {{is added to the}} BDC climatology derived from National Centers for Environmental Prediction—Department of Energy Reanalysis 2 (NCEP 2) from 1979 to 2002. Then it is used to drive the California Institute of Technology/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech/JPL) two-dimensional chemistry and transport model. The results reveal that the total <b>ozone</b> <b>increases</b> by 7 and 3. 5 Dobson units (DU) in the high latitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively, and decreases by 4 DU in the Tropics {{as a result of the}} increase in BDC associated with doubled CO 2. If the change of eddy mixing coefficients after doubling CO 2 is also considered, the total <b>ozone</b> will <b>increase</b> by 6. 5 and 3 DU in the high latitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres after combining both effects from the change in BDC and eddy mixing coefficients.

40|$|Dynamical {{downscaling}} {{was applied}} {{in this study}} to link the global climate–chemistry model Community Atmosphere Model (CAM-Chem) with the regional models: Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model and Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ). Two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5) were {{used to evaluate the}} climate impact on ozone concentrations in 2050 s. Ozone concentrations in the lower-mid troposphere (surface to ~ 300 hPa), from mid- to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), show decreasing trends in RCP 4. 5 between 2000 s and 2050 s, with the largest decrease of 4 – 10 ppbv occurring in the summer and the fall; and increasing trends (2 – 12 ppbv) in RCP 8. 5 resulting from the increased methane emissions. In RCP 8. 5, methane emissions increase by ~ 60 % by the end of 2050 s, accounting for more than 90 % of <b>ozone</b> <b>increases</b> in summer and fall, and 60 – 80 % in spring and winter. Under the RCP 4. 5 scenario, in the summer when photochemical reactions are the most active, the large ozone precursor emissions reduction leads to the greatest decrease of downscaled surface ozone concentrations, ranging from 6 to 10 ppbv. However, a few major cities show <b>ozone</b> <b>increases</b> of 3 to 7 ppbv due to weakened NO titration. Under the RCP 8. 5 scenario, in winter, downscaled <b>ozone</b> concentrations <b>increase</b> across nearly the entire continental US in winter, ranging from 3 to 10 ppbv due to increased methane emissions and enhanced stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE). More intense heat waves are projected to occur by the end of 2050 s in RCP 8. 5, leading to more than 8 ppbv of the maximum daily 8 h daily average (MDA 8) ozone during the heat wave days than other days; this indicates the dramatic impact heat waves exert on high frequency ozone events...|$|R
