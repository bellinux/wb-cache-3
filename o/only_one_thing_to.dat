6000|$|... "And by God there's {{the empty}} {{cartridge}} he done it with!" [...] was Blackbeard's discovery. [...] "Boys, there's <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do--" ...|$|E
60|$|Objects to {{be aimed}} at, in the General Arrangements. Systematising the teacher's work. Necessity of having <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> attend to at a time.|$|E
60|$|There was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do--turn and fly--and this we did, heading whither we knew not, but {{managing}} to keep touch of each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{show them}} nothing," [...] {{interrupted}} Christie decidedly. [...] "In our place there's <b>only</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do. Where is this--Whiskey Dick?" ...|$|R
60|$|Guy {{turned on}} his heel and left the house. There was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> left <b>to</b> be done, {{although}} he hated doing it. He went {{to the office of}} a private detective.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> wanting <b>to</b> {{make this}} the {{greatest}} {{day of my}} life, but without it all the rest counts for nothing. You know what it is," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do;" [...] thought Rob, [...] "and that's to walk {{straight}} in, as I haven't {{any friends}} {{to give me}} a regular introduction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Done?" [...] {{said the}} Principal One. [...] "There is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done, {{and that is}} to wash her. There can be no doubt about that." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY CICELY. Oh, I see you're {{one of the}} Idealists--the Impossibilists! We have them, too, occasionally, in our world. There's <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be {{done with}} them.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{possible}} <b>to</b> make, [...] That is, assuming--that she {{has gone}} out. [...] Of course she hasn't though." [...] They both sat down [...] Helpless. [...] "There's {{nothing we can do}} till morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “And now,” he said, {{taking her}} hand, “I <b>only</b> need <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} my happiness, and that is, {{that you will}} share my good fortune with me. May I {{hope that it will}} be so?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My hope {{has all but}} gone,' said Averil. 'There is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> left <b>to</b> look to. If I {{only can}} live till he is sent out to a colony, then nothing shall keep me back from him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] whispered Orme back. [...] "Perhaps these camels were bred here, and {{are looking}} for their stables. Well, there is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do--go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't say that!" [...] {{said his}} housekeeper--who was also his remote cousin. For [...] "something happening" [...] was a {{euphemism}} that meant <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was evident}} there was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done. Mrs. Bunting said as much. [...] "The only thing," [...] said she, [...] "is {{to carry her}} indoors." ...|$|E
50|$|Horn finds a {{gold deposit}} located near a river. Now he wants <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> - <b>to</b> collect as much {{precious}} metal as possible, {{return to the}} mainland and try to start over. Horn separates itself from Bekeko and refuses Esther's offer to live together.|$|R
60|$|She {{did not see}} him; and {{he could}} <b>only</b> think of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done, which was to shout her name.|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "Bruiser," [...] {{with a happy}} {{smile on}} his face, {{surveyed}} the scene, sniffing with joy {{the smell of the}} land as it came fresh and sweet from the hills {{at the back of the}} town. There was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> wanting <b>to</b> complete his happiness—the skipper.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Settle something,' said Mrs. Davis. 'If you are {{an honest}} man, as I take you, there is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> settle; when {{do you mean to}} marry her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see much}} opening," [...] she answered. [...] "If you ask my advice, I should {{say there is}} <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done in Rhodesia just now--turn farmer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done," [...] said Flambeau, [...] "whether {{it belongs}} to this world or the other. I must go {{down and talk to}} my friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> for me <b>to</b> do," [...] he answered. [...] "Until I {{know what}} I {{have come to}} London to learn, I shall fight against it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{there is}} <b>only</b> <b>one</b> other <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done,' said Averil; 'and {{that is for}} me {{to go back to school}} as a parlour boarder, and take the {{children}} with me. It would be very good for them, and dear Mrs. Wood would be very glad to have me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My brains work beautifully today. I'm quite {{proud of}} them. Now, listen! If {{we attempt to}} escape through {{the doors of the}} palace we shall surely be captured. And, as we can't escape through the ground, there is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> other <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done. We must escape through the air!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When the Roman {{purple and}} a princely title are but masks {{to cover a}} swindler, there is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done. This swindler must be exposed and punished." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, I'm sure, Danny. But {{if this is}} so, there's <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done. You must go {{straight}} to Mr. Walters and tell him all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] said McFarlane, after a {{few moments}} of thought. [...] "You and Berrie and Mrs. McFarlane must get out of here before you are subpoenaed." ...|$|E
6000|$|JANET [She {{is seated}} in an easy-chair near the fire.] I {{was talking to}} a woman only yesterday--in Bethnal Green. She keeps a husband and three {{children}} by taking in washing. [...] "Lord, miss," [...] she laughed, [...] "what would we do with the vote if we did have it? <b>Only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more <b>to</b> give to the men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't tell you, Sir Everard," [...] he said, as {{he sipped}} his first glass of wine, [...] "what a {{pleasure}} {{it is to}} me to see, as it were, this recrudescence of an old family. If I might be allowed to say so, there's <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> necessary <b>to</b> round the whole business off, as it were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} see that; and I'm {{glad you did}} it. You don't believe me, of course. Why do men think life can be <b>only</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> women? And {{if you come to}} the selfish view, who are the happy women? I'm sure that if work doesn't fail me, health won't, and {{happiness}} won't." ...|$|R
60|$|They sat {{silent for}} a while. There was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done, but they shrank from {{indicating}} it and owning their defeat. At last Jimmy made a gesture of resignation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I see. <b>Only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done,' {{said the}} Captain, {{who had already}} turned the {{carriage}} round by the stumps of the shafts; 'you must accept me in lieu of your pony.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{on earth}} can I tell you that, Annabella? But I suppose {{he can have}} <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> say after all that has come and gone. He can only have come with one object." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more wanted <b>to</b> make me happy,' {{continued}} the new- comer. 'And {{that is a}} little baccy, which I am sorry to say I am out of.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... § 38. There was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{belonging}} <b>to</b> {{hills that}} Shakespere {{seemed to feel}} as noble--the pine tree, and that was because he had seen it in Warwickshire, clumps of pine occasionally rising on little sandstone mounds, as at the place of execution of Piers Gaveston, above the lowland woods. He touches on this tree fondly again and again.|$|R
60|$|There was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> wanting <b>to</b> make Mr. Walters' ecstasy complete, {{and that}} was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy. Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough --he had been around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now, to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.|$|R
