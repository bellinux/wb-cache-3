5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> the writers of Unknown and Astounding, {{there was a good}} deal of <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines. Sf historian Paul Carter has argued that the spectrum of fantastic fiction from Weird Tales through Unknown to Astounding was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as Wonder Stories were more like the works of Edgar Allan Poe than they were tales of scientific imagination.|$|E

5|$|Each {{hemisphere}} is conventionally {{divided into}} four lobes; the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe, named according to the skull bones that overlie them.

5|$|Einsteinium-254 {{was used}} as the {{calibration}} marker in the chemical analysis spectrometer ("alpha-scattering surface analyzer") of the Surveyor 5 lunar probe.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to differentiate to between tumor and tissue in the brain when the border and cells <b>overlapped</b> <b>between</b> normal and abnormal tissues in gray level of the medical images. This is a real challenge of the surgeon or physician to distinguish it. When MRI and CT scan are taken for patient brain tumor there is an <b>overlapping</b> <b>between</b> the boundaries of tumor in the cerebellum part and tissue surrounded. If the surgeon has the accurate dimensions of the involved tissue he can do his job with more flexibility. When the image of MRI and CT scan were taken to a patient {{it is easy to}} distinguish image gray level <b>overlapping</b> <b>between</b> two or more different parts in the same image...|$|R

5|$|The most {{interesting}} aspects of Irish phonotactics {{revolve around the}} behavior of consonant clusters.

5|$|A few adult beetles may <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> {{the spring}} and summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{focuses on}} forming nucleic acid systems with designed dynamic functionalities {{related to their}} overall structures, such as computation and mechanical motion. There is some <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> structural and dynamic DNA nanotechnology, as structures can be formed through annealing and then reconfigured dynamically, or {{can be made to}} form dynamically in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the kabuki theater {{tradition}} in Japan employs ritualized representations of {{violence on the}} stage. While kabuki is technically theater and not dance, the movements, for example, of the sword-fighting termed tachimawari in kabuki are gymnastic to the point even of employing somersaults, and elaborate fight scenes are so deliberate and stylized that they provide at least an area of <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> theater and dance.|$|E
5|$|GTRI, {{like many}} {{traditional}} boards of directors, has an External Advisory Council, {{which consists of}} individuals who are notable in related fields of industry, government or academia and who provide advice about research direction, strategy, and markets, although they do not govern the organization. Members of the Board of Trustees of the contracting agency, GTARC, are not necessarily members of the External Advisory Council, although there is sometimes <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> them.|$|E

50|$|For each family, a {{manually}} curated gathering threshold {{is assigned}} that maximises {{the number of}} true matches to the family while excluding any false positive matches. False positives are estimated by observing <b>overlaps</b> <b>between</b> Pfam family hits that are not from the same clan. This threshold is used to assess whether a match to a family HMM {{should be included in}} the protein family. Upon each update of Pfam, gathering thresholds are reassessed to prevent <b>overlaps</b> <b>between</b> new and existing families.|$|R
5|$|In the mid-1940s, US9 was rerouted {{to follow}} its modern {{alignment}} through Champlain, creating a lengthy <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> NY348 and US9 from Chazy hamlet to Champlain village. The overlaps with both US9 and US11 were eliminated {{in the early}} 1960s after NY348 was truncated on its northern end to its junction with US9 in Chazy.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} shown that the current species concept for H.repandum may need {{revision}} as there is a poor <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> morphological and molecular species concepts. Phylogenetic analysis of European specimens, based on internal transcribed spacer and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicates that H.repandum specimens form two distinct clades, whose only consistent morphological distinction is cap size. These genetic differences may indicate the presence of undescribed cryptic species, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive speciation.|$|E
5|$|Now in the {{adjacent}} village of Homer, US11 and NY41 meet I-81 once more {{by way of a}} lengthy exit ramp internally designated as NY930Q by NYSDOT. The two routes continue on into the village center, where they meet the southern terminus of NY90. The <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> US11 and NY41 ends three blocks later when NY41 leaves US11 and follows Clinton Street to the northwest. NY41 intersects with NY281 before leaving Homer village.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the legal}} issues raised by {{geothermal}} energy resources include questions of ownership and allocation of the resource, the grant of exploration permits, exploitation rights, royalties, {{and the extent to}} which geothermal energy issues have been recognized in existing planning and environmental laws. Other questions concern <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> geothermal and mineral or petroleum tenements. Broader issues concern the extent to which the legal framework for encouragement of renewable energy assists in encouraging geothermal industry innovation and development.|$|E
5|$|Some winter service vehicles, {{especially}} those {{designed for use}} on footpaths or pedestrian zones, are built on a far smaller chassis using small tractors or custom made vehicles. These vehicles are often multi-purpose, and can be fitted with other equipment such as brushes, lawnmowers or cranes—as these operations are generally unable to run during heavy snowfalls, there is generally little <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> the different uses, reducing {{the size of the}} fleet required by the agency or contractor.|$|E
5|$|The {{invisible}} rail is superficially {{similar to}} the purple swamphen, Porphyrio porphyrio, which has recently been found in Halmahera, but that species is larger, with a short, thick red bill and a red forehead shield; it also has purple underparts and a white undertail. The invisible rail {{is different from the}} Calayan rail, Gallirallus calayanensis, in that it is larger and lacks the barred plumage of that species; there is no <b>overlap</b> <b>between</b> the ranges of the two species.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the gaps and <b>overlaps</b> <b>between</b> software and systems engineering cost models with intent to harmonize the estimates in engineering engineering estimation. In particular, we evaluate the central assumptions of the COSYSMO and COCOMO II models and propose an approach to identify gaps and <b>overlaps</b> <b>between</b> them. We provide guidelines on how to reconcile and resolve the identified gaps and overlaps. The ultimate purpose of this work is to develop effective techniques for accurately estimating the combined systems and software engineering effort for software-intensive systems...|$|R
