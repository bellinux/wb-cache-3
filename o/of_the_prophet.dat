5|$|After the Ottomans assumed {{power in}} 1517, {{they did not}} {{undertake}} any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole. This included {{the building of the}} Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), the restoration of the Pool of Raranj, and the building of three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> built in 1538. All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the sultans themselves. The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however. In 1816, the mosque was restored by Governor Sulayman Pasha al-Adil after having been in a dilapidated state.|$|E

5|$|The Al-Azhar Mosque was {{commissioned}} by the Caliph Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah for the newly established capital city of Cairo.

The Green Dome above the tomb was built by the Mamluk sultan Al Mansur Qalawun in the 13th century, although the green color was added in the 16th century, under the reign of Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Among tombs adjacent to that of Muhammad are those of his companions (Sahabah), the first two Muslim caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar, and an empty one that Muslims believe awaits Jesus.|$|E

5|$|Affairs quieted {{after the}} initial persecution. Diocletian {{remained}} in Antioch for the following three years. He visited Egypt once, over the winter of 301302, where he began the grain dole in Alexandria. In Egypt, some Manicheans, followers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prophet</b> Mani, were denounced {{in the presence of}} the proconsul of Africa. On March 31, 302, in a rescript from Alexandria, Diocletian, after consultation with the proconsul for Egypt, ordered that the leading Manicheans be burnt alive along with their scriptures. This was the first time an Imperial persecution ever called for the destruction of sacred literature. Low-status Manicheans were to be executed; high-status Manicheans were to be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island) or the mines of Phaeno. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury.|$|E

5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, the daughter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prophet</b> Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron {{would be considered a}} necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|In Islamic tradition, Bayt Jibrin is {{the burial}} {{place of the}} sahaba (companion) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prophet</b> Muhammad, Tamim al-Dari, who was famously known for his piety and briefly served as the Governor of Jerusalem in the late 7th century. Al-Dari {{and his family were}} granted {{trusteeship}} over the Hebron Hills, including Bayt Jibrin, and were assigned as the supervisors of the Cave of the Patriarchs (Ibrahimi Mosque) in Hebron. His sanctuary is the most venerated site in Bayt Jibrin, located just northwest of it. Until the present day, al-Dari's sanctuary has been a place of local Muslim pilgrimage. Other Islamic holy sites in the village include Maqam (shrine) for a local shaykh named Mahmud and a tomb for a shaykha (female religious figure) named Ameina.|$|E
5|$|In early 1594, the Serbs in Banat rose {{up against}} the Ottomans. The rebels had, in the {{character}} of a holy war, carried war flags with the icon of Saint Sava. The war banners were consecrated by Patriarch Jovan Kantul, and the uprising was aided by Serbian Orthodox metropolitans Rufim Njeguš of Cetinje and Visarion of Trebinje (s. 1590–1602). In response, Ottoman Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha demanded that the green flag <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammed be brought from Damascus to counter the Serb flag and ordered that the sarcophagus containing the relics of Saint Sava be removed from the Mileševa monastery and transferred to Belgrade via military convoy. Along the way, the Ottoman convoy killed all the people in its path as a warning to the rebels. The Ottomans publicly incinerated the relics of Saint Sava on a pyre atop the Vračar plateau on April 27, 1595, and had the ashes scattered.|$|E
