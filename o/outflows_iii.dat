The system has been detected at very high energies with H. E. S. S. The most probable production mechanism is inverse Compton scattering between target photons from the optical companion and disc, and relativistic electrons in the pulsar wind.

40|$|We {{review the}} high energy {{properties}} of Misaligned AGNs associated with gamma-ray sources detected by Fermi in 24 months of survey. Most {{of them are}} nearby emission low power radio galaxies (i. e FRIs) which probably have structured jets. On the contrary, high power radio sources (i. e FRIIs) with GeV emission are rare. The small number of FRIIs {{does not seem to}} be related to their higher redshifts. Assuming proportionality between the radio core flux and the gamma-ray flux, several of them are expected to be bright enough to be detected above 100 MeV in spite of their distance. We suggest that beaming/jet structural differences are responsible for the detection rate discrepancy observed between FRIs and FRIIs.

It is known that massive black holes have a profound effect on the formation and evolution of galaxies, but how black holes and galaxies communicate is still an unsolved problem. For Radio Galaxies, feedback studies have mainly focused on jet/cavity systems in the most massive and X-ray luminous galaxy clusters. The recent high-resolution detection of warm absorbers in some Broad Line Radio Galaxies allow us to investigate the interplay between the nuclear engine and the surrounding medium from a different perspective. We report on the detection of warm absorbers in two Broad Line Radio Galaxies, 3 C 382 and 3 C 390. 3, and discuss the physical and energetic properties of the absorbing gas.

40|$|Context: Because it {{is viewed}} simply edge-on, the HH 212 protostellar system {{is an ideal}} {{laboratory}} for studying the interplay of infall, outflow, and rotation in the earliest stages of low-mass star formation. Aims: We wish to exploit the unmatched combination of high angular resolution, high sensitivity, high-imaging fidelity, and spectral coverage provided by ALMA {{to shed light on}} the complex kinematics of the innermost central regions of HH 212. Methods: We mapped the inner 10 " (4500 AU) of the HH 212 system at about 0. 5 arcsec resolution in several molecular tracers and in the 850 μm dust continuum using the ALMA interferometer in band 7 in the extended configuration of the Early Science Cycle 0 operations. Results: Within a single ALMA spectral set-up, we simultaneously identify all the crucial ingredients known {{to be involved in the}} star formation recipe namely: (i) the fast, collimated bipolar SiO jet driven by the protostar, (ii) the large-scale swept-up CO <b>outflow,</b> (<b>iii)</b> the flattened rotating and infalling envelope, with bipolar cavities carved by the outflow (in C^ 17 O(3 [...] 2)), and (iv) a rotating wide-angle flow that fills the cavities and surrounding the axial jet (in C^ 34 S(7 [...] 6)). In addition, the compact high-velocity C^ 17 O emission (± 1. 9 [...] 3. 5 km s^- 1 from systemic) shows a velocity gradient along the equatorial plane consistent with a rotating disk of about 0. 2 arcsec = 90 AU around a ≃ 0. 3 ± 0. 1 M_ source. The rotating disk is possibly Keplerian. Conclusions: HH 212 is the third Class 0 protostar with possible signatures of a Keplerian disk of radius ≥ 30 AU. The warped geometry in our CS data suggests that this large keplerian disk might result from misaligned magnetic and rotation axes during the collapse phase. The wide-angle CS flow suggests that disk winds may be present in this source. Comment: Astronomy & Astrophysics Letter, in pres...|$|R

The study of these structures can provide valuable insights on the conditions for particle acceleration and radiation at the shock fronts. We have studied the thermal and non-thermal emission that can be expected from the jet termination regions of Fanaroff & Riley type I sources. The broadband emission from these galaxies has been recently extended to include the high-energy gamma-ray domain, owing to the Fermi detection of Cen A lobes. Exploring the physics behind the jet/medium interactions in FRI can provide valuable insights on the conditions for particle acceleration and radiation in the jet termination shocks.

40|$|The {{physical}} processes {{that take place}} in the auroral ionosphere (activation of auroral arcs at various spatial scales, plasma irregularities, non-homogeneities of the electric conductivity) are linked with the dynamics of the distant magnetosphere; the same geomagnetic field lines connect the polar ionosphere and the distant magnetosphere. Inside the magnetosphere the plasma parameters (temperature, density, bulk velocity) are non-uniform. We develop a stationary model that predicts the amplitude of the ionospheric perturbations corresponding to magnetospheric sheared flows. In this study we investigate the sheared plasma flows encountered close to the outer magnetospheric boundary layers. The main components of the model are:(i) a kinetic tangential discontinuity that plays the role of a magnetospheric generator; (ii) a current-voltage relationship describing the flux of generator particles precipitating into the ionosphere as well as the flux o the ionospheric <b>outflow</b> and (<b>iii)</b> a simple model of the topside ionosphere.

40|$|Relativistic jets carry {{energy and}} {{particles}} from compact to very large scales {{compared with their}} initial radius. This is possible due to their remarkable collimation despite their intrinsic unstable nature. In this contribution, I review the state-of-the-art of our knowledge on instabilities growing in those jets and several stabilising mechanisms that may give {{an answer to the}} question of the stability of jets. In particular, during the last years we have learned that the limit imposed by the speed of light sets a maximum amplitude to the instabilities, contrary to the case of classical jets. On top of this stabilising mechanism, the fast growth of unstable modes with small wavelengths prevents the total disruption and entrainment of jets. I also review several non-linear processes that can have an effect on the collimation of extragalactic and microquasar jets. Within those, I remark possible causes for the decollimation and decelleration of FRI jets, as opposed to the collimated FRII's.

The time coincidence {{in the end of}} 2008 of the propagation of the brightest superluminal feature detected in AO 0235 + 164 (Qs) with an extreme multi-spectral-range (gamma-ray to radio) outburst, and an extremely high optical and 7 mm (for Qs) polarization degree provides strong evidence supporting that all these events are related. This is confirmed at high significance by probability arguments and Monte-Carlo simulations. These simulations show the unambiguous correlation of the gamma-ray flaring state in the end of 2008 with those in the optical, millimeter, and radio regime, as well as the connection of a prominent X-ray flare in October 2008, and of a series of optical linear polarization peaks, with the set of events in the end of 2008.

40|$|A {{model for}} gas {{outflows}} is proposed which simultaneously explains {{the correlations between}} the (i) equivalent width of low ionization and Ly-alpha lines, (ii) <b>outflow</b> velocity, and (<b>iii)</b> star formation rate observed in Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). Our interpretation implies that LBGs host short-lived (30 +/- 5 Myr) starburst episodes observed at different evolutionary phases. Initially, the starburst powers a hot wind bound by a denser cold shell, which after about 5 Myr becomes dynamically unstable and fragments; afterwards the fragment evolution is approximately ballistic while the hot bubble continues to expand. As the fragments are gravitationally decelerated, their screening ability of the starlight decreases as the UV starburst luminosity progressively dims. LBG observations sample all these evolutionary phases. Finally, the fragments fall back onto the galaxy after approximately 60 Myr. This phase cannot be easily probed as it occurs when the starburst UV luminosity has already largely faded; however, galaxies dimmer in the UV than LBGs should show infalling gas.

40|$|There are {{thousands}} of embankment dams around the world which represent a significant economic and ecological risk should any of them fail. In previous failure {{events such as the}} Baldwin Hills Reservoir near Los Angeles which failed in 1964, destroying 277 homes and killing five people and causing $ 73 million in property damage. Other failures include the Buffalo Creek coal tailings dam in West Virginia which failed in 1972, killing 125 people, injuring over 1000 more and leaving thousands homeless and the Teton Dam in Idaho which failed in 1976 killing 14 people and causing over $ 1 billion in damages, and the recent Situ Gintung Lake Dam near Jakarta, Indonesia which failed March 26, 2009 killing almost 100 people. The goal {{of this study is to}} provide the experimental basis for a new numerical dam breach model which will help to address many of the shortcomings identified in the literature which are due primarily to lack of knowledge. Shortcomings have been identified in the existing models in the areas of breach initiation, breach location, breach morphology, hydraulics of flow over an embankment, sediment transport equations, geomechanics of the breach, and modeling composite embankments. For example, it has been said that there is an uncertainty of about 50 % which can be expected from estimates of peak discharge for the existing numerical models (Franca and Almeida, 2004). To address the existing limitations, two embankment test series were developed. The first series of tests was conducted in a smaller flume in which compaction was varied. These tests shed light on the effects of compaction as well as the effects of side walls in testing and some of the effects that unsaturated soils and slope stability have on the breach process. The second series of tests was conducted in a larger flume with varying initial breach geometry as well as varying the filtration characteristics of the embankment. These tests demonstrate the role of initial breach geometry in dam breach mechanics and also help with understanding the importance of slope stability and unsaturated soil mechanics. One of these runs also included a clay core to study the effects of composite construction. These two test series were supported by data obtained by a series of geotechnical investigations as well as a series of erosion characteristics tests which were both conducted using the dam construction materials. From these test series, the following conclusions have been drawn: (i) A four phase breach process is proposed based on quantitative analysis of breach morphology. (ii) Initial breach geometry does not appear to have any effect on the peak breach <b>outflow.</b> (<b>iii)</b> The density of the embankment plays an important role in determining the shape of the outflow hydrograph as well as the peak flow. (iv) The breach is widest at the downstream toe of the embankment and smallest at the crest, but widens again upstream of the crest. (v) The slope failure mode does not appear to have any impact on breach characteristics. (vi) Tailwater conditions have a notable effect on breach morphology and reservoir volume also appears to have an important effect on sediment deposition characteristics. It should be noted that these conclusions have not been drawn for the purposes of improving dam construction techniques. Rather, they are useful for developing a more advanced numerical breach model in the hope of improving the accuracy of risk assessments in downstream flood zones. A new set of criteria could then be developed to define the new flood elevations and improve warning times for people who may be at risk...|$|R

The {{observed}} {{relation between}} the X-ray radiation from active galactic nuclei, originating in the corona, and the optical/UV radiation from the disk is usually described by the anticor{{relation between the}} UV to X-ray slope α_ox and the UV luminosity. Many factors can affect this relation, including: i) enhanced X-ray emission associated with the jets of radio-loud AGNs, ii) X-ray absorption associated with the UV broad absorption line (BAL) <b>outflows,</b> <b>iii)</b> other X-ray absorption not associated with BALs, iv) intrinsic X-ray weakness, v) UV and X-ray variability, and non-simultaneity of UV and X-ray observations. The separation of these effects provides information about the intrinsic α_ox - LUV relation and its dispersion, constraining models of disk-corona coupling. Aims: We use simultaneous UV/X-ray observations to remove the influence of non-simultaneous measurements from the α_ox - LUV relation.

40|$|I review {{constraints}} on the physical properties of AGN jets revealed through Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) studies of the structure and time-evolution of parsec-scale jets, including recent results from the MOJAVE program. In particular I focus on constraints available from very long time baseline studies which probe {{a wide range of}} jet behavior over many outbursts. Kinematic studies of propagating jet features find an apparent speed distribution that peaks around 10 c for blazars, with speeds up to 50 c observed. These observed speeds require Lorentz factors at least as large, implying that parsec-scale Lorentz factors up to 10 - 20 are common for blazars with a tail up to ~ 50. Jet flows are still becoming organized on these scales as evidenced by the high incidence of non-radial motions and/or accelerations of jet features (including increases and decreases in apparent speed and direction). Changes in Lorentz factors of propagating jet features appear to {{play a significant role in}} the observed accelerations, and while the connection between acceleration of jet features and the underlying flow is not clear, the pattern of observed accelerations suggest the flow may increase in speed near the base of the jet and decrease further out. In some jets, ejections of new features span a range of ejection angles over many epochs, tracing out wider opening angles on parsec-scales than are apparent in single epoch observations.

40|$|There {{is a large}} {{diversity}} in the C IV broad absorption line (BAL) profile among BAL quasars (BALQs). We quantify this diversity by exploring {{the distribution of the}} C IV BAL properties, FWHM, maximum depth of absorption and its velocity shift (v_ md), using the SDSS DR 7 quasar catalogue. We find the following: (i) Although the median C IV BAL profile in the quasar rest-frame becomes broader and shallower as the UV continuum slope (α_ UV at 1700 - 3000 A) gets bluer, the median individual profile in the absorber rest-frame remains identical, and is narrow (FWHM = 3500 km/s) and deep. Only 4 per cent of BALs have FWHM > 10, 000 km/s. (ii) As the He II emission equivalent-width (EW) decreases, the distributions of FWHM and v_ md extend to larger values, and the median maximum depth increases. These trends are consistent with theoretical models in which softer ionizing continua reduce overionization, and allow radiative acceleration of faster BAL <b>outflows.</b> (<b>iii)</b> As α_ UV becomes bluer, the distribution of v_ md extends to larger values. This trend may imply faster outflows at higher latitudes above the accretion disc plane. (iv) For non-BALQs, the C IV emission line decreases with decreasing He II EW, and becomes more asymmetric and blueshifted. This suggests an increasing relative contribution of emission from the BAL outflow to the C IV emission line as the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) gets softer, which is consistent with the increasing fraction of BALQs as the ionizing SED gets softer.

40|$|We use cosmological {{hydrodynamic}} simulations {{to study}} the impact of out-flows and radiative feedback on high-redshift galaxies. For outflows, we consider simulations that assume (i) no winds, (ii) a. constant-wind. model in which the mass-loading factor and outflow speed are constant, and (iii) "momentum driven" winds in which both parameters vary smoothly with mass. In order to treat radiative feedback, we develop a moment-based radiative transfer technique that operates in both post-processing and coupled radiative hydrodynamic modes. We first ask how outflows impact the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of six observed reionization-epoch galaxies. Simulations reproduce five regardless of the outflow prescription, while the sixth suggests an unusually bursty star formation history. We conclude that (i) simulations broadly account for available constraints on reionization-epoch galaxies, (ii) individual SEDs do not constrain <b>outflows,</b> and (<b>iii)</b> SED comparisons efficiently isolate objects that challenge simulations. We next study how outflows impact the galaxy mass metallicity relation (MZR). Momentum-driven outflows uniquely reproduce observations at z = 2. In this scenario, galaxies obey two equilibria: (i) The rate at which a galaxy processes gas into stars and outflows tracks its inflow rate; and (ii) The gas enrichment rate owing to star formation balances the dilution rate owing to inflows. Combining these conditions indicates that the MZR {{is dominated by the}} (instantaneous) variation of outflows with mass, with more-massive galaxies driving less gas into outflows per unit stellar mass formed. Turning to radiative feedback, we use post-processing simulations {{to study the}} topology of reionization. Reionization begins in overdensities and then. leaks. directly into voids, with filaments reionizing last owing to their high density and low emissivity. This result conflicts with previous findings that voids ionize last. We argue that it owes to the uniqely-biased emissivity field produced by our star formation prescriptions, which have previously been shown to reproduce numerous post-reionization constraints. Finally, preliminary results from coupled radiative hydrodynamic simulations indicate that reionization suppresses the star formation rate density by at most 10. 20 % by z = 5.

For an assigned empirical differential oxygen abundance distribution (EDOD), which can be linearly fitted, a family of theoretical differential oxygen abundance distribution (TDOD) curves is built up with the following prescriptions: (i) the initial and the ending points of the linear fit are common to all curves; (ii) the flow parameter k ranges from an extremum point to ± ∞, where negative and positive k correspond to inflow and <b>outflow,</b> respectively; (<b>iii)</b> the cut parameter ζO ranges from an extremum point (which cannot be negative) to the limit (ζO) ∞ related to |k|→ + ∞. For curves with increasing ζO, the gas mass fraction locked up into long-lived stars and remnants is found to attain a maximum and then decrease towards zero as |k|→ + ∞ while the remaining parameters show a monotonic trend. The theoretical integral oxygen abundance distribution (TIOD) is also expressed. An application is made to the EDOD deduced from two different samples of disk stars, for both the thin and the thick disk. The constraints on formation and evolution {{are discussed in the}} light of the model. The evolution is tentatively subdivided into four stages, namely: assembling (A), formation (F), contraction (C), equilibrium (E). The EDOD related to any stage is fitted by all curves where 0 ≤ ζO ≤ (ζO) ∞ for inflowing gas and (ζO) ∞ ≤ ζO ≤ 1. 2 for outflowing gas, with a single exception related to the thin disk (A stage), where the range of fitting curves is restricted to 0. 35 ≤ ζO ≤ (ζO) ∞. The F stage may safely be described by a steady inflow regime (k= - 1), implying a flat TDOD, in agreement with the results of hydrodynamical simulations. Finally, (1) the change of fractional mass due to the extension of the linear fit to the EDOD, towards both the (undetected) low-metallicity and high-metallicity tail, is evaluated and (2) the idea of a thick disk - thin disk collapse is discussed, {{in the light of the}} model...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{highlight}} {{a special}} subset {{of cases of}} venous stasis in which the profunda femoris vein enlarges to a variable extent (axial transformation) to compensate for severe postthrombotic changes in the accompanying superficial femoral vein. Methods: Among 500 consecutively treated patients with severe venous stasis, 57 patients had axial transformation of the profunda femoris vein. Venous obstruction and reflux were assessed by means of arm-foot pressure differential, ambulatory venous pressure measurement, air plethysmography, and duplex examination. Ascending and descending venograms also were obtained. A variety of valve reconstruction techniques were useful in correcting reflux in the enlarged profunda femoris vein and the companion postthrombotic superficial femoral vein. Results: In 55 % of patients the profunda femoris vein was larger than normal and provided partial outflow from the leg through a profunda-popliteal connection, but the superficial femoral vein was still the dominant outflow tract (grades I and II). In 36 % of patients the profunda femoris was the dominant outflow tract from the leg, and in another 9 % it was the sole axial <b>outflow</b> tract (grades <b>III</b> and IV). The skin changes of advanced venous stasis were present among 92 % of patients and frank ulceration among 88 %. Antireflux operations on the profunda femoris vein and companion superficial femoral vein, including ligation and division in some instances, were well tolerated. Despite a postthrombotic cause, obstruction did not worsen after surgical treatment, and reflux improved according to most laboratory measurements. Complete ulcer healing was obtained with the surgical techniques described. The actuarial recurrence-free survival rates were 90 % 1 year and 66 % 5 years after treatment. Conclusion: Axial transformation of the profunda femoris vein is present in a subset of instances in which severe postthrombotic changes {{are present in the}} companion superficial femoral vein. Profunda femoris reflux is invariably present in these instances because of compensatory dilatation and enlargement of this vessel. Simultaneous valve repair of the axially transformed profunda femoris vein and companion superficial femoral vein to abolish reflux yields excellent long-term results and healing of stasis ulceration.

40|$|Context. The stellar halo {{provides}} {{precious information}} about the Galaxy {{in its early stages}} of evolution because the most metal-poor (oldest) stars in the Milky Way are found there. Aims: We study the chemical evolution and formation of the Galactic halo through the analysis of its stellar metallicity distribution function and some key elemental abundance patterns. We also test the effects of a possible Population III of zero-metal stars. Methods: Starting from the two-infall model for the Galaxy, which predicts too few low-metallicity stars, we added a gas outflow during the halo phase with a rate proportional to the star formation rate through a free parameter, λ. In addition, we considered a first generation of massive zero-metal stars in this two-infall + outflow model, adopting two different top-heavy initial mass functions and specific Population III yields. Results: The metallicity distribution function of halo stars as predicted from the two-infall + outflow model agrees well with observations when the parameter λ = 14 and the time scale for the first infall, out of which the halo formed, is not longer than 0. 2 Gyr, a lower value than suggested previously. Moreover, the abundance patterns [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] for C, N, and α-elements O, Mg, Si, S, and Ca agree well with the observational data, {{as in the case of}} the two-infall model without <b>outflow.</b> If Population <b>III</b> stars are included, under the assumption of different initial mass functions, the overall agreement of the predicted stellar metallicity distribution function with observational data is poorer than in the case of the two-infall + outflow model without Population III. Conclusions: We conclude that it is fundamental to include both a gas infall and outflow during the halo formation to explain the observed halo metallicity distribution function in the framework of a model assuming that the stars in the inner halo formed mostly in situ. Moreover, we find that there is no satisfactory initial mass function for Population III stars that reproduces the observed halo metallicity distribution function. As a consequence, there is no need for a first generation of only massive stars to explain the evolution of the Galactic halo...|$|R
