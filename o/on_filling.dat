He {{had ignored}} {{the advice of}} Prince Eugene of Savoy who had urged him to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>filling</b> the treasury and equipping the army rather than on acquiring signatures of fellow monarchs. The Emperor, who spent his entire reign securing the Pragmatic Sanction, left Austria in an impoverished state, bankrupted by the recent Turkish war and the War of the Polish Succession; the treasury contained only 100,000 florins, which were claimed by his widow. The army numbered only 80,000men, most of whom had not been paid in months; they were nevertheless remarkably loyal and devoted to their new sovereign.|$|E
40|$|Cold-season filling using much coarser sediments {{than the}} native caused {{dramatic}} suppression of beach macroinvertebrates, demonstrably degrading habitat value for foraging shorebirds. As a dual consequence of persistent steepening of the foreshore, which translated to reduction in habitat area by 14 - 29 %, and disturbance-induced depression of invertebrate densities <b>on</b> <b>filled</b> beaches, abundances of Donax spp. and haustoriid amphipods averaged less than 10 % of control levels. Donax spp. is the biomass dominant {{and a key}} prey for higher trophic levels. Haustoriids lack pelagic larvae. Recovery <b>on</b> <b>filled</b> beaches was not initiated by either taxon during the March-November sampling. Emerita talpoida, {{an order of magnitude}} less abundant than Donax spp. on control beaches, exhibited a pattern of initial depression <b>on</b> <b>filled</b> beaches but recovered by mid summer. Polychaetes, mostly the small Scolelepis squamata, experienced a warm-season bloom of equal magnitude <b>on</b> <b>filled</b> and control beaches. Summertime recruitment of predatory ghost crabs appeared inhibited <b>on</b> <b>filled</b> beaches, perhaps by persistent shell hash. Intertidal shell cover <b>on</b> <b>filled</b> beaches averaged 25 - 50 % in mid summer as compared to 6 - 8 % on control beaches. Largely in response to prey depression, but perhaps also to surface shell armoring and/or coarsening of sediments, shorebird (mostly sanderling) use plummeted by 70 - 90 % <b>on</b> <b>filled</b> beaches until November. Thus, despite likely adaptations to natural sediment dynamics, the high intensity of sediment deposition, cumulative spatial scope (10. 8 km), and unnaturally coarse shelly character of the Bogue Banks beach nourishment resulted in a perturbation that exceeded biotic resistance and degraded the trophic transfer function of this highly productive habitat for at least one warm season. 17 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Test flights {{revealed}} problems initially {{believed to}} be tail flutter. During high-speed flight approaching Mach0.68, especially during dives, the aircraft's tail would begin to shake violently and the nose would tuck under, steepening the dive. Once caught in this dive, the fighter would enter a high-speed compressibility stall and the controls would lock up, leaving the pilot {{no option but to}} bail out (if possible) or remain with the aircraft until it got down to denser air, where he might have a chance to pull out. During a test flight in May 1941, USAAC Major Signa Gilkey managed to stay with a YP-38 in a compressibility lockup, riding it out until he recovered gradually using elevator trim. Lockheed engineers were very concerned at this limitation but first had to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>filling</b> the current order of aircraft.

500|$|The {{conversations between}} Chapuys and Cromwell {{thereafter}} indicate Cromwell as the instigator {{of the plot}} to remove Anne; evidence of this {{is seen in the}} Spanish Chronicle and through letters written from Chapuys to Charles V. Anne argued with Cromwell over the redistribution of Church revenues and over foreign policy. She advocated that revenues be distributed to charitable and educational institutions; and she favoured a French alliance. Cromwell insisted <b>on</b> <b>filling</b> the King's depleted coffers, while taking a cut for himself, and preferred an imperial alliance. For these reasons, Ives suggests, [...] "Anne Boleyn had become a major threat to Thomas Cromwell." [...] Cromwell's biographer John Schofield, on the other hand, contends that no power struggle existed between Anne and Cromwell and that [...] "not a trace can be found of a Cromwellian conspiracy against Anne... Cromwell became involved in the royal marital drama only when Henry ordered him onto the case." [...] Cromwell did not manufacture the accusations of adultery, though he and other officials used them to bolster Henry's case against Anne. Historian Retha Warnicke questions whether Cromwell could have or wished to manipulate the king in such a matter. Such a bold attempt by Cromwell, given the limited evidence, could have risked his office, even his life. Henry himself issued the crucial instructions: his officials, including Cromwell, carried them out. The result, historians agree, was a legal travesty. However modern lawyers have concluded that the rules of the time were not bent in order to assure Anne Boleyn's conviction; {{there was no need to}} tamper with rules that guaranteed the desired result since law at the time, like armies, was an engine of state, not a mechanism for justice.|$|E

2500|$|By 1843, {{the rapid}} {{growth in the number}} of {{counties}} in the new state necessitated the addition of two new brigades. [...] The Legislature responded with [...] "An Act for the better organization of the Militia of this State". This new act, which had 50 sections, basically restated most of the 1837 law but added nine sections which dealt with the filling of vacancies among the officer corps. [...] The act referred to counties which had not yet organized their militia and directed the sheriff of said counties to announce elections for the office of Colonel Commandant and required the sheriff to continue to announce elections until the office was filled. [...] Colonels were given guidance <b>on</b> <b>filling</b> vacancies. [...] The law expanded the number of musters or drills that were to be conducted to include one regimental muster, one battalion muster, and four company musters each year. Volunteer Companies of cavalry, artillery and riflemen were authorized and the act allowed for the formation of one regiment of cavalry in each brigade where four or more cavalry companies had been formed. The act provided for pay for a regimental adjutant and for the musicians at the regimental and company levels. [...] A judge advocate was appointed for each regiment, and procedures for the conduct of courts martial and collection of fines were clarified. Emphasis was placed on reporting the attendance at company musters to enable the state to make its required return to the United States War department. [...] In the same session, the legislature passed a separate act entitled [...] "An act requiring the Adjutant General to report the strength of the Militia of this State" [...] to the proper officer of the General Government. [...] This act was apparently necessary because the state had failed to receive its authorized allowance of weapons from the federal government for a number of years, due to the fact that the state had failed to file the proper reports or [...] "returns" [...] with the War Department. [...] A return from Arkansas was filed with the Secretary of War dated January 15, 1844 which reported the State of Arkansas as having a total of 17,137 militiamen. [...] The 1844 return indicated that the state had three cavalry companies, and one rifle company but no organized artillery company. The regimental numbers were not listed in the Militia Act but were first developed by Governor Archibald Yell and announced by his Adjutant General, S.H. Hempstead, on January 1, 1841.|$|E
