[...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's a lot <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story." [...] The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|Linguists use grammaticality judgements to {{investigate}} the syntactic structure of sentences. Generative linguists are largely {{of the opinion that}} for native speakers of natural languages, grammaticality is a matter of linguistic intuition, and reflects the innate linguistic competence of speakers. Therefore, generative linguistics attempts to predict grammaticality judgements exhaustively. On the other hand, for linguists who stress the role of social learning, [...] in contrast to innate knowledge of language, such as Hopper 1987 there has been a gradual abandonment <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> grammaticality in favour of acceptability.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's {{thematic}} content, Daniel Rossen noted, [...] "There's a lot <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> negotiating {{distance from}} people in your life. We were dealing with that in various forms, learning {{what it means to}} be alone, learning {{what it means to be}} close to somebody, certain things coming to a head. It just feels like a major difficulty in life." [...] Droste elaborated, [...] "There's a desire to be autonomous, but there's also this great fear of being alone, and there's this constant feeling of, 'How do you reconcile this?' There's this need for space, but there's also this, 'Come closer come closer.'" ...|$|E

During a 1999 interview with MTV's Kurt Loder, Rose announced {{the title of}} the upcoming album to be Chinese Democracy, stating [...] "there's a lot of Chinese democracy movements, and it's something that there's a lot <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> and it's something that will be nice to see. It could also just be like an ironic statement. I don't know, I just like the sound of it." [...] Rose also mentioned the album would feature [...] "lot of different sounds. There's some heavy songs, there's a lot of aggressive songs, but they're all in different styles and different sounds. It is truly a melting pot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Donegal's defence {{of their}} All-Ireland title began against Tyrone on 26 May 2013. The match was billed in advance as the toughest contest Donegal would face in Ulster, with the winner thought {{likely to become}} Ulster champions. Donegal brushed aside Tyrone with {{relative}} ease. McGuinness said afterwards: [...] "In {{the last two years}} the exact same thing was said. The only difference this year was that we were relegated [...] There was a lot <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> putting all the eggs into one basket, but it was the same last year and the same the year before. That's what we do – it's championship football. It will be no different next year. It was a media spin that got the whole debate going. Next year we will put all our eggs in that basket again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the opening}} tip, Bryant and O'Neal did not talk, but did greet {{each other by}} bumping forearms. During the game, Bryant was fouled by O'Neal several times but the {{contacts}} were not excessive. O'Neal fouled out late {{in the fourth quarter}} but the Heat still won the game in overtime, led by up-and-coming star, Dwyane Wade. Bryant missed a potentially game-winning shot as time expired. When asked about the brick wall comment, Bryant said, [...] "I knew there was a lot <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the brick wall and all that. But I think that was kind of just to hype the game. Hopefully, this is all behind us now." [...] O'Neal shared a similar tone, saying [...] "I'm over it. It's old news to me." [...] Bryant and O'Neal met on the court twice more during the season, once during the NBA All-Star Game and once more when the Lakers played the Heat on March 17, 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Gandhi {{insisted that}} the {{conviction}} did not undermine her position, despite having been unseated from the lower house of parliament, Lok Sabha, by order of the High Court. She said: [...] "There is a lot <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [...] parties were forming governments". And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her. After news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty. Indian High Commissioner BK Nehru said Gandhi's conviction would not harm her political career. [...] "Mrs Gandhi has still today overwhelming support in the country," [...] he said. [...] "I believe {{the prime minister of}} India will continue in office until the electorate of India decides otherwise".|$|E
2500|$|The Colonial Office {{obtained}} {{an early}} {{draft of the}} Commission's report and passed a copy to Armitage, which he used to prepare a document attacking its findings. Armitage then flew to London, where he joined a high level working party which drafted a despatch, often known as the Armitage Report, to counter the Devlin Report. In the Commons debate on the report, the government noted that the Commission had found the declaration of a State of Emergency justified, but it attacked {{their use of the}} expression [...] "police state" [...] and its rejection <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> killings and beatings of Europeans as no more than rhetoric. The government also minimised Devlin's criticisms of handcuffing and gagging prisoners, burning houses and other illegal acts on ilt grounds if necessity. The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the government had the right and a duty to reject the Commission's findings where it disagreed with them, and used this argument to justify accepting what little in its report was favourable and rejecting all that was unfavourable, instead of rejecting the whole report.|$|E
