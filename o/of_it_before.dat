In the 3rd century, a few auxilia units of clearly barbarian origin start to appear in the record e.g. Ala I Sarmatarum, cuneus Frisiorum and numerus Hnaufridi in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the difficult position of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of Šolta and Brač, the Vis TG led by Pula sailed north from the island of Vis to draw some of the artillery fire away from the Kaštela TG. As the ships approached the Split Entrance, they made a radar contact sailing away from Split towards open sea at a high speed. Pula, attempting to enforce the blockade imposed in September, requested the vessel by radio to stop for an inspection. The vessel failed to respond and Pula fired several shots in front <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> Brčić noticed {{that it was a}} hydrofoil carrying an ECMM team and flying the flag of Europe.

The origin of this superstition is obscure (there is no record <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> the 1920s) but it is believed to derive from quarry workers: they would see rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall and blame them for increasing the risk of dangerous, sometimes deadly, landslides. If a rabbit was seen in a quarry, the workers would pack up and go home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured. Local fishermen too would refuse to go to sea if the word was mentioned.|$|E

500|$|On lap 39, James Hinchcliffe {{fell victim}} to the deteriorating track. Going through turn six, he struck {{a large piece of}} asphalt that had lifted from the track. After hitting his front wing, it then went under the car and {{propelled}} it into the air. With no traction, Hinchcliffe was unable to control his car and was sent into the tire wall. Hinchcliffe was angry after the race, and claimed that the track should have been fixed earlier: [...] "The fact that (race control) let it go as far as they did, essentially waiting for someone to crash as a result <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> they did something, is very unsafe." [...] He said that the track had lifted much earlier in the race, but that the drivers had been forced to keep avoiding the debris, which was on the racing line. On the same lap, Takuma Sato clipped the curb going into turn 12 and lost control of his car before hitting the wall, forcing his retirement. The two crashes drew a full track caution, and the cars drove behind the safety car for six laps before a red flag was given on lap 45.|$|E
500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle {{gave the}} program a rave review and saying that, [...] " [...] good you can't help {{wondering}} {{why no one}} thought <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> a compelling mix of credible real-life melodrama with a fictionalized approximation {{of what it takes}} to get a Broadway show from the idea stage to opening night. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof-raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems." [...] He ultimately gave it three and a half stars out of four. The A.V. Club reviewer Noel Murray praised the cast and Eileen's divorce storyline. He mainly criticized the staging and arrangement of the musical numbers saying they threatened the realism of the show and wrote they weren't completely [...] "digetic". He ultimately gave the episode a B. Another A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff criticized the series for not avoiding clichés but also wrote [...] "the show is so damned sincere about how much it embraces the clichés of the backstage Broadway story that those inclined to like this sort of thing—and I'm very much one of them—will forgive it some of these excesses." [...] He also criticized the adoption storyline. Despite this, he went on to compare the series to Hill Street Blues, ER and The West Wing.|$|E
500|$|Those who {{adopted a}} more {{negative}} {{view at the}} time of the film's release came mostly from the classical music community. Many took fault with Stokowski's rearrangements and abridgements of the music. Igor Stravinsky, the only living composer whose music was featured in the film, expressed displeasure at how in Stokowski's arrangement of The Rite of Spring, [...] "the order of the pieces had been shuffled, and the most difficult of them eliminated", and criticized the orchestra's performance, observing that the simplification of the score [...] "did not save the musical performance, which was execrable". Other composers and music critics leveled criticism at the premise of the film itself, arguing that presenting classical music with visual images would rob the musical pieces of their integrity. Composer and music critic Virgil Thomson praised Fantasound which he thought offered [...] "good transmission of music", but disliked the [...] "musical taste" [...] of Stokowski, with exception to The Sorcerer's Apprentice and The Rite of Spring. Olin Downes of The New York Times too hailed the quality of sound that Fantasound presented, but said, [...] "much of Fantasia distracted from or directly injured the scores". Film critic Pauline Kael dismissed parts of Fantasia as [...] "grotesquely kitschy". Some parents resisted paying the higher roadshow prices for their children, and several complained that the Night on Bald Mountain segment had frightened them. There were also a few negative reactions that were more political in nature, especially since the film's release happened at a time when Nazi Germany reigned supreme in Europe. One review of the film in this manner, written by Dorothy Thompson for The New York Herald Tribune on November 25, 1940, was especially harsh. Thompson claimed that she [...] "left the theater in a condition bordering on nervous breakdown", because the film was a [...] "remarkable nightmare". Thompson went on to compare the film to rampant Nazism, which she described as [...] "the abuse of power" [...] and [...] "the perverted betrayal of the best instincts". Thompson also claimed that the film depicted nature as being [...] "titanic" [...] while man was only [...] "a moving lichen on the stone of time". She concluded that the film was [...] "cruel", [...] "brutal and brutalizing", and a negative [...] "caricature of the Decline of the West". In fact, Thompson claimed that she was so distraught by the film that she even walked out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> she saw the two last segments, Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria, because she did not want to be subject to any more of the film's [...] "brutalization".|$|E
