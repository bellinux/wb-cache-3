5|$|The {{perceived}} {{shortcomings of}} the mass housing movement led to efforts to create cost-effective housing solutions that were more varied, more integrated with natural surroundings, and above all more customized to families' needs. In 1973, the Parliament of Norway recommended a shift toward small residential houses rather than large apartment buildings. The Norwegian State Housing Bank (Husbanken) provided citizens {{with the ability to}} fund construction <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> an entire construction industry formed to build these needs.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} {{launching}} of Toan Thang 44, the two battalions of the 3rd Brigade, U.S. 9th Infantry Division, crossed the border 48 kilometers southwest of the Fishhook into an area known as the Dog's Face from 7 through 12 May. The only significant contact with PAVN forces took place near the hamlet of Chantrea, where 51 North Vietnamese were killed and another 21 were captured. During the operation, the brigade lost eight men killed and 22 wounded. It {{was already too late}} for thousands of ethnic Vietnamese murdered by Cambodian persecution, but there were tens of thousands of Vietnamese still within the country who could now be evacuated to safety. South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu arranged with Lon Nol to repatriate as many as were willing to leave. The new relationship did not, however, prevent the Cambodian government from stripping the Vietnamese <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> other personal property before they left.|$|E

25|$|Thousands of Hindus, {{located in}} the districts of East Bengal which were awarded to Pakistan, found {{themselves}} being attacked and this religious persecution forced {{hundreds of thousands of}} Hindus from East Bengal to seek refuge in India.

25|$|Sentiment in Rogersville was divided. Many {{supported}} {{the efforts of}} twenty-six East Tennessee counties seceding from the state (much as the State of Scott had done) and re-joining the Union. Others saw President Lincoln's invasion of Tennessee as an unprecedented invasion <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> an incursion by Federal power; these people became strong Confederates. Rogersville was spared destruction during the war. In fact, structures such as the Hale Springs Inn were used by the different occupying armies.|$|E
25|$|Massport's {{relationship}} with nearby communities has been strained since the mid-1960s, when the agency {{took control of}} a parcel of residential land and popular fishing area near the northwest side of the airfield. This project was undertaken to extend Runway 15R/33L, which later became Logan's longest runway. Residents of the neighborhood, known as Wood Island, were bought out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> forced to relocate. Public opposition {{came to a head}} when residents lay down in the streets to block bulldozers and supply trucks from reaching the construction zone.|$|E
25|$|The raid on Beslan {{had more}} to do with the Ingush {{involved}} than the Chechens, but was highly symbolic for both nations. The Ossetes and Ingush had (and have) a conflict over ownership of the Prigorodny District, which hit high points during the 1944 Stalinist purges, and the ethnic cleansing of Ingush by Ossetes (the Ossetes getting assistance from the Russian military) in 1992-3. At the time of the raid, there were still over 40,000 Ingush refugees in tent camps in Ingushetia and Chechnya. The Beslan school itself had been used against the Ingush, as in 1992 the gym was used as a pen to round up Ingush during the ethnic cleansing by the Ossetes. For the Chechens, the motive was revenge for the destruction <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and,</b> indeed families: Beslan was one of the sites from which federal air raids were launched at Chechnya.|$|E

25|$|On August 13, 2005, the Gush Katif {{region was}} closed to non-residents, {{in keeping with the}} plan to {{evacuate}} the Katif bloc. Though effectively violating the Disengagement law, which most residents viewed as highly immoral and illegitimate, most settlers did not voluntarily leave their homes or even pack in preparation for the eviction. On August 15, 2005, the forcible evacuation of the Gush Katif settlements began. On August 22, 2005, the residents of the last settlement, Netzarim, were evicted. In essence, many residents returned to pack the contents <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> the Israeli government began the destruction of all residential buildings. On September 12, 2005, the Israeli Army withdrew from each settlement up to the Green Line. All public buildings (schools, libraries, community centres, office buildings) as well as industrial buildings, factories, and greenhouses which could not be taken apart were left intact.|$|E
25|$|Corsicans were notorious in Rome {{for their}} {{tendency}} to engage in fights and brawls, and the soldiers of the guard were no exception. Under the reign of UrbanVIII, on April21, 1642, Easter Monday, a fight broke out among Corsican soldiers and the Corazze ("cuirasses"), another Papal corps composed almost exclusively of men from Bologna, who were quartered at the slope of S. Onofrio on the Gianicolo hill. Two Corsicans died, and only the intervention of Cardinal-Nephew Francesco Barberini, who approached from nearby St. Peter's Basilica, {{put an end to}} the fight. The Corsicans did not give up, and during the following days fights broke out at Via della Lungara, Tor di Nona and Castel Sant'Angelo. Merchants and shopkeepers in Via dei Coronari and the surrounding lanes of rione Ponte were forced to barricade themselves, fearing the sacking <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> shops. In the end, only another intervention by Cardinal Barberini and many soldiers on May2 ended the fights. On the following day, gallows were set up near the hospital of Santo Spirito, in Borgo, and seven Corsican soldiers were hanged. Another one, who had killed a wounded corazza while a friar of Sant'Agostino was confessing him, was executed by hitting his head with a mallet.|$|E

500|$|However, this {{served only}} as a pretext as civilians were {{subjected}} to grueling interrogations and many were taken out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> beaten. The troops also arrested several adult males, often without any conclusive evidence, who they accused of being members of the militia. Additionally, {{if there was no}} response by the villagers to the ultimatum issued by the troops, an artillery barrage was launched above and over the village itself to further intimidate the civilians.|$|E

[...] Community organizers opposed the plan, fearing that uncontrolled redevelopment would uproot the poor and involuntarily push them out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> neighborhood.

40|$|Children’s {{perceptions}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> neighborhood environments, {{and their}} association with objectively measured physical activity: a qualitative and quantitative study C. Hume 1, 2, J. Salmon 1 and K. Ball 1 Environmental factors may have an important influence on children’s physical activity, yet children’s perspectives <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> neigh-borhood environments have not been widely assessed. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate children’s perceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> environments, and to examine associations between these per-ceptions and objectively measured physical ac-tivity. The sample consisted of 147, 10 -year-old Australian children, who drew maps <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> neighborhood environments. A sub-sample of children photographed places and things in these environments that were impor-tant to them. The maps were analyzed for themes, and for the frequency with which par-ticular objects and locations appeared. Physical activity was objectively measured using acceler-ometers. Six themes emerged from the qualita-tive analysis of the maps and photographs: the family home; opportunities for physical activity and sedentarypursuits; food items and locations; green space and outside areas; the school and opportunities for social interaction. Of the 11 variables established from these themes, one <b>home</b> <b>and</b> two neighborhood factors were asso-ciated with children’s physical activity. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of children’s perceptions <b>of</b> <b>their</b> environment, and highlight the potential importance of the <b>home</b> <b>and</b> neighborhood environments for pro-moting physical activity behavior...|$|R
