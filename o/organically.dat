5|$|As a {{political}} philosophy, one-nation conservatism reflects {{the belief that}} societies exist and develop <b>organically,</b> and that members within them have obligations towards each other. There is particular emphasis on the paternalistic obligation {{of those who are}} privileged and wealthy to the poorer parts of society.|$|E
5|$|In {{the music}} video Mutual Core {{directed}} by Andrew Thomas Huang, Björk is <b>organically</b> {{part of nature}} and universe. The human connection to nature is a theme that underpins most of her artistic output. It’s particularly meaningful to bring Björk’s vision to 7 continents because of its relevance to all cultures.|$|E
5|$|Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof {{redevelopment}} (Stuttgart 21), in Stuttgart, Germany; {{a project}} to realign the Deutsche Bahn's rail lines {{so they can be}} joined to the intra-European network. The sub-terranean station will be roofed with a public park, with <b>organically</b> shaped, reinforced concrete shells with petal-shaped sections terminating as skylights. The project is due for completion in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Boston's streets grew <b>organically,</b> {{so they do}} {{not form}} a planned grid, unlike those in later-developed Back Bay, East Boston, the South End, and South Boston. Boston is the eastern {{terminus}} of I-90, which in Massachusetts runs along the Massachusetts Turnpike. The elevated portion of the Central Artery, which carried most of the through traffic in downtown Boston, was replaced with the O'Neill Tunnel during the Big Dig, substantially completed in early 2006.|$|E
5|$|The 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion {{was one of}} four {{machine gun}} battalions that were raised as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) for service {{overseas}} during the Second World War. Motorised infantry units, equipped with wheeled motor vehicles, motor cycles and sometimes tracked carriers, the machine gun battalions were formed to provide a greater level of support by fire than that which was <b>organically</b> available within ordinary infantry battalions.|$|E
5|$|The 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion {{was one of}} four {{machine gun}} battalions that were raised as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) for service {{overseas}} during World War II. Motorised infantry units, equipped with wheeled motor vehicles, motorcycles and sometimes tracked carriers, the machine gun battalions were formed to provide a greater level of support by fire than that which was <b>organically</b> available within ordinary infantry battalions. At its peak, the 2/3rd was equipped with 124 motor vehicles of various descriptions and 50 motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|Thematically, Rebel Heart {{represents}} the singer's romantic and rebellious sides. The themes grew <b>organically</b> during the writing and recording sessions. Musically, it is a pop record which merges {{an array of}} genres such as 1990s house, trap, and reggae, {{as well as the}} use of acoustic guitars and gospel choir. Some of the songs are autobiographical in nature while others talk about love and Madonna's career. Rebel Heart features guest appearances by boxer Mike Tyson and rappers Nicki Minaj, Nas and Chance the Rapper.|$|E
5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed <b>organically.</b> All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E
5|$|Gjirokastër is principally a {{commercial}} center with some industries, notably {{the production of}} foodstuffs, leather, and textiles. Recently a regional agricultural market that trades locally produced groceries has {{been built in the}} city. Given the potential of southern Albania to supply <b>organically</b> grown products, and its relationship with Greek counterparts of the nearby city of Ioannina, {{it is likely that the}} market will dedicate itself to organic farming in the future. However, currently trademarking and marketing of such products are far from European standards. The Chamber of Commerce of the city, created in 1988, promotes trade with the Greek border areas. As part of the financial support from Greece to Albania, the Hellenic Armed Forces built a hospital in the city.|$|E
5|$|Salvin {{aimed to}} create a castle that would appear to have grown up <b>organically</b> over time, but still appeal to Victorian {{aesthetic}} taste. Accordingly, a large, square tower {{was built on the}} west side of the castle and another smaller tower on the east, both creating additional space but also making the castle deliberately asymmetrical. The 18th-century chapel at the rear was demolished and replaced with another tower, alongside a modern conservatory. A variety of windows in the styles of different historical periods were inserted in the walls, while modern Victorian technology, including gas lighting-supported by a gas plant in the basement-central heating and new kitchens were installed within the castle. The roof of the Great Gatehouse was raised {{to create a}} more uniform sequence of battlements, and a large hall for gatherings of the local farmers installed. A new wing of servants' quarters and offices were sunk into the hill, spread over two floors leading away from the main part of the mansion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Organically</b> moderated {{reactors}} (OMR) use biphenyl and terphenyl as moderator and coolant.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Brooks Museum and Dixon Gallery and Gardens, Memphis plays host to two burgeoning visual art areas, one city-sanctioned, and the other <b>organically</b> formed.|$|E
25|$|Peregrine had {{offices in}} the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific and grew its product line rapidly both <b>organically</b> and via acquisitions, {{including}} Harbinger Corporation in 2000, and Remedy Corporation in 2001.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} sign languages, Auslan's grammar and {{vocabulary}} {{is quite different}} from English. Its development cannot be attributed to any individual; rather, it is a natural language that developed <b>organically</b> over time.|$|E
25|$|Most Modern Orthodox Jews {{will agree}} that, while certain laws within the Oral Law {{were given to}} Moses, most of the Talmudic laws were derived <b>organically</b> by the Rabbis of the Mishnaic and Talmudic eras.|$|E
25|$|The <b>organically</b> {{designed}} {{private residence}} {{was intended to}} be a nature retreat for its owners. The house is well-known for its connection to the site; it is built on top of an active waterfall which flows beneath the house.|$|E
25|$|Volney {{argued that}} Abraham and Sarah {{were derived from}} Brahma and his wife Saraswati, whereas Christ was related to Krishna. Volney made use of a draft version of Dupuis' work and at times {{differed}} from him, e.g. in arguing that the gospel stories were not intentionally created, but were compiled <b>organically.</b>|$|E
25|$|Research and {{development}} (R) at General Motors began <b>organically</b> as {{the continuation of}} such R as the various divisions (e.g., Cadillac, Buick, Olds, Oakland) were already doing for themselves before the merger. Its character was entirely empirical; it was whatever key people in each company had been competent enough to organize and pursue.|$|E
25|$|Activated carbon filters (AC filters) {{can be used}} {{to filter}} vodka and whiskey of organic {{impurities}} which can affect color, taste, and odor. Passing an <b>organically</b> impure vodka through an activated carbon filter at the proper flow rate will result in vodka with an identical alcohol content and significantly increased organic purity, as judged by odor and taste.|$|E
25|$|Since 1995, {{the cities}} of Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield have {{assembled}} together in the Core Cities Group. This organisation accords no distinct legal status on these councils over any other city council in England but appears to be <b>organically</b> moving towards some kind of recognition of their role as regional capitals outside London.|$|E
25|$|<b>Organically</b> Grown Company, {{the largest}} {{distributor}} of organic {{fruits and vegetables}} in the northwest, started in Eugene in 1978 as a non-profit co-op for organic farmers. Notable local food processors, many of whom manufacture certified organic products, include Golden Temple (Yogi Tea), Merry Hempsters and Springfield Creamery (Nancy's Yogurt & owned by the Kesey Family), and Mountain Rose Herbs.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, {{this era}} saw mostly steady growth and a {{relatively}} low level of financial crises. In contrast to the Bretton Woods system, the pre–World War I financial order was not created at a single high level conference; rather it evolved <b>organically</b> {{in a series of}} discrete steps. The Gilded Age, a time of especially rapid development in North America, falls into this period.|$|E
25|$|Her <b>organically</b> {{abstract}} {{paintings of}} one or two colors (the Infinity Nets series), which she began upon arriving in New York, garnered comparisons to the work of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman. When she left New York she was practically forgotten as an artist until the late 1980s and 1990s, when a number of retrospectives revived international interest.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Hinson (2006) {{analyzed}} {{available data}} from several studies {{conducted by the}} USBR (2001-2004), Idaho Power Company (IPC) (1995-2002), IDFG, Idaho Transportation Department (2003-2004) and others, and demonstrated {{a positive relationship between}} Utah valvata snail presence and macrophytes, depth, and fine substrates. One study reported Utah valvata snails in <b>organically</b> enriched fine sediments with a heavy macrophyte community, downstream of an aquaculture facility (rm 588).|$|E
25|$|Many {{hectares}} {{are grown}} <b>organically</b> {{and have been}} certified as organic for decades. The Maule Valley produces good value everyday wines of quality that has been improving over the years. There are also old-bush, dry-farmed vineyards that produce naturally balanced field blends of Carignan, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, and other yet to be identified varieties. Newer plantations include Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Carmenere with bright acidity and juicy fruit notes.|$|E
25|$|After {{purchasing}} the property, he produced wine under the Niebaum-Coppola label. When he purchased the former Inglenook Winery chateau in 1995, he renamed the winery Rubicon Estate Winery in 2006. On 11 April 2011, Coppola acquired the iconic Inglenook trademark paying more, he said, for the trademark {{than he did}} for the entire estate and announced that the estate would once again be known by its historic original name, Inglenook. Its grapes are now entirely <b>organically</b> grown.|$|E
25|$|Most {{interstellar}} travel concepts {{require a}} developed space logistics system capable of moving millions of metric tons to a construction / operating location, and most would require gigawatt scale power for construction or power (such as Star Wisp or Light Sail type concepts). Such a system could grow <b>organically</b> if space-based solar power became a significant component of Earth's energy mix. Consumer {{demand for a}} multi-terawatt system would automatically create the necessary multi-million metric ton/year logistical system.|$|E
25|$|The area is Alberta’s {{refining}} and petrochemical centre – {{notably the}} “Industrial Heartland” northeast of Edmonton. That industrial region has grown <b>organically</b> {{since the late}} 1940s, when Imperial Oil brought a tin-pot World War II refinery down from Whitehorse to process crude from Leduc and the other new fields. Now the beneficiary of more than $25 billion in investment, this 582-square-kilometre region hosts 40 large companies and many small ones. Together they operate refineries and petrochemical plants, an upgrader, pipelines, service companies and numerous other interdependent businesses.|$|E
25|$|The solid, fibrous {{component}} of the digested material {{can be used as}} a soil conditioner to increase the organic content of soils. Digester liquor {{can be used as a}} fertiliser to supply vital nutrients to soils instead of chemical fertilisers that require large amounts of energy to produce and transport. The use of manufactured fertilisers is, therefore, more carbon-intensive than the use of anaerobic digester liquor fertiliser. In countries such as Spain, where many soils are <b>organically</b> depleted, the markets for the digested solids can be equally as important as the biogas.|$|E
25|$|Beyond its {{increasingly}} visible role providing <b>organically</b> grown {{food for}} the School Dining Hall, the 270-acre Hotchkiss Farm is also where art classes can practice plein air painting, poetry classes can find inspiration, environmental science classes can explore terrain that includes rare grassland bird habitats, and American history classes can reflect {{on the fact that}} this was once part of a land grant from King George III. When completed, farm trails will add an estimated three to five miles to the six or more that already traverse the Hotchkiss Woods.|$|E
25|$|For Marine City, Kikutake {{proposed}} {{a city that}} would float free in the ocean and would be free of ties to a particular nation and therefore free {{from the threat of}} war. The artificial ground of the city would house agriculture, industry and entertainment and the residential towers would descend into the ocean to a depth of 200 metres. The city itself was not tied to the land and was free to float across the ocean and grow <b>organically</b> like an organism. Once it became too aged for habitation it would sink itself.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, Price Waterhouse had gained {{significant}} recognition as an accounting firm. As {{a result of}} growing trade between the United Kingdom and the United States, Price Waterhouse opened an office in New York in 1890, and the American firm itself soon expanded rapidly. The original British firm opened an office in Liverpool in 1904 and then elsewhere in the United Kingdom and worldwide, each time establishing a separate partnership in each country: the worldwide practice of PW was therefore a federation of collaborating firms that had grown <b>organically</b> rather than being {{the result of an}} international merger.|$|E
25|$|A Yat accent, is a creole {{accent and}} is {{considered}} an identity marker of white, metropolitan {{people who have been}} raised in the greater New Orleans area. Speakers with a New Orleans accent are typically proud of their accent as it <b>organically</b> stems from the historical mixing of language and culture. This distinctive accent has been dying out generationally in the city due to white flight of the city, but remains very strong in the suburbs. However, the creole Yat dialect does survive in the city in several areas, notably Mid-city, Lakeview, parts of Gentilly and Uptown.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 AECL {{partnered with}} the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario to build Canada's first {{nuclear power plant}} at Rolphton, Ontario, which is 30km {{upstream}} from Chalk River. On June 4, 1962 the NPD (Nuclear Power Demonstration) first reactor went critical to demonstrate the CANDU concept, generating about 20 MWe. In 1963, AECL established the Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment (now Whiteshell Laboratories) in Pinawa, Manitoba where an <b>organically</b> moderated and cooled reactor was built. Later work on developing a SLOWPOKE reactor, thorium fuel cycle, and a proposal for safe storage of radioactive waste were carried out at this site.|$|E
25|$|The Shang dynasty oracle bone {{script and}} the Zhou dynasty scripts found on Chinese bronze {{inscriptions}} {{are no longer}} used; the oldest script that is still in use today is the Seal Script (篆書(书), zhuànshū). It evolved <b>organically</b> out of the Spring and Autumn period Zhou script, and was adopted in a standardized form under the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. The seal script, as the name suggests, is now used only in artistic seals. Few people are still able to read it effortlessly today, although the art of carving a traditional seal in the script remains alive; some calligraphers also work in this style.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} grew <b>organically</b> {{starting in}} 1990 {{with the first}} cassette tape. Connections were made when women in colleges started duplicating and sharing tapes. Offers to play at colleges started coming in and her popularity grew largely {{by word of mouth}} and through women's groups or organizations. Zango and Goldenrod, two music distributors specializing in women's music, started carrying DiFranco's music. In general they sold music to independent music stores and women's book stores. In 1995 Righteous Babe Records signed with Koch International for DiFranco's release of Not a Pretty Girl. Her records could then be found in large and small record stores alike.|$|E
