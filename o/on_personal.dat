5|$|Apathetic agnosticism: The {{view that}} no amount of debate can prove or {{disprove}} the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they {{do not appear to be}} concerned about the fate of humans. Therefore, their existence has little to no impact <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> human affairs and should be of little interest.|$|E

5|$|Hensley's theology, {{with the}} {{exception}} of his snake handling, was typical of other fundamentalist Pentecostal churches. His teachings <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> holiness bore a resemblance to doctrines of the Wesleyan Holiness tradition.

First-year students begin the BGeX program during the BGeX Introduction Weekend {{prior to the start}} of the semester and continued taking courses designed to meet BGeX criteria throughout the four years of the undergraduate programs.|$|E
5|$|The Commission's final report, {{released}} in May 1940, reflected many of Macdonald's recommendations.

5|$|There {{are also}} times when players and even entire teams carry <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> rivalries that {{have little to}} do with {{individual}} games; fights frequently occur for no other reason.

5|$|Avoiding {{stereotypes}} and labeling based <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as uniforms. Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, {{which is a}} visible reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell {{at the conclusion of}} the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.|$|E
5|$|Black Elk (Lakota) was a {{medicine}} man and heyokha, whose life spanned {{the transition to}} reservations. His accounts of the 19th-century Indian Wars and Ghost Dance movement, and his deep thoughts <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> visions and Native American religion, {{form the basis of}} the book Black Elk Speaks, first published in 1932. (Among several editions, a premier annotated edition was published in 2008.) Paul Goble, an award-winning children's book author and illustrator, has been based in the Black Hills since 1977.|$|E

5|$|Coexist is the 2012 second studio album by English indie pop {{band the}} xx. After {{a break from}} touring for their 2009 self-titled first album, the band members began to write songs {{individually}} before they recorded Coexist from November 2011 to May 2012. For the album, the xx drew <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> experiences for their songwriting, while their music {{was influenced by the}} electronic dance scene that occurred when they had been away on tour. The album was produced by the band's Jamie Smith, who had pursued electronic dance on other projects and developed as a DJ prior to the album.|$|E
5|$|Cricket is {{more similar}} to {{baseball}} than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by {{the importance of the}} batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> responsibility in this area of play.|$|E
5|$|Emboldened by his success, Diệm {{began to}} plot Bảo Đại's downfall. He {{scheduled}} a referendum for 23 October 1955 and pushed Bảo Đại {{out of the}} political scene, hindering the former emperor's attempts to derail the poll. In the period {{leading up to the}} vote, campaigning for Bảo Đại was banned, while Diệm's election campaign focused <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> attacks against Bảo Đại. These included pornographic cartoons of the head of state and unverified rumours claiming he was illegitimate and linking him to various mistresses. The government-controlled media launched polemical attacks on Bảo Đại, and police went door-to-door, warning people of the consequences of failing to vote. After his brother Ngô Đình Nhu successfully rigged the poll, Diệm proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam.|$|E

She was not the only Jets relative deceived – cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> business, and when his father picked him up at Philadelphia International Airport, he congratulated his son on a Jets triumph.|$|E
5|$|In San Antonio de Béxar, Ugartechea asked Dr. Launcelot Smither, a Gonzales {{resident}} in town <b>on</b> <b>personal</b> business, to help Castañeda convince the settlers to follow orders. When Smither arrived on October 1, {{he met with}} militia captain Mathew Caldwell to explain that the soldiers meant no harm if the settlers would peacefully relinquish the cannon. Caldwell instructed Smither to bring Castañeda to the town the following morning to discuss the matter. At roughly the same time, Moore called a war council, which quickly voted to initiate a fight. It is unclear whether the war council was aware that Caldwell had promised Castañeda safe passage to Gonzales the next morning.|$|E
