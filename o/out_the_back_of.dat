5|$|In American football, if {{what would}} {{normally}} be a safety is scored on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt (officially known in the rulebooks as a try), one point is awarded to the scoring team. This {{is commonly known as}} a conversion safety or one-point safety and it can be scored by the offense. There are at least two known occurrences of the conversion safety in Division I college football– a November 26, 2004 game in which Texas scored against Texas A, and the 2013 Fiesta Bowl in which Oregon scored against Kansas State. In both games, the point-after-touchdown kick was blocked, recovered by the defense, and then fumbled or thrown back into the end zone. Coincidentally, play-by-play commentator Brad Nessler of the ESPN family of networks (currently with CBS) called both of these games. No conversion safeties have been scored in the NFL since 1940, although it is now slightly more likely after the rule change in 2015 which allowed the defense to take possession and score on a conversion attempt. Before 2015, the only scenario in which a one-point safety could have been scored in the NFL would have involved the defense kicking or batting a loose ball <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the end zone without taking possession of it. After the 2015 rule change, a one-point safety can also be scored after the defense takes possession and fumbles out of their own end zone or is tackled in it after leaving it, as in the NCAA.|$|E

After the Bavarians mauled Chasteler's regulars at Wörgl, the Austrian general abandoned the Tyrol and attempted to join with the retreating army in Hungary. The victory allowed the Bavarians to temporarily reoccupy Innsbruck, though not without additional fighting. The Tyrolean Rebellion, however, was far from over. Even after the regular Austrian armies met defeat at the Battle of Wagram in early July, the revolt resisted all efforts to stamp it <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the rebellion was finally broken in November and only fizzed out in February 1810.|$|E
500|$|In American football, {{intentionally}} conceded safeties are {{an uncommon}} strategy. Teams have utilized elective safeties to gain field {{position for a}} punt when pinned deep in their own territory and, when ahead {{near the end of}} a game, to run down the clock so as to deny the other team a chance to force a turnover or return a punt. Teams have also taken intentional safeties by kicking a loose ball <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> their end zone, with the intent of preventing the defense from scoring a touchdown.|$|E

500|$|In a world {{populated}} by anthropomorphic vehicles, the last {{race of the}} Piston Cup championship ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran Strip [...] "The King" [...] Weathers, infamous runner-up Chick Hicks, and rookie Lightning McQueen. The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway in California. McQueen is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow {{him to leave the}} unglamorous sponsorship of Rusteze, a bumper ointment company, and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, Mack drifts off, and is startled by a gang of four reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, but ends up lost in the run-down desert town of Radiator Springs, while inadvertently ruining the pavement of its main road.|$|E

2500|$|The Source Four is {{the first}} ERS to use a faceted {{borosilicate}} reflector behind the lamp. [...] Nearly all stage lights {{have some form of}} reflector positioned behind the lamp to reflect otherwise wasted light out of the front of the instrument. [...] The Source Four's reflector is dichroic, meaning that it reflects light of only certain wavelengths. [...] The Source Four's reflector reflects back 95% of the visible light striking it, while allowing over 90% of the infrared radiation (heat) to pass <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the instrument. This produces a much cooler light which is less destructive to gobos or color gels {{at the front of the}} fixture, and reduces localized heating of the lighting target.|$|E

The leading group of four had 1'24" [...] on the Mazzoleni group {{at the top of}} Passo Tre Croci and a further three minutes on the pink jersey group, meaning Mazzoleni was very nearly the virtual race leader on the road. Mazzoleni dropped Savoldelli and Rasmussen as the stage went on, and finished five minutes before them.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{dismissed}} from TV Jones, Tek proceeded {{to form a}} new band with longtime friend Rob Younger, with the addition of Chris Masuak, Warwick Gilbert, Pip Hoyle and Ron Keeley, and called themselves Radio Birdman, after a misheard Stooges lyric. Radio Birdman were arguably the most successful band that Tek was associated with, despite the band's initial shunning from the Australian music scene. The Radio Birdman sound was unconventional and raw and echos the Motor City influences of Tek's youth. Birdman are often attributed with the initiation of the Australian indie rock scene, as after being repeatedly rejected from various clubs and bars in the Sydney area, Birdman took it upon themselves to record and release their first recording Burn My Eye, and distribute it <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the band members' station wagons. Radio Birdman began a world tour in 1977 travelling to England and playing a few shows around London as well as recording their second album Living Eyes, until in 1978 the band broke up mid-tour due to [...] "personality conflict".|$|E

2500|$|Max Tackett, a 33-year-old Arkansas State Police officer rookie at the time, {{realized}} that a car had been stolen on the nights of the murders, and a previously stolen car was found abandoned. On Friday, June 28, 1946, Tackett found a car that had been reported stolen in a parking lot. He staked out the car until someone came back to it. He arrested a 21-year-old woman. She said she had just married her husband in Shreveport, but he was currently in Atlanta, Texas trying to sell another stolen car. Homer Carter, chief of police in Atlanta, told Tackett that a man had tried selling a stolen car {{to one of his}} citizens. Tackett asked the citizen if he would recognize the suspect, but the man said that he would not. Tackett noticed that the citizen had a distinct look, which included a cowboy hat and boots. Tackett told the citizen, [...] "You wouldn't recognize him, but he would recognize you." [...] Max then asked the citizen if {{he would be willing to}} walk with him into several public places. Tackett had the idea that the suspect would not want to see the citizen and would try to avoid him. On a Saturday in July, Tackett walked into the Arkansas Motor Coach bus station on Front Street, near Union Station, with the citizen. Tackett saw a man run <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the building. He chased after him and caught him on the fire escape. The man, Youell Swinney, would not talk, but his wife Peggy confessed in great detail that he was the Phantom Killer and that he killed Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin.|$|E
