40|$|The zonal surface torque budget {{associated}} with the tropical wind stress anomalies during El Niño/Southern Oscillation is analyzed.

During El Niño, eastward <b>torque</b> anomalies <b>over</b> the central equatorial Pacific are largely compensated by westward anomalies elsewhere in the equatorial band, notably <b>over</b> South America. <b>Torque</b> anomalies <b>over</b> South America and the Pacific in latitude bands {{north and south of}} the equator are both westward and are not compensated within the band, implying an export of eastward momentum to higher latitudes...|$|R
6000|$|His {{generosity}} did {{not extend}} to living-quarters. Most of the students lived at the hangars and dined on Hamburg sandwiches, fried eggs, and Mexican enchiladas, served at a lunch-wagon anchored near the field. That lunch-wagon was their club. Here, squatted on high stools, treating one another to ginger-ale, they argued <b>over</b> <b>torque</b> and angles of incidence and monoplanes vs. biplanes. Except for two unpopular aristocrats who found boarding-houses in San Mateo, they slept in the hangars, in their overalls, sprawled on mattresses covered with horse-blankets. It was bed at eight-thirty. At four or five Carmeau would crawl out, scratch his beard, start a motor, and set every neighborhood dog howling. The students would gloomily clump over to the lunch-wagon for a ham-and-egg breakfast. The first flights began at dawn, if the day was clear. At eight, when the wind was coming up, they would {{be heard in the}} workshop, adjusting and readjusting, machining down bearings, testing wing strength, humming and laughing and busy; a life of gasoline and hammers and straining attempts to get balance exactly right; a happy life of good fellows and the achievements of machinery and preparation for daring the upper air; a life of very ordinary mechanics and of sheer romance! ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} Digital PI Controller Using Anti Wind-Up Mechanism For A Speed Controlled Electric Drive System. To eliminate the system zeros relocated proportional integral controller is implemented. Which in turn reduces the <b>over</b> shoots. The <b>torque</b> is not limited, inspite {{of the use of}} relocated proportional integral controller. The motor windings get damaged, if the torque reaches higher values. In order to limit this torque, we introduce a torque limiter, which limits the torque value to the permissible limits. Due to limited <b>torque,</b> <b>over</b> shoots are produced for large inputs. To eliminate these overshoots, with limited torque, we implement the anti-windup mechanism.

With ever improving reliability and performance of digital devices, digital control techniques are fast catching popularity due to software flexibility and low cost.

5000|$|Designed by Roy Fedden, {{assisted}} by Alec Moulton, Ian Duncan, Peter Ware, and Gordon Wilkins, the styling resembled the contemporary Jowett Javelin, with a sloping rear, four doors, seating for six, and rear spats.

The car was powered by a horizontally-mounted [...] sleeve valve three-cylinder air-cooled radial engine, which had the carburettor between the rear window and the passenger compartment.

25|$|In December 2009 Alison Grieve, a 32-year-old {{waitress}} and event manager from Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, {{witnessed a}} waitress drop a tray full of glasses of champagne at a corporate event for {{a delegation of}} international lawyers. To address how a tray could right itself {{at the moment of}} impending tilt, Grieve, a first-time inventor with a university background in 'History of film and photography', developed a finger receiver attached to the bottom of a wait tray based on first-principle physics, load dispersal, and counter movement. In a closed position, the finger receiver lays flush with the bottom of the wait tray so that the tray can sit on the surface of a bar or table without wobbling and can be stacked onto other trays. When the device is open, two slots can be accessed into which a waitperson may secure their two inside fingers, similar to how a flip-flop structurally attaches itself between the toes of the foot to counter the large stresses place upon it. The Safetray product's arrangement creates a strong cantilever advantage for the waitperson to allow them additional control <b>over</b> <b>torque</b> caused by items placed in various locations around the tray. The stability achieved with the Safetray product allows a waitperson to place a bottle of wine right {{at the edge of the}} tray while still keeping the tray in a horizontal position by reacting instinctively against the bottle's off-balance downward force.|$|R

40|$|There is a {{requirement}} (within the food packaging industry) for a greater analytical knowledge and more scientific understanding of the ROPP capping process and of the interaction of caps (closures) with the threaded part of the glass container (finish). Threads used within the industry have largely developed empirically from metal thread profiles. An improved understanding is needed so that problems associated with that process can be better understood and solved. Such problems can be manifest in damaged closures, ‘spinners’ and closures that are just too difficult to open. The term ‘spinners’ is used for closures that do not break the pilfer band (a tamper evident safety feature) when twisted. The same term {{is also used to}} describe closures that have been turned the wrong way (i. e. clockwise) on opening, stripping the thread whilst not breaking the pilfer band. To combat this problem it is desirable to produce a closure system that has a high torque when twisted in the wrong direction (known as the <b>over</b> <b>torque)</b> whilst maintaining good seal integrity and a low torque for correct opening procedure. A successful feasibility study was carried out to investigate the appropriateness of using finite element techniques to investigate closure systems and gain the required understanding to improve these systems. The follow on project utilised these finite element techniques and experimental testing using a single-head capping machine. The Project focuses on the industry standard glass thread finish called the GF 305 that utilises an extra deep, aluminium ROPP closure. The results of this work so far are presented here...|$|R

Thus, a modeling of PMSM operating constraints (voltage saturation, current limitation, etc.) is carried out at first. This enables an appropriate analysis of PMSM performances within its operating boundaries. As a result, PMSM efficiency maps can be achieved, which allow the identification of suitable operating conditions for HS-FESS.
