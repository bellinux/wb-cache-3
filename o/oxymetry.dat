40|$|Carried {{out within}} {{the project of}} the German Research Foundation (DFG) “ECG Mapping Proceedings on a Heart Surface Defined by Ultrasound” (He 1669 / 11), this study aimed at {{developing}} and characterising an isolated heart model. In particular, basic conditions for a perfusion with preferable physiological cardiac activity should be established. In order to validate a clinically used ECG mapping system, a model of an independently beating and perfused heart had to be developed, aiming at recording reproducibly the excitation cycle of a filled heart in an electrically homogeneous medium. Seven porcine hearts were surgically explanted and perfused for 280 minutes in a four-chamber working heart mode {{so as to make}} haemodynamic, biochemical and electrophysiological measurements, which were used to validate and characterise the perfusion system. A blood mixture was used as perfusate, allowing oxygen transportation to occur in a physiological way. Furthermore, a higher oncotic pressure was provided compared to crystalloid solutions, preventing thus oedema development within the myocardium. The perfusate oxygenated, dialysed and temperated. After reperfusing the porcine heart, it was inserted into a spherical bowl fitted with 75 electrodes, which allowed recording the ECG mapping data in an electrically homogeneous medium. The heart was prepared and connected to the system. First, it was perfused using the Langendorff mode. After stabilization of heart activity it was filled antegradly via the atrium while independently beating in the working-heart modus (average heart rate of 70 - 81 min- 1) and performing pressure-volume work. While perfusing the heart, <b>oxymetries</b> and blood gas analyses were carried out in regular intervals, and other parameters were checked in the laboratory in order to examine the organ’s quality. A left atrial preload of 3, 7 - 7, 4 mmHg and a median aortic afterload of 55, 1 - 57, 4 mmHg lead to an average inflow of 848 - 1085 ml/min into the left atrium. The average aortic flow remained stable during the first 80 minutes of perfusion (576 - 600 ml/min), decreasing continuously thereafter. Since the heart was isolated and not subjected to neuronal or humoral control, {{it was not possible to}} attain physiological values for all parameters. Haemodynamic values did not reach the reference values, coinciding with results of other studies. Proceeding deterioration, a known issue with isolated perfusion, was indicated by increasing values of LDH (MW: 1029 U/l after 120 minutes of steady-state) and GOT (MW: 279 U/l after 120 minutes of steady-state). The presented model was developed in order to examine a new method of ECG mapping, delivering well comparable and proportionate ECG curves for the interval of perfusion, thus providing the opportunity of showing local changes in heart activity independent from anatomical features or interaction of the electrodes and the heart’s surface. During the experiment, P duration (85 ± 27 ms – 120 ± 41 ms) and the PQ interval (159 ± 56 ms– 190 ± 43 ms) remained close to reference values. The QRS interval (115 ± 14 ms – 129 ± 11 ms) was similar to the results presented in other studies with isolated hearts. However, the QT interval (417 ± 85 ms – 462 ± 58 ms) was larger than in other studies with isolated hearts and in vivo. The QRS (988 ± 409 µV – 1549 ± 759 µV) and T amplitudes (535 ± 222 µV– 885 ± 335 µV) tended to increase during the first half of the perfusion, decreasing afterwards. ECG voltages and intervals are affected by various factors. Under constant perfusion conditions however, variating conductibility of the myocardium, which changes due to myocardial oedema or myocardial ischaemia, remains a main factor. The perfusion method applied in this study permitted the conduction of ECG maps in an electrically homogeneous medium without attaching electrodes to the surface of a completely filled heart. ECG mapping data was collected in order to validate the clinical usage of ECG mapping systems and to enhance the model. A physical doctoral thesis carried out in the same framework aimed at the fluorimetric characterisation of metabolic activity of ex vivo perfused pig hearts. At the stage of evaluation, technical as well as experimental limitations arising from the model’s complexity became evident. Complexity, however, was a requisite within the DFG project. It is advisable for further research to choose a suitable model for the respective question, which is less complex and adapted to the experimental framework.

Due to the large use of this association in elective neutering of felines and its anesthetic properties, we chose to monitorize and identify electrocardiographic (ECG) and clinical changes during the anesthetic procedure, with and without oxygen supplementation. For this study, 20 female felines were recruited. All animals were young adults, healthy, no specific breed.

All these features make DOT, an excellent candidate for the continuous monitoring of brain <b>oxymetry.</b> On the other hand, DOT also presents some important disadvantages such as the low spatial resolution and the high computational power required to produce images. The aim of this research was to apply non linear signal processing techniques and analysis methods to obtain significant improvements in brain imaging. The main contributions include: the establishment of a methodology for the incorporation of functional and anatomical a priori information based on MRI scans and physiology assessments; the development of a novel method for fast image reconstruction in DOT based on the use of reduced-order models of the propagation of light; a comparative study of two model representation, namely polynomial and Radial Basis Function (RBF) reduced- order models and an investigation on the applicability of these methods in three-dimensional imaging.

40|$|Com o crescimento da utilização da artéria radial como enxerto em operações de revascularização tornou-se importante a avaliação fidedigna da integridade da arcada palmar em cada paciente a fim de se prevenir complicações vasculares da mão. Classicamente, utiliza-se para esta finalidade o teste de Allen, que é baseado em avaliação subjetiva da coloração da mão ao se comprimir os pulsos radial e ulnar e, portanto, mais sujeitos a erros de interpretação. Com a finalidade de avaliação objetiva, propusemos a realização do teste, analisando-se a perfusão através da oximetria de pulso, método simples e facilmente disponível em centro cirúrgico. Objetivo: Os autores apresentam uma nova proposta para avaliação da perfusão e integridade da arcada palmar com a utilização do oxímetro de pulso e comparam os dados obtidos por este método com os do teste de Allen. Método: Foram estudadas 50 artérias radiais, 50 artérias ulnares de 25 pacientes em decúbito dorsal, com idade igual ou {{superior}} a 45 anos, sendo 19 do sexo masculino e 6 do sexo feminino, em condições cardio-respiratórias estáveis e sem alterações vasculares periféricas conhecidas em membros superiores. O oxímetro utilizado foi o da marca Ohmeda, sendo o Doppler portátil de fluxo contínuo da Medical Eletronics. A princípio colocou-se o dedal do oxímetro no dedo indicador de cada mão anotando-se a saturação que chamamos de inicial. Verificou-se ao Doppler os pulsos radial e ulnar. Foi realizado o teste de Allen em cada mão comprimindo-se digitalmente ambas as artérias, com o oxímetro no 2 º dedo e observando-se o desaparecimento da onda de pulso. Após isso, descomprimiu-se a artéria ulnar retornando a onda de pulso e medindo-se a saturação final. Houve queda de 0 a 2 pontos, no valor da saturação, em 96 % dos casos. O Doppler foi utilizado distalmente à compressão da artéria radial mostrando não haver fluxo nesta artéria. Resultado: O teste de Allen mostrou-se satisfatório em 35 (70 %) procedimentos; insatisfatórios em 15 (30 %); a oximetria resultou normal em 49 (98 %) procedimentos com queda importante de sua saturação em apenas 1 (2 %) caso, no qual o teste de Allen foi insatisfatório. Conclusões: Observamos que houve diferença significativa entre resultados do teste de Allen e do oxímetro, levando-nos ao questionamento da validade do teste de Allen quanto à sua eficácia, por tratar-se de um método subjetivo em contraposição a um método objetivo (oxímetro), conseqüentemente, estaríamos deixando de utilizar a artéria radial como enxerto em 26 % dos casos avaliados pelo teste de Allen. With {{the increasing}} {{utilization of the}} radial artery as a graft in CABG a reliable evaluation of {{the integrity of the}} palmar arch in each patient, is important in order to prevent classically vascular complications of the hand, one uses the Allen test, which is based on a subjective evaluation of the colour change of the hand, when the radial and ulnar pulse are pressed and, therefore, more prone to misinterpretations. For an objective evaluation, we propose this test, analyzing perfusion through pulse <b>oxymetry,</b> a simple method easily available in the operating room. Purpose: The authors present a new proposal to evaluate perfusion and integrity of the palmar arch by pulse <b>oxymetry,</b> comparing information obtained through method with the one obtained through the Allen test. Method: Fifty radial and 50 ulnar arteries from 25 patients in prone position were studied. Patients were 45 years or over, 19 males and 6 females, in stable cardiorespiratory conditions, and free of known peripheral vascular disease in the upper limbs. The oxymeter used was from Ohmeda, and the portable Doppler, with continuous flow from Medical Electronics. At first, the probe was put over the index finger of each hand sequentially observing the saturation level which we called initial. The Doppler was used for the radial and ulnar pulses. The Allen test was performed in each hand, digitally compressing both arteries, with the oxymeter in the second finger, observing the disappearance of the pulse wave. The ulnar artery was then released, causing the return of the pulse wave and obtaining the final saturation. In 96 % of cases, there was a drop in saturation ranging from 0 to 2 points. The Doppler probe was located distally to the compression of the radial artery, showing no flow in it. Results: The Allen test proved to be satisfactory (return of colour to the hand in 5 seconds or less) in 35 procedures (70 %), and unsatisfactory in 15 of them (30 %). The <b>oxymetry</b> was normal in 49 procedures (98 %), with an important saturation drop in just one case (2 %), in which the Allen test was unsatisfactory. Conclusions: We observed a rather meaningful difference between the results from the Allen test and those from <b>oxymetry,</b> leading one to question the validity of the Allen test regarding its efficacy, since it is a subjective method compared to an objective one (<b>oxymetry).</b> Therefore, we could not be using the radial artery as a graft in 26 % of the cases evaluated through the Allen test...|$|E

ABG sampling is however a painful and invasive act, exposing both {{the patient and the}} healthworker to a real, though minimal, risk of complication. In the last couple of years, authors have been investigating alternative techniques to replace ABG sampling: venous blood gas sampling and saturometry by pulse <b>oxymetry.</b> This article aims to revise the indications of arterial blood gas analysis, and to study the circumstances in which arterial blood sampling can be avoided, and replaced by an alternative technique. Concrete examples will be analysed, practical exercises given, a written procedure proposed, and fundamental principles of applied respiratory physiology reviewed. © 2011 Société française de médecine d'urgence and Springer-Verlag France...|$|E
40|$|In vivo, {{articular}} chondrocytes {{are exposed}} to 5 to 10 % O 2. Chondrocytes are also suspected to produce reactive oxygen species when submitted to anoxia/re-oxygenation. We were interested to {{study the effects of}} O 2 and glucose variations on cellular respiration, glucose consumption and lactate production. Equine articular chondrocytes were cultured in suspension for 2 days under 5 or 21 % O 2 in the gaseous phase, and with 0, 1. 0 or 4. 5 g/L glucose. The viable cells were then counted and the respiration rate (O 2 consumption) of 10. 106 cells was monitored by <b>oxymetry</b> for 2 hours; after <b>oxymetry,</b> glucose and lactate were measured in the medium (enzymatic assays). After 2 days, the cell viability was the best at 5 % O 2 and 1 g/L glucose; it decreased at 4. 5 g/L glucose and was the worst at 0 g/L glucose, for the two O 2 tensions (n= 3). There was no obvious difference of the respiration rate between cells cultured at 5 and 21 % O 2, but respiration of chondrocytes was surprisingly low. When cells were submitted to 20 min anoxia at 0 % O 2, the O 2 consumption was doubled at re-oxygenation for cells previously cultured at 21 % O 2. Glucose and lactate values found in the medium after oxymetry: lactate release in medium was similar (36. 23 and 34. 57 mg/L respectively) for cells cultured with 1 g glucose and 5 or 21 % O 2 conditions; lactate values were low (2. 03 and 8, 63 mg/L respectively) for 4. 5 g glucose and 5 or 21 % O 2. Glucose uptake was not different whatever the culture conditions. These results indicate a low cellular respiration with a lactate production linked to the glucose concentrationin the medium, and raise the question of the capacity of chondrocytes to produce ROS in vivo starting from the mitochondrial chain...|$|E
30|$|Patients {{and methods}} Observational {{prospective}} study, conducted in 2 of the 8 centers {{participating in a}} randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial (PRETTINEO study, ClinicalTrial.gov identifier NCT 01490580). Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) between “atropine-propofol” and “atropine-atracurium-sufentanil” before elective or semi-urgent intubation in the neonatal intensive care unit. Randomization was stratified on weight and center. Exclusion criteria included low blood pressure defined as a MABP (in mmHG) below gestational age (in weeks). Physiological parameters, including pulse <b>oxymetry</b> (SpO 2) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO 2), were collected 1  min prior to induction of anesthesia, and then up to 60  min after. To investigate the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption, cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) was calculated as FTOE = (SpO 2  − rScO 2)/SpO 2. The analyzed parameters included changes in rScO 2 and FTOE over time and their relative change from baseline value in both treatment groups.|$|E
40|$|Intestine {{has gained}} a {{fundamental}} room in monitoring and treatment of the patient in the Intensive Care Unit, since this organ can switch its roll from protector to promoter of multiple organ failure in critical patients. Moreover, this organ is an interesting research field in last 20 years, running to validate minimally invasive methods for early diagnosis and monitoring of shock (for example, tonometry, impedance spectrometry, and endoluminal pulse <b>oxymetry).</b> For {{a better understanding of}} function and control of blood circulation in the digestive tube, an updated review about that physiology is presented, with an emphasis in human stomach and intestine. First of all, we present an elemental and comparative inventory of the anatomic and histological distribution of blood vessels in abdomen and in the intestinal wall; then, we review some applicable biophysics; finally, we study the regulatory mechanisms of blood flow in the digestive tube, updating on the classical information...|$|E
30|$|Authors {{investigated}} sedation {{quality in}} children for auditory brainstem response testing. Two-hundred and seventy-six sedation procedures {{were retrospectively analyzed}} using recorded data focusing on efficacy of sedation and complications. Intramuscular ketamine-midazolam-atropine combination was administered on sedation preceded by narcotic suppository as pre-medication. On using the combination vital parameters remained within normal range, the complication rate was minimal. Pulse rate, arterial blood pressure and pulse <b>oxymetry</b> readings were stable, hypoventilation developed in 4, apnoea in none of the cases, post-sedation agitation occurred in 3 and nausea and/or vomiting in 2 cases. Repeated administration of narcotic agent was necessary in a single case only. Our practice is suitable for the sedation assisting hearing examinations in children. It has no influence on the auditory brainstem testing, the conditions necessary for the test can be met entirely with minimal side-effects. Our practice provides a more lasting sedation time in children during the examination hence {{there is no need}} for the repetition of the narcotics.|$|E
40|$|What {{is already}} known on this topic: Women and men show {{differences}} in their respiratory system. They have different red blood cells count, different plasma concentration of haemoglobin and 2, 3 diphosphoglycerate. Differences {{have been found in}} the transcutaneous and brain PaO 2, in the ventilatory response to hypoxia and exercise and in the evolution of some respiratory illnesses. What this study adds: The present study brings forward that during rest at sea level, the haemoglobin oxygen saturation, measured by pulse <b>oxymetry,</b> is slightly but significantly higher in women than in men. Knowledge of gender-differences is of increasing interest in recent years. It is well known that women and men show {{differences in their}} respiratory system. They have different red blood cells count, haemoglobin and 2, 3 diphosphoglycerate plasma concentration. Later, other differences have been found in the ventilatory response to hypoxia and exercise and the evolution of some respiratory illnesses.

40|$|The {{endothelium}} {{plays an}} active role in ischemia/reperfusion injuries. Herein, we report the effect of a single or successive cycles of anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) on the mitochondrial respiratory function of equine endothelial cells (cultured from carotids) monitored by high resolution <b>oxymetry,</b> and on their production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS were measured by electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) using POBN and DMPO spin traps, and by gas chromatography (GC) of ethylene released by ROS-induced alpha-keto-gamma-(methylthio) butyric acid (KMB) oxidation. The oxygen consumption significantly decreased with the number of A/R cycles, and POBN-ESR spectra were specific of adducts formed in the cells from superoxide anion. After a one-hour A/R cycle, high intensity DMPO-ESR spectra were observed and assigned to superoxide anion trapping; the GC results confirmed an important production of ROS compared to normoxic cells. These results show that A/R induces mitochondrial alterations in endothelial cells, and strongly stimulates their oxidative activity as demonstrated by ESR and GC methods. Peer reviewe...|$|E
