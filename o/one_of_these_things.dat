500|$|Every so often, I’d get a {{call from}} the {{producer}} saying, it’s going out at this time. The publicity people would be alerted, then we’d {{get a call}} saying no, it’s not, it’s been put back. That happened six times, I think, altogether – seven reschedules in a year or so... It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> that happen. I mean, a lot of shows are left on people’s desks and they hardly get seen, and Joking Apart was certainly one of those. Meanwhile, they were making about four series of The Brittas Empire, and you thought, [...] "Bloody Hell! Come on, surely….?" [...] To my mind, our show was a very superior product, and it upset me that other shows, which I, personally, felt were broader and less interesting, were getting precedence.|$|E
500|$|Evan {{decides to}} build the ark alone, gaining media {{attention}} and public ridicule as hundreds of animals assemble in pairs. Meanwhile, God appears to Joan as a waiter at a diner, where he listens {{to her as she}} expresses concern that Evan is losing his sanity and allowing himself to become a laughing stock, though claiming that [...] "God told him to do it." [...] Sympathetic toward Evan, God tells Joan that perhaps it is only opportunity for them, and explains that he does not give things but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing togetherness of families as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> Seeing God's meaning, Joan finally returns to Evan with new-found faith and continues helping him finish the ark together in order to prepare for the flood. On September 22, the day of the flood, Evan's staffers arrive in support as well and Eugene shows him research he performed on Long. It is revealed that, many years ago, Long conquered Prestige Crest and later commissioned a dam, then destroyed the remaining land to have many of the lots and houses built. Long cut corners in building the dam, and will most likely {{do the same thing with}} his Public Land Act bill.|$|E
2500|$|Special Operations Forces also {{assisted}} in this effort. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment operated AH-6 helicopters {{from a large}} barge anchored at sea. A second platform was manned by Special Forces from Fort Bragg, piloting OH-58Ds. [...] "These things looked extremely sinister. They were all black and bristling with antennas and had a huge round sight module about two feet in diameter stuck on a mast above the rotor blades. ... The impression you got, just looking at <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> on the ground, was of a giant insect staring at you before you die", a Special Forces officer is quoted as saying.|$|E
6000|$|He {{sat down}} and puzzled over <b>these</b> <b>things</b> a good while, but kept muttering, [...] "It's no use; I can't {{understand}} it. They don't tally right, and yet I'll swear the names and dates are right, and so of course they OUGHT to tally. I never labeled <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>thing</b> carelessly in my life. There is a most extraordinary mystery here." ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re going to have to go through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} holding the gun by the wrong end," [...] protested Pat. [...] "The story all happens before <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> is needed." [...] Pat was himself {{at work on}} a {{stretching}} board.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I, too, then, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> to be {{attained}} in your life?" [...] she asked. [...] "Dear Leonard, you mustn't say it like that. I don't like {{the look of}} your jaw. It frightens me." ...|$|E

6000|$|The more <b>one</b> thinks <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> and {{the deeper}} one dives into {{the mysteries of}} nature, the more profoundly is one {{impressed}} at once with a humbling sense of the limited amount <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> knowledge, and an awe-inspiring appreciation of the illimitable fields suggested by that comprehensive expression: [...] "The Wonderful Works of God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right. I forgot that. Well, my pater had an {{orchestrion}} {{put in the}} drawing-room. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> automatic <b>things</b> {{you switch}} on, you know.

6000|$|But {{although}} Captain Bream {{was a heavy}} sleeper and {{addicted to}} sonorous snoring, {{there were some things}} in nature through which even he could not slumber; and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> proved to be a hymn as sung by the fishermen of the North Sea! ...|$|E
60|$|Edmund, summoned {{from the}} {{hinterland}} {{of the house}} to give his opinion why only one of Mike's shoes was to be found, had no views on the subject. He seemed to look on it as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> which no fellow can understand.|$|E
6000|$|So the two {{brothers}} went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned in a minute with their arms full of things--such as bolsters, blankets, hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. 'I hope you're a good hand at pinning and tying strings?' Tweedledum remarked. 'Every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> {{has got to go}} on, somehow or other.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cheenbuk," [...] {{he said in}} a low voice, [...] "the black {{stuff that}} I put in my spouter is kept by traders in round things--I forget the name.

60|$|The cabman said he {{had heard}} that tale before, and was making {{preparations}} to descend. The crowd, now numbering eleven, looked hopeful. It occurred to Johnny later {{that he might have}} offered his umbrella to the cabman; at least it would have fetched the eighteenpence. <b>One</b> thinks <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> afterwards. The only idea that occurred to him at the moment was that of getting home.|$|R
5000|$|At the hearing, the NYPD must {{demonstrate}} (1) that it followed proper procedure in arresting {{the person and}} taking the vehicle, (2) that {{it is likely to}} win the civil forfeiture action, and (3) that returning the vehicle would cause a danger to the public. [...] If the NYPD fails to demonstrate <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> three <b>things,</b> the vehicle is returned to its owner pending the outcome of the separate civil forfeiture action.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's only worth talking about, mio caro," [...] she smiled, [...] "from your having begun it. My {{question}} is only reasonable--so that your idea may stand or fall by {{your answer to}} it. If I should pin <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> on for you would it be, to your mind, that I might go home and show it to Maggie as your present?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's done for," [...] {{he said to}} himself, with a {{surprising}} mental agitation, {{as though he had}} discovered an unexpected meaning in this thought. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> was bound to happen. Nothing could be prevented now, and nothing could be remedied. The men on board did not count, and the ship could not last. This weather was too impossible.|$|E
6000|$|Whoever asserts the {{existence}} of an omnipotent Deity, that he made and sustains all things, and is the causa causarum, cannot, without a contradiction in terms, assert that there is any cause independent of him; and it is a mere subterfuge to assert that the cause of all things can [...] "permit" [...] <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> to be an independent cause.|$|E
6000|$|Do we {{know how}} our sins provoke God? how they grieve the Holy Ghost? how they weaken our graces? how they spoil our prayers? how they weaken faith? how they tempt Christ {{to be ashamed of}} us? and how they hold back good from us?

40|$|Abstract. In {{this study}} we tried to {{evidence}} the type of lymphatic vascularisation in the mammary gland at bitches, {{as well as the}} capture of some possible lymphatic connections between the border homo-lateral mammary glands, including the hetero-lateral <b>ones.</b> All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> imply a good knowledge of the mammary lymphatic irrigation, the lymphatic’s drainage way and the possibility of communication between the mammary glands through the lymphatic vessels, although, in this field of study there are few data on <b>these</b> kind <b>of</b> connections...|$|R

If only one could get on to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> early enough, eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{said that}} in the all-important quality of co-operation, —— was only good on {{condition}} of being in front. Mr. G. read him in the same sense. Reminded of a mare he once had—admirable, provided you kept off spur, curb, or whip; show her <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> and she would do nothing. Mr. G. more of a judge of men than is commonly thought.|$|E
60|$|Mr. St. Clare {{thought in}} his heart that very likely this meant nothing. He thought it was only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> which good-natured people said to their slaves to comfort {{them when they were}} taken away from their dear ones to be sold. He did not really believe Mrs. Shelby meant to buy Tom back again. However, he did not say so out loud, but just told Tom to get the horses ready for a ride.|$|E

Won't you try <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> phenacetine lozenges--excellent <b>things</b> for a headache, I believe? Warranted, in fact, to cure all bodily ailments for ever! What!

40|$|Target {{blood sugar}} levels in {{diabetes}} are achieved through manipulation of diet, exercise and medication. A change in any <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> three <b>things</b> can skew {{blood sugar levels}} and create complications associated with hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Fasting {{during the month of}} Ramadan is a religious activity that devout Muslims practice whether they are diabetic or not. Since such fasting involves abstinence from food and water for twelve hours or more during the day from dawn to dusk, it is evident that advice regarding exercise and medication will have to be modified during this period...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{makes one}} hate one's country," [...] Malchus exclaimed passionately, [...] "when <b>one</b> hears <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> You {{taught me to}} love Carthage, father, and {{to be proud of}} her. How can <b>one</b> be proud <b>of</b> a country so misgoverned, so corrupt, so base as this? Of what use are sacrifices and efforts here, when at home they think of nothing but luxury and ease and the making of money, when the best and bravest of the Carthaginians are disgraced and dishonoured, and the people bow before these men whose wealth has been gained solely by {{corruption}} and robbery? It makes one wish one had been born a Roman." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{trouble is}} that the real {{question}} I raised is not discussed. It is argued as a problem in pennies, not as a problem in people. It is not the proposals of these reformers that I feel to be false so much as their temper and their arguments. I am not nearly so certain that communal kitchens are wrong as I am that the defenders of communal kitchens are wrong. Of course, for one thing, there is a vast difference between the communal kitchens of which I spoke and the communal meal (monstrum horrendum, informe) which the darker and wilder mind of my correspondent diabolically calls up. But in both the {{trouble is that}} their defenders will not defend them humanly as human institutions. They will not interest themselves in the staring psychological fact that {{there are some things that}} a man or a woman, as the case may be, wishes to do for himself or herself. He or she must do it inventively, creatively, artistically, individually--in a word, badly. Choosing your wife (say) is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> Is choosing your husband's dinner <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things?</b> That is the whole question: it is never asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she, [...] "and I {{have been}} on board of her and have gone all over her, and have seen many things which are queer and strange to me. But the strangest thing about her, to my mind, being a landswoman, is, that she should belong to my father. There are many things which he has not, which {{it would be easy}} to believe he would like to have, but that a ship, with sails and anchors and hatchways, should be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> it is hard to imagine." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was useless}} for them now to reproach {{themselves}} with carelessness in not examining the woods {{when they first}} awoke, as they should have done, since they knew the thieves would {{spend the night in}} some such place, and quite as useless to complain, because they did not attempt to discover the cause of the noise when they first heard it. Had they done either <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> which it seemed the most inexperienced in this kind of work would have done, they would have discovered the team and had it then in their possession.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I want, Chingatok," [...] said the Captain with a joyful look, [...] "only aid me in this matter, and I will reward you well. I've already told you that my ship is wrecked, and that the crew, except those you see here, have left me; but I have saved all the cargo and buried it {{in a place of}} {{security}} with the exception of those things which I need for my expedition. <b>One</b> half <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> are on this sledge,--the other half on a sledge left behind and ready packed near the wreck.

6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} a peep at Bothwell Castle {{if it is}} only for [...] half-an-hour.

When <b>one</b> thinks <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> there [...] is no silencing one's regret but by Corporal Nym's philosophy: [...] Things must be as they may. One generation goeth and another [...] cometh."--To LORD MONTAGU, June 28th, 1825.|$|R
60|$|The Plantagenet had {{received}} {{damage from the}} fire of her opponent. Some ten or fifteen men were killed and wounded; her main-top-sail was split by a shot, from clew to earing; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the quarter-masters was carried from the poop, literally dragged overboard by the sinews that connected head and body; {{and several of the}} spars, with a good deal of rigging, required to be looked to, on account of injuries. But no <b>one</b> thought <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> except as they were connected with present and pressing duties. Sir Gervaise got a sight of la Victoire, some hundred and twenty fathoms ahead, just as the roar of the Carnatic's guns was rushing upon his ears. The French commander saw and understood the extreme jeopardy of his consort, and he had already put his helm hard up.|$|R
