50|$|Once the spathe <b>opens,</b> <b>pollination</b> must happen {{the same}} day. In many species, the {{inflorescence}} emits a scent of decaying flesh {{in order to}} attract insects, though a number of species give off a pleasant odor. Through a number of ingenious insect traps, pollinating insects are kept inside the spathe to deposit pollen on the female flowers, which stay receptive for only one day, while the male flowers are still closed. These open the next day, but by then the female flowers are no longer receptive and so self-pollination is avoided. The male flowers shower the trapped insects with pollen. Once the insects escape, they can then pollinate another flower. Amorphophallus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species including Palpifer sexnotatus and Palpifer sordida.|$|R

All different insect species found on theexperimental site were collected for identification. Sampling was done once a week andthree times a day. Three methods were used to collect insects from the sesame plants (asweep net, pitfall traps, digital camera and eye observation). A total of 31 insect specieswere collected and properly identified during the survey. Insects recorded on the plantswere divided into four groups, true pollinators (Hymenoptera), other pollinators (Diptera,Coleoptera and Lepidoptera), pests (Orthoptera, Odonata, Hemiptera and Homoptera) andnatural enemies (Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Neuroptera and Dictyoptera). For studying the impact of insect pollination on sesame production, the experimentwas divided in two: <b>opened</b> and non-opened <b>pollination</b> of sesame. 50 plants from nonopenedpollination were covered with a perforated paper bag to allow the air to passthrough and to prevent insects from approaching the plants.

50|$|Grafts {{from large}} {{survivors}} of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant Americans were made beginning in 1980. The first all-American intercrosses are planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in Giles County, VA, and in Beckley, WV. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 & 1992. Nine of them showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test. It appears that inheritance of resistance requires genes of two trees with good combining ability from each source location. Thus, more generations of controlled crosses {{may be required to}} make American chestnuts produce blight resistance that is regularly inherited by seednuts. It takes at least 7 years for an American chestnut to produce nuts, and new trees must be at least 5 years old before their resistance can be tested by inoculation; the test requires 2 years for evaluation. Some of this time may be saved by utilizing grafts, and further progress may result from Elkins' studies underway, to locate chemical markers for resistance. In the meanwhile, ACCF plantings of all-American intercrosses are producing, from <b>open</b> <b>pollinations,</b> large nut crops.|$|R

Trials were conducted in E. globulus seed orchards in Tasmania to identify the timing of capsule development and abortion, as well as the effect of pollination type, female tree, site, fertilisation, flower physical attributes, flower density, irrigation and weather events on capsule set and overall reproductive success. Controlled pollinations (CP), mass supplementary <b>pollinations</b> (MSP), <b>open</b> <b>pollinations</b> (OP) and un-pollinated controls (UP) were carried out at two orchard sites (Cambridge and Ridgley).

No capsules were set in the UP, and capsule set was significantly lower following CP than OP and MSP. The genotypes at the lower altitude Cambridge site had a higher level of capsule set than the same genotypes pollinated at the Ridgley site.

(Rubiaceae), an intramorph self-compatible species, in a tropical semideciduous forest in the municipality of Catalão, located {{in the state of}} Goiás, Brazil. The phenology was recorded for a sample of individuals, the floral morphology being described using fresh and fixed material. The incompatibility system was tested using controlled hand pollinations. Floral visitors were collected and identified. Blooming began in November 2009 and ended in April 2010. Fruits developed from December 2009 to March 2010. The population presented atypical distyly, because only plants with pin flowers were found. The intramorph and <b>open</b> <b>pollinations</b> set more fruits than did spontaneous self-pollinations. The main flower visitors were Systropus sp. (Diptera), as well as Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera species. Morphological variations in distyly can occur by breakdown/permutation of the gene that controls the polymorphism. However, some authors argue that, in Rubiaceae, genetic control of the incompatibility system can operate independently of the morphological factor, and species might respond in different ways to the same selective pressures...|$|R

Normal seeds were classified into five grades depending on the ratio of embryo/endosperm lengths, including 5 / 5, 4 / 5, 3 / 5, 2 / 5, and 1 / 5. Triploids were not observed among seedlings produced from natural <b>open</b> <b>pollinations</b> on isolated islands. Triploids were detected only in seedlings of underdeveloped seed grades (3 / 5 and 2 / 5) from artificial crosses between populations from different isolated islands. The triploid occurrence frequency was calculated as 0 % for natural open–pollinated seedlings and 0. 058 % for artificial crosses (six triploids from 10, 303 seedlings). Triploids were produced from crosses between isolated populations located at least 70 km apart; no triploids were detected in inter–population crosses of plants originating on the same islands. Triploid seedlings had very low viability in soil. We analyzed factors affecting triploid occurrence and survival in natural diploid populations of L. lancifolium.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} bud pollination, compared to <b>pollination</b> of <b>open</b> flowers and crossing, on field characteristics of broccoli progenies, an experiment was conducted in 1974 and 1975 at Corvallis, Oregon. Single plants of 55 broccoli lines were pollinated, using four methods, i. e. bud <b>pollination</b> (BP), <b>open</b> flower <b>pollination</b> (OS), <b>open</b> flower <b>pollination</b> with ether treatment as an aid (OSE), and crossing with a common parent (CP). BP resulted in a substantially greater number of seed set per cluster than OS or OSE and slightly less than CP. There was a significant overall effect of pollination methods on seed weight, but it was the result of greater seed weight resulting from CP compared to other treatments. Broccoli lines differed greatly in seed weight and number of seeds per cluster. The use of ether did not significantly increase number of seed per cluster or seed weight. Thirty-nine lines were direct seeded in the field. Because of seed shortages and seedling losses, the experimental design of four replications in a randomized block was complete for only seven lines, and a total of 20 lines had at least one replication for each treatment. Separate analyses were made of the data for these seven lines and 20 lines respectively. In the field-grown progenies, the quantitative characteristics of plant height, plant weight, and head diameter, were greater for CP, intermediate for OS-OSE, and lowest for BP. Head weight was similarly, but less conclusively affected. Number of days to head emergence was longer in progenies from BP than OS-OSE, and those from OS-OSE took longer than progenies from CP. Number of days to harvest maturity followed the same pattern in the analysis of 20 lines but was inconclusive in the analysis of seven lines. Results for floret size and rosetting were generally inconclusive. The experiment generally supported the hypothesis that BP results in progenies with less plant vigor than those pollinated after normal anthesis (OS). The use of ether as an aid in <b>open</b> flower <b>pollination</b> generally had no effect on the field characteristics of resulting progenies...|$|R

Precocity and high flower numbers appear to be the reasons for the weed status of A. baileyana.

Among the larval-pupal endoparasitoids, the figitid Sarothrus areolatus Hartig was more common than an ichneumonid, Atractodes sp., but parasitism by both was commonly below 10 %.
