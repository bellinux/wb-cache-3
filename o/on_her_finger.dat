5|$|The video {{features}} Beyoncé {{and her two}} companions dancing {{inside an}} infinity cove, which alternates {{between black and white}} and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger.</b>|$|E

At {{one point in the}} first segment of the video, she is filmed dancing but the camera is almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera. As the screens inside the viewing booths open and close, the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration. The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's playbill image into different angles. There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger,</b> she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E

500|$|During promotional {{interviews}} about [...] "Used to Love You", Stefani {{confirmed the}} album was {{to be released in}} 2016. Since the release of [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] and [...] "Spark the Fire", her then-untitled album was among many magazine's lists of The Most Anticipated Albums, for both 2015 and 2016. On February 9, 2016, she posted the album's track list through her Twitter account with the caption [...] "This Is What the Truth Feels Like...", which was later confirmed as the album's title. A day later, the album's art cover was released, along with four bonus tracks exclusive to the Target edition. The release date was scheduled for March 18, 2016. The cover features a close-up shot of Stefani with [...] "hand drawn hearts, tears and flowers", which according to Carolyn Menyes of Music Times, [...] "giv the record a sense of femininity and raw emotion". Using Stefani's official website, fans were able to create their own album cover with the same doodles on it by uploading a picture of their face to the site. Regarding the deluxe edition cover of the album, Christina Marfice from SheKnows Media speculated that it [...] "includes a secret dis aimed at" [...] her ex-husband; she stated: [...] "And, in the corner, a ring drawn <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> with a frowny face [...] connected to it by an arrow." [...] However, the drawing was ultimately covered up by a sticker on this edition. Prior to the release of Shelton's tenth studio album, If I'm Honest (2016), several publications compared the cover to Stefani's, with Maeve McDermott of USA Today calling them [...] "eerily similar".|$|E

500|$|There {{she gives}} birth to Sigurd. Sigurd is raised by Regin, a cunning old man, and when he grows to manhood he asks for a horse from King Elf. Elf bids him choose the one he likes best, and Sigurd takes the best horse, and names it Grani. Sigurd is now urged by Regin to attack Fafnir, a dragon who guards a hoard of gold. This {{treasure}} is a curse to all who possess it. Fafnir, Regin says, was originally a human being; indeed, the dragon was Regin's brother and thus the gold rightfully belongs to Regin. He tries and fails to forge an adequate sword for Sigurd, but Sigurd produces the shattered fragments of Odin's sword, which he has inherited from Sigmund, and from these fragments Regin forges a mighty sword, named [...] "the Wrath" [...] by Sigurd. Sigurd {{makes his way to}} Fafnir's lair, kills him, drinks his blood, and roasts and eats his heart. This gives him the power to understand the voices of birds and to read the hearts of men. He now understands that Regin intends to kill him, and so he kills Regin and takes Fafnir's treasure for himself. On his journey homeward Sigurd comes across an unearthly blaze on the slopes of Hindfell. He rides straight into it and comes unharmed {{to the heart of the}} fire, where he finds a beautiful sleeping woman clad in armour. He wakes her, and she tells him that she is Brynhild, a handmaiden of Odin whom he has left here as a punishment for disobedience. They pledge themselves to each other, Sigurd places a ring from Fafnir's hoard <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger,</b> and he leaves.|$|E

Virgin Media listed Mercedes' wedding to Russ amongst their list of [...] "Soap's biggest wedding day disasters" [...] before adding that [...] "McQueen weddings are full of drama, and Russ and Mercedes' big day was no exception". Virgin Media later profiled some of Hollyoaks' [...] "hottest females" [...] in their opinion, and stated about Mercedes, [...] "As one of the hottest ladies in Hollyoaks, with curves to die for, Mercedes has had more men than hot dinners. And now Malachy's met his maker, we're sure it won't be long till Mercedes earns yet another notch on her bedpost". The Liverpool Echo described Mercedes' desire to marry saying, [...] "Mercedes has finally got what she's wanted for so long - a great big gleaming rock <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger.</b> Not that it matters who gave it to her, of course". Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton praised Mercedes, saying he loved the character and had these affections [...] "Because frankly, she scares the bejeezus out of me.

2500|$|Catherine is very {{frequently}} depicted in art, {{especially in the}} late Middle Ages, {{which is also the}} time that the account of [...] Saint Catherine's Mystical Marriage makes its first literary appearance. She can usually be easily recognised as she is richly dressed and crowned, as befits her rank as a princess, and often holds or stands next to a segment of her wheel as an attribute. [...] She also often carries either a martyr's palm or the sword with which she was actually executed. She often has long unbound blonde or reddish hair (unbound as she is unmarried). The vision of Saint Catherine of Alexandria usually shows the Infant Christ, held by the Virgin, placing a ring (one of her attributes) <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger,</b> following some literary accounts, although in the version in the Golden Legend he appears to be adult, and the marriage takes place among a great crowd of angels and [...] "all the celestial court", and these may also be shown.|$|E

In the storyline, Sam {{had been left}} {{in charge of the}} various Mitchell business and properties, and Andy, sensing an opportunity to gain control of these assets, proposed to Sam. According to Medcalf, Sam needed the marriage because she was [...] "vulnerable". She added, [...] "Andy is tough and she craves someone to look after her. I can see why she'd go for him; he's a good-looking guy, he's got money, he wears good clothes - he ticks every box." [...] 11 million viewers watched Sam marry Andy in September 2004. According to Medcalf, [...] "She knows that he's not desperately in love with her, but she thinks that it's enough. She's desperately in love with him. She's entering it very positively [...] Sam's not the brightest person, so she falls for his manipulations [...] I think she just wants to get the ring <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and then they can try to iron out any problems. She's a little naive." [...] The marriage lasted mere months on-screen; when Sam was conned into giving away all her family's properties, including her mother's public house (pub), The Queen Vic, Andy threw her out of their house.|$|E
2500|$|The Carol Ferris {{version of}} Star Sapphire appears in , with Carol Ferris voiced by Rachel Quaintance and Star Sapphire voiced by Vicki Lewis. Carol is {{transformed}} into Star Sapphire after being abducted by the Zamarons then implanted with their queen's spirit within her and bestow a violet power ring upon her. Whenever Carol places the ring <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger,</b> she transforms into the Star Sapphire and loses control of her body. In the episode [...] "Scorn of the Star Sapphire", Star Sapphire ultimately attempts to open a portal that allows an army of Zamarons to invade Earth, but the invasion is repelled by Green Lantern and Batman. After the Zamarons are sent back to their homeworld, Carol eventually regains control and casts the Star Sapphire out of her body while apparently losing all of her memories of her time under the ring's influence. This version sports a costume that combines elements from both her original design {{as well as the}} more recent 2005 Green Lantern series redesign. The Star Sapphires' Central Battery is briefly featured in a flashback showing the Zamaron homeworld. Star Sapphire later makes a cameo appearance in the episode [...] "Powerless!" [...] where Captain Atom attempts to illustrate how weak Batman is by pointing out that Star Sapphire could easily kill him in battle.|$|E

In 1965, Alpert released two albums, Whipped Cream & Other Delights and Going Places. Whipped Cream sold over 6 million copies in the United States. The album cover featured model Dolores Erickson wearing only what appeared to be whipped cream. In reality, Erickson was wearing a white blanket over which were scattered artfully placed daubs of shaving cream—real whipped cream would have melted under the heat of the studio lights (although the cream <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> was real). In concerts, when about to play the song, Alpert would tell the audience, [...] "Sorry, we can't play the cover for you."
