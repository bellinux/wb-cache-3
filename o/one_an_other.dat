In this context I examine the relationship between photographs and journalism and discuss a series of powerful signifiers, from 911 to grisly images now coming from the campaign in Iraq.

40|$|The {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} was used to amplify random sequences of DNA from 25 accessions of Azolla to evaluate the usefulness of this technique for identification and phylogenetic analysis of this aquatic fern. Accessions were selected to represent all known species within the genus Azolla and to encompass the worldwide distribution of the fern. Primers of 10 nucleotides with 70 % G + C content were used to generate randomly amplified polymorphic DNA from the symbiotic Azolla-Anabaena complex. Twenty-two primers were used and each primer gave 4 - 10 bands of different molecular weights for each accession. Bands were scored as present or absent for each accession and variation among accessions was quantified using Nei's genetic distances. A dendrogram summarizing phenetic relationships among the 25 accessions was generated using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean. Principal component' analysis was also used to evaluate genetic similarities. Three distinct groups were identified: group 1 contains five species, group 2 contains the pinnata species, and group 3 contains the nilotica species. The analysis demonstrates that the major groups of Azolla species can be easily distinguished from <b>one</b> <b>an</b> <b>other</b> and, in addition, that closely related accessions within species can be identified. We further found that using 10 primers, a phylogeny that {{is essentially the same}} as that derived from 22 primers can be constructed. Our results suggest that total DNA extracted from the Azolla-Anabaena symbionts is useful for classification and phylogenetic studies of Azolla...|$|E

40|$|We {{have been}} {{developing}} Laser Ablation Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) technique to measure titanium isotopic composition in situ. A principal {{aim of this}} work is to search for isotopic heterogeneities larger than the few epsilons (e, in parts in 10 ^ 4) of the solar system. Our analytical precision of the ratios of 46 Ti, 48 Ti, and 50 Ti to 49 Ti after exponential-law mass discrimination correction normalizing 47 Ti/ 49 Ti to 1. 33375 were about 2. 5 £` (2 £m). Mixture solutions were prepared by adding the expected level of Ca, Cr, Mg, and Alto the Ti solutions to demonstrate that our interference correction is effective. We then applied our technique with 213 nm Nd-YAG laser ablation to five Ti-rich terrestrial solids, {{and all of them}} also showed titanium isotopic composition that was consistent with <b>one</b> <b>an</b> <b>other</b> and agreed with that for the solution standard. It appears that the in situ laser technique did not significantly in crease the long-term reproducibility be yond the 2. 5 established using the solution method. This is an order of magnitude better than the typical precision of a few permil for secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The combination of the ability to perform in situ analysis on 30 mm spots with e level precision is a niche for LA-MC-ICP-MS. We also ablated two lines on a fassaite grain from a large well studied CAI Egg- 6 of the Allende meteorite. After the mass discrimination was corrected by normalizing 47 Ti/ 49 Ti, the 46 Ti and 48 Ti are nor mal within about 2 £ while 50 Ti/ 49 Ti shows a 9 £ excess. These data are in excellent agreement with thermalion ization mass spectrometry (TIMS) results. Comparing our ICP-MS results against the results from TIMS studies, we found that our normal titanium isotopic ratios were closest to the less precise data of Heydegger et al. (1979) who measured Ti+. We support the proposal to IUPAC to change the accepted Ti abundance to that measured by ICP-MS and TIMS without using Ti oxides...|$|E
