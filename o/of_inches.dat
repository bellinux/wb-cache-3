5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across the length of the table a set number <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E
5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, {{too much or too little}} rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> of rain per year to survive.|$|E
5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} element in the Everglades, and it shapes the land, vegetation, and animal life of South Florida. The South Florida climate was once arid and semi-arid, interspersed with wet periods. Between 10,000 and 20,000years ago, sea levels rose, submerging portions of the Florida peninsula and causing the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone, eroding some of it and creating springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and through evaporation formed thunderstorms. Limestone was dissolved by the slightly acidic rainwater. The limestone wore away, and groundwater {{came into contact with}} the surface, creating a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, the wearing away of the limestone in some areas created slight valleys and plateaus—a difference <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> in elevation—that affected not only the flow of water, but also types of vegetation present.|$|E

25|$|On Easy {{difficulty}} Pro mode, {{the game}} will only present single notes to the player; Medium difficulty introduces chords, while Hard difficulty is a less-dense version of the full guitar track charted for Expert mode. The game adjusts which frets are used depending on which Pro model guitar is used, because the Mustang, being only a couple <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> smaller than a real guitar, has fewer frets than the Squier real guitar. Some leeway is given on Pro Guitar such as by missing a chord by one offset string.|$|E

25|$|U.S. {{customary}} {{units are}} widely used on consumer products and in industrial manufacturing. Metric units are standard in science, medicine, {{as well as many}} sectors of industry and government, including the military. There are anecdotal objections to the use of metric units in carpentry and the building trades, on the basis that it is easier to remember an integer number <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> plus a fraction than a measurement in millimeters, or that foot-inch measurements are more suitable when distances are frequently divided into halves, thirds and quarters, often in parallel. The metric system also lacks a parallel to the foot.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} {{turned into a}} {{showcase}} for New Zealand in general and Carter in particular. He scored two tries, converted three, kicked two penalties, and constantly kept the Lions on the back foot with his distribution. Flanker Richie McCaw powered his way over for a try after Carter missed a hat trick by a matter <b>of</b> <b>inches.</b> Rugby media were in virtually unanimous agreement that the Lions were greatly improved and that the All Blacks were dominant. Carter's tally of 33 points broke the all-time record for points by an All Black against the Lions.|$|E
25|$|A {{trial was}} held at the Stirling Spring Circuit Court on 19 April 1823; however, Forrest had absconded and was absent from the hearings. He was assumed to be heading for Paris whilst McNab and Mitchel were held prisoners in the Stirling Tolbooth. The court {{documents}} do not mention Shiels however. The crime had been discovered when the grave of Mary Wotherspoon, who had been buried a week before, had been observed to be a couple <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> below the surface. A rope was discovered near the surface and digging down to the coffin revealed it had been broken open and the body removed, however the clothes had been thrown back inside.|$|E

The size (diagonal) of television and computer monitor screens is always denominated in inches. Food sold by length or width e.g. pizzas or sandwiches, is generally sold in inches. Clothing is always sized in inches, with the metric equivalent often shown as a small supplementary indicator. Gas is usually measured by the cubic foot or cubic metre, but is billed like electricity by the kilowatt hour.|$|E
25|$|Both the Kings and San Joaquin Rivers flow west {{into the}} arid San Joaquin Valley; however, while the San Joaquin {{eventually}} empties into San Francisco Bay, the Kings {{ends in the}} terminal sink of Tulare Lake, which – before its waters were diverted for irrigation – {{was one of the}} largest freshwater lakes in the western United States. The seasonal {{rise and fall of the}} park's rivers is driven by heavy snowfall (typically between November and April) followed by a rapid melt during May and June. Runoff drops significantly by late July (or August in wet years), and rivers are usually a trickle by autumn. Snow accumulations in the higher areas of Kings Canyon National Park can be extremely large, often totaling in the hundreds <b>of</b> <b>inches,</b> although the annual snowpack fluctuates greatly between wet and dry years.|$|E
25|$|In the Tour of California, Sagan won on stages one, {{which was}} a bunch sprint finish, and 4, where the finish was contested on the Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. On stage 7, {{he was part of}} the breakaway, went solo from fifty {{kilometers}} to cover and was caught with 20 kilometers to go to the finish. He still managed a second place by a couple <b>of</b> <b>inches</b> over Alexander Kristoff. On stage 8 he took another 2nd place and clinched the points classification. On his next race, the Tour de Suisse, Sagan sprinted to victory on the hilly stage 1 around Baar. It was a record-breaking 12th victory for the Slovak on the Swiss race. The very next day he won another stage after joining the late breakaway after attacking the reduced peloton at the end of a climb, and outsprinted the pair.|$|E

500|$|Grossmith {{took to the}} {{professional}} stage in 1870 with a sketch called Human Oddities, written by his father, and a song called [...] "The Gay Photographer" [...] (that is, the [...] "carefree" [...] photographer). The song, with words by Grossmith's father and music by young Grossmith, concerns a photographer who broke {{the heart of a}} young lady named Miss Jenkins; so she drank his chemicals and died. In late 1870, the younger Grossmith appeared on his own with a nightly spot at the [...] "old Polytechnic" [...] in Regent Street, where comic sketches alternated with scientific and serious lectures for the entertainment of the public. [...] Human Oddities and another sketch, The Yellow Dwarf, were successful for Grossmith, and he took the former work on tour for six months. [...] An 1871 Grossmith sketch was called He was a Careful Man. Biographer Tony Joseph notes that, except for a few early pieces, nearly all of Grossmith's material was written and composed by Grossmith himself. [...] Joseph describes the sketches as [...] "a light-hearted sending up of various aspects of contemporary life and manners. ...he was the complete performer... as a pianist (he performed for the most part sitting at a piano)... as a raconteur... as a mimic, facial expression, timing—he had it all.
