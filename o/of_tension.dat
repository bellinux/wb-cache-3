5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I {{at the end of}} July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I, decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which was a source <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October 1916; the heavy units of the Greek fleet were disarmed and placed in reserve {{for the remainder of the}} war. Spetsai was decommissioned in 1920 and used as a naval communications school until 1929, when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E

30|$|At present, {{the studies}} on <b>tensioning</b> {{processes}} <b>of</b> {{circular saw blade}} mainly focus on the effect <b>of</b> <b>tensioning</b> process on dynamic stability of circular saw blade [5 – 15]. Only a few studies are about the generation process <b>of</b> <b>tensioning</b> stress during tensioning process. The theoretical model <b>of</b> roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Szymani. The tensioning stresses obtained by the model were generally in good agreement with the experimentally determined tensioning stresses [1]. The model <b>of</b> roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Nicoletti based on finite {{element method and the}} tensioning stresses were obtained, the introduction of these stresses into a modal analysis allowed us to predict the dynamic behavior of circular saw blade [16]. A finite element model for roll <b>tensioning</b> <b>of</b> circular saw blades which allowed the investigation <b>of</b> various roll <b>tensioning</b> parameters was developed by Heisel [17]. There is little theoretical research about the generation process <b>of</b> <b>tensioning</b> stress during multi-spot pressure tensioning process at present. For an in-depth research of generation process <b>of</b> <b>tensioning</b> stress during multi-spot pressure tensioning process, a numerical model which could both meet the requirement of computational efficiency and accuracy should be established first.|$|R

Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the September 11 attacks were a false flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a police state.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} years of the war, a degree <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> existed between the {{government}} and the army, which divided its allegiance between government and King. The Free Belgian forces, particular the infantry who had been training since 1940, held the government responsible for not being allowed to fight. In November 1942, 12 Belgian soldiers mutinied, complaining about their inactivity. By 1943, the army's royalist stance had been moderated, allowing the government to re-gain the support of the military.|$|E
5|$|French {{breeding}} of the Mérens is divided between two schools of thought. The first is traditional breeders seeking {{to preserve the}} original type, that of a light draft horse living high in the mountains year-round and retaining the hardiness for which the breed is known. The second comes from {{the conversion of the}} Mérens to a leisure horse in the 1980s, and aims to transform the physical type of the breed into a more sports-oriented horse to ensure the survival of the breed. This dichotomy has become a source <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> between farmers and users of the breed.|$|E

5|$|After Stephen's death, Henry II succeeded to {{the throne}} of England. Henry vigorously re-established royal {{authority}} {{in the aftermath of}} the civil war, dismantling castles and increasing revenues, although several of these trends had begun under Stephen. The destruction of castles under Henry was not as dramatic as once thought, and although he restored royal revenues, the economy of England remained broadly unchanged under both rulers. Stephen's remaining son William I of Blois was confirmed as the Earl of Surrey by Henry, and prospered under the new regime, with the occasional point <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> with Henry. Stephen's daughter Marie I of Boulogne also survived her father; she had been placed in a convent by Stephen, but after his death she left and married. Stephen's middle son, Baldwin, and second daughter, Matilda, had died before 1147 and were buried at Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate. Stephen probably had three illegitimate sons, Gervase, Ralph and Americ, by his mistress Damette; Gervase became Abbot of Westminster in 1138, but after his father's death Gervase was removed by Henry in 1157 and died shortly afterwards.|$|E
