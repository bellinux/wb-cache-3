5|$|Rice is {{the basic}} {{ingredient}} in ceremonial dishes, and {{is a very important}} element <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> meals. Rice dishes are usually the main dish <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> dinner, because they consist of a variety of ingredients commonly found within the Palestinian land. Rice is usually not served alone or as a side dish (see ruz ma lahma below), but rather it is incorporated within a larger dish or tabeekh (dish), that would include soups, vegetables, and meat (chicken or lamb). Meat is almost always present in Palestinian dishes.|$|E

5|$|Finkelstein {{received}} his Master's degree {{in political science}} in 1980, and later his PhD in political studies, from Princeton. His doctoral thesis was on Zionism. Before gaining academic employment, Finkelstein was a part-time social worker with teenage dropouts in New York. He then taught successively at Rutgers University, New York University, Brooklyn College, and Hunter College and at DePaul University in Chicago. During the First Intifada, he spent every summer from 1988 in the West Bank, a guest <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> families in Hebron and Beit Sahour.|$|E
5|$|Following the rebels' defeat, he {{immigrated to}} Palestine, {{where he became}} a Muslim waqf (religious endowments) {{official}} and grew incensed at the plight <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Arab peasants. In the 1930s, he formed bands of local fighters and launched attacks against British and Jewish targets. He was eventually killed in a manhunt following his alleged role {{in the killing of}} a British policeman. Israeli historian Tom Segev has called him 'the Arab Joseph Trumpeldor'. His campaign and death were factors that led to the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1996, Benjamin Netanyahu {{was elected}} Prime Minister of Israel. Palestinian-Israeli {{relations}} grew even more hostile {{as a result}} of continued conflict.

The resulting Wye River Memorandum detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and PNA to complete the peace process.|$|E

The meal is oftentimes served the traditional way in a large common plate, a sidr.

5|$|Nabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi {{is a type}} of castile soap {{produced}} only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: virgin olive oil, water, and a sodium compound.

Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.|$|E

Modern Syrian-Palestinian dishes have been generally influenced by the rule of three major Islamic groups: the Arabs, the Persian-influenced Arabs (Iraqis) and the Turks.|$|E

5|$|With a {{population}} of 2,560 in 1945, Deir al-Balah was a relatively large village. The influx <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> refugees from nearby areas captured by Israel during the 1948 War drastically increased the population thereafter. In the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) Deir al-Balah's population was recorded as 42,839, a figure which included the adjacent Deir al-Balah Camp (the smallest refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.) Nearly 75% of the population were below the age of 30.|$|E
5|$|A massive influx <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> {{refugees}} swelled Gaza's population {{after the}} 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population {{had grown to}} about six times its 1948 size. In 1997, 51.8% of Gaza's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city's population has continued to increase since that time to 515,556 in 2012, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City {{has one of the}} highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km² (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km² – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km² – 55,000/sq mi). In 2007 poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations food aid.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the University, Arafat studied civil engineering and {{served as president of}} the General Union <b>of</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Students (GUPS) from 1952 to 1956. During his first year as president of the union, the University was renamed Cairo University after a coup was carried out by the Free Officers Movement overthrowing King Farouk I. By that time, Arafat had graduated with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and was called to duty to fight with Egyptian forces during the Suez Crisis; however, he never actually fought. Later that year, at a conference in Prague, he donned a solid white keffiyeh–different from the fishnet-patterned one he adopted later in Kuwait, which was to become his emblem.|$|E
