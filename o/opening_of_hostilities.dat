5|$|At 8:00am on 1 August, a Georgian police lorry {{was blown}} {{up by an}} improvised {{explosive}} device on the road near Tskhinvali, injuring five Georgian policemen. In response, Georgian snipers assaulted some of the South Ossetian border checkpoints, killing four Ossetians and injuring seven. According to majority of reports, South Ossetians were responsible for instigating the bomb explosion which marked the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 1914, Churchill {{ordered the}} first British {{attack on the}} Dardanelles {{following}} the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> between Turkey and Russia. The attack {{was carried out by}} Indomitable and Indefatigable, as well as the French pre-dreadnought battleships Suffren and Vérité. The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response. The results were deceptively encouraging. In a twenty-minute bombardment, a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at Sedd el Bahr {{at the tip of the}} Gallipoli peninsula, displacing (but not destroying) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers. The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences, and they set about expanding the mine field. This attack actually took place before a formal declaration of war had been made by Britain against the Ottoman Empire which didn't happen until the 5th. Indomitable was ordered to return to England in December where she joined the 2nd BCS.|$|E

25|$|From 1938 to 1940 he was District Officer Commanding 13th Military District in Calgary.

50|$|Some {{members of}} Cumann na mBan were also {{members of the}} Citizen Army, and as such were combatants in the Rising. Constance Markievicz {{is said to have}} shot and killed a {{policeman}} at St Stephen's Green during the <b>opening</b> phase <b>of</b> the <b>hostilities.</b> She carried out sniper attacks on British troops, and, with Mary Hyland and Lily Kempson, was among a small force under Frank Robbins which successfully occupied the College of Surgeons opposite the Green, and unsuccessfully searched for rifles that were believed to be held there by the college's Officer Training Corps. Helena Molony was among the Citizen Army company which attacked Dublin Castle and subsequently occupied the adjacent City Hall, where she and other women had sniping duties.|$|R
2500|$|At night, Arima's armada of junks full of {{shouting}} men {{approached the}} Nossa Senhora da Graça, which was unlit and quiet in stark contrast. Some of Pessoa's officers wanted to {{fire on the}} mob, being lit by the torches they carry, but Pessoa refused to take the responsibility <b>of</b> <b>opening</b> <b>hostilities,</b> and so the procedures of setting sail and weighing anchor continued quietly in the darkness. The Japanese shot first, firing two volleys of muskets and arrows, and Pessoa responded with two successive broadsides of five guns apiece, with flutes and trumpets playing after each volley {{to add insult to}} injury. The Japanese flotilla scattered and retreated for the night as the Portuguese carrack anchored off Fukahori (...) for lack of wind.|$|R
25|$|With the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> in Europe, Maumee {{was brought}} out of reserve, given an {{extensive}} overhaul at Baltimore, Maryland {{during which she}} received conventional steampower propulsion, and recommissioned 2 June 1942.

25|$|Tensions between Georgia and Russia began {{escalating}} in April 2008. A bomb explosion on 1 August 2008 targeted a car transporting Georgian peacekeepers. South Ossetians {{were responsible}} for instigating this incident, which marked the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> and injured five Georgian servicemen. In response, several South Ossetian militiamen were hit. South Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages on 1 August. These artillery attacks caused Georgian servicemen to return fire periodically since 1 August.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> several Polish cities {{including}} Dubno, Łuck and Włodzimierz Wołyński let the Red Army in peacefully, {{convinced that}} it was marching on in order to fight the Germans. General Juliusz Rómmel of the Polish Army issued an unauthorised order to treat them like an ally {{before it was too}} late. The Soviet government announced it was acting to protect the Ukrainians and Belarusians who lived {{in the eastern part of}} Poland, because the Polish state – according to Soviet propaganda – had collapsed in the face of the Nazi German attack and could no longer guarantee the security of its own citizens. Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded that the defence of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all uniformed troops to then-neutral Romania.|$|E

5000|$|When Avon is released, Slim Charles is {{the only}} person he consults upon making a {{decision}} to go to war with Marlo Stanfield. On Avon's orders, Slim Charles puts together a team to strike against Marlo's subordinates. The team is headed by the experienced trio of Cutty, Country and Slim Charles, but on the <b>opening</b> day <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> Country is killed and Cutty quits, leaving Slim as the unquestioned Barksdale chief enforcer in the war. Although Charles proves himself a capable and loyal soldier on many occasions, the support he gathers around himself is not up to the task. He is involved at an organizational level with the assassinations of Marlo and Omar, although he has a hands-on role in neither of the plans. When the operation against Marlo backfires and Avon is wounded, Charles brings a surgeon to the warehouse where the Barksdales regroup. Meanwhile, when Gerard and Sapper sight Omar and phone Charles to confirm that he wants them to kill him even though it is a Sunday morning, he does not answer the phone - Gerard dismissively says that Charles must be sleeping in. However, after this operation too is botched, Charles angrily reproves the pair before sending them to answer to Avon himself. Near the end of the war, he is taken aback by Stringer's demand that he must kill Senator Clay Davis, protesting that [...] "...murder ain't no thing, but this here's some assassination shit." [...] Shown up as a gangster without the political sensitivity of even Slim Charles, Stringer storms off and is caught in a fatal ambush set up by Omar and Brother Mouzone.|$|R
50|$|The laying of the {{cornerstone}} and christening {{of the new}} armoury took place on July 21, 1938. The plans had been drawn by a local architect, Lucien Sarra-Bournet, presumably based upon the 2-year-old plans for the Seaforth Armoury. Six months later, on 28 January 1939, {{less than a year}} before the declaration <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> with the Third Reich, His Excellency Lord Tweedsmuir, presided over the official <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> Salaberry Armoury.|$|R
25|$|From {{the start}} Leopold I had {{rejected}} the final will of Charles II: {{he was determined}} to keep the Spanish domains in Italy, above all the Duchy of Milan, which was seen as the southern key to Austria's security. Before the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> French troops had already been accepted in Milan when its viceroy declared for Philip V, as did the neighbouring Duchy of Mantua by a secret convention of February 1701. The Republic of Venice, the Republic of Genoa, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and the Duchy of Parma (under Papal protection), remained neutral. Farther south the Kingdom of Naples acknowledged Philip V as King of Spain, as did Pope Clement XI who, due to the pro-French leanings of his cardinals, generally followed a policy of benevolent neutrality towards France. Only in the Duchies of Modena and Guastalla – once French troops were expelled {{at the beginning of the}} campaign – did the Emperor find support for his cause.|$|E

[...] Japanese diplomats intended to deliver the notice to the United States thirty minutes before the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, but it was delivered to the U.S. government an hour after the attack was over. Tokyo transmitted the 5,000-word notification (commonly called the [...] "14-Part Message") in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington, but transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it in time. The 14-Part Message was actually about sending a message to U.S. officials that peace negotiations between Japan and the U.S. were likely to be terminated, not a declaration of war. In fact, Japanese officials were well aware that the 14-Part Message was not a proper declaration of war as required by the 1907 Hague Convention III – The <b>Opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hostilities.</b> They decided not to issue a proper declaration of war anyway as they feared that doing so would expose the possible leak of the secret operation to the Americans. Some conspiracy theorists charged that President Franklin D. Roosevelt willingly allowed the attack to happen {{in order to create a}} pretext for war, but no credible evidence supports that claim.
