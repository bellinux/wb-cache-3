5|$|Bats possess highly adapted lung {{systems to}} cope with the {{pressures}} of powered-flight. Flight is an energetically taxing aerobic activity and requires large amounts of <b>oxygen</b> <b>to</b> be sustained. In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals. Due to the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to dive {{for long periods of}} time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store <b>oxygen</b> <b>to</b> support deep diving. Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>to</b> vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E
5|$|Molecular oxygen is {{an ideal}} {{terminal}} electron acceptor {{because it is a}} strong oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates.

5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in <b>oxygen</b> <b>to</b> produce a welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, {{since it is}} less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels.

5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and <b>oxygen</b> <b>to</b> make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of <b>oxygen</b> <b>to</b> brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E
5|$|By Sunday afternoon, 18hours {{after the}} alarm {{was raised in}} Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh <b>oxygen</b> <b>to</b> the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both {{north and south of}} the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.|$|E
