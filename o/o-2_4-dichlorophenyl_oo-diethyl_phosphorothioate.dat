40|$|A {{new series}} of 27 diethyl 2 -(phenylcarbamoyl) phenyl phosphorothioates (thiophosphates) was synthesized, {{characterized}} by NMR, IR and CHN analyses and evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv, Mycobacterium avium and two strains of Mycobacterium kansasii. The best activity against M. tuberculosis was found for O-{ 4 -bromo- 2 -[(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) carbamoyl]phenyl} <b>O,O-diethyl</b> <b>phosphorothioate</b> (minimum inhibitory concentration of 4 µM). The highest activity against nontuberculous mycobacteria was exhibited by O-(5 -chloro- 2 -{[4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]carbamoyl}-phenyl) <b>O,O-diethyl</b> <b>phosphorothioate</b> with MIC values from 16 µM. Prepared thiophosphates were also evaluated against acetylcholinesterase from electric eel and butyrylcholinesterase from equine serum. Their inhibitory activity was {{compared to that of}} the known cholinesterases inhibitors galanthamine and rivastigmine. All tested compounds showed a higher (for AChE inhibition) and comparable (for BChE inhibition) activity to that of rivastigmine, with IC 50 s within the 8. 04 to 20. 2 µM range...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Suicidal {{poisoning}} by {{ingestion of}} organophosphate (OP) insecticides represents a serious emergency with a high mortality rate. However, attempted suicide via the parenteral route has rarely been reported. The present study reports a case of parasuicide by self-injection of an organophosphorus insecticide (phoxim, phenylglyoxylonitrile oxime <b>O,O-diethyl</b> <b>phosphorothioate)</b> into the distal region of the left arm. The patient developed necrosis at the injection site and an abscess of the affected limb following injection. A fasciotomy and surgical debridement resulted in the symptoms of the patient disappearing {{within a few days}} and were vital in shortening the course of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Applications of ethyl 4 -(methylthio) -m-tolyl isopropylphosphoramidate, <b>O,O-diethyl</b> O-((p-(methylsulfinyl) phenyl) <b>phosphorothioate,</b> and <b>O,O-diethyl</b> S-[2 -(ethylthio) ethyll phosphorotbioate {{effectively}} controlled Trichodorus christiei on centipede grass. Populations of Pratylenchus spp. and Xiphinema americanum {{were significantly}} reduced {{with a mixture}} of methanesulfonic acid, 2, 4 -dichlorophenyl ester and 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane. Ethyl 4 -(methylthio) -m-tolyl isopropylphosphoramidate and <b>O,O-diethyl</b> O-((p-(methylsulfinyl) phenyl <b>phosphorothioate</b> significantly suppressed populations of Pratylenchus spp., and the latter reduced populations of X. arnericanum.

40|$|Chlorpyrifos is {{a typical}} {{chlorinated}} organophosphorus pesticide. The heterogeneous reaction of chlorpyrifos particles with NO 3 radicals was investigated using a vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-ATOFMS) and a real-time atmospheric gas analysis mass spectrometer. Chlorpyrifos oxon, 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol, <b>O,O-diethyl</b> O-hydrogen <b>phosphorothioate,</b> <b>O,O-diethyl</b> ester thiophosphoric acid, diethyl hydrogen phosphate and a phosphinyl disulfide compound were identified as the main degradation products. The heterogeneous reaction pathways were proposed and their kinetic processes were investigated via a mixed-phase relative rate method. The observed effective rate constant is 3. 4 +/- 0. 2 x 10 (- 12) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1). (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Diazinon (IUPAC name: <b>O,O-Diethyl</b> O-4-methyl-6-(propan-2-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl <b>phosphorothioate,</b> INN - Dimpylate), a colorless to {{dark brown}} liquid, is a thiophosphoric acid ester {{developed}} in 1952 by Ciba-Geigy, a Swiss chemical company (later Novartis and then Syngenta). It is a nonsystemic organophosphate insecticide formerly {{used to control}} cockroaches, silverfish, ants, and fleas in residential, non-food buildings. Diazinon was heavily used during the 1970s and early 1980s for general-purpose gardening use and indoor pest control. A bait form was used to control scavenger wasps in the western U.S. Diazinon is used in flea collars for domestic pets in Australia and New Zealand. Residential uses of diazinon were outlawed in the U.S. in 2004 {{but it is still}} approved for agricultural uses. An emergency antidote is atropine.|$|R
40|$|The {{reactions}} of <b>O,O-diethyl</b> Z-S-aryl <b>phosphorothioates</b> with X-benzylamines are kinetically investigated in dimethyl sulfoxide at 85. 0 °C. The Hammett (log k 2 vs σX) and Brönsted [log k 2 vs pKa(X) ] plots are biphasic concave downwards for substituent X {{variations in the}} nucleophiles with a break point at X = H. The signs of the cross-interaction constants (ρXZ) are positive for both the strongly and weakly basic nucleophiles. Considerably great magnitude of ρXZ (= 6. 56) value is observed with the weakly basic nucleophiles, while ρXZ = 0. 91 with the strongly basic nucleophiles. Proposed reaction mechanism is a stepwise process with a rate-limiting leaving group expulsion from the intermediate involving a backside nucleophilic attack with the strongly basic nucleophiles and a frontside attack with the weakly basic nucleophiles. The kinetic results are {{compared with those of}} the benzylaminolysis of O,O-diphenyl Z-S-aryl phosphorothioates...|$|R
40|$|Yield {{of tobacco}} {{was related to}} the amount of {{infection}} by Meloidogyne javanica during the first month after transplanting. Six nematicidal treatments significantly reduced infection during this period and subsequently increased yield. However, during the second month after transplanting, infection in plots treated with O-ethyl S,S-dipropyl phosphorodithioate (V-C 9 - 104) and a mixture of 80 % chlorinated C₃ hydrocarbons + 20 % methyl isothioeyanate (DD + MENCS) was not significantly different from infection in untreated plots. After 3 months, root-knot indices in plots treated with V-C 9 - 104, DD + MENCS, <b>O,O-diethyl</b> O-[p-(methylsulfinyl) phenyl] <b>phosphorothioate</b> (B- 25141), and 1, 3 -dichloropropene, 1, 2 -dichloropropane (DD) were not significantly different from those in untreated plots; reduced infection was present only in plots treated with ethylene dibromide (EDB) and 2 -methyl- 2 (methylthio) propionaldehyde O-(methylcarbamoyl) oxime (aldicarb). At the end of harvest (4 months after transplanting), root-knot indices in all plots were essentially equal...|$|R
40|$|EPTC (S-ethyl dipropyl carbamothioate) {{degradation}} rate was enhanced in Clay Center (Crete silty clay loam, pH 6. 6, 2. 7 % O. M.) and Scottsbluff (Tripp very fine sandy loam, pH 8. 0, 1. 0 % O. M.) soils following three annual EPTC, butylate S-ethyl bis(2 -methylpropyl) carbamothioate, or vernolate (S-propyl dipropylcarbamothioate) applications, or when rotated biennially with butylate. EPTC degradation was not enhanced following three annual atrazine 6 -chloro-N-ethyl-N-(1 -methylethyl) - 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4 -diamine, alachlor 2 -chloro-N-(2, 6 -diethylphenyl) -N-(methoxymethyl) acetamide, cyanazine 2 - 4 -chloro- 6 -(ethylamino) - 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 2 -yl amino - 2 -methylpropanenitrile, cycloate (S-ethyl cyclohexylethylcarbamothioate), or metolachlor 2 -chloro-N(2 -ethyl- 6 -methylphenyl) -N-(2 -methoxy- 1 -methylethyl) acetamide applications, or when rotated biennially with cyanazine, cycloate, or alachlor. EPTC degradation was not affected in Scottsbluff soil following three annual carbofuran (2, 3 -dihydro- 2, 2 -dimethyl- 7 -benzofuranyl methylcarbamate) applications, but was partially enhanced in Clay Center soil. The reversion rate of soil enhanced for EPTC degradation was gradual and varied with location, year, {{and number of}} prior EPTC applications. Butylate degradation was normal or only partially enhanced in soil previously treated with EPTC compared to previously untreated soil and soil previously treated with butylate. Self- and cross- enhanced degradation of EPTC and butylate did not change regardless of number of prior annual applications of either herbicide. ^ The {{degradation rate}}s of EPTC and butylate were not affected by pretreating soil with butylate sulfone, but were enhanced by pretreating soil with the sulfoxides of each herbicide. ^ Rotation of EPTC + dietholate; (<b>O,O-diethyl</b> O-phenyl <b>phosphorothioate)</b> and EPTC + fonofos (O-ethyl S-phenyl ethylphosphonodithioate) in soils with three prior annual treatments of each combination did not improve weed control compared to continuous use. SC- 0058 S-ethyl di-(3 -chlorallyl) thiocarbamate was effective in slowing EPTC degradation in soils pretreated with EPTC, EPTC + dietholate, EPTC + fonofos, or EPTC + SC- 0058. Dietholate was effective in slowing EPTC degradation in soil pretreated with EPTC + SC- 0058. SC- 0058 appeared to have an inhibitory influence on initial enhancement for EPTC degradation. Dietholate and SC- 0058 did not condition the soil for their own enhanced degradation after repeated use. The extenders were more effective inhibitors of enhanced EPTC degradation in soil from Scottsbluff than from Clay Center. ...|$|R
