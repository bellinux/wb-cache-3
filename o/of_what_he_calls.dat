5|$|Durkheim had an {{important}} impact {{on the development of}} Anthropology and Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as Marcel Mauss, but also later thinkers, such as Maurice Halbwachs, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Levi-Strauss. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert Bellah, and Pierre Bourdieu. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of Ziya Gökalp, the founding father of Turkish sociology. Randall Collins has developed a theory <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with Erving Goffman's micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the interaction order.|$|E

In his {{autobiography}} he mentions in particular two aspects of his time there: learning the [...] "facts of life" [...] from other boys, with extensive experimentation, and his discovery <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "exotic" [...] religion—High Anglicanism. These experiences formed what he called two [...] "conflicting compulsions", soon {{to be joined by}} a third—left-wing politics—to shape the ruling passions of his life.|$|E

500|$|Some critics find it {{difficult}} to accept Fodor's insistence that a large, perhaps implausible, number of concepts are primitive and undefinable. For example, Fodor considers such concepts as EFFECT, ISLAND, TRAPEZOID, and WEEK to be all primitive, innate and unanalyzable because they all fall into the category <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "lexical concepts" [...] (those for which our language has a single word). Against this view, Bach argues that the concept VIXEN is almost certainly composed out of the concepts FEMALE and FOX, BACHELOR out of SINGLE and MALE, and so on.|$|E
500|$|Donald C. Willis, {{a writer}} who wrote about horror and science fiction films, {{described}} the horror scenes as completely lacking suspense, and said the film was [...] "so flimsy that its three co-plots seem to be operating independently of one another". Keith Brown of the University of Edinburgh, in his paper [...] "Notes on the Terror Film", argued that The Brute Man is an example <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the [...] "terror film", a genre distinguishable from the horror film due to its emphasis on naturally occurring sources of fear, rather than fantastical or otherworldly horror elements. Brown wrote that the Creeper character [...] "blurs the boundary between human and animal {{on account of his}} grotesque, deformed features, but is natural and thus a figure of terror".|$|E
500|$|Nel {{notes that}} Geisel makes heavy use of anapestic tetrameter in Mulberry Street {{and many of}} his later books, citing the rhythm and draw of the books' {{language}} as a main reason for their appeal. Thomas Fensch also notes the rollicking rhythm of the verse in Mulberry Street and Geisel's other books, writing, [...] "Children can read the lines; they can sing the lines; they can SHOUT! the lines; they can dance to the lines." [...] Fensch marks Mulberry Street as the start <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "escalating sequences or escalating action", a technique Geisel used in most of his books, in which the action builds with each page. As Fensch put it, [...] "The rhythm gallopsthe pictures move from left to right, toward the next page and the action builds." ...|$|E

500|$|Gutowski finds {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the [...] "protofestival" [...] pattern {{throughout the}} United States. In {{addition to the}} jackalope, his examples include the sea serpent of Nantucket, which in 1937 led to [...] "stories of armadas hunting the monster, and footprint discoveries by local businessmen", accompanied by wide publicity. In similar fashion, Newport, Arkansas, publicized its White River Monster, and Algiers, Louisiana, claimed to be home to a flying Devil Man. Ware, Massachusetts, drew media attention to its local reputation for alligator sightings. Perry, New York, held Silver Lake Sea Serpent Festivals based on a local hoax. The Hodag Festival in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, celebrates [...] "discovery" [...] of a prehistoric creature in a nearby pit. Willow Creek, California, hosts an annual Bigfoot Festival. Since 1950, Churubusco, Indiana, has celebrated Turtle Days, based on a story, part real and part invented, about {{the hunt for the}} Beast of Busco, a [...] snapping turtle said to be living in a nearby lake.|$|E
500|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Rintarō Okabe, the protagonist of Steins;Gate. Okabe is an {{eccentric}} individual, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who often goes by the pseudonym [...] Mayuri and Daru call him , a portmanteau of his surname and given name. He is the founder <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the [...] in Akihabara, where {{he spends most of}} his time, and has dubbed himself Lab Member No. 001 (as he is the first person to join). Okabe gives off the appearance of being delusional and paranoid, frequently referring to the [...] "Organization" [...] that is after him, talking to himself on his phone, and engaging in fits of maniacal laughter. Most of the time he takes on a fairly arrogant personality. He is usually seen wearing a lab coat. As he experiments with time travel, he learns that he {{is the only one who}} possesses the ability to determine changes between different timelines, which he dubs [...] "Reading Steiner". He is 18 years old and a first-year student at Tokyo Denki University.|$|E
500|$|Another quandary {{is that if}} the precogs' visions are infallible {{then the}} future cannot be otherwise, while if they are {{incorrect}} people will be punished for crimes they will never commit. Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the [...] "conditional future". He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what would have happened to their child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, she knows what will have happened to the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can see what he would have freely chosen to do, and what selections various people in his life would have freely made. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.|$|E

500|$|When {{writing the}} story, Uchikoshi made use <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the [...] "inductive {{composition}} method", where a setting is created first, after which one thinks about a core {{to the story}} {{that can be used}} to make the setting work. He did not recommend this way of writing, as he saw it as gamble that might not have resulted in an interesting story. This is in contrast to the deductive composition method, where a core story is thought of first, after which a setting is [...] "deduced", that matches the core. As an example of inductive composition used, Uchikoshi did not initially think up the story's [...] "main trick", and instead created two protagonists only because he thought it was getting stale with single-protagonist stories in visual novels, after which he thought about how to make two protagonists interesting. The writers only put little effort into hiding the 17-year gap between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes, writing each day of the story casually without a particular plan in mind. Rather, it took special effort to make it seem convincing when the game's secrets were revealed, with hints toward the truth added throughout the story, such as Tsugumi acting more suspicious when playing as the Kid due to having already experienced the events of Takeshi's route, or slight differences between the Kid's and Takeshi's routes due to the characters not being able to perfectly recreate events. While Coco was planned from the beginning as the character who knew the truth, Uchikoshi did not come up with the idea of leaving her on the bottom of the ocean until during the writing of the script.|$|E
500|$|In {{a lively}} {{exchange}} over {{what has come}} to be referred to as [...] "the Chinese room argument", John Searle sought to refute the claim of proponents <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "strong artificial intelligence (AI)" [...] that a computer program can be conscious, though he does agree with advocates of [...] "weak AI" [...] that computer programs can be formatted to [...] "simulate" [...] conscious states. [...] His own view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are. [...] To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols. [...] In this case, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program. [...] Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean. [...] If the experiment were done in English, since Searle knows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions, and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve. [...] Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages, but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English. [...] Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.|$|E

Langs' use of archetypes particularly pertains to issues associated with death anxiety, which Langs takes to be the root of psychic conflict.
