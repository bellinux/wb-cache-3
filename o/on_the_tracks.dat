5|$|After the tour, Dylan and {{his wife}} became estranged. He filled a small red {{notebook}} with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled Blood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tracks</b> in September 1974. Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.|$|E
5|$|The {{elevated}} {{stations are}} built in glass, concrete and steel to minimize their visual impact. Outside, there is parking for bicycles, cars, buses and taxis. The platforms are open, but have sheds {{as well as}} automatic sensors that halt trains if obstacles are detected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The town of Atherton, {{which lies}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> {{was an early}} and vocal {{opponent}} of electrification. Residents opposed electrification and the proposed high-speed rail route because the overhead electrical lines would require tree removal and the town could potentially be divided in two by permanently closing the two grade crossings at Fair Oaks Lane and Watkins Avenue.|$|E

5|$|While {{discussing}} the 2006 remix of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts {{at a dinner}} party, Eno suggested finishing some songs that he had written {{but that did not}} have lyrics. Byrne visited Eno's studio to listen to the demos and the two decided to collaborate to finish writing the songs. They continued working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> in New York City and London, with regular e-mail correspondence to finish the composition. Multi-instrumentalist and previous Eno collaborator Leo Abrahams performed guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio and played guitar with Byrne on one occasion. Abrahams would continue working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> in his home studio through May 2008, with all collaborations being carried on via e-mail.|$|E
5|$|Advantages over {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, {{and decreased}} weight which caused less wear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the trainsets and ordered another four trainsets, which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. The purchase {{price for the}} six trainsets was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 trainsets for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. Doing so would have required a significant rise in fares between the two cities, and the United States Department of Transportation blocked the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Berg {{station has}} seen many {{accidents}} and almost-accidents. In 1965, a deadly accident occurred between Ullevål and Berg stations, when a train ran over a 33-year-old man {{walking in the}} tracks. In 2002, a 24-year-old man was {{run over by a}} metro train approaching the station. The man survived the accident with minor wounds. In 2008, a 21-year-old drunk man was found crawling around <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> between the platforms. The police removed him from the station and sent him home in a taxi.|$|E

5|$|M.I.A. {{named the}} album after her mother, in {{contrast}} to her first album Arular, which was named after her father, and stated that her mother's struggles in life are a major theme of the recording. She began recording the album in early 2006 and worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> in various locations around the world, including India, Jamaica, Australia, Liberia and Trinidad. Planned sessions in the United States failed to occur, after M.I.A. was refused a long-term work visa to enter the country.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March 2016, 2 SMRT {{maintenance}} trainees {{were run}} over {{and killed by}} an oncoming C151 train (trainset 073/074) reportedly travelling at 60km/h, 150 metres from Pasir Ris MRT Station, at approximately 11.10 am. The maintenance staff were a group of 15 personnel tasked to investigate a possible signalling system fault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> near the Pasir Ris MRT Station. This incident had led to a 2.5 hour train service disruption and at least 10,000 commuters were affected.|$|E
5|$|When built, the {{surrounding}} area was composed of dirt roads and private residences. The Southern Pacific Railroad's 1868 west side rail line ran down Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the county courthouse. The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the dirty and noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric interurban line continued <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> until the 1930s. In 2007, work began on adding light rail tracks on Fifth Avenue for the planned MAX Green Line, and trains once again ran past City Hall starting in 2009.|$|E

5|$|By March 2008, the duo had {{recruited}} SebRochford to play drums with Byrne in New York City. Later that month, multi-instrumentalist {{and previous}} Eno collaborator LeoAbrahams was enlisted to perform guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio. Abrahams and Rochford would continue working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> in Abrahams' studio through May {{and their work}} was e-mailed to other collaborators—Byrne attended one session to play guitar. Other musicians worked with Byrne in NewYorkCity and Eno in London, such as frequent Byrne collaborator MauroRefosco, Eno's daughters Darla and Irial, and JarvisCocker of Pulp, who added uncredited guitar in London. The duo attempted to record {{as much of the}} music from home studios as possible and played almost all instrumentation themselves, saving the drums and percussion for the studio. In addition to the tracks that were released, the musicians had some other instrumentals that Byrne did not complete.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow {{declared}} a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. Consolidated Edison (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in Westchester. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in Tarrytown, New York, was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. Metro-North Railroad suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).|$|E
5|$|Moman {{moved away}} from the usual Presley pop {{recordings}} aimed at an established audience. A developer of the Stax Records sound, he incorporated a Memphis sound integrating soul, country, gospel and rural and electric blues. Many arrangements lean heavily on the rhythm section, with lesser contributions from strings, brass and woodwinds. Arrangers Green Spreen and Mike Leech changed Presley's image <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> with the addition of violas, cellos and French horns. The arrangers intended to blend the tracks for a distinctive sound; the strings are used in counterpoint, rising when the track fades and vice versa. The violas play the same lines as the French horns, with cello used for darker tones. Syncopation was incorporated by bowing.|$|E
5000|$|The Ultra Zone {{is notable}} for its tributes to two legendary guitarists: Frank Zappa (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> [...] "Frank"), and Stevie Ray Vaughan (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> [...] "Jibboom").|$|R

5|$|Posing as a nurse, Eva wheels Diabolik past {{groups of}} people. He sneaks into the morgue where Valmont's {{body has been}} cremated, {{collects}} the eleven emeralds from his ashes and escapes. The police discover that Diabolik is still alive and offer a million-dollar reward for him. He reacts by blowing up the tax offices. Without tax revenue, {{the country is in}} debt and sells off some gold to buy currency. Twenty tons of gold is melted into one solid block to make it difficult to steal, and the block is loaded on a train. Diabolik and Eva divert the train by leaving a burning truck <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> and re-route it to a bridge where a bomb is placed. It explodes when the train arrives and the gold falls into the water below. Diabolik and Eva collect it and return it to their hideout.|$|E
5|$|The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) which {{split from}} the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1949, {{inherited}} the anti-Hindi policies of its parent organisation. DMK's founder Annadurai had earlier {{participated in the}} anti-Hindi imposition agitations during 1938–40 and in the 1940s. In July 1953, the DMK launched an agitation for changing {{the name of a}} town – Dalmiapuram – to Kallakudi. They claimed that the town's name (after Ramkrishna Dalmia) symbolised the exploitation of South India by the North. On 15 July 1953, M. Karunanidhi (later Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu) and other DMK members erased the Hindi name in Dalmiapuram railway station's name board and lay down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> In the altercation with the Police that followed the protests, two DMK members lost their lives and several others including Karunanidhi and Kannadhasan were arrested.|$|E
5|$|The album charted {{at number}} 19 on the US Billboard 200, selling 18,000 copies {{in its first}} week in the United States. It also charted inter{{national}}ly on the national album charts in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Upon release, The Drug in Me Is You received mixed reviews. Critics consistently noted the contrast between hardcore music and pop music <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> but to mixed reception. Overall, the lyrics were viewed as being cliché while Radke's singing and return to making music were noted. In addition, critics focused on the bitter relationship between Radke and his former band, Escape the Fate, in which reviewers noticed the choice to attack the band {{in many of the}} album's tracks. The Drug in Me Is You was chosen by the Guitar World magazine as the album number 21 among the top 50 albums of 2011.|$|E

5|$|The hasty {{departure}} from Manchester degenerated into chaos. Mechanical failures {{and a lack}} of space to turn the locomotives meant that the seven trains on the northern track were unable {{to get out of the}} station. Only three carriages—the Duke's among them—managed to leave successfully. At around 6.30pm the Duke arrived in Roby, and went to spend the night at the Marquess of Salisbury's house at Childwall Hall. Meanwhile, the remaining 24 passenger carriages were eventually lashed together with rope and fastened to the three locomotives which remained usable, which hauled this single long train, carrying around 600 passengers, out of Manchester at a speed of around 5mph (8km/h), further slowed by crowds of people standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> and by grit and mud settling on the rails.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} vacuum trains that are {{designed}} to remove trash off of the tracks, but are ineffective and often broken. A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country {{based on the number of}} viable bacteria cells. In August 2016, the MTA announced that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, which is an aggressive plan that will dramatically reduce the amount of trash <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> and in the subway environment, and in turn should reduce track fires and train delays. The frequency of station track cleaning will be increased. In a two-week period, 94 stations will be cleaned, an increase from 34 stations. Starting on September 12, 2016, the MTA launched an intensive two-week, system-wide cleaning from all of the tracks at all of the system's stations. New portable track vacuum systems are in the works as the MTA is working with two manufacturers. Three new powerful vacuum trains, two arriving in 2017, and the third in 2018, and 27 new refuse cars will be part of the operation.|$|E
5|$|Trains {{passing through}} Baltimore {{at that time}} could not proceed {{directly}} through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at President Street Station {{on the east side}} of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails on Pratt Street by horsepower to Camden Station on the west side of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops. The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail. The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand and dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.|$|E
