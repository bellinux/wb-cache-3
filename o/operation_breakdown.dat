40|$|High voltage {{insulators}} {{are widely}} deployed in power systems {{to isolate the}} live- and dead-part of overhead lines {{as well as to}} support the power line conductors mechanically. Permanent, secure and safe operation of power transmission lines require that the high voltage insulators are inspected and monitor, regularly. Severe environment conditions will influence insulator surface and change creepage distance. Consequently, power utilities and transmission companies face significant problem in operation due to insulator damage or contamination. In this study, a new technique is developed for real-time inspection of insulator and estimating the snow, ice and water over the insulator surface which can be a potential risk of <b>operation</b> <b>breakdown.</b> To examine the proposed system, practical experiment is conducted using ceramic insulator for capturing the images with snow, ice and wet surface conditions.

Many timeseries models {{have been developed to}} forecast the unforeseen future of container throughput to project the needed amount of port equipments for optimum operation. Conventionally, a "ratio" method developed by port consultants at early port design stage is adopted for equipment planning, giving no consideration to the dynamic growth of the port in terms of improved layout and technological advancement in equipments. This study seeks first to enhance the empirical approach of the equipment planning at the end of planning time horizon by including assumed coefficient of port capacity parameters. The second is to compare the size of equipment purchase by receiving different terminal's future throughput demand from two univariate forecasting models at planning time horizon. The empirical method of equipment planning will be tested against the conventional yard equipment per quay crane ratio after deriving the throughput demand from forecasting models of Holt-Winter's exponential smoothing and seasonal ARIMA (autoregression integrated moving average) model. Results in the form of graphs and tables indicate similar forecasting pattern by two models and equipment estimation proofs to avail more redundancy for optimum operation.

Varying weather conditions, learning development on repetitive <b>operations,</b> equipment <b>breakdowns,</b> management i erference, and other external factors may impact he production process in construction. As a result of such interferences, the behavior of construction processes becomes ubject o random variations. This necessitates modeling construction operations as random processes during simulation. Random processes insimulation i clude activity and processing times, arrival processes (e. g. weather patterns) and disruptions. In the context of construction simulation studies, modeling a random input process is usually per-formed by selecting and fitting a sufficiently flexible probability distribution to that process based on sample data.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to improve the current {{manufacturing}} process through the application of FIT manufacturing principles with the aid of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) technique. FIT principles focus on making the manufacturing process lean, agile and sustainable while maintaining the productivity rates, profitability and waste at their optimum levels. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a powerful tool which can be used to build a model of the current manufacturing process and later utilised to study the effects on the process flow by simulating the model under different scenarios corresponding to different key process parameters. In this study, WITNESS software was used as a platform to build the DES model and run simulations. The simulations were carried out manually i. e. by an intuitive approach and later run automatically i. e. using the embedded optimising module within WITNESS to collect the necessary data for improving the current manufacturing process. This study has been conducted as part of a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) program within a traditional manufacturing industry. Data has been collected from the company, process flow was mapped for 3 different product categories, plant layout of existing manufacturing facility was created in CAD package and a DES model was created to test different methodologies suggested by FIT manufacturing. For the simulation model, specific rules and functions were created to mimic the process flow based on the extracted knowledge of current practice. Three different FIT scenarios were tested against measured outputs to see the potential benefits to the company. The results were validated by setting the process parameters to the values suggested by the optimised DES model. The fourth scenario was tested by modelling breakdown pattern of the machines in the simulation. In the first scenario, manual improvements were made intuitively using FIT principles to allow the process to be more lean, agile and sustainable by critical evaluation and analysis such as line balancing of existing processes. iv However, due to thresholds met by this approach in terms of improvements to the manufacturing process, the DES model was simulated for the second and third scenarios using the Experimenter module in WITNESS to capture the complex relationships that exist between the 3 FIT components considering the level of investment required as a constraint for decision making. The fourth scenario was used to study the effect of breakdowns of the machines on the production line and the effect of predictive maintenance on the overall manufacturing process. The study showed that, in general, resources such as machines and labour that are shared between production lines caused undue pressure on the production line. Also, maximum allocation of resources does not always lead to maximum increase in productivity. On the contrary, lesser but smarter investment on resources improved productivity by a higher margin. Employing people with multiple skills who can carry out multiple operations was found to improve productivity significantly. It was also found that increasing the efficiency of one production line did not always increase the overall efficiency due to cross-functional relationships within the manufacturing processes and increasing the efficiency of one production line is likely to cause a bottleneck on the other inter-dependent <b>operations.</b> <b>Breakdown</b> of machinery were found to impact the production process flow negatively. In contrary to the belief that preventive maintenance is the effective solution, it was found that a reactive maintenance strategy of having a spare machine is more cost effective, in this case. This option is viable in the current manufacturing model, but not always on all scenarios. Overall, the study showed that the application of FIT manufacturing principles applied with the help of a DES model could add significant value to the organisation and increase the operational efficiencies. This work can be easily adapted to other manufacturing industries to identify the inefficiencies in the manufacturing process and remedy the bottlenecks as well as remove non-value adding activities...|$|R
30|$|We {{found that}} the device {{performance}} is greatly influenced by the electric field distribution. To maintain the high gain and small dark current, the proper control of the electrical field in the multiplication and absorption layers is important. From the ref. [32], a suitable field distribution in InGaAs/InAlAs APD should comply with those rules. The guarantee Vpt (punch-through voltage)[*]<[*]Vbr (breakdown voltage) and Vbr-Vpt should have a safety margin for processing variations in temperature fluctuations and <b>operation</b> range. At <b>breakdown</b> voltage, the multiplication gain goes toward infinity and the current sudden increase [32]. When the dark or photo current reached 50  μA, the corresponding voltage is called breakdown voltage Vbr. In the absorption layer, the electric field should be larger than 50 – 100  kV/cm to ensure enough velocity for the photo-induced carriers. Concurrently, the electric field must be less than 180  kV/cm to avoid the tunneling effect in the absorption layer. Electric field distribution greatly influences the device performance. The choice of electric field in the absorption layer has a balancing of the trade-off between small transit time, dark current, and high responsivity for the practical requirement.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{constructs}} a {{model of}} the "institutional agenda " of capitalists in a closed domestic economy. The link between this agenda (i. e., the set of institutions capitalists desire) and the actual institutions regulating the economy is established. Some characteristics of this model are consistent with the claims of radical institutionalists; however, other characteristics are not. This model also permits, for the fIrSt time in a formal model, discussion of the link between the base and the superstructure, of the role of "the last instance " in historical development, and of the claim that there exists a "monopoly capital " stage of capitalism. A core claim of radical institutionalism is that the individual institutions regulating capital accumulation are interdependent. The concepts of a social structure of accumulation and of a mode of regulation explicitly embrace the idea of interdependence between institutions, though it is also articulated by others who use more eclectic frameworks of analysis (e. g., Marglin 1990). Many theoretical, historical, and econometric accounts of 'the construction of these interdependent sets of institutions, their <b>operation,</b> and their <b>breakdown</b> have been provided within this literature (e. g., Gordon, Edwards, and Reich 1982; Bowles, Gordon, an...|$|R

One of the {{key issues}} {{limiting}} the commercialization of power SiC rectifiers and switches is the poor yield due {{to the absence of}} an effective and reliable edge termination. Efficient edge termination allows for a thinner and heavier doped voltage blocking layer, which directly reduces conduction losses. The focus of this work was to optimize the efficiency and reproducibility of the edge termination technique. For that purpose, 4 H-SiC PiN diodes were fabricated with Junction Termination Extension (JTE) created by B+ and Al+ implantation. The JTE-terminated 4 H-SiC PiN diodes fabricated in this work exhibited stable reverse bias <b>operation</b> with avalanche <b>breakdown</b> occurring at 1. 8 kV. This voltage corresponds to the maximum one-dimensional electric field of 2. 67 MV/cm in the blocking layer under the pn junction. Forward voltage drops of 5 V and 8 V were associated with current densities of 1. 2 kA/cm 2 and 6. 5 kA/cm 2 respectively. Measurement results obtained on the fabricated devices closely matched the simulation results, which confirms the reproducibility and scalability of the design to much higher blocking voltage and forward current levels...|$|R
40|$|The novel {{real-time}} traffic sensing (RTS) model {{proposed in}} this paper not only senses traffic patterns but also chaotic traffic conditions, known as the fractal breakdowns, on the fly. If a web-based industrial ecosystem has included RTS as a functional component, it would possess the ability to acquire ambient intelligence of, and act upon, changes in traffic patterns. Its use of the results by the RTS as parameters for self-organization proactively could prevent sudden system failures. Web-based industrial ecosystems consist of distributed processing centers/entities/species. These species have distinctive functional characteristics and collaborate by message passing over the mobile Internet, which supports wireline and wireless communications in a mixed dynamic manner. The unpredictable traffic changes {{in such an environment}} could reduce system performance and lead to system instability and even failure. Although brief stints of chaotic operations or system failures followed by quick recoveries may be unnoticeable to human eyes, they can impede the normal operations of industrial systems and inflict huge financial losses. Any industrial ecosystem with RTS support would benefit from the enhanced reliability by detecting possible chaotic <b>operations</b> or fractal <b>breakdowns.</b> Department of Computin...|$|R
