40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the application of, {{and the challenges}} created by, {{a new class of}} objects in virtual environments: deformable <b>objects.</b> <b>Animation</b> techniques are examined to determine their relevance to the physically-based needs of virtual environments. Simulation techniques for one-, two- and three-dimensional objects are compared, with emphasis laid on the real-time solution for deformation. The problems inherent in applying a deformable object model to a virtual environment are discussed. Graphical models typically involve temporally and topologically invariant objects, with deformation computed as a series of still frames, which are then visualised by a standard renderer. However, within a virtual environment, temporally variant effects such as creep and flow become more important, since the object is being displayed in real-time. Computer graphics and virtual environments have different requirements for a deformable object model: virtual environments need real-time user interac [...] ...|$|E
40|$|An {{interface}} {{for software}} {{that creates a}} natural environment for engineering graphics students to improve their spatial reasoning and 3 D visualization skills is described. The skills of interest involve spatial transformations and rotations, specifically those skills that engineers use to reason about 3 D objects based on 2 D representations. The software uses an intuitive and interactive interface allowing direet manipulation of <b>objects.</b> <b>Animation</b> capability is provided to demonstrate the relationship between arbitrary positions of an object and standard orthographic views. A second skill of interest requires visualization of a cuttingplane intersection of an object. An interface is developed which allows intuitive positioning of the cutting-plane utilizing the metaphor of a “pool of water ” in which the object is partially submerged. The {{surface of the water}} represents the cutting plane. Adjustment of the pool depth combined with direct manipulation of the object provides for arbitrary positioning of the cutting-plane. Subjective evaluation of the software thus far indicates that students enjoy using it and find it helpful. A formal testing plan to objectively evaluate the software and interface design is underway...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel parameterization approach for complex shapes {{suitable for a}} multidisciplinary design optimization application. The approach consists of two basic concepts: (1) parameterizing the shape perturbations rather than the geometry itself and (2) performing the shape deformation {{by means of the}} soft <b>objects</b> <b>animation</b> algorithms used in computer graphics. Because the formulation presented in this paper is independent of grid topology, we can treat computational fluid dynamics and finite element grids in a similar manner. The proposed approach is simple, compact, and efficient. Also, the analytical sensitivity derivatives are easily computed for use in a gradient-based optimization. This algorithm is suitable for low-fidelity (e. g., linear aerodynamics and equivalent laminated plate structures) and high-fidelity analysis tools (e. g., nonlinear computational fluid dynamics and detailed finite element modeling). This paper contains the implementation details of parameterizing for planform, twist, dihedral, thickness, and camber. The results are presented for a multidisciplinary design optimization application consisting of nonlinear computational fluid dynamics, detailed computational structural mechanics, performance, and a simple propulsion module...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the IT {{industry}} has witnessed a growth -driven {{by the success of}} the Internet- in the requirement of skills based on the emergence of the technology and the creative media industries. This has provided a unique niche market where, a combination of programming and artistic knowledge, is a requirement. As a result, many of the courses focusing on multimedia and information technology need students to develop programming and scripting skills to develop Web applications, databases, 3 D modelling of <b>objects,</b> <b>animation</b> and games. For students who do not see themselves as serious programmers, some of the concepts and methods used in the teaching of programming can be difficult to grasp. It is important as a result to find ways of engaging students in activities where programming is seen as a tool to demonstrate other concepts and ideas visually which can in turn help in the teaching of programming principles. In this paper, the authors describe a number of activities used to engage multimedia students in the learning of scripting and programming. By the use of animation, mixed reality gaming, computer game design and research seminars, first year students are able to grasp the fundamentals of computer programming and combine it with their creative artistic side to produce digital multimedia content...|$|E

50|$|<b>Object</b> <b>animation</b> is {{considered}} a different form of animation distinct from model animation and puppet animation, as these two forms of stop-motion animation usually use recognizable characters as their subjects, rather than just objects like static toy soldiers, or construction toys such as Tinker Toys, LEGO brand bricks (Brickfilm), Lincoln Logs, Erector Sets, Playmobil, etc.|$|R
50|$|<b>Object</b> <b>animation</b> {{is often}} {{combined}} with other forms of animation, typically for a more realistic effect (e.g., Model Animation or Puppet Animation to add more complex movement or depth to the characters).

ABSTRACT: Jan Śvankmajer - is {{a leading}} world {{animation}} creator and a confirmed representative of surrealism belonging to a small circle of film artists who, apart from great achievements in short animation, can also boast of remarkable attainments in long features. He owes it to his technique of combining animated and acting scenes together, which he developed already when making his short film forms. The article is a synthetic attempt at presentation of the artisfs whole creative output starting from his first short animations from the 1960 s up to his latest feature film titiled Lunacy. The author of the text underlines {{the centrality of the}} <b>object</b> <b>animation</b> in the artistic work of Jan Śvankmajer, who is the most outstanding representative of this form of animation alongside Jan Lenica, Walerian Borowczyk and Stephen and Timothy Quay. In his latest film, the artist suggests with the kind of determination typical of the surrealists that all of his <b>object</b> <b>animation</b> production can be regarded as vision of a lunatic. Not many artists have courage {{to do so in the}} contemporary - and commercialized in the very nature of it - audiovisual culture...|$|R
