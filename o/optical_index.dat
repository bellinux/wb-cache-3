However, not much is known about the existence of optimal routings with levelled minimum <b>optical</b> <b>indices</b> besides the results established by Dinitz, Ling and Stinson via the partitionable Steiner quadruple systems approach. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of a large set of even levelled P 3 ⃗-design of order v and index 2, denoted by (v,P 3 ⃗, 2) -LELD, which is equivalent to an optimal, levelled (v− 2) -fault-tolerant routing with levelled minimum <b>optical</b> <b>indices</b> of the complete network with v nodes. On the basis of the theory of three-wise balanced designs and partitionable candelabra systems, several infinite classes of (v,P 3 ⃗, 2) -LELDs are constructed.

This material's permittivity above the plasma frequency can be positive and less than one. This means that the refractive index is just above zero.

50|$|The {{technology}} {{works by}} probing an optical stationary wave, or {{the sum of}} the standing waves in the case of polychromatic light, created by a light to be analyzed. In a SWIFTS linear configuration (true Lippman configuration), the stationary wave is created by a single-mode waveguide ended by a fixed mirror. The stationary wave is regularly sampled on one side of a waveguide using nano-scattering dots. These dots are located in the evanescent field. These nanodots are characterized by an <b>optical</b> <b>index</b> difference with the medium in which the evanescent field is located. The light is then scattered around an axis perpendicular to the waveguide. For each dot, this scattered light is detected by a pixel aligned with this axis. The intensity detected is therefore proportional to the intensity inside the waveguide at the exact location of the dot. This results in a linear image of the interferogram. No moving parts are used. A mathematical function known as a Lippmann transform, similar to a Fourier transform, is then applied to this linear image and gives the spectrum of the light.|$|E
