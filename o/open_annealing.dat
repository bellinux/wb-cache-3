40|$|Here we have {{developed}} a sensitive DNA amplified detection method based on isothermal strand-displacement polymerization reaction. This method takes advantage of both the hybridization property of DNA and the strand-displacement property of polymerase. Importantly, we demonstrate that our method produces a circular polymerization reaction activated by the target, which essentially allows it to self-detect. Functionally, this DNA system consists of a hairpin fluorescence probe, a short primer and polymerase. Upon recognition and hybridization with the target ssDNA, the stem of the hairpin probe is opened, after which the <b>opened</b> probe <b>anneals</b> with the primer and triggers the polymerization reaction. During this process of the polymerization reaction, a complementary DNA is synthesized and the hybridized target is displaced.

40|$|The {{impact of}} rapid thermal {{annealing}} RTA on large grained polycrystalline Si thin film solar cells on glass was investigated. The solar cells consist of absorber layers homo epitaxially grown at 600 C by electron beam evaporation on polycrystalline Si seed layers. Due to the thermal limitations of the preparation processes by the glass the absorber layers suffer from a structural imperfectness.

40|$|Crack {{healing in}} quartz has been {{investigated}} by optical microscopy and interferometry of rhombohedral (1 1 10) cracks in polished Brazilian quartz prisms that were annealed hydrothermally at temperatures of 250 ?C and 400 ?C for 2. 4 to 240 hours, fluid pressure Pf = Pc = 41 MPa, and varying pOH- (from 5. 4 to 1. 2 at 250 ?C for fluids consisting of distilled water and NaOH solutions with molalities up to 1). Crack morphologies before and after annealing were recorded for each sample in plane light digital images. Crack apertures were determined from interference fringes recorded using transmitted monochromatic light (l = 598 nm). As documented in previous studies, crack healing is driven by reductions in surface energy and healing rates are governed by diffusional transport; sharply defined crack tips become blunted and split into fluid- filled tubes and inclusions. A rich variety of fluid inclusion geometries are also observed with nonequilibrium shapes that depend on initial surface roughness. Crack healing is significant at T= 400 ?C. Crack healing is also observed at T= 250 ?C for smooth cracks with apertures < 0. 6 mm or cracks subject to low pOH-. The extent of crack healing is sensitive to crack aperture and to hackles formed by fine-scale crack branching during earlier crack growth. Crack apertures appear {{to be controlled by}} hackles and debris, which prop the crack surfaces <b>open.</b> Upon <b>annealing,</b> crack apertures are reduced, and these reduced crack apertures govern the kinetics of diffusional crack healing that follows. Hackles are sites of either enhanced or reduced loss of fluid-solid interface, depending on slight mismatches and sense of twist on opposing crack surfaces. Hackles are replaced either by healed curvilinear quartz bridges and river patterns surrounded by open fluid-filled crack, or by fluid- filled tubes surrounded by regions of healed quartz. For a given temperature, aperture and anneal time, crack healing is enhanced at low pOH- (? 1. 2) either because of changes in the hydroxylated quartz- fluid interface that enhance reaction rates or because of increased rates of diffusional net transport of silica at high silica concentrations...|$|R
40|$|For {{preparation}} of ZnO CdS Cu In,Ga Se 2 solar cells, {{physical vapor deposition}} PVD was employed to deposit CdS buffer layers in ultrahigh vacuum on Se decapped absorber surfaces, thus realizing an all dry fabrication process of the device. An 14. 1 total area and 14. 5 active area efficient ZnO CdS Cu In,Ga Se 2 solar cell under AM 1. 5 conditions was achieved after annealing the as prepared solar cells in air. Kelvin probe force microscopy KPFM measurements were carried out in situ to monitor the initial growth of the CdS buffer layer on the absorber, {{as well as its}} electronic properties, in particular, the work function. It was observed that the PVD CdS growth is initially inhibited at the absorber grain boundaries. Quantum efficiency measurements allowed us to suppose that during the initial growth stage a passivation of the grain boundaries occurs. The latter explains the higher short circuit currents of the cells with PVD CdS compared to their references with CdS grown by chemical bath deposition CBD. The beneficial effect of the annealing seems to originate from a formation of a region with higher band gap than that of the absorber bulk and inverted conductivity type at the absorber surface, close to the CdS Cu In,Ga Se 2 interface, leading to a dramatic change in the electronic transport properties and finally, to a significant enhancement of the <b>open</b> circuit voltage. <b>Annealing</b> of the ZnO PVD CdS Cu In,Ga Se 2 solar cells provides formation of PVD CdS Cu In,Ga Se 2 interface with properties similar to that of reference samples with CBD Cd...|$|R
40|$|Cast iron {{components}} in combustion engines, such as cylinder blocks and heads of trucks, are exposed {{for long periods}} of time to elevated temperatures. Moreover, the engines are started and stopped frequently during their operational life, constituting a large number of heating and cooling cycles. In geometrical complex components the sudden heating (starting the engine) and cooling (stopping the engine) lead to thermal gradients and thermal mismatch within the material, resulting in the local development of high stress levels. The many start-stop operations and their associated alternating stress levels can lead to a localized cracking phenomenon known as Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue (TMF). Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI) is a common material of choice for diesel engine cylinder heads of heavy trucks and is a type of graphitic cast iron, consisting of vermicular graphite particles embedded in a metal matrix of pearlite. This material provides a suitable combination of thermal and mechanical properties, satisfying the functional requirements of these engine components. The main aim of this research is to identify and understand the damage micro-mechanisms that control thermo-mechanical fatigue phenomena in cast iron (CGI). The acquired knowledge is of relevance for predicting the lifetime, improving the properties and increasing the reliability of diesel truck cylinder heads. The work of this study can roughly be categorized into three main subjects: (i) Microstructural evolutions of CGI at elevated temperatures, (ii) TMF crack growth characterization and (iii) precise microstructural analysis of the TMF-crack path. Microstructural Evolutions of CGI at Elevated Temperatures In a first series of experiments, time and temperature induced microstructural changes in CGI were characterized, in view of their possible role in the TMF behavior of CGI. During <b>open</b> air <b>annealing</b> of CGI at 420 °C microstructural changes take place in the material, which gave rise to volume expansion and weight increase. The weight increase can be explained by considering the formation of an oxide scale whereas the volume expansion can be attributed to the decomposition of pearlite into ferrite and graphite. It was observed that the atmosphere is of crucial importance in this process. Annealing in an open-air atmosphere produced ten times less volume expansion as compared to annealing in vacuum conditions. Internal oxidation was observed during annealing under atmospheric conditions and the presence of an internal oxidation layer largely inhibited the progress of pearlite decomposition. The observed oxide layers at the internal metal/vapour interface of cavities (left behind by denuded graphite) cause the obstruction of carbon diffusion and thus the suppression of the pearlite decomposition process. In addition it was found that the depth of the oxidized zone near the surface (the oxide penetration depth) was of the same order of magnitude as the eutectic cell size, i. e. the volume in which graphite particles are interconnected. This suggests that the interconnectivity of the graphite has a dominant influence on the kinetics of the oxidation process. The microstructural dependence of tensile and fatigue properties of CGI at room temperature were evaluated by an extended annealing treatment of 720 h at 420 °C. This extended annealing treatment leads to better tensile (increase in yield strength, ductility) and dynamic properties (fatigue lifetime) at room temperature. The variations of mechanical properties were observed both after annealing under atmospheric and vacuum conditions, but were more pronounced after vacuum annealing. This can be explained by the decomposition of the pearlite phase during annealing and the formation of new ferrite at the graphite/metal interface. It is assumed that the ferrite/graphite interface exhibits a stronger bond than the pearlite/graphite interface. As this stronger bond will be better resistant to delamination, it will strengthen the material both in static and dynamic loading. Such effects were far less pronounced in the open-air annealed material, which could be associated with the fact that it was shown that internal oxidation strongly reduced the kinetics of decomposition. TMF Crack Growth Characterization An important part of this study was to measure and analyze the TMF lifetime of CGI. For smooth and notched specimens, the TMF lifetime was measured in TMF tests under total-constraint conditions, with temperatures cycling between 50 °C and 420 °C. By considering the notch depth as the initial crack length, TMF lifetimes were reproduced numerically using the Paris equation for fatigue crack growth (da/dN = C (?K) m). The calculated lifetimes were found to be in good agreement with all experimental results, covering a wide range of TMF lifetimes from 30 to 1400 cycles. Also for smooth specimens the Paris model worked well by considering the typical graphite particle size as notch depth. It is one of the main conclusions of this work that graphite particles act as internal notches from which a TMF crack almost immediately starts to grow during the first TMF cycles. Hence, it was established that TMF lifetime in CGI is governed by crack growth and not by crack initiation. The relevance of the Paris growth law was further confirmed by meticulously measuring the actual crack growth rates for three typical values of the stress intensity factor. The resulting crack growth rates proved to be in reasonable agreement with the predicted values according to the Paris model. It was further shown that the cyclic plasticity of the bulk material, accumulated during TMF cycles, does not have a noticeable effect on TMF lifetime (i. e. crack growth rates are not affected). The notched dog-bone specimen geometry is proposed in this work as a valid alternative for monitoring the TMF behavior of CGI. By applying standard TMF tests with notched specimens, it was possible to significantly reduce both testing time and experimental data scatter, whilst preserving a realistic estimation of the lifetime of the smooth sample. The effect of prolonged holding times (HT) on TMF lifetime was studied by using notched specimens and a clear effect was observed. Extended holding times were accompanied by an increased relaxation of compressive stresses, causing higher tensile stresses to develop in the subsequent low temperature stages of the TMF cycles. So, extended HTs had an adverse effect on the sample lifetime with a saturating effect for HTs above 1800 s. The Paris fatigue-crack-growth model was used also to estimate the impact of extended HTs. According to the Paris growth law, using a fixed value of tensile stress at low temperature, it was estimated that an increase of holding time from 30 s to 18000 s (5 h) produced a drop of 45 % in lifetime. In reality a 60 % drop in lifetime was measured, though, which implies that a combined effect of (tensile) stress and microstructural evolution during TMF is responsible for the reduction of lifetime. Precise Microstructural Analysis of the TMF Crack Path To the purpose of precise characterization of the complex TMF-crack-path morphology in CGI in relation to local microstructural features and to find out how and by which mechanisms the cracks predominantly develop, 2 D and 3 D orientation contrast imaging was carried out on wide field sample volumes, covering several mm 3 of imaged material. The data analysis revealed that the crystal planes that are parallel to the (local) crack plane are essentially of a random orientation. Conversely, it was found that graphite particles do not only play a crucial role in the crack initiation, but also are of primary significance for crack propagation. Quantitative analysis of the EBSD data in 2 D and 3 D showed that the distribution of graphite particles is very important for the crack propagation, as it was revealed that graphite particles enhance crack growth. It was statistically proven that the density of graphite particles in the crack plane is more than double of the density in an arbitrary plane. Our materials knowledge, based on the interpretation of test results in terms of quantifiable microstructural data functions, is of crucial importance to develop a microstructurally based TMF model.
