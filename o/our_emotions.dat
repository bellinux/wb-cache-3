25|$|The {{studies of}} Paul Ekman, a {{psychologist}} who created the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), indicates {{that a lot of}} “thin slicing” can be done within seconds by unconsciously analyzing a person’s fleeting look called a microexpression. Ekman claims that the face is a rich source {{of what is going on}} inside our mind and although many facial expressions can be made voluntarily, our faces are also dictated by an involuntary system that automatically expresses <b>our</b> <b>emotions.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{proposed}} a weighted discrete K-nearest neighbor (weighted D-KNN) classification algorithm for detecting and evaluating emotion from Mandarin speech. In the experiments of the emotion recognition, Mandarin emotional speech database used contains five basic emotions, including anger, happiness, sadness, boredom and neutral, and the extracted acoustic features are Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (LPCC). The results reveal that the highest recognition rate is 79. 55 % obtained with weighted D-KNN optimized based on Fibonacci series. Besides, we design an emotion radar chart which can present the intensity of each <b>emotion</b> in <b>our</b> <b>emotion</b> evaluation system. Based on <b>our</b> <b>emotion</b> evaluation system, we implement a computer-assisted speech training system for training the hearing-impaired people to speak more naturally. ...|$|R
25|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known of these topics is Evolution and Ethics, which deals with the {{question}} of whether biology has anything particular to say about moral philosophy. Both Huxley and his grandson Julian Huxley gave Romanes Lectures on this theme. For a start, Huxley dismisses religion as a source of moral authority. Next, he believes the mental characteristics of man are as much a product of evolution as the physical aspects. Thus, <b>our</b> <b>emotions,</b> our intellect, our tendency to prefer living in groups and spend resources on raising our young are part and parcel of our evolution, and therefore inherited.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt {{believed}} that because tragedy engages <b>our</b> <b>emotions</b> most profoundly, {{it is the}} greatest kind of drama. Of the tragedies based on Greek and Roman history, he ranked Julius Caesar beneath the other Roman tragedies, Coriolanus and Antony and Cleopatra. But, as elsewhere, he expresses admiration for the fine discrimination of character, the depiction of [...] "the manners of the common people, and the jealousies and heart-burnings of the different factions" [...] in Julius Caesar.|$|E

2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{issue in}} the study of the emotion-memory relationship is whether <b>our</b> <b>emotions</b> are influenced by our behavioral reaction to them, and whether this reaction—in the form of expression or suppression of the emotion—might affect what we remember about an event. Researchers have begun to examine whether concealing feelings influences our ability to perform common cognitive tasks, such as forming memories, and found that the emotion regulation efforts do have cognitive consequences. In the seminal work on negative affect arousal and white noise, Seidner found support for the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism through observations regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza was a thoroughgoing determinist {{who held}} that {{absolutely}} {{everything that happens}} occurs through the operation of necessity. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand why we act as we do. By forming more [...] "adequate" [...] ideas {{about what we do}} and <b>our</b> <b>emotions</b> or affections, we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.|$|E

2500|$|Beuys {{had adopted}} shamanism {{not only as}} the {{presentation}} mode of his art but also in his own life. Although the artist as a shaman has been a trend in modern art (Picasso, Gauguin), Beuys is unusual in that respect as he integrated “his art and his life into the shaman role.” Beuys believed that humanity, with its turn on rationality, was trying to eliminate “emotions” and thus eliminate {{a major source of}} energy and creativity in every individual. In his first lecture tour in America he was telling the audience that humanity was in an evolving state and that as “spiritual” beings we ought to draw on both <b>our</b> <b>emotions</b> and our thinking as they represent the total energy and creativity for every individual. Beuys described how we must seek out and energize our spirituality and link it to our thinking powers so that “our vision of the world must be extended to encompass all the invisible energies with which we have lost contact.” ...|$|E

Some leaders, including representatives of Islamic Jihad and Hamas, have said that they consider children of 16 to be adults. International law defines a child as any person under the age of eighteen.

Additionally, we have added as a novel function the simulation of the output of the emotion recognizer. In order to do so, the selection of the possible users' emotions coincides with the set described for the development of <b>our</b> <b>emotion</b> recognizer for the system (boredom, anger, doubtfulness and neutral).|$|R
