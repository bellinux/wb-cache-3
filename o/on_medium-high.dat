40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of geomorphological research of the periglacial relief on mountain Crnook (1881 m) in Southeast Serbia. The results have showed the significant presence of modern periglacial morphology on this mountain which is developing in azonal conditions of a periglacial mountain environment. Research results from Crnook are significant because they represent the continuation of similar studies <b>on</b> <b>medium-high</b> mountains of Serbia (Kopaonik, Stara Planina). Based on a comparison of data from Kopaonik, Stara Planina and Crnook (Nešić D., Milinčić M., 2004; Belij S. et al., 2008; Nešić D. et al., 2009; Nešić D., 2009), it can be concluded that in similar climatic frameworks with a significant share of anthropogenic activities, in terms of reducing the forest area in the highest parts of a mountain, similar modern periglacial processes develop on mountains as an indicator of azonal or boundary development framework of modern mountain periglacial environment. During 2006 - 07, the project "Modern periglacial geomorphic landforms on the mountains of Serbia" was initiated and the field research was conducted on the high mountains of Serbia (Stara Planina, Kopaonik, Kučaj, Beljanica, Zlatibor), and the mountains of Southeast Serbia (Vardenik, Besna Kobila, Dukat i Crnook) ...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{wind energy}} {{resource}} (WER) {{is a key}} to deal with climate change and energy structure adjustment. A crucial issue is to obtain the distribution and variability of WER, and mine the suitable location to exploit it. In this paper, a multicriteria evaluation (MCE) model is constructed by integrating resource richness and stability, utilization value and trend of resource, natural environment with weights. The global resource richness is assessed through wind power density (WPD) and multi-level wind speed. The utilizable value of resource is assessed by the frequency of effective wind. The resource stability is assessed by the coefficient of variation of WPD and the frequency of prevailing wind direction. Regression slope of long time series WPD is used to assess the trend of WER. All of the resource evaluation indicators are derived from the atmospheric reanalysis data ERA-Interim with spatial resolution 0. 125 °. The natural environment factors mainly refer to slope and land-use suitability, which are derived from multi-resolution terrain elevation data 2010 (GMTED 2010) and GlobalCover 2009. Besides, the global WER utilization potential map is produced, which shows most high potential regions are located in north of Africa. Additionally, by verifying that 22. 22  % and 48. 8   9 % operational wind farms fall <b>on</b> <b>medium-high</b> and high potential regions respectively, the result can provide a basis for the macroscopic siting of wind farm...|$|E

Although the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program defines productivity {{as the potential}} of a particular forest stand to grow timber wood {{and is based on}} the maximum mean annual increment of fully stocked natural stands (Bechtold and Patterson 2005), productivity reflects soil characteristics and climatic factors (Skovsgaard and Vanclay 2008). Hence, medium–high site productivity appears to favor Japanese stiltgrass invasion.|$|R

40|$|Typical {{methods of}} {{stimulating}} intellectual capital (eg. to create KBE) are activities {{conducive to the}} development of business environment supporting the development of sectors based <b>on</b> high and <b>medium-high</b> technology. Th e article examines an alternative method of stimulating intellectual capital - increasing tourist attractiveness of a region. In the case of not traditionally touristic regions, the improvement of tourist attractiveness requires innovative action – eg. conversion of a mine into a concert hall or a spa. Such activities are refl ected in the statistics as an increase in the knowledge-intensive services (KIS) in the regional service structure. Th e main goal of the paper is to fi nd whether two development policies – based on stimulating innovativeness or based on enhancing tourism function intensity are complimentary or substitutes. We found a statistically signifi cant correlation between the stage of tourism development and the share of knowledge-intensive services in total services in 2009 in Polish counties. Th e highest percentage of counties with the highest share of KIS relates to counties with low level of intensity but strong growth of tourist function.

40|$|The {{scientific}} evidence is very strong: climate change presents very serious global risks and it demands an urgent global response. This paper {{is part of}} the dissemination phase of a research project assessing the need to adapt buildings in New Zealand to climate change based <b>on</b> medium-low and <b>medium-high</b> climate change scenarios from research by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA). The overall purpose is to determine the impact of climate change on the built environment and to generate a set of options for adaptation. The building sector’s vulnerability to climate change is assessed through: • Topology and condition review of the national building stock; • House overheating conditions and energy consumption simulations; and • A scenario-based social impacts study. Adaptation options and recommendations are presented for a broad range of building-related climate change impacts. Economic modelling and cost-benefit analyses are used to investigate the economic viability of thermal adaptation. Although the effects of climate change are expected to be less severe in New Zealand than in many other parts of the world, the key message from this report is that the strong, early and coordinated action on climate change can limit potentially large social, cultural and economic costs in New Zealand...|$|R
30|$|On {{the basis}} of {{analyses}} done by Cayan et al. (2008), climate change scenarios were selected from those used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment. Two emission scenarios were selected to range from optimistic to business-as-usual. Two models were required to contain realistic representations of some regional features, such as the spatial structure of precipitation and important orographic features, and to produce a realistic simulation of aspects of California's recent historical climate - particularly the distribution of monthly temperatures and the strong seasonal cycle of precipitation {{that exists in the}} region and throughout the western states. Because the observed western US climate has exhibited considerable natural variability at seasonal to interdecadal time scales, the historical simulations by the climate models were required to contain spatial and temporal variability that resembles that from observations at shorter time scales. Finally, the selection of models was designed to include models with differing levels of sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing. On {{the basis of}} these criteria, two GCMs were identified: the parallel climate model [PCM] (with simulations from NCAR and DOE groups; see Washington et al. 2000; Meehl et al. 2003) and the NOAA geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory [GFDL] CM 2.1 model (Stouffer et al. 2006; Delworth et al. 2006). The choice of greenhouse gas emission scenarios which focused <b>on</b> A 2 (<b>medium-high)</b> and B 1 (low) emissions was based upon implementation decisions made earlier by IPCC (Nakic'enovic' et al. 2000).|$|R
40|$|In last years, several {{research}} teams pointed {{their attention on}} the application of active noise control systems (ANC) inside the cabs of agricultural tractor, {{with the purpose of}} reducing the driver exposition to noise, that is only partially controlled by the frame of the cab. This paper reports the results of a first experience that aimed at verifying the applicability of an ANC <b>on</b> a <b>medium-high</b> power, tracked tractor without cab. The tested tractor was a Fiat Allis 150 A, equipped with rear power take off, used in the execution of deep primary tillage in compact soils. It is a tracked tractor without cab, with maximum power of 108. 8 kW at 1840 min– 1 of the engine. The ANC consists of a control unit box based on a digital signal processor (DPS), two microphones, two speakers and a power amplifier. The instrumentation used in noise data collecting and processing consisted of a multichannel signal analyzer (Sinus - Soundbook), a ½” microphone capsule and an acoustic calibrator, both Bruel & Kjaer. The study aimed at evaluating the behaviour of the ANC by means of tests carried out under repeatable conditions, characterized by pre-defined engine speed values. Three replications have been made for each engine speed. The sampling time was 30 s. Two series of tests were performed in order to compare the results observed with the ANC on and off. The engine speed adopted in the study ranged from 600 min– 1, up to 2000 min– 1 (maximum speed) with steps of 100 min– 1. The ANC proved to be effective in the interval of speed between 1400 and 1700 min– 1, where the samplings have been intensified, adopting steps of 50 min– 1. In such an interval, the attenuation observed with the ANC system on appeared evident both as weighed A sound pressure level (from 1. 29 up to 2. 46 dB(A)) and linear (from 4. 54 up to 8. 53 dB). The best performance has been observed at the engine speed of 1550 min– 1, with attenuations, respectively of 2. 46 dB(A) and 7. 67 dB. Outside of the engine speed interval 1400 - 1700 min– 1, the attenuations always resulted lower than 1 dB(A) for the weighed A sound pressure level and between 0. 66 and 7. 72 dB...|$|R

Secondly, the author discusses the capacity for Los Angeles' rail system to support housing development. Thirdly, the author presents housing density and land use characteristics for neighborhoods located within a / 4 mile radius of the City of Los Angeles' 41 rail stations. Fourthly, the author conducts a more specific land use and zoning analysis for 5 station neighborhoods varying in neighborhood and transit type. Although the city of Los Angeles has made various policy and development efforts to concentrate new development near rail investments, these polices and projects have only recently begun to incorporate housing as a component. The finding in this report demonstrates the range of residential densities within all station neighborhoods as well as highlights the zoning and land use limitations <b>on</b> building new <b>medium-high</b> density infill housing near rail. Although many of the rail station neighborhoods are still very much in transition and residential density is expected to increase especially along the Red Line station neighborhoods, the report makes various recommendations encouraging the city to take a more proactive and comprehensive approach in TOD development in order to address the barriers of the city's current Euclidean zoning code and facilitate further infill housing developments. by Erin M.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years the {{significance}} of life-long learning skills has been greatly realised with regard to adult learning, which is based on self-motivation, engagement in learning and making full use of a person’s resources. In this context, it is paramount that healthcare professionals take responsibility for their profession by being innovative, creative and flexible to change in order to facilitate the adaptation process and encourage responsiveness to change. The main principles can be summarized as lifelong learning, which are strictly linked to self-directed learning. The aims of this study were to describe (a) the self-directed learning competence of Nurses (Registered Nurse, RN) and Radiologist Technicians (RT); (b) the self-directed learning competence of RN and RT students before their graduation. A comparative cross-sectional study approach was adopted; a consecutive sample of RNs and RTs attending continuing education seminars, workshops and other initiatives from 2009 to 2010 were considered for this study. Moreover, all Nursing and Radiology Technicians students about to graduate in the same course and studying in the same region were included. The Self-Rating Scale of Self-Directed Learning (SRSSDL) was used to collect data for the purpose of the study. Eight hundred and forty-seven participants were involved (453 RNs, 141 RTs, 182 RN students and 68 RT students) who obtained an average SRSSDL score of 224. 7 (± 25. 0). RNs and RTs got <b>on</b> average a <b>medium-high</b> score (229. 1 ± 22. 9 and 219. 6 ± 29. 2, respectively) and the majority of them (63. 8 – 51. 1 %) reached a high level of self-directed learning. In order to promote tailored continuing education programs and interprofessional continuing education strategies, and identify the support to offer to healthcare workers according to their needs, educators should be aware of their self-directed learning skills. Therefore, individuals with high competence should adopt different strategies from those who have limited skills. Reflecting on self-directed learning competence of students before their graduation incorporates self-directed learning into the professional continuum and clarifies the University’s contribution in developing this important skill...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{thesis is}} a {{quantitative}} research {{focused on the}} measurement of the Reliability of the Spanish Version of the Utrecht Early Mathematical Competence Test (Scale A). The Utrecht Early Mathematical Competence Test was constructed in 1994 by Hans van Luit; Bernadette van de Rijt & Albèr H. Pennings, in Netherlands. Initially it had a pool of 120 items. Currently, it is composed by two scales (A and B) each consisting of 40 items. The purpose of this test it to assess the developmental level of early mathematical competence in children ages 4 to 7 years, by evaluating eight mathematical concepts: Comparison of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of objects; classification of objects in class or subclass; correspondence one to one relation; seriation of objects in class or subclass based on criteria; counting words forward and backward; structured counting; resultative counting and general knowledge of numbers. As a primary teacher graduated from the Pontifical University of Ecuador, I have always been concerned about mathematical learning disabilities and I believe {{that the use of}} an appropriate assessment tool that helps us teachers to know the mathematical development of kindergarten students can be crucial in preventing future learning problems or inferior performance later. It can also contribute in a significant way to special educational planning and decision-making, for example, in terms of more accurate evaluation and diagnosing, in establishing supportive social networks, and in the designing of appropriate learning materials. Among some instruments used in Ecuador to assess the mathematical skills in children we can find the Spanish version of the Utrecht Early Mathematical Competence Test (Scale A). This version was developed in the University of Cadiz, Spain. Considering that there have been no studies about the reliability of the results obtained in the application of this test in Ecuador, the aim of my project will be to measure the reliability of this version when it is used in Ecuadorian kindergartens. The research is focused on reliability because it reflects the ability of an instrument to perform and maintain its functions in routine. A low punctuation of the reliability of a test can be a sign that the items are ambiguous or that the standard conditions during the administration of the test are failing. In other words, measuring the reliability of the test will show us the consistency of this measure in the Ecuadorian environment. Between the several general classes of reliability estimates, two types of reliability were estimated for this research: The test-retest and the internal consistency. The study was carried out on a sample of one hundred Ecuadorian children, between four and five years old. The children were students of 3 different kindergartens in Quito, which are well known for their good academic level and they are ranked <b>on</b> a <b>medium-high</b> economical level. After applying the statistical techniques to the data collected through the SPSS program, the statistical estimations showed a high degree for both, test-retest reliability and internal consistency reliability. These results of the empirical studies confirmed that the Spanish version of the Utrecht Early mathematical competence is a reliable assessment method for examining the numerical abilities of Ecuadorian preschool children...|$|R
