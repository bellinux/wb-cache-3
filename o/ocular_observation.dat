6000|$|These {{considerations}} also {{remove the}} objection {{arising from the}} impossibility of ocularly following the lines in their prolongation to infinity. For though, in order actually to see that two given lines never meet, {{it would be necessary}} to follow them to infinity; yet without doing so we may know that if they ever do meet, or if, after diverging from one another, they begin again to approach, this must take place not at an infinite, but at a finite distance. Supposing, therefore, such to be the case, we can transport ourselves thither in imagination, and can frame a mental image of the appearance which {{one or both of the}} lines must present at that point, which we may rely on as being precisely similar to the reality. Now, whether we fix our contemplation upon this imaginary picture, or call to mind the generalizations we have had occasion to make from former <b>ocular</b> <b>observation,</b> we learn by the evidence of experience, that a line which, after diverging from another straight line, begins to approach to it, produces the impression on our senses which we describe by the expression, “a bent line,” not by the expression, “a straight line.”(73) ...|$|E

40|$|Humans {{perceive}} the environment through sensory inputs which the brain processes appropriately for the stimulus. This {{is particularly true}} of visual cognition and interpretation of geospatial images. The virtual scene, imagined in the brain, is inherently related to neuro-physiological features of the human visual system and differs from the real world. The brain processes visual input by concentrating on specific components of the entire sensory realm so that the interesting features of a scene may be examined with greater attention to detail than peripheral stimuli. Visual attention, responsible for regulating sensory information to sensory channels of limited capacity, serves as a “selective filter”, interrupting continuously the process of <b>ocular</b> <b>observations</b> by visual fixations. In this paper we analyze specific features of the human visual system involved with geospatial imagery analysis using tracking eyes movements and the requirements for hardware, suitable for corresponding treatment of geospatial images in augmented photogrammetric systems.

40|$|Red eye {{is one of}} {{the most}} common ocular presentations in general {{practice}} and emergency departments. It is caused by conditions ranging from a benign eye problem to a sight-threatening condition requiring urgent ophthalmic referral and treatment. Causes include infection, inflammation, trauma, allergies, auto-immune response, or rarely, secondary to intra-ocular tumours In this article primary acute angle closure glaucoma and acute iritis will be discussed as sight-threatening red eye conditions. Dry eyes, chronic blepharitis, and conjunctivitis will be discussed as non-sight-threatening eye conditions. Effective recognition of the signs and symptoms of these conditions facilitates distinction between a sight or non-sight-threatening ocular problem, leading to accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Relieving ocular pain, restoring vision, and preventing sight loss are paramount.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of community involvement on management of water tanks in the Arkavathi sub-basin in the state of Karnataka, South India. Water management was analysed from a socio-environmental perspective, with emphasis on village-level stakeholders’ roles and perceived responsibility. The efficiency of community participation was investigated by comparing two villages having undergone the same World Bank launched program to restore water bodies traditionally used to sustain the livelihood of the rural population. In one village there was a resistance towards how the implementation of the tank rejuvenation project had been performed, in the other there was no local involvement. A minor field study was conducted by visiting the two villages. Qualitative interviews were held with village-level stakeholders of three age groups, to analyse changes over time in knowledge and attitudes. Additionally, <b>ocular</b> <b>observation</b> and photo documentation were made of the study areas. Some informal interviews were carried out with members of an external non-governmental organisation and locals in the study villages. The collected data were analysed by comparing the results for the two villages, as well as the results of the different age groups and genders. There were significant differences in awareness and sense of responsibility, but not knowledge, between the two villages. In the village with a community involvement resisting the governmental scheme for tank renovation, this involvement had proved to be of some advantage to the local community. Contrary to the guidelines, the governmental implementation of the water management strategy did not include local stakeholders’ participation, nor were the tanks restored. Overall, the villagers considered the tank management to be the responsibility of external authorities. There were generally no significant differences between the age groups or men and women, though there were indications of a lower level of knowledge and awareness in women. Absence of effective institutions for water management on all levels as well as difficulties in mainatining efficient village level leadership for community participation are factors causing a major gap between planning and implementation...|$|E
40|$|The broad {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the socioeconomic impact of canal side plantation on the sustainable livelihood of local communities in the study area. Two types of data was collected for this research, namely primary and secondary data. The secondary data was collected from the archive of the Forests National Corporation (FNC) and relevant studies, while the primary data was collected through different methods; interviews with 91 respondents, semi-structural interviews with government officials from the FNC and Irrigation Unit of Gezira Scheme, and observation and experience of the researcher. Moreover, mensurational data was collected for the calculation of the volumes and stocking densities of trees in canal side plantation. Gezira Scheme was selected as study area for this research where the intervention of canal side plantation is practice at a large scale. Please purchase PDFcamp Printer on [URL] to remove this watermark. The main findings of the research are; although all age groups are participating in the canal side plantation, the majority of them are old people with little representation of the youth. This result confronts the sustainability of the intervention in the study area. The intervention of canal side plantation is autonomous (locally driven), the local people in one side started protecting their wild trees around the irrigational canal and the intervention adopted latter by other villages in the study area. The canal side plantations are managed by the local people under close supervision of the FNC which provides training and extension services. Village committee is the responsible body for the management of the plantations. Selection of the members of the village committee is base on general consensus or election of the members. Time of tree harvesting is base on <b>ocular</b> <b>observation</b> of the volume of the trees and the urgent needs of the community. The intervention of canal side plantation provides satisfactory financial returns which are exploited in rural development through maintenance and establishment of public services in the study area. Moreover, the local people perceive the social and environmental benefits gained from the adoption of canal side plantation like protection against dust storms, reduction of malaria and bilharzias incidences in the study area. Always there are conflicts regarding canal side plantation between the local people and the Irrigation Unit of Gezira Scheme from one side and between the local people and the FNC. All the conflicts are cause by the financial returns from the intervention. The local people suggested some proposals for the improvement of the activity. The main conclusions drawn from this study are; extension services can easily be delivered in the study area since the majority of the respondents are literate capable of following instructions and interpret any symbols. Since the intervention is autonomous, this indicates the creativity of the local people in dealing with their surrounding environment. The local people showed their potentiality in managing the canal side plantation satisfactorily and protecting them against offences and animals. Moreover, the FNC was able to sensitize and mobilize the local people to participate in the activity of canal side plantation and organize themselves into working group (village committee for managing the plantations. The main recommendations drawn from this study area; there is an urgent need for coordination between the FNC and the Irrigation Unit of Gezira Scheme and the local people in the study area for sake of sustaining the intervention of canal side plantation, and the importance of delivering extension massages systematically, instead of sporadic visits, in the different silvicultural treatments...|$|E

40|$|Background and aims: Among children, {{the lack}} of {{physical}} activity (PA) is widespread in developed countries. Further, the majority of all skin cancers depend on an overexposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in early life. The combination of sufficient PA and suberythemal UVR exposure (potentially sufficient for vitamin D production) dispersed over the day is vital to general wellbeing and bone health, especially in growing children and adolescents. However, long regulated school days entail less free mobility and outdoor stay, which may jeopardize the opportunities for cohesive intense physical activity (PA) and suberythemal UVR exposure. The impact of the school outdoor environment upon schoolchildren’s PA has been studied but not {{in combination with the}} exposure to UVR from the sun during the school day in children of different ages during one academic year containing different seasons. The overall aim for this thesis was to examine the crosssectional impact of outdoor environments at compulsory school level in different seasons upon PA and solar UVR exposure in Swedish pupils. Material and Methods: The impact of school outdoor environment upon pupils' physical activity and UVR exposure during free-mobility, scheduled time and physical education (PE) were studied in 196 pupils aged 7 - 15 years (grades 2, 5, and 8) at four schools in mid-southern Sweden during 5 consecutive days each in September, March and May. Actigraph GT 3 X+ Activity monitors were used for PA assessments and for separation of indoor from outdoor stay, supplementary to <b>ocular</b> <b>observation.</b> Predictors for PA during school stay, expressed as mean daily accelerometer counts and time in different PA intensities were measured per season, day, grade and gender. For individual assessment of erythemally effective UVR (joule per exposed m 2 of the skin), a polysulphone film dosimeter badge was pinned {{to the top of the}} pupils’ right shoulders and worn during school-time during the entire week. Their individual UVR exposures were related to and expressed as fractions of total available ambient UVR in the schools’ outdoor environments which differed considering amount of shade, vegetation, and peripheral city-scape quantified as percentage of free sky view calculated by fish-eye photography. Questionnaires and diaries were applied to control for confounders. Results: Overall, free-living PA outdoors generated the highest mean accelerometer counts for moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and together with outdoor physical education contributed with 50 % of total mean accelerometer counts though representing only 25 % of the total school time. Season, age, gender and weather had an impact on both PA and UVR exposure, with less PA and UVR exposure. In March, in inclement weather both PA and UVR exposure dropped, especially among older pupils and girls. During all seasons both MVPA counts and UVR exposures were significantly higher among 2 nd graders vs. 5 th and 8 th graders. In September and March play at sport fields had a positive impact on pupils’ PA and suberythemal sun exposure (potentially sufficient for vitamin D production). Among 2 nd and 5 th graders and in September this interaction between attributes of the physical environment and level of PA and UVR exposure was pronounced. In May overexposure to UVR did occur, though green settings with trees and shrubs and fixed play equipment close to the greenery protected from hazardous UV exposure and promoted high levels of MVPA. Conclusions: More time outdoors, at all seasons, would favorably increase school children´s chances of reaching recommended levels of PA. There is a potential for prolonged suberythemal outdoor stay for play in open areas during fall and early spring at Lat. 56 oN. Outdoor activities in such settings should therefore be encouraged. In late spring, long outdoor exposures of the youngest pupils warrant UVR-protective outdoor environment. Access to vegetation and/or shaded structures (e. g. trees, bushes, roofs) attractive for play should be provided for...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Bacterial {{adherence}} to the upper airway epithelium {{is considered to be}} an important phenomenon in the pathogenesis of infections. However, the evidence for the hypothesis that bacterial {{adherence to}} mucosal epithelial cells has significance for pathogenesis of mucosal infections is based on studies using indirect techniques. We could find no biopsy studies with direct <b>ocular</b> <b>observations</b> of significant numbers of bacteria adhering to upper airway mucosal epithelial cells either in health or during disease. Results We studied specimens from healthy and infected tonsillar epithelium and specimens from the soft palate epithelium obtained by surgery. The specimens were examined by TEM. In the vast majority of specimens, we found no bacteria adhering to the epithelial cells in the mucosal line regardless of whether the patient was infected or not. Bacteria adhering to shed epithelial cells were seen in higher numbers. Furthermore, as bacteria are small compared to epithelial cells, we calculated the risk of overlooking every adhered bacteria in a section if bacterial adherence was such a significant phenomenon as earlier suggested. We found this risk to be very small. Conclusion We conclude that bacterial adherence to mucosal surface epithelial cells is not a significant phenomenon, either in healthy mucosa in the upper airways or during infection. This is also in line with our earlier results, where we have shown that the site for the infectious process in pharyngotonsillitis is in the secretion on the tonsillar mucosal surface. </p...|$|R

40|$|Shrublands cover {{an area of}} 3, {{1 million}} {{hectares}} in Greece and contribute substantially to feeding of grazing animals. A special series of evergreen shrublands is that of kermes oak (Quercus coccifera L.), which is the dominant species. Kermes oak shrublands offer green and of relatively good quality browse to grazing animals almost all year-round. These shrublands are mainly grazed by goats and secondly by sheep flocks or mixture of goats and sheep. Goats and sheep food preferences are not similar. The objective of the present research {{is the study of}} the effects of goat, sheep and mixed moderate grazing on the productivity, structure and plant diversity of open kermes oak shrublands as well as animal behaviour, while grazing alone or mixture, in such shrublands. The research was conducted in Chrysopigi, Serres, north Greece in an altitude of 650 m and a subhumid climate. The experimental area was a 21 ha open kermes oak shrubland which has been heavily grazed for three years by goats and then left ungrazed {{for two and a half}} years. The area was divided to six plots of equal size (3, 5 ha each). The treatments applied were: 1) goat grazing, 2) sheep grazing and 3) mixed sheep and goat grazing. All treatments were repeated twice. Vegetation parameters were measured at the end of May for three consecutive years (1997, 1998 and 1999). Data of 1997 was considered as control data because of the severe decline of vegetation after the three years heavy grazing. Grazing animals were weighed at the beginning of each month and at the end of the grazing period (June to September). The number of grazing animals was equal to grazing capacity of the plots. The following parameters were measured: 1. Plant cover and composition, using the line point method. Four 25 m each permanent transects were used in every plot. 2. Species richness and species abundance, using 0, 5 x 0, 5 m quadrates. Then, plant diversity was calculated using the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. 3. Herbage and browse production, harvesting two 0, 5 x 0, 5 m quadrates in every transect. 4. Food intake, using automatic recorders and <b>ocular</b> <b>observations</b> of the grazing time per day, number of bites/minute, bite size and species preferred by the grazing animals. 5.

MethodsOne hundred and ten eyes from 55 autopsies examined at an academic tertiary referral center over 21 years were tabulated for histopathology: subdural hemorrhage in the optic nerve sheath, intrascleral hemorrhage, any retinal hemorrhage, ora-extended hemorrhage, cherry hemorrhage, perimacular ridge, and internal limiting membrane tear. Select tissues with cherry hemorrhage were further examined by transmission electron microscopy. ResultsSixty eyes were identified as “abusive head trauma” (cases), 46 as “alternative cause” (controls), and 4 as “abusive head trauma survivor”. Cases were legally verified or confirmed by confession in all except 1 case. All <b>ocular</b> histopathologic <b>observations</b> from cases were similar or more frequent in infants younger than 16  months of age.

In this study, we explored {{the development of}} experimental ocular pathogenesis in genetically dissimilar mice infected with either the RH strain, the PLK strain, or the immunodominant surface antigen 1 (SAG 1 [P 30]) -deficient mutant of the RH strain of Toxoplasma gondii. At 11 days postinfection, ocular infection of C 57 BL/ 6 mice {{with all of the}} strains of parasites resulted in severe inflammatory lesions and high numbers of parasites in eye tissue; less severe ocular lesions at earlier histopathology and prolonged survival were observed in this mouse strain infected with either the major surface antigen 1 -deficient SAG 1 −/− strain or the less virulent PLK strain compared with RH infection. In contrast, both BALB/c and CBA/J mice had less severe lesions and low numbers of parasites in their eye tissue, and infection developed into the chronic stage in these mice. There were significantly higher serum levels of gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha in C 57 BL/ 6 mice than in BALB/c and CBA/J mice following <b>ocular</b> infection.

The control group was treated by physicians according to the experience of manual bending and shaping titanium mesh implantation ipsilateral orbital pad,when the observation group by the physicians directly in the pre-shaped titanium mesh of 3 D printing. The eyeball exophthalmos, eye movement and diplopia were evaluated in the next 1, 3 and 6 mo after the operation, and we compared {{the differences between the two}} methods at different time points and the differences of the indexes between the two materials at the same time point. RESULTS: The cure rate of the observation group and the control group about eyeball exophthalmos values was 84 % and 59 %, the difference of the two groups was statistically significant(P P > 0. 05). The cure rate of limited <b>ocular</b> movement of <b>observation</b> group was 73 %, that of control group was 66 %, there was no statistical significance(P> 0. 05). During the follow-up period, there was no infection in the two groups, no titanium mesh shift, extrusion, deformation and rejection or other complications. CONCLUSION: Pre-shaped titanium mesh shaping orbital implantation with no need for shaping the mesh in the operation, can shorten the operation time, make accurate reconstruction of orbital wall, reduce complications and improve the curative effect...|$|R
