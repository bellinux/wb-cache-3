Although <b>outbound</b> <b>traffic</b> is configurable, the default configuration of Amazon and Azure Resource Manager allows any kind of outgoing traffic. Beyond, Amazon is the only provider giving the advice to restrict SSH connections to your own IP address when instantiating a new instance and provides therefore a mechanism for automatic detection.|$|R

In this study, we apply the community of households model from biological epidemiology to evaluate rate control strategies. We find that rate throttling of <b>outbound</b> worm <b>traffic,</b> implemented in the network or hosts, can be effective in slowing down a new worm outbreak given sufficient coverage of hosts. An outbreak is slowed down exponentially as the fraction of protected hosts is increased. We also find that throttling both inbound and <b>outbound</b> <b>traffic</b> can be much more effective than rate throttling only <b>outbound</b> <b>traffic.</b> I...|$|R

The objective {{is to keep the}} inter-domain link utilization balanced under any of these changes while reducing service disruptions and reconfiguration overheads. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve better load balancing with less service disruptions and re-configuration overheads in comparison to alternative approaches. ...|$|R

40|$|Cyber criminals {{compromise}} Integrity, Availability and Confidentiality {{of network}} resources in cyber space and cause remote class intrusions such as U 2 R, R 2 L, DoS and probe/scan system attacks. To handle these intrusions, Cyber Security uses three audit and monitoring systems namely Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors only inbound traffic which {{is insufficient to}} prevent botnet systems. A system to monitor <b>outbound</b> <b>traffic</b> is named as Extrusion Detection System (EDS). Therefore a hybrid system should be designed to handle both inbound and <b>outbound</b> <b>traffic.</b> Due to the increased false alarms preventive systems do not suite to an organizational network.

40|$|Abstract Inter-AS <b>outbound</b> <b>traffic</b> {{engineering}} (TE) {{is a set}} {{of techniques}} for controlling inter-AS traffic exiting an autonomous system (AS) by assigning the traffic to the best egress points (i. e. routers or links) from which the traffic is for-warded to adjacent ASes towards the destinations. In practice, changing network conditions such as inter-AS traffic demand variation, link failures and inter-AS routing changes occur dynamically. These changes can make fixed outbound TE solutions inadequate and may subsequently cause inter-AS links to become con-gested. In order to overcome this problem, we propose the deployment of a closed-loop control traffic engineering system that makes <b>outbound</b> <b>traffic</b> robust to inter-AS link failures and adaptive to changing network conditions. The objective is to keep the inter-AS link utilization balanced under unexpected events while reducing ser-vice disruptions and reconfiguration overheads. Our evaluation results show that the proposed system can successfully achieve better load balancing with less service disruption and re-configuration overhead in comparison to alternative approaches...|$|R
