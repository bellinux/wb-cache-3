5|$|In 1999, Thornton {{introduced}} the character <b>of</b> <b>Dr.</b> Dooom {{on the album}} First Come, First Served (1999). The album featured a track in which the character murdered Dr. Octagon. In 2002, Thornton announced The Resurrection <b>of</b> <b>Dr.</b> Octagon, a proposed sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst that would reintroduce the character. The resulting album, The Return <b>of</b> <b>Dr.</b> Octagon released in 2006, was largely produced without Thornton's involvement, based upon three completed vocal tracks and reconstructed outtakes. Thornton later produced Dr. Dooom 2 in response to The Return <b>of</b> <b>Dr.</b> Octagon.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFuzzy quality {{function}} deployment (QFD) {{has been}} extensively used for translating customer requirements (CRs) into product design requirements (DRs) in fuzzy environments. Existing approaches, however, for rating technical importance <b>of</b> <b>DRs</b> in fuzzy environments are found problematic, either incorrect or inappropriate. This paper investigates how the technical importance <b>of</b> <b>DRs</b> can be correctly rated in fuzzy environments. A pair of nonlinear programming models and two equivalent pairs of linear programming models are developed, respectively, to rate the technical importance <b>of</b> <b>DRs.</b> The developed models are examined and illustrated with two numerical examples...|$|R

40|$|Quality {{function}} deployment (QFD) is {{one such}} extremely important quality management tool, which is useful in product design and development. Traditionally, QFD rates the design requirements (DRs) with respect to customer requirements, and aggregates the rating to get relative importance score <b>of</b> <b>DRs.</b> An increasing number of studies emphasize {{on the need to}} incorporate additional factors, such as cost and environmental impact, while calculating the relative importance <b>of</b> <b>DRs.</b> However, there are different methodologies for driving the relative importance <b>of</b> <b>DRs,</b> when several additional factors are considered. TOPSIS (technique for order preferences by similarity to ideal solution) is suggested for the purpose of the research. This research proposes new approach of TOPSIS for considering the rating <b>of</b> <b>DRs</b> with respect to CRs, and several additional factors, simultaneously. Proposed method is illustrated using by step-by-step procedure. The proposed methodology was applied for the Sanam Electronic Company in Iran...|$|R

Dr. Mephesto is based on Marlon Brando's character Dr. Moreau in the 1996 film, The Island <b>of</b> <b>Dr.</b> Moreau, which is based on the 1896 H. G. Wells novel of the same name. Mephesto is named after Mephistopheles, the demon in the Faust legend.
