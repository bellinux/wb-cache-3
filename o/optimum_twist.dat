The chosen diffuser has an aerofoil section with varying blade chord from hub to shroud due to blade twist or in other words, the solidity of the diffuser blade is varied from hub to shroud. The twisting is given to the diffuser blade by rotating the diffuser blade opposite to the direction of rotation of the impeller keeping its leading edge as origin resulting in different stagger angles from hub to shroud. The analysis was conducted at an impeller tip Mach number of 0. 35. The overall stage performance is evaluated in terms of head coefficient, stage efficiency and power coefficient of the stage and static pressure recovery coefficient of diffuser vanes for different diffuser vane twist angles with varying flow coefficients.

The purpose of study is to find out whether the mechanical and interfacial properties of composites can be improved by surface treatment and twisting or not. In all specimens, PA 66 was commingled with aramid (AR) yarn. AR was used as reinforcement and PA 66 was used as resin yarn. The different weight percent of epoxy, such as 3, 6, and 9 wt% and twisting such as 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 tpm, were applied on the commingled yarns. After fabrication of UD composites with commingled yarns, the mechanical properties of laminates were investigated by conducting tensile and three-point bending test. Consequently, the <b>optimum</b> <b>twisting</b> number and wt% of epoxy surface treatment was found.

The first is an optimum (OPT) blade shape, obtained using improved blade element momentum (BEM) theory. A detailed description of the blade geometry is also given. The second is an untapered and <b>optimum</b> <b>twist</b> (UOT) blade with the same twist distributions as the OPT blade. The third blade is untapered and untwisted (UUT). Wind tunnel experiments were used to measure the power coefficients of these blades, and the results indicate that both the OPT and UOT blades perform with the same maximum power coefficient, Cp = 0. 428, but it is located at different tip speed ratio, λ = 4. 92 for the OPT blade and λ = 4. 32 for the UOT blade. The UUT blade has a maximum power coefficient of Cp = 0. 210 at λ = 3. 86.

Tropical climate throughout the year covering Indonesia cause the average wind speed is relatively low, ranging from 2. 5 to 6 m/s. At the other side, wind turbine performance is strongly influenced by the airfoil geometry. Therefore, {{in order to obtain}} a wind turbine with optimum output power capacity, the need to design an airfoil of wind turbine blades is necessary in order to adjust to the available wind speed (cut-in speed). During this time, wind turbine blade design is conducted by selecting an airfoil arbitrarily. Until now it is still many problems when airfoil geometry engages in the process of optimization using computational fluid dynamic (CFD). In this final project the output power capacity of horizontal axis wind turbine was optimized with respect to twist angle distribution and airfoil geometry of the blades. To involve the airfoil geometry in the optimization process, the airfoil design is performed by the direct method which is based on artificial neural network (ANN). Using this method the airfoil geometry is generated by using Joukowski transformation in which a circular is transformed to be an airfoil shape and then its aerodynamic characteristics are determined utilizing CFD. Based on these results a database which contains relation between center points of the circle and these aerodynamic characteristics can be developed to perform ANN. In this final project the coordinates of the circle center (x,y) and the twist angle distribution were chosen as design variables The optimization was performed using the optimization toolbox of MATLAB solver, i. e. based-gradient method optimization and genetic algorithm. A computer code namely yawdyn is applied for determining the output power of the wind turbine. The results showed that for average wind speed of 5 m/s the optimization of reference wind turbine which apply NREL S 834 as airfoil blade is able to produce power of 200 watts, meanwhile the present wind turbine is capable of generating output power of 1. 3 kW in which the optimum airfoil blades are formed by a pair coordinates of the center of the circle of (- 1009, 0. 0951) and the <b>optimum</b> <b>twist</b> angle distribution is represented by the equation θ_i=- 1. 063 - 3. 610. r_i, where ri indicates station distance from blade root.

40|$|For optimal rotor {{performance}} in a tiltrotor aircraft {{the difference in the}} inflow and the rotor speeds between the hover and cruise flight modes suggests different blade twist and chord distributions. The blade twist rates in current tiltrotor applications are defined based upon a compromise between the figure of merit in hover and propeller efficiency in airplane mode. However, when each operation mode is considered separately the optimum blade distributions are found to be considerably different. Passive blade twist control, which uses the inherent variation in centrifugal forces on a rotor blade to achieve <b>optimum</b> blade <b>twist</b> distributions in each flight mode through the use of extension-twist coupled composite rotor blades, has been considered for performance improvement of tiltrotor aircraft over the last two decades. The challenge for this concept is to achieve the desired twisting deformations in the rotor blade without altering the aeroelastic characteristics of the vehicle. A concept referred to as the sliding mass concept is proposed in this work in order to increase the twist change with rotor speed for a closed-cell composite rotor blade cross-section to practical levels for performance improvement in a tiltrotor aircraft. The concept is based on load path changes for the centrifugal forces by utilizing non-structural masses readily available on a conventional blade, such as the leading edge balancing mass. A multilevel optimization technique based on the simulated annealing method is applied to improve the performance of the XV 15 tiltrotor aircraft. A cross-sectional analysis tool, VABS together with a multibody dynamics code, DYMORE are integrated into the optimization process. The optimization results revealed significant improvements in the power requirement in hover while preserving cruise efficiency. It is also shown that about 21 % of the improvement is provided through the sliding mass concept pointing to the additional flexibility the concept provides for tailoring of the structure without any additional weight penalty on the system.

The complex assembly (CA) {{is defined as}} a task which deals with complex shaped parts including concavity or whose environment is so complex that unexpected contacts occur frequently during insertion. CA tasks are encountered frequently in the field of the manufacturing automation and various robot applications. To make CA successful, both the bounded wrench condition and the target approachability condition should be satisfied simultaneously during insertion. The bounded wrench condition can be satisfied by properly designing accommodation parameters, which depends on the tolerable stiffness for an assembly task, not to exceed the prescribed contact wrench. On the other hand, the target approachability condition can be satisfied by determining an admissible twist minimizing the deviation between the current and the target twist.
