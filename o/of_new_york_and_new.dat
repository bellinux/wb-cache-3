On Newark Bay, it is run by the Port Authority <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey and serves as the principal container ship facility for goods entering and leaving the New York metropolitan region and the northeastern quadrant of North America. The Port moved over $100 billion in goods in 2003, making it the 15th busiest in the world at the time, but was the number one container port as recently as 1985. Plans are underway for billions of dollars of improvements – larger cranes, bigger railyard facilities, deeper channels, and expanded wharves.|$|E

5|$|After work began, it was {{determined}} that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that it would take a decade before the state could afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and Route139, replace Wittpenn Bridge, and extend US1/9 Truck, all part of the larger distribution network in the Port <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey.|$|E

5|$|Ambrose Channel is {{the main}} {{shipping}} channel {{in and out of}} the Port <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey, making it the only means of accessing an important commercial port. Delays posed a major problem for shipping en route to New York City, and bad weather could close the Channel for days. Ships were forced to wait at the Harbor's entrance for conditions to clear. These delays cost shipping companies substantial amounts of money, with each ship costing between $500 and $4000 per hour it was stopped (roughly $5,700 to $46,000 in 2013 dollars).|$|E

In 2012, after the film was released, Barack Obama, President of the United States, recognized White's work and told her story during a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the Port Authority <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E

5|$|Settled in 1666 by Puritans from New Haven Colony, Newark {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} European cities in the United States. Its {{location}} at the mouth of the Passaic River (where it flows into Newark Bay), has made the city's waterfront an integral part of the Port <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey. Today, Port Newark-Elizabeth is the primary container shipping terminal of the busiest seaport on the American East Coast. In addition, Newark Liberty International Airport was the first municipal commercial airport in the United States, and today is one of its busiest.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was built}} in 1934 as the Long Beach Loop Causeway, funded with money from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It was {{completed}} six months ahead of schedule and officially opened on October27, 1934, by Robert Moses, then a candidate for Governor <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. The plans to fund the highway included the implementation of tolls, which went into effect on January2, 1935. These tollbooths, once considered the murder site of Sonny Corleone in Mario Puzo's The Godfather, were closed in 1978 as part of Governor Hugh Carey's efforts to establish that year's state budget.|$|E

5|$|With {{a capital}} of seven million florins, the West India Company was granted {{exclusive}} authority and trade privileges in the Dutch possessions {{of the two}} Americas, {{as well as the}} coast of Africa from the Tropic of Cancer to the Cape of Good Hope. The objects of its creation were to establish an efficient and aggressive Atlantic maritime power in the struggle with Spain, as well as to colonize, develop, and rule the Dutch American dependencies — particularly New Netherland (the modern states <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey), discovered by Henry Hudson in 1609.|$|E
5|$|After the military, {{the second}} largest and most {{important}} industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports. Headquartered in Norfolk, the Virginia Port Authority (VPA) is a Commonwealth of Virginia owned-entity that, in turn, owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for break-bulk and container type cargo. In Norfolk, Norfolk International Terminals (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and {{is home to the}} world's largest and fastest container cranes. Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Regional Plan Association {{advocated}} for {{an extension of}} the BMT Canarsie Line from Eighth Avenue to Jersey City under the Hudson River. The tunnel under the Hudson would have cost $40,000,000. The extension would have provided access to commuter railroads in New Jersey as most lines converged there, and the lines that didn't would be rerouted to stop there. The RPA also suggested having a parking lot there for access from the Pulaski Skyway and the New Jersey Turnpike. It was suggested that either the New York City Transit Authority, the Port Authority <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey or the Bi-State Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission would do the construction.|$|E

5|$|In March 2001, the Port Authority <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey {{implemented}} a discount on regular toll fees during off-peak hours for those vehicles paying electronically with an EZ Pass issued in New York State.

5|$|It was legislated in 1966 to run {{parallel}} to the New Jersey Turnpike from exit 13 until North Avenue, where it would turn northwest and intersect U.S. Route 1/9 near the airport. The routing was eventually shifted to begin from a new interchange along the New Jersey Turnpike. A total of $50 million in funding was allocated for {{the road and the}} Port Authority <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey was responsible for designing the road. The state had wanted the port authority to pay for construction; however it was ruled that they could not build the road. Construction on Route 81 took place between 1979 and 1982.|$|E
5|$|One World Trade Center is principally {{owned by}} the Port Authority <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey.

By September 2012, around 55percent of the building's floor space had been leased, but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014; the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8percent by November 2014.|$|E
