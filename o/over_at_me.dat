500|$|... "Life's a Glitch, Then You Die" [...] {{was written}} and {{conceived}} by Hauge. In DVD commentary for the episode, Hauge stated that, when writing the segment, {{he knew it}} would not age well. [...] "I was aware of it at the time, that it wouldn't last forever" [...] he said, [...] "But I wanted to capture that moment." [...] According to director Michels, the rocket which transported the [...] "best and brightest" [...] of the population was drawn to resemble a popsicle. The Simpsons staff had a lot of trouble finding a guest star for the second rocket, and the only person who agreed to participate was American actor Tom Arnold. In the episode, Arnold is depicted as an annoying, [...] "not-so-great" [...] celebrity. Although he was mostly in on the joke, Arnold did [...] "bust [...] chops" [...] a little bit when recording his lines. [...] "He would say a line and then they'd yell cut and he'd look <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and take a shot at me" [...] Hauge said. Still, Hauge found Arnold's performance [...] "fantastic" [...] and Scully said that he was a [...] "good sport". The segment also features television personality Dick Clark as himself. A few months after the episode aired, Hauge discussed the segment with Clark in a Fox studio. According to Hauge, Clark said that the episode gave the [...] "biggest response" [...] he had ever gotten from anything he had ever done. [...] "After the career that he had in television for so long, just to give him a highlight was a highlight for me" [...] Hauge said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
2500|$|Groove metal group Five Finger Death Punch had an {{incident}} when, during the song [...] "White Knuckles" [...] {{at a concert}} in Hartford Connecticut, a young man received a compound fracture on his ankle in a mosh pit. Ivan L. Moody, the band's lead singer, stopped the show, leaped into the crowd with Zoltan Bathory, the band's rhythm guitarist, and carried the injured fan onto the stage, where {{he was taken to}} the hospital. Moody has been quoted as saying: [...] "I looked him square in the face and asked him if he was okay, or if there was anything I could do for him. He looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> still in shock, and said 'You guys fucking rock!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{captain said}} nothing to Alan, but he looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with an ugly look. [...] "David," [...] said he, [...] "I'll mind this"; {{and the sound of}} his voice went through me with a jar.|$|E
60|$|His {{expression}} has changed. He {{takes the}} document and examines it, turns it <b>over,</b> looks <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and smiles that faint smile of his again.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Bowater merely {{continued}} to look quietly <b>over</b> the envelope <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{the girl}} did so she looked <b>over</b> her hand <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and lifted her}} eyebrows very slightly.|$|R
60|$|Did what I could.... I cowered, {{staring at}} my knuckles, {{and it seemed that}} a little {{concourse}} of strangers, heads close together, were talking in my mind. My eyes were dry; I think the spectre of a smile had dragged up my lips. Mrs Bowater raised herself in her bed, and peered <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{work was}} the kind where {{you go in and}} look at three dirty {{children}} and teach them that they'll be happy if they're good, when you know perfectly well that their only chance to be happy is to be bad as anything and sneak off to go swimming in the East River. But it kept me from being very much afraid of the Bowery (we went down on the surface cars), but Olive was scared beautifully. There was the dearest, most inoffensive old man in the most perfect state of intoxication sitting next to us in the car, and when Olive moved away from him he winked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Honor your shruples, ma'am, ver' good form.' I think Olive {{thought he was going to}} murder us--she was sure he was the wild, dying remnant of a noble race or something. But even she was disappointed in Chinatown.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} her friend, [...] "I {{would not be}} so wicked as to do that. All imitations of Nature seem to me a mock of God's handiwork, which no mortal brush can hope to equal. I shall never be so audacious, I hope. But a photograph is a pure reflex of Nature, and my caricatures, which are merely bits of harmless fun, furnish us now and then a spark of humor to make us laugh, and laughter is good for the soul. I often laugh at my own sketches, as you know. Sometimes I laugh at their whimsical conception, before ever I put pencil to paper. Lots of caricatures I make secretly, laughing over and then destroying them for fear they might be seen and hurt the feelings of their innocent subjects. Why, Mary Louise, I drew your doleful face only yesterday, and it was so funny I shrieked with glee. You heard me and looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a smile that made the caricature lie, so I promptly tore it up. It had served its purpose, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some {{instinct}} told me so," [...] {{said the}} old gentleman, putting on his spectacles, and looking <b>over</b> them <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with asperity, while he folded his paper into a convenient shape. [...] "I wish to read you what must have made me have that instinct. It was this editorial. Listen, {{and see if it}} was you that wrote it: ...|$|R

60|$|The criticism, {{especially}} from the accomplished Danteists I have named, was frank and frequent. I believe they neither of them quite agreed with Longfellow as to the form of version he had chosen, but, waiving that, the question was how perfectly he had done his work upon the given lines: I myself, with whatever right, great or little, I may have to an opinion, believe thoroughly in Longfellow's plan. When I read his version my sense aches for the rhyme which he rejected, but my admiration for his fidelity to Dante otherwise is immeasurable. I remember with equal admiration the subtle and sympathetic scholarship of his critics, who scrutinized every shade of meaning in a word or phrase that gave them pause, and did not let it pass till all the reasons and facts had been considered. Sometimes, and even often, Longfellow yielded to their censure, {{but for the most}} part, when he was of another mind, he held to his mind, and the passage had to go as he said. I make a little haste to say that in all the meetings of the Club, during a whole winter of Wednesday evenings, I myself, though I faithfully followed in an Italian Dante with the rest, ventured upon one suggestion only. This was kindly, even seriously, considered by the poet, and gently rejected. He could not do anything otherwise than gently, and I was not suffered to feel that I had done a presumptuous thing. I can see him now, as he looked up from the proof-sheets on the round table before him, and <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> growing consciously smaller and smaller, like something through a reversed opera-glass. He had a shaded drop-light in front of him, and in its glow his beautiful and benignly noble head had a dignity peculiar to him.|$|E
5000|$|Sammy Cahn {{has said}} of the {{conception}} of the sixteen-bar song: [...] "This song was written one night in Palm Springs. When I sang the last line, Jule Styne looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'So. That's it.' I knew he felt we could have written on, but I felt I had said {{all there was to}} say, and if I had it to do over, I would stop right there again." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "By the way, {{the morning}} my father made {{the picture of}} JFK at the window, the {{president}} was reading the Times. He had gotten to the editorial page. My father said, 'He looked over and he saw me. He hadn't been aware that I took that picture from the back, but he saw me when I moved to the side there. He glanced <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and he said: [...] "I wonder where Mr. Krock gets all the crap he puts in this horseshit column of his." [...] Apparently he was much upset about Mr. Krock's column that day.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear!" [...] The {{word was}} uttered {{with a low}} sigh. Then there was a pause, during which Lopez {{supported}} the sufferer. [...] "I {{thought that it was}} all <b>over</b> with <b>me</b> <b>at</b> one moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|But when I got amongst that bunch, there sat Ida in her buggy {{and nobody}} hurt, {{not even the}} horse or the vehicle. Ida was pale but serene. As I came tearing down, she smiled back <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said, [...] "Well, we're alive yet, aren't we?" [...] A miracle had been performed--nothing else.|$|R
60|$|My leave-takings were brief. My mother {{shed some}} tears and many prayers <b>over</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> parting. Not {{that she was}} moved to any grief <b>at</b> losing <b>me.</b> That were a grief I should respect {{and the memory of}} which I should {{treasure}} as a sacred thing. Her tears were tears of dread lest, surrounded by perils in the world, I should succumb and thus falsify her vows.|$|R
5000|$|From that point, Alphin's career took off, {{both as a}} {{songwriter}} {{and as part of}} the duo Big & Rich. Several years after the incident, he played some of his songs for McGraw. [...] "I'll never forget the day I played him the song," [...] Alphin said. [...] "We were at Blackbird Studio and Tim was making a new album. As we sat together in my truck, I played him a couple of the songs that I was recording. The second song I played was [...] "Last Dollar." [...] He looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said, [...] "Are you gonna let me record that?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, when Beatty {{was asked}} whether Petrino had ever {{discussed}} giving him a job on his previous staffs, Beatty said, “I’m {{not going to say}} that I haven’t, but it hasn’t presented itself yet, so we’ll worry about that if the time comes.” Beatty {{went on to say that}} he has been grateful that Petrino has “always treated high school coaches with the utmost respect” and been willing to swap ideas with them. According to Beatty “There have been times I would go to (U of L’s) practice, and all of a sudden I’ll see something that I’ve done (at Trinity), and he’ll look <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and say, ‘Hey, where did I get that?’” ...|$|E
5000|$|The book {{presents}} {{methods for}} discovering truths behind advertising, politics, media, family and social relationships. Kasten {{has described the}} genesis of the book as his experiences in a rural community [...] "It was 1970, and my family had recently moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to a town in the San Joaquin Valley…One evening I found myself sitting on a couch at my friend Earl's house…Walter Cronkite was finishing up a newscast with a bit of commentary. He spoke about the dangers of making up one's mind too quickly and labeling events before fully understanding them…His concluding phrase was something like, [...] "Let's not be too quick to use the label-making device." [...] Earl looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Do you know what the crap he was talking about?" [...] Kasten has said the book is an attempt to answer that question.|$|E
60|$|Fidus Achates ran <b>over</b> to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of}} {{the first}} act to say that all things were going pretty well; though he confessed to the titter in the house upon Miss Pritchard's first appearance, dressed exactly like an Indian princess.|$|R
6000|$|... "Davidson!" [...] cried I. [...] "What's {{the matter}} with you?" [...] He turned round in my {{direction}} and looked about for me. He looked <b>over</b> <b>me</b> and <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and {{on either side of}} me, without the slightest sign of seeing me. [...] "Waves," [...] he said; [...] "and a remarkably neat schooner. I'd swear that was Bellows' voice. Hullo!" [...] He shouted suddenly {{at the top of his}} voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "All <b>over</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> once?"--Mr. Bender {{took refuge}} in easy humour. [...] "Well, I'm a large man--so when I want to feel so much I look out for {{something}} good. But what, if he suffers from the blot on his ermine--ain't that what you wear?--does our friend propose to do about it?" ...|$|R

5000|$|... 'At {{what would}} turn out to be my last darshan of Maharaj-ji's {{physical}} body, I was petrified with fear about returning to the U.S. after so many years. I hadn't worn a pair of jeans or shoes for such a long time that I couldn't imagine what it would be like. I didn't want to ask Maharaj-ji what I should do in America, but all of a sudden I blurted out in anguish, 'Maharaj-ji! How can I serve you in America?''He looked at me with mock disgust and said, 'What is this? If you ask how you should serve then it is no longer service. Do what you want.' I couldn't believe my ears. How could doing what I wanted to do be of service to him? I didn't have that kind of faith. I just sat there, stunned. Then after a minute or so he looked <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> smiling sweetly, and asked, 'So, how will you serve me?''My mind was blank. It was time for me to leave for Delhi, to catch the plane back to the States. He was looking at me and laughing. I bent down and touched his feet for the last time and when I looked up, he was beaming at me, 'So, how will you serve me in America?' I felt like I was moving in a dream. I floated across the courtyard and bowed to him one more time from a distance. As I did, the words came to me, 'I will sing to you in America.''Soon afterwards, during the full moon in September, Neem Karoli Baba left his body. Now he had to be found within. The chanting, the meditation, the puja and all the wonderful time spent with Maharaj-ji turned out to be seeds that he himself had planted in my heart... seeds that would keep growing and blossom by his Grace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I suppose so. But I am weak. Although I {{know it is}} {{all right}} with our plans, I felt a curious dread of him; an awe, or terror, of {{conventions}} I don't believe in.

"It's dark, but there's {{a sort of}} dignity," [...] said Beatrice very distinctly, {{regarding}} the hall with serene tranquillity, and allowing the unwilling feet on the stairs to widen their distance from us.

5000|$|As he {{explained}} {{in an interview}} late in life, Tames took the photograph {{through the door of}} the Oval Office, after Kennedy thought he had left: [...] President Kennedy's back was broken during the war, when that torpedo boat of his was hit by the Japanese destroyer. As a result of that injury he wore a brace on his back most of his life. Quite a few people didn't realize that. Also he could never sit for any length of time, more than thirty or forty minutes in a chair without having to get up and walk around. Particularly when it felt bad he had a habit, in the House, and the Senate, and into the Presidency, of carrying his weight on his shoulders, literally, by leaning over a desk, putting down his palms out flat, and leaning over and carrying the weight of his upper body by his shoulder muscles, and sort of stretching or easing his back. He would read and work that way, which was something I had seen him do many times. When I saw him doing that, I walked in, stood by his rocking chair, and then I looked down and framed him between the two windows, and I shot that picture. I only made two exposures on it--we were very conservative with our film. Then I {{walked out of the room}} and stood there for a while, then I saw him straighten up. I went in again and I photographed him straight up, for a different shot, from the back, then I walked around to the side and photographed him profile, right and left. He had a copy of the New York Times, he was reading the editorial page--and I have that print right here, I was looking at it just the other day. He looked over and he saw me. He hadn't been aware that I took that picture from back, but he saw me when I moved to the side there. He glanced <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and he said: [...] "I wonder where Mr. Krock gets all the crap he puts in this horseshit column of his." [...] Apparently he was much upset about Mr. Krock's column that day. So that was the occasion of that picture.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the tent}} was gone, Det. Brown, of the [...] Baltimore City Police, came <b>over</b> and yelled <b>at</b> <b>me</b> to leave: “You’re {{supposed}} {{to be with the}} other media outside the perimeter.” Asked why the press had to leave, Brown, said, “I don’t have to tell you that, I just have to escort you over there.” He warned that I’d be subject to the same treatment “they” were, indicating the protesters but declining to say what that treatment was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Easily, by {{fabricating}} {{some interesting}} perplexity in which I want sage counsel. He will be flattered, and by seeming {{to take him}} into my confidence, I can hoodwink the excellent man to my heart's content, for he annoys me by his odd way of mounting guard <b>over</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> all times. Now take me in to dinner, and be your former delightful self." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you're right, Nellie," [...] rejoined Mrs Mitford, {{with a mild}} nod of assent; [...] "I've {{sometimes}} {{thought on}} these things when I've 'ad one o' my sick 'eadaches, which prevents me from thinkin' altogether, almost; an', bless you, you'd wonder what strange idears comes <b>over</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> such times. Did you ever try to think things with a sick 'eadache, Nellie?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There Mrs. Wilkins paused, {{flushed and}} breathless with her defence, and Christie said, candidly: [...] "I did like {{the freedom and}} good-will there, for people sat where they liked, and no one frowned <b>over</b> shut pew-doors, <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a stranger. An old black woman sat next me, and said 'Amen' when she liked what she heard, and a very shabby young man was on the other, {{listening}} as if his soul was as hungry as his body. People read books, laughed and cried, clapped when pleased, and hissed when angry; that I did not like." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{came and}} stood <b>over</b> <b>me,</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I'm {{going to have}} a concert," [...] she said abruptly, and laughed uneasily and hovered at the pigeon-holes. [...] "Now--now what shall I have?" [...] She chose more of Brahms. Then we came to the Kreutzer Sonata. It is queer how Tolstoy has loaded that with suggestions, debauched it, made it a scandalous and {{intimate}} symbol. When I had played the first part of that, she came up to the pianola and hesitated over me. I sat stiffly--waiting.|$|R
