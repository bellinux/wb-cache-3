500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Robert Christgau gave Escape a grade of B+ and wrote that Hutchins and Smith [...] "turn out ingratiating {{variations on a}} formula.

[...] Although Christgau found the lyrics of [...] "Freaks Come Out at Night" [...] less intellectual than [...] "Escape" [...] or [...] "Friends" [...] and less musically interesting than [...] "Five Minutes of Funk", he still considered it a strong song. NME described Escape as superior to Whodini's first album and praised Smith's production, writing that his [...] "sparse DMC sound here gives way to a rich and warm electronic soundscape". They went on to dub the title track as being the best song on the album, followed by [...] "Big Mouth", [...] "Out of Control", [...] "We Are Whodini" [...] and [...] "Friends". They {{went on to say}} that [...] "Featuring Grandmaster Dee" [...] was Escape weak link, calling it a [...] "pointless instrumental reworking of [...] "Five Minutes of Funk"." [...] Spin praised [...] "Escape (I Need a Break)", comparing it to Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's [...] "The Message", writing that Whodini's song [...] "focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> affected by social condition, not on the condition itself." ...|$|E
