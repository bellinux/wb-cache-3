40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>resource</b> is {{the major}} source of {{competitive}} advantages for an enterprise. Discussions aiming at the role <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> in educational communities are progressing in past years. From the mobility <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> in an organization, retaining human assets or reducing the mobility to the lowest are considered as the professional commitment <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> and the direction for efforts. A new viewpoint about the role <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> reveals that the role <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> is to change social capital into the driving force of competitive advantages of an organization. It might affect the presentation of different roles <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> in various corporate characteristics. For this reason, the effects of high-tech corporate characteristics on social capital and role <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> management are discussed in this study.

5|$|Management in all {{business}} and organizational activities is {{the act of}} getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group {{of one or more}} people or entities), or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resources,</b> financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches, namely human resource management, operations management (or production management), strategic management, marketing management, financial management, and information technology management, which was responsible for management information systems. Although it is difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way, it helps in navigating the discipline of management. Design management overlaps mainly with the branches marketing management, operations management, and strategic management.|$|E

With 223,692 votes, Collins edged out Sloane (219,160 votes) and Stumbo (199,795 votes) to secure the nomination.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The {{continuous}} alignment <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> strategies, activities. {{processes and}} competencies within an ever-changing business environment poses certain {{challenges for the}} <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> profession in a global petrochemical industry. Modem business managers have realised the necessity of work wellness initiatives and that a relationship exists between employee wellness and business results, but very few companies measure whether such initiatives actually had any impact on work performance. Defining performance indicators and competence models for <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners has developed into a dynamic activity. Adaptation to continuously changing business needs {{has the potential to}} create a sense of incompetence, exhaustion, decreased motivation and dysfunctional work attitudes, collective 1 y defined as burnout. This highlights the need to identify and research psychological constructs that hold predictable value for the ability <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners to prevent and overcome burnout by generating sufficient emotional energy to adapt to changing business needs, acquiring strategic <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> competencies to increase their feelings of professional efficacy and increasing their contribution towards organisational performance. The objective of this study was to determine perceived importance and actual performance <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners in a global petrochemical company in terms <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> roles, and to determine the influence of work wellness (burnout, engagement and workaholism) on the perceived value adding contribution <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners in a global petrochemical company. The research method for each of the three articles of this study consisted of a brief literature review and an empirical study. Stratified samples were taken <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> personnel (N = 128) and their internal line customers (N = 67). The measuring instruments used in this study included the Ulrich <b>Human</b> <b>Resource</b> Role Assessment Survey (HRRAS), Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS), Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) and the Workaholism Scale. Article I compared perceptions <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners and their internal customers regarding expected and actual contributions <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners towards business performance in a global petrochemical company. It was found that <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners and their line customers are in agreement concerning the importance <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> roles that enable business performance, indicating that <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners have a good understanding of their job requirements. Both <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners and their line customers perceived the performance <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners as average, which is lower than the expected level of performance as indicated by importance scales. In Article 2, a correlation study revealed that burnout (Exhaustion, Professional Efficacy and Cynicism) statistically significantly predicted the perceived level <b>of</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners in the organisation. It was found that Cynicism was a statistically significant predictor of the perceived level <b>of</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioners in the organisation in terms <b>of</b> all the <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> roles (Strategic Partnering, Administrative Support, Employee Support and Change Management). Vigour and Dedication statistically significantly predicted perceived performance on the Administrative Support role. In Article 3, a three-factor model of workaholism (consisting of Compulsiveness, Involvement and Overwork) was found which showed positive relationship with burnout factors. Statistical analysis indicated that workaholism factors of the Workaholism Scale practically significantly correlate. Multiple regression analysis showed that burnout and workaholism factors can explain perceptions <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> practitioner performance. Recommendations were made for future research. Doctora...|$|R
