40|$|The {{widespread}} {{destruction of}} mature forests in China {{has led to}} massive ecological degradation, counteracted in recent decades by substantial efforts to promote forest plantations and protect secondary forest ecosystems. The value of the resulting forests for biodiversity conservation is widely unknown, particularly in relation to highly diverse invertebrate taxa that fulfil important ecosystem services. We aimed to address this knowledge gap, establishing the conservation value of secondary forests on Dongling Mountain, North China based on the diversity of <b>geometrid</b> <b>moths</b> – a species-rich family of nocturnal pollinators that also influences plant assemblages through caterpillar herbivory. Results showed that secondary forests harboured <b>geometrid</b> <b>moth</b> assemblages similar in species richness and phylogenetic diversity, but with a species composition distinctly different to assemblages in one of China’s last remaining mature temperate forests in the Changbaishan Nature Reserve. Species overlap between these sites was about 30 %, and species did not form separate phylogenetic clusters according to site. Species assemblages at Dongling Mountain were strongly differentiated according to forest type; a pattern not found at Changbaishan. Our results indicate that protected naturally regenerated secondary forests in northern China provide suitable habitats for species-rich and genetically diverse <b>geometrid</b> <b>moth</b> assemblages, highlighting the potential importance of these forests for conservation and ecosystem function provision across the wider landscape...|$|R

40|$|Insects, which {{represent}} the most species-rich taxa, are extremely important ecosystem components. The diversity patterns of insects have, however, been widely ignored in biodiversity research. In my thesis, I aim {{to establish a}} basic understanding of the diversity patterns of insect assemblages in the temperate forest and forest plantation ecosystems of Northern China, and to investigate how these patterns correlate with vegetation and environmental conditions. The study aims to give further insights into the insect diversity status and measures to conserve or even enhance their diversity in the large secondary and plantation forests which have been and are currently established throughout northern China. The study focuses on two distinct insect taxa: ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and <b>geometrid</b> <b>moths</b> (Lepidoptera: Geometridae). In the main study area located within the Changbaishan Natural Reserve (CNR) in Jilin Province, 4844 individuals (47 species) of ground beetle and 9285 individuals (155 species) of <b>geometrid</b> <b>moth</b> were sampled. In addition, 1488 ground beetles (24 species) and 2047 <b>geometrid</b> <b>moths</b> (165 species) were sampled in the secondary and plantation forest area at Dongling Mountain (DLM) in Beijing. A first important result of this work is that the α-diversity of both ground beetle and <b>geometrid</b> <b>moth</b> assemblages decreased significantly with increasing elevation at CNR. My results also show that the relationships between phyto-diversity and the diversity of insects are weak and furthermore likely to be driven by underlying environmental factors. The significant changes which have recently occurred in the plant species composition at CNR chiefly related to changes in the climatic conditions suggest that insect species are also under high pressure in this area. Finally, this study suggests that in the temperate religions of Northern China, secondary and plantation forests can potentially harbour high levels of insect α-diversity compared with mature, more pristine forests...|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate between pupa, chrysalis and cocoon. The pupa is the stage between the larva and adult stages. The chrysalis generally refers to a butterfly pupa although the term may be misleading as there are some moths whose pupae resembles a chrysalis, e.g.: the plume winged moths of the family Pterophoridae and some <b>geometrid</b> <b>moths.</b> A cocoon is a silk case that moths, and sometimes other insects, spin around the pupa.|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{diversity}} and composition of species assemblages and identifying underlying biotic and abiotic determinants represent great ecological challenges. Addressing some of these issues, we investigated the α-diversity and phylogenetic composition of species-rich <b>geometrid</b> <b>moth</b> (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) assemblages in the mature temperate forest on Changbai Mountain. A total of 9285 <b>geometrid</b> <b>moths</b> representing 131 species were collected, with many species displaying wide elevational distribution ranges. Moth α-diversity decreased monotonously, while the standardized effect size of mean pairwise phylogenetic distances (MPD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) increased significantly with increasing elevation. At high elevations, the insect assemblages consisted largely of habitat generalists that were individually more phylogenetically distinct from co-occurring species than species in assemblages at lower altitudes. This could hint at higher speciation rates in more favourable low-elevation environments generating a species-rich geometrid assemblage, while exclusion of phylogenetically closely related species becomes increasingly important in shaping moth assemblages at higher elevations. Overall, it appears likely that high-elevation temperate moth assemblages are strongly resilient to environmental change, and that they contain a much larger proportion of the genetic diversity encountered at low-elevation assemblages in comparison to tropical geometrid communities. </p...|$|R
40|$|For trophic {{interactions}} {{to generate}} population cycles and complex spatio-temporal patterns, like travelling waves, the spatial dynamics must be matched across trophic levels. Here, we propose a spatial methodological approach for detecting such spatial match–mismatch {{and apply it}} to <b>geometrid</b> <b>moths</b> and their larval parasitoids in northern Norway, where outbreak cycles and travelling waves occur. We found clear evidence of spatial mismatch, suggesting that the spatially patterned moth cycles in this system are probably ruled by trophic interactions involving other agents than larval parasitoids...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} studies {{that deal with}} the {{identification}} of the potential influential factors on the population dynamics pattern of MUWM in Europe, many of them distinguishing weather effects as driving components. Jepsen et al. (2009) discovered a coherent pattern of spatial synchrony of the start of the vegetation period and defoliation by <b>geometrid</b> <b>moths</b> in boreal birch forests in northern Fennoscandia. Thus, they assume that weather effects in spring, which influence the phenology of both host plant and <b>geometrid</b> <b>moth,</b> might act as “Moran effects”. Likewise, van Asch and Visser (2007) suppose that years with high synchrony between bud burst and egg hatch of winter moth might lead to a mass outbreak because synchrony is crucial for the moth development and has several consequences on its fitness. Topp and Kirsten (1991) discovered that the fecundity of female winter moths is temperature dependent and, therefore, assume that coincidence between imago eclosion and optimal temperatures might be a precondition for mass outbreaks. In Fennoscandia, important regulating influences on population density of the related autumn moth (Epirrita autumnata) appear to be egg mortality caused by minimum winter temperatures, followed by parasitism and, finally, the varying food plant quality (Virtanen and Neuvonen 1999).|$|R

40|$|Landscape {{simplification}} {{and habitat}} fragmentation may cause severe declines of less mobile and habitat specialist species {{and lead to}} biotic homogenization of species communities, but large-scale empirical evidence on biotic homogenization remains sparse. We sampled butterfly and day-active <b>geometrid</b> <b>moth</b> communities within 134 differently fragmented landscapes in Finland situated in five geographical regions. Overall species richness was partitioned into alpha and beta diversity and butterflies were assigned a species-specific mobility rank and habitat specificity score based on published ecological trait classifications. Alpha and beta diversity of butterflies and <b>geometrid</b> <b>moths</b> decreased with increasing agricultural intensity, independently of geographical position. The responses were either linear or nonlinear with accelerating decrease of diversity when arable field cover exceeded 60 %. Mobility rank and percentage generalists of butterfly communities increased linearly with increasing field cover. In landscapes with high agricultural intensity (> 60 % field coverage), the decrease in beta diversity of butterflies was strongly associated with an increasing proportion of habitat generalists and increasing average mobility in the butterfly communities. However, {{there was no such}} relationship in landscapes with low or moderate agricultural intensity. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that biotic homogenization caused by land-use change arises {{as a consequence of the}} loss of habitat specialists and poor dispersers in intensively cultivated landscapes with simplified landscape structure. Agri-environment schemes will therefore be inefficient in protecting high beta diversity unless they explicitly increase habitat availability and connectivity for habitat specialists and poor dispersers...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the species diversity and abundance of <b>geometrid</b> <b>moths</b> in tropical rain forest of Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary (< 200 meters above sea level), Narathiwat Province, southern Thailand. Field data were collected every 2 months from July 2001 to July 2002. Three light traps were placed 200 meters apart. Moths were collected every 2 hours between 18. 00 - 24. 00 pm for 3 consecutive nights. Seven hundred and fifty six individuals of <b>geometrid</b> <b>moths</b> comprising 5 subfamilies, 17 tribes, 67 genera and 129 species were collected and identified. According to the numbers of species and individuals, moths in subfamily Ennominae (79 species, 522 individuals respectively) were the predominant group followed by Geometrinae (32 species, 88 individuals), Desmobathrinae (8 species, 42 individuals), Sterrhinae (7 species, 24 individuals) and Larentiinae (3 species, 80 individuals). The number of species and individuals varied with collecting time as follows: 18. 00 - 20. 00 pm (61 species, 199 individuals); 20. 00 - 22. 00 pm (90 species, 298 individuals); 22. 00 - 24. 00 pm (75 species, 259 individuals).
