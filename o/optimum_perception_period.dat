40|$|ABSTRACT: Critical {{listening}} {{rooms are}} spaces carefully {{designed to provide}} the listener with an accurate listening environment. It {{is well known that}} in small rooms, resonances may occur that will cause some amplification or attenuation of sound at certain frequencies. These problems are known to cause a distraction from the <b>optimum</b> <b>perception</b> and the correct judgement of the reproduced sound. A study has been carried out on various factors that affect how “bass ” is perceived in rooms. Parameters like the modal distribution and the Q-factor of modes have been studied using a binaural technique that employs virtual representation of different sound fields. This technique allows different room conditions to be compared relatively quickly without actually having to change the conditions in a real room. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the subjective perception of these factors and to attempt to classify its perceptual importance with regards to time and frequency domain effects introduced by resonances. Results indicate how changes to these factors are subjectively perceived by users. In practice these results may be applied to a more efficient use of acoustical treatment and aid the design of better rooms. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to bring out the <b>period</b> <b>perception</b> of 1980 ’s period primary school students with their own words via center-periphery and gender variables. As it is known that the <b>period</b> <b>perception</b> of individuals cannot appear independent from the political and socio-economic conditions in which they are. It is possible to find out so many developments about the political, social and economic history of different periods of the societies in the written documents. However, the documents presenting about the primary school’s children’s <b>perception</b> of the <b>period</b> in which their childhood is constructed is so limited. Therefore, the children as a prominent part of society, the narratives reflecting their periodic perception will let them be both the subjects and objects of history. Only oral history uncovers the children’s (being excluded from historiography) periodic perception with their original narratives. This, on the one hand democratizes the nature of history, on the other hand it enriches it with its critical and transformative mission. In this study I had totally thirty-two interviews, two of which are for testing, including fifteen women and fifteen men who had their primary school education in 1980 s. I recorded the interviews by a recording device and decoded them. I tried to reconstruct their <b>period</b> <b>perception</b> via their narratives...|$|R
40|$|Critical {{listening}} rooms, like {{recording studio}} control rooms or listening rooms, are carefully {{designed to provide}} the listener with the most accurate listening environment. It {{is well known that}} in small rooms resonant modes may occur, well separated in the lower frequency range, and cause some amplification or attenuation of sound at certain frequencies. This may distract from the <b>optimum</b> <b>perception</b> and the correct judgement of the reproduced sound. The modal distribution is directly associated with the dimensional aspect ratios of the room. There are in literature various design metrics that assess the distribution of these modes in frequency and help the designer to decide on room dimensions that avoid worst situations and aim for an “optimum” distribution of the eigenfrequencies. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the subjective perception of two general types of metrics, one based on modal spacing and the other based on pressure response, and to attempt to classify their perceptual importance compared to other factors associated with the perception of room modes. Tests were carried out to evaluate differences between three “virtual” rooms that score extreme classifications in each of the metrics. The results of the tests indicate that room aspect ratios do have some effect on the perception of the modal distribution, but the effect is very much dependent on the frequency content of the original signal. This indicates that a room that scores well using a certain metric may still suffer from problems if the frequency content of the driving signal matches one particularly strong modal artefact...|$|R

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{real-world}} {{challenges to}} our visual system is posed by cluttered scenes and occluded objects. To make sense of such scenes, local elements belonging to the same object need to be perceptually grouped, {{also referred to as}} spatial binding problem. However, it remains unknown how and where in the brain the local information is grouped together to give rise to a holistic percept. In the current study we addressed this question with a novel bistable motion stimulus developed by Anstis and Kim (2011) that consists of four pairs of dots coherently moving on a circular path. The stimulus causes perception to alternate spontaneously between two interpretations: local dot motion and global motion of two imaginary squares. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that activity in the right parietal cortex correlated specifically with global as compared to local <b>perception</b> <b>periods.</b> To test for a causal role of parietal function in perceptual grouping, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to temporarily disrupt activity in two subregions of the parietal cortex. TMS over one of the subregions - the right anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) - specifically affected the global percept durations without affecting the local ones. Our results provide causal evidence that IPS may {{play a crucial role in}} perceptual grouping of local elements into a holistic percept, suggesting it to be a common anatomical locus of attention, perceptual grouping and perceptual selection processes...|$|R

40|$|When {{different}} {{images are}} {{presented to the}} eyes, the brain is faced with ambiguity, causing perceptual bistability: visual perception continuously alternates between the monocular images, a phenomenon called binocular rivalry. Many models of rivalry suggest that its temporal dynamics depend on mutual inhibition among neurons representing competing images. These models predict that rivalry should be different in autism, which has been proposed to present an atypical ratio of excitation and inhibition [the E/I imbalance hypothesis; Rubenstein & Merzenich, 2003]. In line with this prediction, some recent studies have provided evidence for atypical binocular rivalry dynamics in autistic adults. In this study, we examined if these findings generalize to autistic children. We developed a child-friendly binocular rivalry paradigm, which included two types of stimuli, low- and high-complexity, and compared rivalry dynamics in groups of autistic and age- and intellectual ability-matched typical children. Unexpectedly, {{the two groups of}} children presented the same number of perceptual transitions and the same mean phase durations (times perceiving one of the two stimuli). Yet autistic children reported mixed percepts for a shorter proportion of time (a difference which was in the opposite direction to previous adult studies), while elevated autistic symptomatology was associated with shorter mixed <b>perception</b> <b>periods.</b> Rivalry in the two groups was affected similarly by stimulus type, and consistent with previous findings. Our results suggest that rivalry dynamics are differentially affected in adults and developing autistic children and could be accounted for by hierarchical models of binocular rivalry, including both inhibition and top-down influences...|$|R

In this study, frequency-to-electrode allocation was adjusted {{in a group of}} 12 adult cochlear implant users, to ascertain if the use of a default setting results in <b>optimum</b> <b>perception</b> of speech and music for individual recipients. Participants in the experiment trialled a map in which the frequency allocation was adjusted to the frequency-position function of the normal cochlea and a map which allocated sounds to a limited area of the cochlea, in addition to the default. Performance with the two alternative maps did not exceed that of the default allocation and was poorer for the majority of participants: [F(2, 14) = 51. 3, p< 0. 001] for a sentence test in noise. Performance was negatively correlated with the magnitude of the adjustment from the default [r= 0. 838, p= 0. 002 and r=- 0. 700, p= 0. 024] for the two maps, suggesting that participants had acclimatised to their clinical maps. Electrode discrimination was found to be at chance levels for some participants at the apical end of the array but above chance {{in the middle of the}} array. Another alternative map, with logarithmic frequency spacing and some basal shift was trialled and gave improved performance on a sentence test in noise for three participants with poor electrode discrimination at the apical end of the array. A second experiment was conducted, with 13 adult CI users, in which perception of speech and music was assessed with ten frequency allocations, including the default. The ability to follow a pitch contour was measured for centre frequencies of neighbouring filters. Performance with the different allocations varied between individuals; some individuals performed better with alternative allocations from the default. A strategy was developed for the selection of frequency allocation for individuals, based on pitch contour scores for different electrodes, which offered improved performance on the sentence test for the group [t(12) =- 3. 31, p= 0. 006, r= 0. 69]. The overall results show that optimisation of frequency allocation for individuals can be achieved by adjustment of the frequency-to-electrode allocation based on pitch perception ability in different areas of the cochlea...|$|R

Methods  Mothers (n[*]=[*] 217) and fathers (n[*]=[*] 204) of term, moderately preterm, and very preterm infants were interviewed 1 month postpartum using the Clinical Interview for Parents of high-risk infants (CLIP), to assess their experiences and perceptions related to the pregnancy, delivery, infant, hospitalization, support system, and their narratives. Their responses were factor analyzed and entered into prediction models of parental behaviors (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development observations) 6 months postpartum. Results  Preterm birth was associated with negative experiences and concerns in parents. Regression analyses revealed, however, that irrespective of preterm birth, negative and unrealistic parental perceptions predicted less sensitive, more intrusive, and more withdrawn behavior. Conclusions  Not prematurity per se, but particularly the presence of negative perceptions in parents, is predictive of difficulties in parent–infant interaction.

40|$|Short-term monocular {{deprivation}} alters {{visual perception}} in adult humans, increasing {{the dominance of}} the deprived eye, for example, as measured with binocular rivalry. This form of plasticity may depend upon the inhibition/excitation balance in the visual cortex. Recent work suggests that cortical excitability is reliably tracked by dilations and constrictions of the pupils of the eyes. Here, we ask whether monocular deprivation produces a systematic change of pupil behavior, as measured at rest, that is independent of the change of visual <b>perception.</b> During <b>periods</b> of minimal sensory stimulation (in the dark) and task requirements (minimizing body and gaze movements), slow pupil oscillations, “hippus,” spontaneously appear. We find that hippus amplitude increases after monocular deprivation, with larger hippus changes in participants showing larger ocular dominance changes (measured by binocular rivalry). This tight correlation suggests that a single latent variable explains both the change of ocular dominance and hippus. We speculate that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine may be implicated in this phenomenon, given its important role in both plasticity and pupil control. On the practical side, our results indicate that measuring the pupil hippus (a simple and short procedure) provides a sensitive index of the change of ocular dominance induced by short-term monocular deprivation, hence a proxy for plasticity...|$|R
