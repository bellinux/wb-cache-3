500|$|Despite being {{presented}} as a [...] "polished commercial group" [...] in their radio appearances, Deep Purple's stage excesses and success in the US {{did not make a}} good impression on British audiences. The Deviants frontman and later journalist Mick Farren described Deep Purple's music as [...] "a slow and pompous din, somewhere between bad Tchaikovsky and a B-52 taking off on a bombing run." [...] They were also criticised for being too American and the [...] "poor man's Vanilla Fudge".

[...] His review concludes, [...] "t's {{a fine example of}} a show past its glory days, nevertheless finding a way to make itself relevant again." [...] VanDerWerff later awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and praised—in addition to its refreshing take on the alien mythology—the episode's location, noting that the oil rig's [...] "isolation and man-made island status, was definitely the sort <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> would look and feel different from just about every other episode of the show." [...] He also applauded the dynamic between Mulder and Doggett, and wrote that the episode successfully was a way for [...] "David Duchovny and Fox Mulder to pass the torch to Robert Patrick and John Doggett." ...|$|E

This altar, {{though it}} stood without the veil, {{to teach us}} to live by faith, and {{to make use of}} the name of Christ, as we find it {{recorded}} in the first temple, yet was placed so nigh unto the holiest, that the smell of the smoke might go in thither; to show that it is not distance <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> can keep the voice of true prayer from our God, the God of heaven; but that he will be taken with what we ask for according to his word. It stood, I say, nigh the veil, nigh the holiest; and he that burnt incense there, did make his approach to God. Hence the Psalmist, when he spake of praying, saith, 'It is good for me to draw near to God' (Psa 73:28; Heb 10:22).|$|E
60|$|Spinny Lane, St. Botolph's in the East, {{when at last}} it was found, was {{not exactly}} the sort <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Prendergast had expected. It must be known {{that he did not}} allow the cabman to drive him up to the very door indicated, nor even to the lane itself; but {{contented}} himself with leaving the cab at St. Botolph's church. The huntsman in looking after his game is as wily as the fox himself. Men do not talk at the covert side--or at any rate they ought not. And they should stand together discreetly at the non-running side. All manner of wiles and silences and discretions are necessary, though too often broken through by the uninstructed,--much to their own discomfort. And so in hunting his fox, Mr. Prendergast did not dash up loudly into the covert, but discreetly left his cab at the church of St. Botolph's.|$|E
5000|$|Census <b>of</b> <b>Places</b> <b>that</b> Matter: The Census <b>of</b> <b>Places</b> <b>that</b> Matter is a city-wide {{survey to}} which New Yorkers {{nominate}} <b>places</b> <b>that</b> are significant to them.

Place Matters follows up with additional research for many <b>of</b> the nominated <b>places</b> in order to create rich and thorough profiles of them on the Census, resulting in a unique directory of information that tells NYC's history. The Census serves as a resource for activists, artists, architects, scholars, students, and developers, among others.|$|R

I ain't known to be mixed up with thieves, and this court ain't the sort <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> coppers would ever dream of searching for jewels. Sometimes nothing comes for weeks, sometimes {{there is a big}} haul; but they pay me something a week regular, and I gets a present after a good thing has been brought off, so you needn't worrit about me.

6000|$|Now it {{was just}} at this thrilling part that Euphemia came home, and the trouble about the {{flattened}} hat began. I never flattened her hat. It was in the box, and so was I; but as for deliberate flattening----It was just a thing that happened. She should not write such interesting stories if she expects {{me to go on}} tiptoe through the world looking about for her hats. To have that story taken away just at that particular moment was horrible. There was fully as much as I had read still to come, so that a lot happened after this duel of Sword v. Fiery Eye. I know from a sheet that came out <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> Margot stabbed herself with a dagger ("richly jewelled"), but of all that came between I have not the faintest suspicion. That is the peculiar interest of it. At this particular moment the one book I want to read in all the world is the rest of this novel of Euphemia's. And simply, on the score of a new hat needed, she keeps it back and haggles! ...|$|E
6000|$|French soldiers, {{in their}} bluish-gray coats and scarlet trousers, were on duty at the gate, {{and one of}} them took my {{passport}} and the vetturino's, and we then drove into the town to wait till they should be vised. We saw but one street, narrow, with tall, rusty, aged houses, built of stone, evil smelling; in short, a kind <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> would be intolerably dismal in cloudy England, and cannot be called cheerful even under the sun of Italy. [...] . Priests passed, and burly friars, one of whom was carrying a wine-barrel on his head. Little carts, laden with firkins of grapes, and donkeys with the same genial burden, brushed passed our vettura, finding scarce room enough in the narrow street. All the idlers of Acquapendente--and they were many--assembled to gaze at us, but not discourteously. Indeed, I never saw an idle curiosity exercised in such a pleasant way as by the country-people of Italy. It almost deserves to be called a kindly interest and sympathy, instead of a hard and cold curiosity, like that of our own people, and it is displayed with such simplicity that it is evident no offence is intended.|$|E

60|$|I had {{scarcely}} {{crossed the}} wall when I stopped at hearing a new bird song, so amazingly sweet {{that it could}} only be a Christmas message, yet so out <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> the listener stood doubting whether his ears were playing him false, wondering whether the music or the landscape would not suddenly vanish as an unreal thing. The song was continuous--a soft melodious warble, full of sweetness and suggestion; but suggestion of June meadows and a summer sunrise, rather than of snow-packed evergreens and Christmastide. To add to the unreality, no ear could tell where the song came from; its own muffled quality disguised the source perfectly. I searched the trees in front; there was no bird there. I looked behind; there was no place for a bird to sing. I remembered the redstart, how he calls sometimes from among the rocks, and refuses to show himself, and runs and hides when you look for him. I searched the wall; but not a bird track marked the snow. All the while the wonderful carol went on, now in the air, now close beside me, growing more and more bewildering as I listened. It took me a good half-hour to locate the sound; then I understood.|$|E
6000|$|She {{began with}} her {{habitual}} prelude. [...] "You see," [...] she said, and stopped and began again. She {{wanted to tell}} them and with a clumsy simplicity she told them how these Hostels had arisen out of her desire {{that they should have}} something better than the uncomfortable lodgings in which they lived. They weren't a business enterprise, but they weren't any sort of charity. [...] "And I wanted them to be the sort of place in which you would feel quite free. I hadn't any sort of intention of having you interfered with. I hate being interfered with myself, and I understand just as well as anyone can that you don't like it either. I wanted these Hostels to be the sort <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>that</b> you might perhaps after a time almost manage and run for yourselves. You might have a committee or something.... Only you know it isn't always easy to do as one wants. Things don't always go in this world as one wants them to go--particularly if one isn't clever." [...] She lost herself for a moment at that point, and then went on to say she didn't like the new rules. They had been drawn up in a hurry and she had only read them after they were printed. All sorts of things in them---- ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was almost}} her last {{outbreak}} of passive grief; at least, she never indulged in another {{that the world}} knew anything about. But this one was long and terrible; she flung herself {{on the sofa and}} gave herself up to her misery. She hardly knew what had happened; ostensibly she had only had a difference with her lover, as other girls had had before, and the thing was not only not a rupture, but she was under no obligation to regard it even as a menace. Nevertheless, she felt a wound, even if he had not dealt it; {{it seemed to her that}} a mask had suddenly fallen from his face. He had wished to get away from her; he had been angry and cruel, and said strange things, with strange looks. She was smothered and stunned; she buried her head in the cushions, sobbing and talking to herself. But at last she raised herself, with the fear that either her father or Mrs. Penniman would come in; and then she sat there, staring before her, while the room grew darker. She said to herself that perhaps he would come back to tell her he had not meant what he said; and she listened for his ring at the door, trying to believe that this was probable. A long time passed, but Morris remained absent; the shadows gathered; the evening settled down on the meagre elegance of the light, clear-coloured room; the fire went out. When it had grown dark, Catherine went to the window and looked out; she stood there for half an hour, on the mere chance that he would come up the steps. At last she turned away, for she saw her father come in. He had seen her at the window looking out, and he stopped a moment at the bottom of the white steps, and gravely, with an air of exaggerated courtesy, lifted his hat to her. The gesture was so incongruous to the condition she was in, this stately tribute of respect to a poor girl despised and forsaken was so out <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> <b>that</b> the thing gave her a kind of horror, and she hurried away to her room. It seemed to her that she had given Morris up.|$|E
