50|$|In 1790, the English {{inventor}} Thomas Saint {{invented the}} first sewing machine design, {{but he did}} not successfully advertise or market his invention. His machine was meant to be used on leather and canvas material. It is likely that Saint had a working model but {{there is no evidence of}} one; he was a skilled cabinet maker and his device included many practically functional features: an <b>overhanging</b> <b>arm,</b> a feed mechanism (adequate for short lengths of leather), a vertical needle bar, and a looper.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{sewing machine}} was actually patented by Thomas Saint in 1790. So Thimonnier's machine {{was not the}} first. Saint's contribution was not made public until 1874 when William Newton Wilson, himself a sewing machine manufacturer, found the drawings in the London Patent Office and built a machine which worked following some adjustments to the looper. So, in 1790 Thomas Saint had invented a machine with an <b>overhanging</b> <b>arm,</b> a feed mechanism (adequate for the short lengths of leather he intended it for), a vertical needle bar and a looper. The London Science Museum has the model that Wilson built from Saint's drawings.|$|E
60|$|Going to {{the edge}} he found {{that one of the}} trees had a large <b>arm</b> <b>overhanging</b> the cliff.|$|R
60|$|It {{was indeed}} two {{o'clock in the}} morning when they arrived at the gates of Paris. Accustomed though they all were to horse exercise, the journey had been a very {{fatiguing}} one. Until night fell they had ridden briskly, talking as they went on the probable state of affairs in France and of the military operations that were likely to be undertaken {{as the result of the}} victory, but progress became slow after darkness set in. The roads were in many places detestably bad. In passing through forests it was not possible to travel much beyond a walk, as it was necessary not only to avoid <b>overhanging</b> <b>arms</b> of trees, but to keep the track, for the road in many places was nothing more.|$|R
