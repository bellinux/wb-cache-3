5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive <b>Optical</b> <b>Filter)</b> {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E

25|$|High power mercury vapor {{black light}} lamps {{are made in}} power ratings of 100 to 1000 watts. These do not use phosphors, but rely on the {{intensified}} and slightly broadened 350375nm spectral line of mercury from high pressure discharge at between , depending upon the specific type. These lamps use envelopes of Wood's glass or similar <b>optical</b> <b>filter</b> coatings to block out all the visible light and also the short wavelength (UVC) lines of mercury at 184.4 and 253.7nm, which are harmful to the eyes and skin. A few other spectral lines, falling within the pass band of the Wood's glass between 300 and 400nm, contribute to the output.|$|E

500|$|Atomic line filters can be {{considered}} the optical equivalent of lock-in amplifiers; they are used in scientific applications requiring the effective detection of a narrowband signal (almost always laser light) {{that would otherwise be}} obscured by broadband sources, such as daylight. [...] They are used regularly in Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and are being studied for their potential use in laser communication systems. Atomic line filters are superior to conventional dielectric optical filters such as interference filters and Lyot filters, but their greater complexity makes them practical only in background-limited detection, where a weak signal is detected while suppressing a strong background. [...] Compared to etalons, another high-end <b>optical</b> <b>filter,</b> Faraday filters are significantly sturdier and may be six times cheaper at around US$15,000 per unit.|$|E

2500|$|A {{polarizer}} or polariser is an <b>optical</b> <b>filter</b> {{that lets}} light waves {{of a specific}} polarization pass and blocks light waves of other polarizations. [...] It can convert {{a beam of light}} of undefined or mixed polarization into a beam of well-defined polarization, that is polarized light. [...] The common types of polarizers are linear polarizers and circular polarizers. Polarizers are used in many optical techniques and instruments, and polarizing filters find applications in photography and liquid crystal display technology. [...] Polarizers can also be made for other types of electromagnetic waves besides light, such as radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays.|$|E

40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>filters</b> are {{essential}} {{in a wide}} range of applications, including optical communications, electronics, lighting, optical sensors and photography. This article presents recent work which indicates that <b>optical</b> <b>filters</b> can be created from specialized nanoparticle suspensions. Specifically, this article describes a theoretical optimization process for designing nanofluid-based filters for hybrid solar photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) applications. This particular application is suitable because nanofluids can be utilized as both volumetric solar absorbers and flowing heat transfer mediums. The nanofluid filters described in this work compare favorably with conventional <b>optical</b> <b>filters</b> for five photovoltaic (PV) cell alternatives: InGaP, CdTe, InGaAs, Si, and Ge. This study demonstrates that nanofluids make efficient, compact and potentially low-cost, spectrally selective <b>optical</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we report recent {{modeling}} and design work indicating that mixtures of nanoparticles in liquids {{can be used as}} an alternative to conventional <b>optical</b> <b>filters.</b> The major motivation for creating liquid <b>optical</b> <b>filters</b> is that they can be pumped {{in and out of a}} system to meet transient needs in an application. To demonstrate the versatility of this new class of filters, we present the design of nanofluids for use as long-pass, short-pass, and bandpass <b>optical</b> <b>filters</b> using a simple Monte Carlo optimization procedure. With relatively simple mixtures, we achieve filters with < 15 % mean-squared deviation in transmittance from conventional filters. We also discuss the current commercial feasibility of nanofluid-based <b>optical</b> <b>filters</b> by including an estimation of today&# 039;s off-the-shelf cost of the materials. While the limited availability of quality commercial nanoparticles makes it hard to compete with conventional filters, new synthesis methods and economies of scale could enable nanofluid-based <b>optical</b> <b>filters</b> in the near future. As such, this study lays the groundwork for creating a new class of selective <b>optical</b> <b>filters</b> for a wide range of applications, namely communications, electronics, optical sensors, lighting, photography, medicine, and many more...|$|R
2500|$|Eyewear {{is rated}} for optical density (OD), {{which is the}} base-10 {{logarithm}} of the attenuation factor by which the <b>optical</b> <b>filter</b> reduces beam power. [...] For example, eyewear with OD3 will reduce the beam power in the specified wavelength range {{by a factor of}} 1000. In addition to an optical density sufficient to reduce beam power to below the maximum permissible exposure (see above), laser eyewear used where direct beam exposure is possible should be able to withstand a direct hit from the laser beam without breaking. The protective specifications (wavelengths and optical densities) are usually printed on the goggles, generally {{near the top of the}} unit. In the European Community, manufacturers are required by European standard EN 207 to specify the maximum power rating rather than the optical density.|$|E
2500|$|A {{distributed}} feedback laser (DFB) {{is a type}} {{of single}} frequency laser diode. [...] DFBs are the most common transmitter type in DWDM-systems. To stabilize the lasing wavelength, a diffraction grating is etched close to the p-n junction of the diode. This grating acts like an <b>optical</b> <b>filter,</b> causing a single wavelength to be fed back to the gain region and lase. Since the grating provides the feedback that is required for lasing, reflection from the facets is not required. Thus, at least one facet of a DFB is anti-reflection coated. The DFB laser has a stable wavelength that is set during manufacturing by the pitch of the grating, and can only be tuned slightly with temperature. DFB lasers are widely used in optical communication applications where a precise and stable wavelength is critical.|$|E
2500|$|A {{black light}} lamp emits long-wave UVA {{radiation}} and little visible light. Fluorescent {{black light lamp}}s work similarly to other fluorescent lamps, but use a phosphor on the inner tube surface which emits UVA radiation instead of visible light. Some lamps use a deep-bluish-purple Wood's glass <b>optical</b> <b>filter</b> that blocks almost all visible light with wavelengths longer than 400 nanometres. Others use plain glass instead of the more expensive Wood's glass, so they appear light-blue to the eye when operating. A black light may also be formed, very inefficiently, by using a layer of Wood's glass in the envelope for an incandescent bulb. Though cheaper than fluorescent UV lamps, only 0.1% of the input power is emitted as usable ultraviolet radiation. Mercury-vapor black lights in ratings up to 1kW with UV-emitting phosphor and an envelope of Wood's glass are used for theatrical and concert displays. Black lights are used in applications in which extraneous visible light must be minimized; mainly to observe fluorescence, the colored glow that many substances give off when exposed to UV light. [...] UVA/UVB emitting bulbs are also sold for other special purposes, such as tanning lamps and reptile-keeping.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a big}} {{need for}} {{standardizing}} signal quality tests of transmitters for 100 Gb/s PM-QPSK fiber optic communication systems. Such systems are currently being deployed and still, there is no standard for transmitter testing. Several approaches for doing this in an efficient manner have been proposed. These include different methods of detecting the signal and different approaches for filtering the signal. The signal can be sampled electrically or optically, both over- and undersampled. The choices of <b>filtering</b> range from <b>optical</b> and electrical hardware filters to filtering in digital signal processing. All filtering and sampling techniques are not compatible. The focus in this project will be on <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> {{that can be used}} together with optical sampling. The reason for using optical sampling is to achieve high measurement bandwidth. The only filtering technique which is easily applicable when sampling optically is <b>optical</b> <b>filtering.</b> This is because the signal is undersampled. The project is an exploratory study to investigate if optical sampling together with <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> is a good approach for signal quality testing. Experiments were made to assess the accuracy of <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> by measuring on QPSK signals and comparing to DSP filtered measurements. Impulse response measurements were also made to compare the impulse responses of an optically and DSP filtered system. Also, theoretical work has been done to determine the equivalence to <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> in the DSP domain. The accuracy of the <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> is found to be sufficient under certain conditions on the filter characteristics. It is found that <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> together with <b>optical</b> sampling is a viable method for fast and efficient transmitter testing. The <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> method should be included in future standardization studies as an alternative to DSP filtering used in real-time sampling approaches...|$|R
