5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the century, most blacks in the South, and many poor whites, had been disenfranchised by state legislatures passing constitutions with {{provisions}} that were discriminatory in practice. This meant that their millions of population had no political representation. Most of the South had one-party states. When the resolution came before the Senate, a substitute resolution, <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> rider, was proposed by Joseph L. Bristow of Kansas. It was adopted by a vote of 64 to 24, with 4 not voting. Nearly a year later, the House accepted the change. The conference report that would become the Seventeenth Amendment was approved by the Senate 42 to 36 on April 12, 1912, and by the House 238 to 39, with 110 not voting on May 13, 1912.|$|E
5|$|Znám's problem {{concerns}} sets {{of numbers}} such that each number in the set divides but is not equal to the product {{of all the other}} numbers, plus <b>one.</b> <b>Without</b> <b>the</b> inequality requirement, the values in Sylvester's sequence would solve the problem; with that requirement, it has other solutions derived from recurrences similar to the one defining Sylvester's sequence. Solutions to Znám's problem have applications to the classification of surface singularities (Brenton and Hill 1988) and to the theory of nondeterministic finite automata.|$|E
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and <b>one</b> <b>without).</b> <b>The</b> experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E

25|$|The Heavenly Doctrine {{rejects the}} concept of {{salvation}} through faith-alone (sola-fide in Latin), since he considered both faith and charity necessary for salvation, not <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> other, whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although {{it must be a}} faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to The Heavenly Doctrine, is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} relative state formulation, Everett proposed {{that there is}} one universal wavefunction that describes the objective reality of the whole universe. He stated that when multiple subsystems interact, the total system becomes a superposition of these subsystems. This includes observers and measurement systems, which become part of one universal state (the wavefunction) that is always described via the Schrödinger Equation (or its relativistic alternative). That is, they become entangled such that one cannot define <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> other. Thus, each subsystems state can only be described relative to each subsystem with which it interacts (hence the name relative state).|$|E
25|$|The film {{explores the}} armies of Middle-earth. John Howe was the basic {{designer}} of the forces of evil. The Uruk-hai were the first army approved by Jackson, and Howe also designed a special crossbow for the characters, <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> redundancy of opening to reload, the realization of a 15th-century manuscript. Also created were 100 Elven suits of armour, with emphasis on Autumnal colours due {{to the theme of}} Elves leaving Middle-earth. 250 suits were made for the Rohirrim. The Rohan designs were based on Germanic and Anglo-Saxon patterns. Most of the weapons were designed by John Howe, and forged by Peter Lyon. Each sword took 3–6 days to make.|$|E
25|$|In 1951 Herbert Callen and Theodore Welton {{proved the}} quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) which was {{originally}} formulated in classical form by Nyquist (1928) {{as an explanation}} for observed Johnson noise in electric circuits. Fluctuation-dissipation theorem showed that when something dissipates energy, in an effectively irreversible way, a connected heat bath must also fluctuate. The fluctuations and the dissipation go hand in hand; {{it is impossible to}} have <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> other. The implication of FDT being that the vacuum could be treated as a heat bath coupled to a dissipative force and as such energy could, in part, be extracted from the vacuum for potentially useful work. FDT {{has been shown to be}} true experimentally under certain quantum, non-classical, conditions.|$|E

25|$|Fendt, {{part of the}} AGCO corporation, {{has also}} {{been working on a}} driverless tractor. In 2011 in Hanover at the Agritechnica show, Fendt {{presented}} their driverless tractor model called the GuideConnect. The GuideConnect is a tractor programmed to mirror the movements of another tractor. An operator-driven tractor maneuvers through a field or through crops and is followed by a driverless tractor. Because the first tractor has a driver, he or she can manually steer to avoid obstacles with the driverless tractor following. Instead of focusing on a completely independent piece of technology, Fendt made GuideConnect to work together with operator-controlled machinery. GuideConnect is connected by satellite navigation and radio to the operator-driven tractor. The two perform as one unit. The one with the driver leads while the <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> driver follows.|$|E

500|$|From the outset, Euston {{intended}} to create {{two versions of}} the story; a four-part serial for broadcast on UK television and a 100-minute film, The Quatermass Conclusion, for distribution abroad. While writing the scripts, Kneale was [...] "careful not to pad, because I knew that was the obvious thing, but to write in material which can be removed". There is one major deviation between the two versions; in the film version, the scene where Quatermass, separated from Annie Morgan while transporting Isabel to London, encounters a band of elderly people living in a scrapyard is completely absent; this meant that {{two versions of the}} hospital scene where Isabel dies were shot—one with Quatermass present (the film version) and <b>one</b> <b>without</b> (<b>the</b> television version). There was little interest among film distributors in The Quatermass Conclusion, and it received only a limited theatrical release.|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} of how to render the stars (representing the 13 original states) on the coin was posed in the letters; in the end, Leech opted for six-pointed stars on the obverse and five-pointed ones on the reverse. Barber had prepared three versions of the design, each with clouds over the eagle; Leech approved one on October 31 and ordered working dies prepared, but then began to question the presence of the clouds, and had two more versions made. On November 6, President Harrison and his Cabinet considered which of the designs to approve, and chose <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> clouds; the following day, Leech ordered working dies prepared. Barber scaled down his design for the quarter and dime. While the Cabinet approved the designs, members requested that the Mint embolden the words [...] "Liberty" [...] on the obverse and [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] on the reverse, believing that these legends would wear away in circulation; despite the resulting changes, this proved to be accurate. For the reverse of the dime, on which, by law, an eagle could not appear, a slight modification of the reverse of the Seated Liberty dime was used, with a wreath of foliage and produce surrounding the words [...] "One Dime".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Microsoft {{launched}} the [...]NET initiative, along with new versions {{of some of}} its development products, such as Microsoft Visual Studio. The initiative has been an entirely new development API for Windows programming, and included a new programming language, C#. Windows Server 2003 was launched, featuring enhanced administration abilities, such as new user interfaces to server tools. In 2004, the company released Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, a version of Windows XP designed for multimedia abilities, and Windows XP Starter Edition, a version of Windows XP with a smaller feature set designed for entry-level consumers. However, Microsoft encountered more turmoil in March 2004 when antitrust legal action would be brought against it by the European Union for allegedly abusing its market dominance (see Microsoft Corp v Commission). Eventually Microsoft was fined €497 million (US$613 million), ordered to divulge certain protocols to competitors, and to produce a new version of its Windows XP platform—called Windows XP Home Edition N—that did not include its Windows Media Player. Microsoft was also ordered to produce separate packages of Windows after South Korea also landed a settlement against the company in 2005. It had to pay out US$32 million and produce more than one version of Windows for the country in the same vein as the European Union-one with Windows Media Player and Windows Messenger and <b>one</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> two programs.|$|E
