5|$|The first kingdom's {{government}} {{consisted of}} the king (styled Malikum) and the grand vizier, who headed a council <b>of</b> <b>elders</b> (Abbu) and the administration.

5|$|Although the Loons were afforded {{respect as}} {{principal}} peace chiefs, this status was not permanent.

A chief's power in Ojibwa society was based on persuasion and consensus; it was contingent, holding only as long as the community <b>of</b> <b>elders,</b> including the women, chose to respect and follow the chief's lead.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominant}} {{language of the}} region is Mayali, a dialect of Bininj Gun-Wok traditionally associated with the region surrounding Maningrida, in Western Arnhem Land.

40|$|AbstractPrevalence data <b>of</b> <b>elder</b> {{abuse from}} social and health {{services}} only present a tip of the iceberg. A large amount of situations is left undetected.

This paper provides {{an understanding of the}} multi-dimensionality <b>of</b> <b>elder</b> abuse, explores the potential and need for an assessment instrument to support prevention by professionals and examines existing instruments, while addressing a number of shortcomings. Education programmes for care professionals often include identifying signs and symptoms <b>of</b> <b>elder</b> abuse, how to manage suspected cases, {{and the role of the}} professional in protecting potential victims and ethical issues.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on a rarely {{discussed}} and relatively unknown type <b>of</b> <b>elder</b> abuse: elder abuse by a spouse. The data presented comes from a study examining the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>elder</b> abuse cases in three CISC's in Quebec (Local Centre for Community Services). Firstly, the characteristics associated with forms of abuse and both the abused spouse and the abusive spouse are described. Cases <b>of</b> <b>elder</b> abuse by a spouse are also compared with the other cases <b>of</b> <b>elder</b> abuse in the sample: abuse by a child, another family member, a friend or an acquaintance. Secondly, the authors examine more specifics situations <b>of</b> <b>elder</b> abuse by a spouse such as situations {{where one of the}} spouses has cognitive impairment and how that differs from situations where both spouses are lucid.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{a period of}} {{financial}} and leadership disputes occurred within the church hierarchy, with church treasurer, Stanley Rader, {{at the center of}} many of the disputes. The gravest incident was the church bwing placed in financial receivership by the Attorney General of California, George Deukmejian, an action that was later disallowed in court. Tkach took {{an active role in the}} defense of Armstrong, Rader, and the church headquarters' operations. He rallied the WCG membership to take action against the court proceedings. Armstrong recognized his effectiveness and subsequently ordained him to the rank of evangelist on September 27, 1979. See Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God. In March 1981 Armstrong appointed him to the WCG's advisory council <b>of</b> <b>elders,</b> and eventually, Armstrong named him Director of Church Administration, one of the most prominent administrative positions other than Armstrong himself.|$|E
5|$|The History of the Roman Constitution is a {{study of}} Ancient Rome that traces the {{progression}} of Roman political development from {{the founding of the}} city of Rome in 753 BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. The constitution of the Roman Kingdom vested the sovereign power in the King of Rome. The king did have two rudimentary checks on his authority, which took the form of a board <b>of</b> <b>elders</b> (the Roman Senate) and a popular assembly (the Curiate Assembly). The arrangement was similar to the constitutional arrangements found in contemporary Greek city-states (such as Athens or Sparta). These Greek constitutional principles probably came to Rome through the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia in southern Italy. The Roman Kingdom was overthrown in 510 BC, according to legend, and in its place the Roman Republic was founded.|$|E
5|$|The Spartan council <b>of</b> <b>Elders,</b> the gerousia, {{suggested}} that the Spartan women be sent to Crete for their protection. They were dissuaded from doing so by Arachidamia, the former queen and grandmother of the Eurypontid King Eudamidas II who convinced them that the women could assist in the city's defence. In order to guarantee the fighting men some rest, the women and the elderly began bolstering defences. Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him, the defenders dug a large trench and sunk wagons into the ground at its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance. Moreover, messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request aid from Antigonus, despite the fact the Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile. Pausanias, the Greek geographer, claims that Sparta received some aid from Messene and the pro-Spartan faction at Argos.|$|E

5|$|The first {{city had}} the {{characteristics}} of large urban centers, such as monumental buildings, and {{seems to have been}} ruled by a kinship based assembly, headed by elders. The pre-Akkadian kingdom was decentralized, and the provincial center of Nabada was ruled by a council <b>of</b> <b>elders,</b> next to the king's representative. The Nagarite monarchs had to tour their kingdom regularly in order to assert their political control. During the early Akkadian period, Nagar was administrated by local officials. However, central control was tightened and the number of Akkadian officials increased, following the supposed environmental event that preceded the construction of Naram-Sin's palace. The post-Akkadian Nagar was a city-state kingdom, that gradually lost its political importance during the early second millennium BC, as no evidence for a king dating to that period exists.|$|E
5|$|Under the Tang law code {{compiled}} in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined {{for those}} who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system <b>of</b> <b>elders.</b> Those who assaulted their parents could be put to death, those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning. A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state. Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures. Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body <b>of</b> <b>elders</b> who represented the community. These elders set {{the rules and regulations}} that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. Untouchability was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With {{the exception of a few}} who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) is an indication of the degree of social fluidity in the society.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly {{was called}} by the Long Parliament {{before and during the}} {{beginning}} of the First English Civil War. The Long Parliament was influenced by Puritanism, a religious movement which sought to further reform the church. They were opposed to the religious policies of King Charles I and William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. As part of a military alliance with Scotland, Parliament agreed that the outcome of the Assembly would bring the English Church into closer conformity with the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Church was governed by a system of elected assemblies <b>of</b> <b>elders</b> called presbyterianism, rather than rule by bishops, called episcopalianism, which was used in the English church. Scottish commissioners attended and advised the Assembly as part of the agreement. Disagreements over church government caused open division in the Assembly, despite attempts to maintain unity. The party of divines who favoured presbyterianism was in the majority, but political and military realities led to greater influence for the congregationalist party. Congregationalists favoured autonomy for individual congregations rather than the subjection of congregations to regional and national assemblies entailed in presbyterianism. Parliament eventually adopted a presbyterian form of government, but it lacked the power the presbyterian divines desired. During the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, all of the documents of the Assembly were repudiated and episcopal church government was reinstated in England.|$|E
5|$|The head of {{the legal}} system was officially the pharaoh, who was {{responsible}} for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils <b>of</b> <b>elders,</b> known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.|$|E
