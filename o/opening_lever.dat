5000|$|In {{order to}} use the inbuilt {{shooting}} mechanism, the <b>opening</b> <b>lever</b> is pressed, and the barrel rotated out of the knife handle, the cartridge is inserted into the firing chamber and the barrel is then inserted back into the handle and rotated back into place using two prongs that fit into the outer latch. The lever {{on the right side}} of the NRS-2 is then cocked while the safety catch located beside the barrel is turned to the [...] "fire" [...] position. Then the user's left hand is used to hold the knife blade, and the right hand to hold the knife handle, with the right index finger being placed on the trigger, which is located above the safety catch beside the gun barrel.|$|E
5000|$|The Calypso {{is equally}} {{suitable}} {{for water and}} air environment photography. It consists of two black enamelled cast alloy body parts; the one with all the internal parts is lowered into the outer shell. They are locked together when the interchangeable lens is mounted on the camera, and sealed by Vaseline greased O-rings to form a watertight unit. At the top, the Calypso has a built-in optical viewfinder for the 35mm standard lens, and an accessory shoe on the top for separate viewfinders to suit various purposes. The body is covered in a grey sealskin imitation. Two carrying strap attachments doubles as <b>opening</b> <b>levers</b> to be hooked under the top protrusions either side and forced downwards to lift the top out when no lens is mounted on the camera.|$|R
40|$|African cichlid fishes have {{repeatedly}} evolved highly specialized modes of feeding through adaptations of their oral jaws. Here, we explore the molecular genetic {{basis of the}} <b>opening</b> and closing <b>lever</b> mechanisms of the cichlid lower jaw, which have traditionally been {{used to describe the}} mechanics of feeding behavior in bony fishes. Quantitative genetic analyses demonstrate that the opening and closing mechanisms are genetically modular and therefore free to evolve independently. Bmp 4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4) is one of two loci that segregate with the mechanical advantage of closing and that together account for > 30 % of the phenotypic variance in this trait. Species-specific differences in jaw shape are obvious early in cichlid larval development and are correlated with patterns of bmp 4 expression in the mandibular primordium. When bmp 4 is overexpressed in the obligate suction feeder Danio rerio, mandibular morphology exhibits specific transformations of <b>opening</b> and closing <b>lever</b> ratios. We conclude that patterns of morphological integration of the cichlid jaw reflect a balance among conflicting functional demands. Further, we demonstrate that bmp 4 has the potential to alter mandibular morphology in a way that mimics adaptive variation among fish species...|$|R
40|$|In many {{vertebrate}} radiations, food partitioning among {{closely related}} taxa {{is a key}} factor in both the maintenance of species diversity and the process of diversification. We compared diet composition and jaw morphology of 18 New Zealand triplefin species (F. Tripterygiidae) to examine whether species have diversified along a trophic axis. These fishes predominantly utilised small, mobile benthic invertebrates, and interspecific differences in diet composition appeared to be mainly attributable to habitat- or size-dependent feeding behaviour. Although there were differences in the relative size of the bones comprising the oral jaw apparatus between species, the majority showed an apparatus consistent with a relatively high velocity, low force jaw movement indicative of a diet of evasive prey. Phylogenetic comparative analyses showed that the evolution of jaw lever ratios and diet breadth was best explained by a non-directional model in which character changes have occurred randomly and independent of phylogeny. The mode of diet breadth evolution was gradual and the tempo has not accelerated or slowed down over time. The mode of evolution for the jaw lever ratios has been gradual for the opening but punctuated for the closing levers, suggesting that evolutionary changes have occurred rapidly for the latter trait. The tempo of trait evolution for the jaw <b>opening</b> <b>levers</b> has not accelerated or slowed down over time, while the tempo for the jaw closing levers has accelerated towards the tips of the tree, which is suggestive of species level adaptation. The lack of phylogenetic signal in diet breadth and jaw lever ratios appears most likely to be a correlated response to the marked habitat diversification in this group, and is thus the passive outcome of prey availability in species-specific habitat types. Overall, the trophic ecology of New Zealand's triplefin fauna parallels the generalist strategy typical of the family worldwide, suggesting that trophic resource partitioning has not been an important factor in the evolution of these fishes...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the central}} goals in paleoecology is to {{understand}} the nature and consequences of biotic interactions. In marine systems, {{it has been argued that}} one of the major steps in the escalation of biotic interactions was marked by the origins of grazing fishes in the Cenozoic. Here I investigate the origins of herbivory and grazing in marine fishes using analyses of functional morphospace. Closing and <b>opening</b> <b>lever</b> ratios and relative length of the lower jaw are used to construct a plot of functional morphospace, a quantitative description of the potential feeding modes of fishes. Four fish faunas were examined, spanning the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (Triassic, Jurassic, Eocene and Recent). All three fossil faunas are from conservation Lagerstätten in the central Tethys, in the vicinity of coral reefs or coral-bearing hardgrounds. Changes in functional morphospace occupation reveal a marked shift in the Cenozoic, with the appearance of fishes with relatively small forceful jaws. In Recent faunas, this functional morphospace is occupied almost exclusively by grazing herbivores. This taxon-independent morphological signal of herbivory was lacking in the Mesozoic faunas, was first recorded in the Eocene, and persisted throughout the Cenozoic. This suggests that the Cenozoic did indeed witness the appearance and proliferation of herbivory and grazing by marine fishes. The arrival of these piscine herbivores had the potential to fundamentally alter the dynamics of benthic marine communities...|$|E

He moved to Lancashire in 1972 largely as insurance for {{the likelihood that}} regular <b>opening</b> bowlers Peter <b>Lever</b> and Ken Shuttleworth would be called up for Test cricket by England, but with those bowlers doing extremely badly, Lee became their first choice opening bowler. 1973 saw Lee massively surpass his first season’s promise and become the mainstay of Lancashire’s bowling, actually taking more wickets in the County Championship than any other bowler.|$|R
5000|$|The steer roper starts {{behind a}} [...] "barrier" [...] - a taut rope {{fastened}} with an easily broken string which is fastened lightly to the steer. When the roper {{calls for the}} steer, the chute man trips a <b>lever,</b> <b>opening</b> the doors. The steer breaks out running. When the steer reaches {{the end of the}} tether, the string breaks, releasing the barrier for the horse and roper. Should the roper break the barrier, a 10-second penalty is added to his time). The roper must throw his rope in a loop around the steer's horns.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, {{executives}} from every studio and camera crews crowd a cargo plane soaring over the jungle, {{as they prepare}} to parachute the chimp into an unexplored section of the Amazon; but before arriving at the intended disembarkation point, the stubborn chimpanzee, {{not wanting to be}} sent into the wild, pulls a <b>lever</b> <b>opening</b> an emergency hatch which sucks all the executives out of the plane, causing them to parachute into the jungle instead. Albert Mertons, who is now more sympathetic to Jennifer's feelings, reveals to Steven that the chimp outsmarted the executives and is now en route back to the United States.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the complex}} and bitter nature of the Maluku conflict, <b>openings</b> and <b>levers</b> for {{sustainable}} peace exist. Finding strategic opportunities and leverage points will benefit from interpretation of a multi-dimensional “peacebuilding map ” that attempts synthesis of current best practices in conflict analysis. We be-gin the process of mapmaking by establishing conflict transformation as the goal in Maluku. A core tenet of conflict transformation is that social contexts—where identities are fashioned and given value—remain mutable. Therefore, just as the social identities of religion and ethnicity were politicized and polarized, so can they be transformed and reconciled in fertile social spaces where mediative ca-pacity is actively enhanced. The peacebuilding map will locate peacebuilding actors, activities that tap into their inherent mediative capacity, and social spaces where they are working and collaborating in Maluku. A temporal dimension is incorporated in the map to ensure that peacebuilding activities are appropriately suited {{to the situation in}} post-war Maluku. Finally, an analysis of current con-flict transformation strategies will suggest future prospects for peacebuilding in Maluku. ...|$|R
50|$|When {{the header}} is ready, {{he or she}} calls for the steer and an {{assistant}} pulls a <b>lever,</b> <b>opening</b> the chute doors. The freed steer breaks out running. When the steer reaches {{the end of the}} rope, the barrier releases. The header must rope the steer with one of three legal catches: a clean horn catch around both horns, a neck catch around the neck or a half-head catch around the neck and one horn. The header then takes a dally, a couple of wraps of the rope around the horn of the saddle. Some ropers have lost fingers in this event. Once the header has made the dally, the rider turns the horse, usually to the left, and the steer will follow, still running.|$|R
50|$|Oxygen partial {{pressure}} in a passive addition system {{is controlled by}} the breathing rate of the diver. Feed gas is added by a valve which is equivalent to an open circuit demand valve in function, which opens to supply gas when the counterlung is empty - the moving top plate of the counterlung works like the diaphragm of a demand valve to operate the <b>lever</b> <b>opening</b> the valve when the counterlung volume is low. The volume may be low because the internal bellows has discharged a part of the previous breath to the environment, or because an increase in depth has caused the contents to be compressed, or a combination of these causes. The oxygen used by the diver also slowly decreases the volume of gas in the loop.|$|R
50|$|From Cornalees Bridge The Cut runs west {{then turns}} northward {{following}} along the contour of Dunrod Hill which it follows round until running eastwards directly above {{the town of}} Greenock at Overton, having come a distance of 9 km. On the way it collects some of the water from streams that cross its path, {{and a series of}} sluice gates incorporated an ingenious automatic way of releasing surplus water. As shown in the picture of a restored mechanism, when the aqueduct is over full, water flows down the pipe in the foreground and fills the bucket, which then pulls the chain down over the pulley wheel and lifts the counterweight and the <b>lever</b> <b>opening</b> the sluice gate. Small holes in the bucket allow the water to drain slowly out, so when the inflow stops the counterweight eventually pulls the sluice gate lever down and lifts the empty bucket.|$|R
5000|$|The calves {{are lined}} up {{in a row and}} moved through narrow runways leading to a chute with {{spring-loaded}} doors. When a calf enters the chute, a door is closed behind it and a lightweight 28 ft rope, attached to a trip lever, is fastened around the calf's neck. The lever holds a taut cord or [...] "barrier" [...] that runs across a large pen or [...] "box" [...] at one side of the calf chute, where the horse and rider wait. The barrier is used to ensure that the calf gets a head start. When the roper is ready, he (or, in some roping events, she) calls for the calf, and the chute operator pulls a <b>lever</b> <b>opening</b> the chute doors and releasing the calf. The calf runs out in a straight line. When the calf reaches the end of the rope, that trips the lever, the rope falls off the calf, and the barrier for the horse is released, starting the clock and allowing horse and rider to chase the calf.|$|R
5000|$|When the steer wrestler {{is ready}} he [...] "calls" [...] for the steer by {{nodding his head}} and the chute man trips a <b>lever</b> <b>opening</b> the doors. The {{suddenly}} freed steer breaks out running, shadowed by the hazer. When the steer reaches {{the end of his}} rope, it pops off and simultaneously releases the barrier for the steer wrestler. The steer wrestler attempts to catch up to the running steer, lean {{over the side of the}} horse which is running flat out and grab the horns of the running steer. The steer wrestler then is pulled off his horse by the slowing steer and plants his heels into the dirt further slowing the steer and himself. He then takes one hand off the horns, reaches down and grabs the nose of the steer pulling the steer off balance and ultimately [...] "throwing" [...] the steer to the ground. Once all four legs are off the ground, an official waves a flag marking the official end and a time is taken. The steer is released and trots off.|$|R
50|$|At dawn on June 7, 1958, Kirkham {{was driven}} two miles to a pasture on the prison's farm. After a black hood was placed over his head, Kirkham was led up a ramp to a newly built gallows. His drop had been {{measured}} at 6 feet to accommodate his reported weight of 200 pounds. A professional hangman from the Northwest was paid $400 ($3,174.60 in 2012 USD) for his services. Kirkham trembled slightly as the hangman fitted a noose {{around his neck}} and placed the knot under his left ear. As directed by state law, Sheriff George Beckstead walked up to Kirkham to receive his last words. At 4:57 a.m. Mountain Standard Time, the official time of dawn, Beckstead signaled the hangman to pull an iron <b>lever,</b> <b>opening</b> the trap door under Kirkham. The Kirkham family did not come to witness the execution. Prison physician W. C. Knott climbed on a stepladder to examine Kirkham's hanging body, which was concealed from view by burlap and canvas hung under the 11-foot-high platform. He was pronounced dead at 5:11 a.m. in the last hanging to be conducted by the state of Utah. No subsequent inmate had been executed by the state in this manner by February 1980, when the Utah State Legislature replaced the option of hanging with lethal injection.|$|R
