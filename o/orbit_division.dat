40|$|This paper {{identifies}} and evaluates {{strategies for}} sharing the geostationary orbit {{in the band}} 11. 7 to 12. 2 GHz between domestic systems in the fixed-satellite and broadcasting-satellite services. The effectiveness of two distinct types of sharing strategies, referred to as spectrum division and <b>orbit</b> <b>division,</b> is determined for various deployments of selected baseline systems representing the two services and for various combinations of sharing tactics such as frequency interleaving, crossed-polarization operation, and crossed-beam operation. Effectiveness {{is measured by the}} 'utilization factor', defined as the number of channels provided by the baseline systems when using an assigned share of the orbit-spectrum resource, relative to what they could provide if given the entire resource. Computer simulation is used to verify the intra- and interservice interference compatibility of the assumed deployments. It is concluded that total utilization factors close to 100 percent can be achieved with both spectrum-division and properly-chosen orbit-division strategies...|$|E

2500|$|Slim {{planned for}} 20th Division of XXXIII Corps and 7th Division of IV Corps to cross {{simultaneously}} on 13 February, {{so as to}} further mask his ultimate intentions. On XXXIII Corps' front, 20th Division crossed [...] west of Mandalay. It successfully established small bridgeheads, but these were counter-attacked nightly for almost two weeks by the Japanese 31st <b>Division.</b> <b>Orbiting</b> patrols of fighter-bombers knocked out several Japanese tanks and guns. Eventually 20th Division expanded its footholds into a single firmly-held bridgehead.|$|R
40|$|Voyager imaging, radio {{occultation}}, and stellar occultation {{data for}} the regular structure of Saturn's inner Cassini Division are presently analyzed. The regular optical depth variation observed by the radio occultation experiment scan and the feature noted in Voyager images is the same structure, namely the gravitational wakes of two 10 -km radius satellites <b>orbiting</b> within the <b>division.</b> The structure is azimuthally symmetric, and is judged {{to rule out the}} possibility that large moonlets may be responsible for the observed structure...|$|R

50|$|Lt. Col. Mamun {{took over}} command of 1 Field Regiment Artillery {{stationed}} in Jahangirabad Cantonment, Bogra, {{under the command}} of 11 Artillery Brigade <b>orbiting</b> 11 Infantry <b>Division</b> on 11 February 1993. He along with the 1 Field Regiment Artillery were stationed to United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti from September 1995. Getting back home, Lt. Col. Mamun was deputed to Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) again and was posted to Paanchari as the Region Commander and Commanding Officer of 32 Rifle Battalion under the Khagrachari Hill District during the signing of the peace treaty. The Peace Treaty was signed and Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti (PCJSS) leader, Shantu Larma surrendered arms to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in February 1998. Lt. Col. Mamun was posted as Commanding Officer of the 19 Rifle Battalion (and for some time as Commander of the Dhaka Sector) the same year. He retired from active service in July 2000.|$|R
40|$|Prior to 2010, several ISS crewmembers {{returned}} from spaceflight with changes to their vision, {{ranging from a}} mild hyperopic shift to frank disc edema. As a result, NASA expanded clinical vision testing to include more comprehensive medical imaging, including Optical Coherence Tomography and 3 Tesla Brain and Orbit MRIs. The Space and Clinical Operations (SCO) Division developed a clinical practice guideline that classified individuals based on their symptoms and diagnoses to facilitate clinical care. For the purposes of clinical surveillance, this classification was applied retrospectively to all crewmembers who had sufficient testing for classification. This classification is also a tool that has been leveraged for researchers to identify potential risk factors. In March 2014, driven {{in part by a}} more comprehensive understanding of the imaging data and increased imaging capability on <b>orbit,</b> the SCO <b>Division</b> revised their clinical care guidance to outline inflight care and increase postflight follow up. The new clinical guidance does not include a classification schem...|$|R
