He had a breakout season in 2007, when he made a career-high 35 tackles and six sacks on his way to winning his first and only Grey Cup championship. After eight seasons with the Roughriders, Adams was released and spent brief periods <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> the Edmonton Eskimos and Spokane Shock before retiring. He finished his career with 130 tackles and 12 sacks, appearing in eight playoff games and three Grey Cups.|$|E

5|$|Hanson {{remained}} silent during the team's interviews while Hawk {{did most of}} the talking. The team won its first title on August 3, 1965, when they defeated Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomuka to win the Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They also competed in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, where they became the inaugural NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Champions. They held the title belts four times between 1968 and 1971 while feuding with George Becker and Johnny Weaver. During that time, they also won the IWA World Tag Team Championship while competing in Tasmania. While in the Carolinas, Hanson and Hawk spent a lot <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> Ric Flair when Flair entered the wrestling business. Hawk stated that Flair used to cause trouble for the group, including one incident in which Flair flirted with the girlfriend of a Mafia member. Hanson and Hawk used their friendship with the Mafia member to help Flair escape from being killed in revenge.|$|E
5|$|In 1163 Henry {{returned}} to England, intent on reforming {{the role of}} the royal courts. He cracked down on crime, seizing the belongings of thieves and fugitives, and travelling justices were dispatched to the north and the Midlands. After 1166, Henry's exchequer court in Westminster, which had previously only heard cases connected with royal revenues, began to take wider civil cases on behalf of the king. The reforms continued and Henry created the General Eyre, probably in 1176, which involved dispatching a group of royal justices to visit all the counties in England over a given period <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> authority to cover both civil and criminal cases. Local juries were used occasionally in previous reigns, but Henry made much wider use of them. Juries were introduced in petty assizes from around 1176, where they were used to establish the answers to particular pre-established questions, and in grand assizes from 1179, where they were used to determine the guilt of a defendant. Other methods of trial continued, however, including trial by combat and trial by ordeal. After the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, royal justice was extended into new areas through the use of new forms of assizes, in particular novel disseisin, mort d'ancestor and dower unde nichil habet, which dealt with the wrongful dispossession of land, inheritance rights and the rights of widows respectively. In making these reforms Henry both challenged the traditional rights of barons in dispensing justice and reinforced key feudal principles, but over time they greatly increased royal power in England.|$|E

5|$|In early 1968, the Soviet Ministry of Defence {{decided to}} develop a {{specialised}} shturmovik armoured assault aircraft {{in order to provide}} close air support for the Soviet Ground Forces. The idea of creating a ground-support aircraft came about after analysing the experience of ground-attack (shturmovaya) aviation during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The Soviet fighter-bombers in service or under development at the time (Su-7, Su-17, MiG-21 and MiG-23) did not meet the requirements for close air support of the army. They lacked essential armour plating to protect the pilot and vital equipment from ground fire and missile hits, and their high flight speeds made it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual contact with a target. Having taken into account these problems, Pavel Sukhoi and a group of leading specialists in the Sukhoi Design Bureau started preliminary design work in a comparatively short period <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> the assistance of leading institutes of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{examiner}} Blythe (Wendy Hughes) {{leaves her}} visiting son Danny (Stivi Paskoski) {{with her boyfriend}} Bolander (Ned Beatty) for the day, with the hopes they will {{get to know each}} other better. Danny rides along with Bolander and Munch (Richard Belzer) on their murder investigations, but acts very wild and constantly asks inappropriate questions. At dinner later, Danny asks Bolander about his sex life with Danny's mother, making Bolander extremely uncomfortable. Bolander later tells Blythe he believes her son is crazy. Meanwhile, Crosetti (Jon Polito) spends a lot <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> his friend Officer Chris Thormann (Lee Tergesen), who is recovering from a recent shooting that has left him blind. At one point, Thormann defecates on himself and is humiliated, but Crosetti helps him clean up. Thormann's wife, Eva (Edie Falco), tells Crosetti she is pregnant, but that her husband reacted angrily to the news. Thormann tells Crosetti he should have died at the hospital and can never be a good father, but Crosetti encourages him.|$|E

5|$|The Wind Waker was {{released}} on December 13, 2002 in Japan, on March 24, 2003 in North America, and on May 2, 2003 in Europe. To promote the release, Nintendo offered a bonus disc as a pre-order incentive which included a GameCube port of Ocarina of Time {{as well as its}} previously unreleased expansion, Ura Zelda. Ura Zelda, largely an adaptation of Ocarina <b>of</b> <b>Time</b> <b>with</b> some changes, including new dungeon challenges, had been developed for the Nintendo 64's 64DD peripheral, but was shelved when that system failed. Ura Zelda was named Ocarina of Time Master Quest in North America and Europe. Ocarina of Time/Master Quest discs became popular items in their own right in North America, with some customers making and then cancelling preorders to get them. To avoid this issue in Europe, Nintendo released the item only in two-disc packages with The Wind Waker.|$|E

5|$|The game {{provides}} {{several options}} for players to face challenges. In addition to direct combat, the player can use plasmids to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the security systems and turrets. The player can hack {{into any of}} Rapture's automated systems; the hacking process is done via a mini-game similar to Pipe Mania where the player must connect two points {{on opposite sides of}} a grid with a limited set of piping within a fixed amount <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> failure to complete in time costing health and potentially sounding alarms. Early in the game, the player is given a research camera; by taking photographs of enemies, the player will cumulatively gain knowledge about the individual foes which translates into attack boosts and other benefits when facing that enemy type in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} in a detonation level is to plant and detonate explosive devices {{on a number}} of enemy positions, which can consist of anti-aircraft guns, tanks and armored cars.

In one variation of this game mode, one side has to defend their positions for a set amount <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> the destruction of each piece of equipment giving the enemy team more time. The defenders win if they can hold their positions long enough for the time to run out, while the attackers win when all objectives have been destroyed. In the alternate version, both teams must attack the other's objectives while defending their own. The first team to destroy all of the enemy's equipment wins.|$|E

In March the studio offered Trumbull virtual carte blanche {{if he could get}} the opticals work completed by December, the release date to which Paramount was financially committed (having accepted advances from exhibitors planning on a Christmas delivery). Trumbull was confident that he could get the work done without a loss of quality despite a reputation for missing deadlines because of his perfectionism. Paramount assigned a studio executive to Trumbull to make sure he would meet the release date, and together with Yuricich the effects team rushed to finish.

5|$|The {{resulting}} inundation {{caused by}} Vera's storm surge submerged {{areas around the}} periphery of the bay for extended periods <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> some low-lying areas remaining underwater in excess of four months. Due to the failure of multiple flood mitigation systems in quick succession, coupled with the narrow coverage of telecommunications exacerbated by Vera's strong winds, many persons in affected regions had very little time to evacuate. Nagoya {{was one of the worst}} impacted cities by Vera, and as a result of the storm surge and wind, its harbor was put out of service in under three hours. The effects of the typhoon's storm surge there were further worsened by the destruction of lumber yards in Nagoya Harbor, which set loose large quantities of logs that caused considerable damage to structures. The release of logs also hampered relief efforts following the typhoon's passage. Citywide, 50,000homes were severely damaged by flood waters, and 1,800other residences were washed away off of their foundations. Total damage to crops was estimated at US$30million. Rice crops sustained heavy impacts, with 150,000tons (135,000tonnes) of rice lost. In addition to the crop damage, US$2.5million worth of fruits and US$4million worth of vegetables were lost. The collapse of a single apartment home in the city buried 84people under debris; a similar incident in Naka, Ibaraki buried roughly 300people. Beach houses were destroyed, and large swaths of nearby cropland were heavily damaged. In addition to the storm surge, Nagoya experienced sustained winds of about 145km/h (90mph), with gusts reaching as high as 260km/h (160mph), downing power lines and causing power outage. Southeast of Nagoya, in Handa, Aichi, around 300people were killed after Vera's waves engulfed more than 250homes. Casualties throughout Aichi totaled 3,168 and roughly 59,000people were injured, based on an enumeration conducted in March1960.|$|E
