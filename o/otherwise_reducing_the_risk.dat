It's also becoming more common among businesses especially manufacturers to employ a supplier quality management software, which integrates all phases of the supply chain cycle.

40|$|Company A is {{thinking}} about launching a traditional tobacco product, perhaps a cigarette or a smokeless tobacco confection, with a new ingredient, ingredient level, or ingredient mix {{that in the past}} has never been sold. Company B contemplates putting on the market an innovative medication, medical device, or dietary supplement intended to help consumers to free themselves from physical dependence on tobacco products. Company C ponders the possibility of introducing a smoking product whose novelty derives from express or implied marketing claims that the product will decrease or perhaps even eliminate physical dependence on tobacco, or reduce other risks associated with smoking. What factors will each firm take into account in making the initial decision whether or not {{to go ahead with the}} new product, in preparing the product for market, in producing the product, in promoting the product, and in reacting to postmarketing events that might affect the product 2 ̆ 7 s fate? This article will focus on direct government intervention as it might influence the decisions that Company A would make in marketing a new tobacco product, and that Companies B and C would make in marketing new products intended to help consumers stop using tobacco products or <b>otherwise</b> <b>reduce</b> smoking-related <b>risks.</b> <b>The</b> hidden hand of the marketplace will influence these three producers in exactly the same way. Likewise, the same liability rules will apply generally to them. Direct government regulation, however, tends to be more product-specific, and places different burdens on manufacturers and sellers of different products. It also tends to be more detailed and hence more intrusive than indirect efforts to influence the conduct of manufacturers...|$|R

40|$|Objective 　To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} modest alcohol consumption and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of fatty liver disease (FLD) or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods 　PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Digital Journal Full-text Database, and database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP) till Nov. 2015 were searched for the studies in evaluating the effect of alcohol consumption on FLD or NAFLD. The quality assessment of included studies was performed according to the combined evaluation for cross-sectional studies and Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort studies. A meta-analysis was performed using Stata 12. 0 software. Results 　A total of 16 studies including 13 cross-sectional studies, 2 cross-sectional following longitudinal studies, and 1 cohort study with 76 967 participants were selected finally. The results of Meta-analysis were as follows. Minimal and light alcohol consumptions <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> for FLD or NAFLD by 17 % and 27 %, respectively, and moderate alcohol consumption was marginally associated with decreased risk for FLD or NAFLD. The results of subgroup analysis by gender showed that (1) Minimal and light alcohol consumptions <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD by 29 % and 33 %, respectively, but moderate alcohol consumption {{was not statistically significant}} in <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD in females compared with controls; (2) Light alcohol consumption <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD by 23 %, but minimal and moderate alcohol consumptions were not statistically significant in <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD in male compared with controls; (3) Light and moderate alcohol consumptions in Asian males <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD by 29. 7 % and 30. 3 %, respectively. Conclusions 　Modest alcohol consumptions may not increase <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD. Inversely, minimal and light alcohol consumptions in female <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD remarkably, and light to moderate alcohol consumption in males, especially in Asian males, can also significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of FLD or NAFLD.
