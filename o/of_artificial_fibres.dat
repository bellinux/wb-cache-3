50|$|Hand-spinning was {{a cottage}} {{industry}} in medieval Europe, where the wool spinners (often women and children) would provide enough yarn to service {{the needs of the}} men who operated the looms. This would occur in districts favourable to sheep husbandry. The introduction of the flying shuttle upset this balance. The subsequent invention of the spinning jenny water frame redressed the balance but required water power to operate the machinery, and the industry relocated to West Yorkshire where this was available. The British government was very protective of the technology and restricted its export. After World War I the colonies where the cotton was grown started to purchase and manufacture significant quantities of cotton spinning machinery.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the mathematics and modelling of the industrial crimper, {{perhaps one of the}} least well understood processes that occurs in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>fibre.</b> We begin by modelling the process by which the fibre is deformed as it is forced into the industrial crimper. This we investigate by presuming the fibre to behave as an ideal elastica confined in a two dimensional channel. We consider how the arrangement of the fibre changes as more fibre is introduced, and the forces that are required to confine it. Later, we apply the same methods to a fibre confined to a three dimensional channel. After the fibre has under gone a preliminary deformation, a second process known as secondary crimp can occur. This involves the `zig-zagged' material folding over. We model this process in two ways. First as a series of rigid rods joined by elastic hinges, and then as an elastic with a highly oscillatory natural configuration compressed by thrusts at each end. We observe that both models can be expressed in a very similar manner, and both predict that a buckle can occur from a nearly straight initial condition to an arched formation. We also compare the results to experiments performed on the crimped fibre. Throughout much of the process, the configuration of the fibre does not alter. This part of the process we call the block, and model the material in this region in two ways: as a series of springs; and as an isotropic elastic material. We discuss the coupling between the different regions and the process that occurs in the block, and consider both the steady state and stability of the system...|$|R

30|$|The {{necessity}} of sustainable, non-hazardous and cost effective {{materials in the}} construction industry is inevitable. Concrete being popularly used all over the world is characterised by low strength-strain capacity in tension, and low fracture toughness. To overcome the shortcomings of plain concrete (PC), the use of reinforcing fibre has been found very effective (Thakur et al. 2014; Balaguru and Shah 1992; Barr et al. 1996; Meddaha and Bencheikh 2009; Rizkalla and Hassan 2002). The fibres can insure the post-cracking resistance, high-energy absorption features and increased fatigue resistance of cement based composites (Savastano et al. 2009). Among two different types of fibres i.e., natural fibres and artificial polymer based fibres, natural fibres are promising to use as reinforcement to overcome the inherent deficiencies in FRCC reinforced with polymer based fibre (Ramakrishna and Sundararajan 2005). The main deficiencies associated with the use <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>fibres</b> are: relatively high cost, health and environmental hazards.|$|E

This hybrid system consists of a modified third-generation artificial grass with organic infill,on which natural grass was allowed to grow. A 11300 m 2 experimental pitch was constructed in Pisa(Italy) in the summer of 2007 and tested during 2007 - 2008 following football and rugby union play for an average of 8 - 9 h/week. The hybrid pitch showed a total absence of rubber odour,summer temperatures similar to those of natural-turf pitches,wear resistance superior to that of natural-turfpitches,abrasiveness similar to that of natural-turf pitches,and good infill particle size stability. Most playing-quality parameters fell within both the Fédération Internationale de Football Association(FIFA) Recom-mended 2 -Star Standard requirements for artificial turf and generally accepted playing-quality parameters for natural turf.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} paper presents an experimental investigation on the confinement strength and confinement modulus of concrete cylinders confined using {{different types of}} natural fibre composites and a comparative performance analysis with different artificial fibre based composite materials. The paper also highlights the need to switch over from the utilization <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>fibres,</b> which are non-renewable and fossil fuel products, to environmental beneficial materials like green fibres. The utilization of plant products like sisal and jute fibres and their composites in various structural engineering applications addresses the issues of sustainability and renewability with constructional materials. The paper describes a suitable mechanical treatment method like high temperature conditioning, which aids us in further improving the properties of these woven natural materials like sisal and jute for composite fabrication and utilization. Heat treated natural fibres of woven sisal and jute were utilized for confining concrete cylinders similar to CFRP and GFRP confinement and their confinement characteristics were obtained and compared. All the cylinders were subjected to monotonic axial compressive loads, so as to evaluate the effect of confinement on the axial load carrying capacity and all their failure modes were discussed thoroughly. The results indicated superior performance by sisal FRP as well as jute FRP confined cylinders as compared to controlled or unconfined cylinders, also sisal FRP wrapped cylinders displayed ultimate axial load of comparable magnitude to CFRP confinement. Natural FRP confinement displayed superior confinement modulus and confinement strength, also the ultimate axial load of concrete cylinders confined with natural FRPs underwent 66 % enhancement by sisal FRP and 48 % enhancement by jute FRP, in comparison with controlled or unconfined cylinders. Enhancement in axial load carrying capacity was 83 % with CFRP confinement and 180 % with GFRP confinement. Although natural FRP displayed lower enhancement in axial load carrying capacity in comparison with artificial FRP confinement, but enhanced load carrying capabilities alongside superior sustainability and environmental friendly indices could be obtained using the same, because of various advantages {{associated with the use}} of natural fibres...|$|E
