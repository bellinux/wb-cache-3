5|$|In chapter eleven, History, Wade {{demonstrates}} how genetics {{can be related}} to recorded history. An example given is the substantial genetic legacy of Genghis Khan and his male relatives. History correlates with this, as writers of the period stated that he had hundreds <b>of</b> <b>wives.</b> Wade then covers the origins of the British; contrary to popular belief, he writes, neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the Vikings eradicated the indigenous population, as the Y chromosomes common to Celtic speakers are carried by {{a large percentage of the}} male population of Britain. Markers in these Y chromosomes can be linked to the Basques, and he suggests that the British and Irish descend from a refuge in Spain they shared during the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E
5|$|In 996 {{when her}} father was posted to a {{four-year}} governorship in Echizen Province, Murasaki went with him, although it was uncommon for a noblewoman of the period to travel such a distance on a trip that could {{take as long as}} five days. She returned to Kyoto, probably in 998, to marry her father's friend Fujiwara no Nobutaka (c. 950 – c. 1001), a much older second cousin. Descended from the same branch of the Fujiwara clan, he was a court functionary and bureaucrat at the Ministry of Ceremonials, with a reputation for dressing extravagantly and as a talented dancer. In his late forties {{at the time of their}} marriage, he had multiple households with an unknown number <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> and offspring. Gregarious and well known at court, he was involved in numerous romantic relationships that may have continued after his marriage to Murasaki. As was customary, she would have remained in her father's household where her husband would have visited her. Nobutaka had been granted more than one governorship, and by the time of his marriage to Murasaki he was probably quite wealthy. Accounts of their marriage vary: Richard Bowring writes that the marriage was happy, but Japanese literature scholar Haruo Shirane sees indications in her poems that she resented her husband.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe {{division}} tracks down {{a series}} of deaths <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> shortly after the passing of their respective husbands. Discovering traces of the husbands' DNA on {{the bodies of the}} wives, Walter Bishop (John Noble) suspects that the killer is using pheromones taken from the husbands to get close to the wives, using the substances as a perfume. Further identifying castoreum within the pheromone mix, they identify the murderer as Anson Carr (Michael Massee), a former and disgruntled employee of a perfume company inflicted with a rare skin disease. They arrive at Carr's home to find another husband, already dead, in a dehydration chamber, and race to protect his wife, Dianna (Ona Grauer). When no attack comes at the wife, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) realizes that her husband may have been having an affair, and races to the mistress' home, stopping Carr before he can kill her. As he is taken away, he admits he was trying to discover what love was, scientifically, so that he could reproduce it and allow the entire world to share in it.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{viewed the}} {{tradition}} <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> abandoning their own surname {{to assume that}} of their husbands {{as a manifestation of}} the legal annihilation of a married woman’s identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as “Lucy Stone” or “Lucy Stone – only.” But during the summer, Blackwell tried to register the deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as “Lucy Stone Blackwell.” The couple consulted Blackwell’s friend, Salmon P. Chase, a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately able to answer their question about the legality of her name. So while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in private correspondence, for eight months she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents and allowed herself to be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone. In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she {{would not be allowed to}} vote unless she added “Blackwell” to her signature. This she refused to do, and because her time and energy were consumed with suffrage work, she did not challenge the action in a court of law.|$|E
5|$|The subject came {{up again}} in 1930, during the Conference on Codification of International Law, held in The Hague. A strong {{contingent}} of women from America joined international women's groups to change the existing nationality laws, but the women were unable to agree on wording. Intense lobbying by women, and a massive parade demonstration, failed to influence the conferees, and the international law continued to hold that a woman's nationality followed her husband's. In response, Macmillan organised an International Committee for Action on the Nationality of Married Women early the next year. Six {{of the most influential}} international women's groups sought a broad base of support from working women. Macmillan's stated goal was to delay ratification of the Hague Convention, and to make certain that a woman's nationality would not change without her consent, and that the nationality of a couple's children would not be more influenced by the father's nationality. The new committee was successful in lobbying the League of Nations to address the problem, but when the League constituted a study group, that group was split between two intractable factions. On one side were those who wanted a married couple to have exactly one nationality, based on that of the husband, {{and on the other side}} were those like Macmillan who favoured independent citizenship between spouses, with the possibility <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> having different citizenship than their husbands, and children to be allowed dual citizenship. In 1932, the women's group, at an impasse, were pushed aside as ineffectual by the League of Nations, who decided in favour of ratifying the Hague Convention. The women's group disbanded, and the Hague convention was ratified in 1937.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the factors associated with the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>wife</b> beating among currently married men and women living in disadvantaged Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan. The study uses data from a cross-sectional survey of 3, 100 households from 12 refugee camps, conducted in 1999, with a sub-sample of 395 married women and men selected for this analysis. Associations between acceptance <b>of</b> <b>wife</b> beating and experience of abuse as well as other risk factors are assessed for men and women separately, using χ 2 tests and odds ratios from binary logistic regression models. The majority of men (60. 1 %) and women (61. 8 %) believe that wife beating is justified in at least one of the eight hypothetical marital situations presented to them. Among women, those that had been victims of intimate partner violence are significantly more likely to report acceptance <b>of</b> <b>wife</b> beating. Among men, acceptance <b>of</b> <b>wife</b> beating is also significantly associated with their current age, labor force participation, their view on women’s autonomy, and their own history as perpetrators of IPV. The majority <b>of</b> respondents justify <b>wife</b> beating in this context, with essentially no difference between men and women. Accep-tance <b>of</b> <b>wife</b> beating by both men and women was strongly associated with previous experiences <b>of</b> <b>wife</b> beating adjust-ing for other risk factors...|$|R
25|$|Women's {{rights were}} {{protected}} already by early Medieval Christian Church: {{one of the}} first formal legal provision for the right <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> was promulgated by council of Adge in 506, which in Canon XVI stipulated that if a young married man wished to be ordained, he required the consent of his wife.|$|E
25|$|These {{scholars}} {{felt that}} adherence to monogamy would minimise {{the risk of}} oppression because the requirement of meting out justice amongst a plurality <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> would be immensely challenging for any man. Therefore, they opined that it is preferable to avoid polygyny altogether, so one does not even come near the chance of committing the forbidden deed of dealing unjustly between the wives.|$|E

25|$|Weber {{suggests}} that just like Shiva {{is a combination}} of various Vedic gods Rudra and Agni, Parvati in Puranas text is a combination <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> of Rudra and Agni. In other words, the symbolism, legends and characteristics of Parvati evolved over time fusing Uma, Haimavati, Ambika in one aspect and the more ferocious, destructive Kali, Gauri, Nirriti in another aspect. Tate suggests Parvati is a mixture of the Vedic goddesses Aditi and Nirriti, and being a mountain goddess herself, was associated with other mountain goddesses like Durga and Kali in later traditions.|$|E

25|$|Christians {{regarded}} the emperor {{as a mere}} man who was as much under God's authority as were his subjects, and Christian values favored the social emancipation of women and children.

25|$|In the Anguttara Nikaya (5:33), Buddha tells future wives {{that they}} should be obedient to their husbands, please them, and not make them angry through their own desires. Furthermore, the Buddha offers advice to married women in the Anguttara Nikaya (7:59; IV 91-94), from the Pali (Theravada) canon, where he tells of seven types of wives—the first three types are destined for unhappiness, while the last four, as they are imbued with long term self-control, are destined to be happy. These latter wives are characterised as caretakers (motherly-wife), companions (friend-wife) and submissives (sister-wife and slave-wife)—the Buddha thus {{endorsed}} a variety of types <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> within marriage.|$|E
