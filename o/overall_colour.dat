5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's <b>overall</b> <b>colour</b> polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E
5|$|The fungus grows {{predominantly}} in coniferous forests, forming symbiotic ectomycorrhizal {{associations with}} living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. The fungus produces spore-bearing fruit bodies above ground {{in summer and}} autumn. The large, edible fruiting bodies known as mushrooms appear under pine trees, generally in summer and autumn. It has a matte brown to maroon-coloured cap and its stem is often large and swollen, and the <b>overall</b> <b>colour</b> may have an orange-red tinge. As with other boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body is variable.|$|E
5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow (Zavattariornis stresemanni), {{also known}} as Abyssinian pie, bush crow, Ethiopian bushcrow, or by its generic name Zavattariornis, is a rather starling-like bird, which is {{currently}} thought to be member of the crow family, Corvidae, though this is uncertain. It is slightly larger than the North American blue jay and is a bluish-grey in <b>overall</b> <b>colour</b> which becomes almost white on the forehead. The throat and chest are creamy-white with the tail and wings a glossy black. The black feathers {{have a tendency to}} bleach to brown at their tips. The iris of the bird is brown and the eye is surrounded by a band of naked bright blue skin. The bill, legs, and feet are black.|$|E

2500|$|Pill millipedes can be {{distinguished}} from woodlice {{on the basis of}} having two pairs of legs per body segment instead of one pair like all isopods. Pill millipedes have twelve to thirteen body segments and about eighteen pairs of legs, whereas woodlice have eleven segments and only seven pairs of legs. [...] In addition, pill millipedes are smoother, and resemble normal millipedes in <b>overall</b> <b>colouring</b> and the shape of the segments.|$|R
50|$|The frogs are {{medium-sized}} {{and males}} sometimes bear a distinctive bright green stripe {{down the length}} of the backbone. Otherwise males are green to light brown in <b>overall</b> <b>colouring</b> with large black or dark brown spots. Females are olive green or light brown in colour and also bear brown or black large spots. As befits a species that prefers wetland habitats, the webbing on the feet extends to the tips of the toes.|$|R
5|$|The fruiting {{body has}} a convex-shaped cap, at first small in {{relation}} to its stipe, expanding in volume as it matures. The skin of the cap is dry, matte and can be coloured from maroon to chocolate brown with a reddish tint. These characteristics distinguish it visually from relatives such as Boletus edulis, Boletus reticulatus and Boletus aereus. The young, immature cap may have a pale pink colour and a white, powdery flush. Measuring 410cm (1.64 in) tall by 38 (1.22.2in) cm wide, the bulbous stipe is often large, swollen and imposing, bearing a network. The <b>overall</b> <b>colour</b> may have an orange-red tinge which is more obvious in the lowest parts, although this is also common in other species. As with all boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body can be very variable. The cap diameter can be as much as 30cm (12in) and stem height 15cm (6in).|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} visible {{difference}} between the sexes {{in most of the}} family, although in several species the iris is red in the males and brown-red in the females, and in species with tail-streamers these may be slightly longer in males. Both the European and red-bearded bee-eaters have sex-based differences in their plumage colour, and the female rainbow bee-eater has shorter tail streamers than the male, which terminate in a club-shape that he lacks. There may be instances where bee-eaters are sexually dichromatic at the ultraviolet part of the colour spectrum, which humans cannot see. A study of blue-tailed bee-eater found that males were more colourful than females in UV light. Their <b>overall</b> <b>colour</b> was also affected by body condition, suggesting that there was a signalling component to plumage colour. Juveniles are generally similar to adults, except for the two Nyctyornis species, in which the young have mainly green plumage.|$|E
25|$|Chromatophores {{that contain}} {{large amounts of}} yellow pteridine {{pigments}} are named xanthophores; those with mainly red/orange carotenoids are termed erythrophores. However, vesicles containing pteridine and carotenoids are sometimes found in the same cell, {{in which case the}} <b>overall</b> <b>colour</b> depends on the ratio of red and yellow pigments. Therefore, the distinction between these chromatophore types is not always clear.|$|E
25|$|Until 1998 the diesels were an <b>overall</b> mid-green <b>colour.</b> It {{was decided}} that the warning colour on the {{coupling}} section would be striped red and white; with the crank axles an <b>overall</b> red <b>colour.</b> The diesels' colouring was later changed: Yeti, for example, adopted a red livery, and George a purple one. The warning colours also changed several times until around 2004, when all the diesels again received a green livery, with yellow and black warning colours.|$|R
50|$|Erythristic Erythristic {{individuals}} {{present with}} heightened red pigment in the skin. This causes all other pigments to appear muted. These snakes have an <b>overall</b> red <b>colour.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tail {{feathers}} {{are relatively}} long and graduated and the legs are relatively short. The <b>overall</b> <b>colouring</b> {{of the adult}} bird is black with randomly bleached wing and tail feathers. A large region around the eye is quite bare of feathering and shows pinkish-white skin with the eyes a bluish-white. The bill is unusual too in being very variable, bluish on upper mandible and pinkish-white on the lower in some specimens, while on others the whole bill is pinkish white with a darker tip. The forward pointing nasal bristles so often prominent in other Corvus species are very reduced also.|$|R
25|$|The oriental trumpeter whiting, Sillago aeolus, is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} species of benthic inshore fish in the smelt-whiting family. The species ranges from east Africa to Japan, inhabiting much if the southern Asian and Indonesian coastlines. Its morphology {{is very similar to}} other species within the genus Sillago, with a long, compressed body and silvery <b>overall</b> <b>colour.</b> It can be distinguished from its relatives by colour patterns and particularly swim bladder morphology, which helps define most species of Sillago. S aeolus is a benthic predator, consuming a variety of crustaceans and polychaetes. As with most members of the smelt whiting family, it is important to small coastal fisheries in various areas of its range.|$|E
500|$|The russet sparrow {{is a small}} chunky bird, with plumage warm rufous in <b>overall</b> <b>colour.</b> It is a {{medium-sized}} sparrow at [...] and [...] It has a thick bill suited to eating seeds, which is black on the breeding male, horn-coloured on the non-breeding male, and yellowish with a dark tip on the female.

500|$|Flowering is in autumn, or {{in winter}} in cooler areas; the inflorescences are flower spikes [...] high and [...] broad or so. Each {{individual}} flower {{consists of a}} tubular perianth made up of four fused tepals, and one long wiry style. Characteristic of the taxonomic section {{in which it is}} placed, the styles are hooked rather than straight. The styles' ends are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at anthesis, when the flowers open. The spikes are red or gold in <b>overall</b> <b>colour,</b> with styles golden, orange, orange-red or burgundy. Some unusual forms have striking red styles on a whitish perianth. Very occasionally, forms with all yellow inflorescences are seen. Though not terminal, the flower spikes are fairly prominently displayed emerging from the foliage; they arise from two- to three-year-old nodes.|$|E
50|$|Pogonatum urnigerum is {{a species}} of moss in the family Polytrichaceae, {{commonly}} called urn haircap. It {{can be found on}} gravelly banks and similar habitats and can be identified by the blue tinge to the <b>overall</b> green <b>colour.</b>|$|R

500|$|Eggs are {{elongated}} ovals, with a {{fine texture}} and a slight gloss. They are whitish in <b>overall</b> <b>colour</b> with a grey tinge and brown spots, streaks, or blotches. The average size of the egg is 19.2×14.2millimetres (0.75×0.55in). Eggs {{are similar to those}} of the Eurasian tree sparrow, differing in a duller colour and more narrow shape, though they cannot be separated from those of the other sparrows with certainty. Two clutches of four or sometimes five or six eggs are laid in a year. In Hokkaidō, clutches are laid between early May and early July, with two peaks in laying around mid May and late June. Both sexes incubate and feed the young, with the male often being more active in feeding the nestlings. In Hokkaidō, nestlings hatch weighing about , and fledge fourteen or fifteen days after hatching, weighing [...] The common cuckoo has been recorded in old literature as a brood parasite of the russet sparrow.|$|E
500|$|The {{southern}} boobook {{has generally}} dark brown head and upperparts, with white markings on the scapulars and {{spots on the}} wings. Its head lacks tufts common in other owls, and has a paler facial disk, with a white supercilium (eyebrow) and dark brown ear coverts and cheeks. The brown feathers of the upper forehead, above the supercilium, and sides of the neck have yellow-brown highlights. The feathers of the lores, chin and throat are white with black shafts. The feathers of the underparts are mostly brown with white spots and dark blue-grey bases. The upper tail is dark brown with lighter brown bars and [...] a grey fringe at the end, while the undertail is a lighter grey-brown. The female {{tends to be more}} prominently streaked than the male overall, though this is inconsistent and there is wide variation. The eyes have been described as grey-green, green-yellow, or even light hazel. The bill is black with a pale blue-grey base and cere. The feet are greyish to pinkish brown with dark grey to blackish claws. The underparts are pale, ranging from buff to cream, and are streaked with brown. The <b>overall</b> <b>colour</b> is variable and does not appear to correspond to subspecies or region. In northern and central Australia, Mayr found that the colour of the plumage appears to correlate with the rainfall or humidity, paler birds being found in three disjunct areas, each around [...] away from the other two: the western Kimberley and Pilbara, Sedan on the Cloncurry River, and around Ooldea, with darker birds found on Cape York and Melville Island.|$|E
2500|$|Growth on Czapek Yeast Extract Agar (CYA) and Malt Extract Agar (MEA) {{produces}} colonies {{at least}} 50mm in diameter, often spreading across the petri dish. The mycelium appear colourless with an <b>overall</b> <b>colour</b> of pale to deep grey from the sporangia. Growth on G25N medium produces colonies 20–35mm in diameter, which appear white to pale yellow brown. [...] Mucor plumbeus spores are commonly airborne, which could explain their vast distribution. Chlamydospores have at times been found within sporangiophores.|$|E
5000|$|The {{buff weka}} (Gallirallus australis hectori) {{formerly}} inhabited the eastern districts of the South Island {{but is now}} confined to Chatham Island and Pitt Island to which it {{was introduced in the}} early 1900s, and where they are widely hunted and eaten, being considered 'introduced'. Reintroduction into Canterbury has been unsuccessful so far but introductions to Mao Waho Island (in Lake Wanaka in 2004) and from there to Pigeon and Pig Island (in Lake Wakatipu in 2005/2006) have been much more successful. It has a lighter <b>overall</b> <b>colouring</b> than the other subspecies. The North Island weka (Gallirallus australis greyi) [...] is represented by original populations in Northland and Poverty Bay, and by liberations elsewhere from that stock. This subspecies differs in its greyer underparts, and brown rather than reddish coloured legs.|$|R

50|$|The <b>overall</b> <b>colour</b> {{of adult}} insects {{is a mixture}} of light beige and brown. They have seven brown {{transversal}} bands on the elytra, justifying the species name septemfasciata. The pronotum has two brown lateral bands.|$|E
50|$|The {{alternate}} (breeding) plumage of the Horned Grebe has bright erectable “horns”, black fan-shaped cheek {{feathers and}} an <b>overall</b> red-and-black <b>colour.</b> The neck, flanks, lores and upper-chest are chestnut brown, while the crown and back are black. The belly is a dull white. Males are slightly larger and brighter than females but are generally indistinguishable.|$|R
50|$|In size it is {{a little}} smaller and slimmer than the European magpie (Pica pica) though the bill is {{relatively}} thicker. The <b>overall</b> <b>colouring</b> of the bird is black with the feathers quite silky in texture and having a purplish gloss in good light. The base of the tail tends to be more brown in colour {{than the rest of the}} body. The nasal plumes are somewhat upturned on top of the bill but fully cover the nostrils. The bill itself is black in the adult but partly reddish-pink towards the base in juvenile specimens. The bird's legs and feet are black and the iris is variable, but tends towards violet, purple or mauve with a bluish-purple outer ring. The voice is usually described as a shrill squeaking often with the jackdaw-like overtones. There is also a croaking alarm call given in anger where the head bobs.|$|R
50|$|The adult {{grows up}} to 100 mm in length, with an <b>overall</b> dorsal <b>colour</b> of green with {{scattered}} white spots. The underbelly is white with legs and digits of orange.
