She has stated that the transition was difficult for her due to the great depth of goalkeepers already with the {{national team}}, noting she <b>often</b> <b>took</b> the back seat to more experienced players, which affected her confidence.|$|E
5|$|Common {{and often}} basic {{ingredients}} in many modern European cuisines like potatoes, kidney beans, cacao, vanilla, tomatoes, chili peppers and maize {{were not available}} to Europeans until after 1492, after European contact with the Americas, and even then it <b>often</b> <b>took</b> considerable time, sometimes several centuries, for the new foodstuffs {{to be accepted by}} society at large.|$|E
5|$|Freeborn Roman {{women were}} {{considered}} citizens throughout the Republic and Empire, {{but did not}} vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, {{as indicated by the}} phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos ("children born of two Roman citizens"). A Roman woman kept her own family name (nomen) for life. Children most <b>often</b> <b>took</b> the father's name, but in the Imperial period sometimes made their mother's name part of theirs, or even used it instead.|$|E

5|$|Ingres was self-critical and {{consumed}} by self-doubt. He <b>often</b> <b>took</b> months {{to complete a}} portrait, leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding a pose to best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive, three are signed and dated. Ingres was a master draftsman and the sketches, if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. The sketches are exemplary in their handling of line and form, and similar in size.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{was born}} at the University of Chicago Hospital on December 18, 1949, to Thomas and Alice Johnston. They {{originally}} lived in Hometown, Illinois, but moved to Oak Lawn shortly after Johnston's birth. Johnston grew up with one sister. His father worked as an engineer at a local company and his mother as a newspaper editor. Johnston <b>often</b> <b>took</b> photographs for his mother's newspaper and contributed articles to his school's newspaper. He never married.|$|E
5|$|Kerr's first {{marriage}} was to Squadron Leader Anthony Bartley RAF on 29 November 1945. They had two daughters, Melanie Jane (born 27 December 1947) and Francesca Ann (born 20 December 1951 and subsequently {{married to the}} actor John Shrapnel). The marriage was troubled, owing to Bartley's jealousy of his wife's fame and financial success, and because her career <b>often</b> <b>took</b> her away from home. They divorced in 1959.|$|E

5|$|Prolific and versatile, Ruisdael {{depicted}} {{a wide variety}} of landscape subjects. From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes of remarkable quality for a young man. After a trip to Germany in 1650, his landscapes took on a more heroic character. In his late work, conducted when he lived and worked in Amsterdam, he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire. In these, the sky <b>often</b> <b>took</b> up two-thirds of the canvas. In total he produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls.|$|E
5|$|Smith <b>often</b> <b>took</b> Lennon and {{his cousins}} {{to the cinema}} or the park, even though he worked at night and {{early in the morning}} on the farm and his milk round. When the cousins played outside Smith allowed them to eat meals with their hands in the garden shed. During the school {{holidays}} Lennon and his cousins were allowed to accompany Smith on his milk rounds, and every year he allowed Lennon to place a bet on the Grand National.|$|E
5|$|The {{judicial}} system in Belarus lacks independence and {{is subject to}} political interference. Corrupt practices such as bribery <b>often</b> <b>took</b> place during tender processes, and whistleblower protection and national ombudsman are lacking in Belarus's anti-corruption system. However, there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government, {{and the government has}} made some progress in combating corruption, such as minimizing tax regulations in order to improve transparency in the tax office.|$|E
50|$|The brownback {{trevally}} is {{of minor}} importance to fisheries throughout its range, <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> as bycatch in various trawling and hook and line operations. It is generally not distinguished from other trevally species, and no catch statistics are reported. It is also <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> by small artisanal fisheries by various inshore fish traps.|$|R

5|$|Vainio {{was fond}} {{of the sea and}} sailing. He <b>often</b> <b>took</b> his family and friends sailing in his boat, and in 1987 bought an island in Österskär with his wife Pirkko. His love for sailing is evident in the song Kaikki paitsi purjehdus on turhaa ("Everything But Sailing Is Pointless"), which was {{composed}} by Lasse Mårtenson.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins and {{his mother}} were very close, and her 1983 Alzheimer's disease {{diagnosis}} {{may have contributed to}} his drug problems. He was devastated that she {{would not be able to}} enjoy his success in the major leagues. In the last few years of Wiggins' life, he enjoyed a closer relationship with his father, Albert, and he <b>often</b> <b>took</b> his children on visits to see their grandfather. Wiggins had a very difficult time with his father's death in May 1990.|$|E
5|$|According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the Bishop of Rochester {{was given}} land valued at 17s 4d in Aylesford, Kent, in {{compensation}} for land {{that became the}} site of Rochester Castle. Of the 48castles mentioned in the survey, Rochester {{is the only one}} for which property-owners were reimbursed when their land was taken to build the castle. From the 11thcentury the castle-guard was a feudal obligation in England. This <b>often</b> <b>took</b> the form of knights garrisoning castles for their lords for a set period. There is no comprehensive list of which castles were owed service in this form, but military historian Cathcart King notes that they seem to have been predominantly high-status castles. Rochester's castle-guard consisted of 60knights' fees, marking it as a particularly important fortification.|$|E

5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing <b>often</b> <b>took</b> the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E
5|$|Beiderbecke's cornet {{style is}} often {{described}} by contrasting it with Armstrong's markedly different approach. Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument, and his solos <b>often</b> <b>took</b> advantage of that fact. Beiderbecke was largely, although not completely, self-taught, and the constraints imposed by that fact were evident in his music. While Armstrong often soared into the upper register, Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range, more interested in exploring the melody and harmonies than in dazzling the audience. Armstrong often emphasized the performance aspect of his playing, while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing, uninterested in personally engaging his listeners. Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues, while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow jazzmen.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{was brought}} up in Dartmouth Park Road. His cultured mother exposed her family to art, music and poetry, and young Carte studied the violin and then the flute at an early age. The family spoke French at home two days a week, and his parents <b>often</b> <b>took</b> their {{children}} to the theatre. He was educated at University College School, which he left in 1860. In 1861, he achieved First Class level in the matriculation examination and then attended University College, London. However, he left later that year to work in his father's business, along with his brother, Henry. He studied music during this time and composed some pieces, which he dedicated to the actress Kate Terry. He also acted in amateur theatricals.|$|E

5|$|From 1986 to 1994, Romney {{presided over}} the Boston Stake, which {{included}} {{more than a dozen}} wards in eastern Massachusetts and almost 4,000church members. He organized a team to handle financial and management issues, sought to counter anti-Mormon sentiments, and tried to solve social problems among poor Southeast Asian converts. An unpaid position, his local church leadership <b>often</b> <b>took</b> 30 or more hours a week of his time, and he became known for his considerable energy in the role. He also earned a reputation for avoiding any overnight travel that might interfere with his church responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1823 Hogg met Jane Williams {{while they}} were both visiting Percy Shelley's friend John Gisborne, husband of Maria Gisborne. Jane and her common-law husband Edward Ellerker Williams had been housemates of Shelley's shortly before his death. Edward Williams and Shelley died in a boating accident, leaving Jane alone with two young children. Hogg soon became very enamoured with her. They saw {{each other at the}} Gisborne {{household}} regularly during the autumn and early winter of 1823. That December he went back to Northern England to see his family. While he was there, he began writing to Jane regularly. The following spring he frequently visited her at her mother's house, and they <b>often</b> <b>took</b> long walks together. In March she moved out of her mother's house into a home of her own, allowing Hogg to see her more freely.|$|E
5|$|Lyrical poets <b>often</b> <b>took</b> their {{subjects}} from myth, but their treatment became gradually less narrative and more allusive. Greek lyric poets, including Pindar, Bacchylides and Simonides, and bucolic poets such as Theocritus and Bion, relate individual mythological incidents. Additionally, myth {{was central to}} classical Athenian drama. The tragic playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides took most of their plots from myths {{of the age of}} heroes and the Trojan War. Many of the great tragic stories (e.g. Agamemnon and his children, Oedipus, Jason, Medea, etc.) took on their classic form in these tragedies. The comic playwright Aristophanes also used myths, in The Birds and The Frogs.|$|E
