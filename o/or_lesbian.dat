A notable author writing science fiction published by lesbian presses is Katherine V. Forrest.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender. A 2016 Gallup poll also concluded that 4.1% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%. In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as gay <b>or</b> <b>lesbian,</b> and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.|$|E
5|$|Argentina was {{the first}} Latin American country with a gay rights group, Nuestro Mundo (NM, or Our World), created in 1969. Six mostly secret {{organizations}} concentrating on gay <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> issues were founded around this time, but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the Dirty War. Lesbian rights groups have gradually formed since 1986 to build a cohesive community that works to overcome philosophical differences with heterosexual women.|$|E

5|$|Some {{women were}} able {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual <b>or</b> <b>lesbian,</b> and also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E
5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts. In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women. Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams). Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly gay <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.|$|E

50|$|I am awfully {{disappointed}} that the John Birch Society has gotten into the thing. Of course, it's an emotional issue. It has absolutely {{nothing at all to}} do with homosexual marriages <b>or</b> <b>lesbians</b> <b>or</b> abortion. ERA is exactly what it says it is. It's ridiculous after 200 years that women are still second class citizens. No -- black men were allowed to vote fifty years before women could vote. As long there is still some statutes that say {{there are certain things that}} a woman can not do, we are still second class citizens.|$|R
50|$|For {{both men}} and women, the {{percentage}} of bisexual people who have experienced domestic violence is higher than either gay men <b>or</b> <b>lesbians.</b> The high rate of domestic violence faced by bisexual people may be {{in part because of}} the specific challenges bisexual people face in receiving help, as bisexuality is often misunderstood, even by those who administer domestic violence help professionally.|$|R
5|$|From the 1980s onwards, {{homosexuality}} gained {{much wider}} mainstream acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues {{relevant to the}} LGBT community. This development was helped by {{the growing number of}} openly gay <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.|$|E

5000|$|The National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., {{the second}} largest Baptist church {{globally}} and predominantly African-American, holds no official view on homosexuality, leaving this issue to individual congregations.

5000|$|... 'His first {{television}} film, Rainy Day Women (BBC, tx. 10 April 1984), directed by Ben Bolt for producer Michael Wearing, {{was set in}} rural England during {{the early days of}} the Second World War. Here, a detachment of the local Home Guard are at war with a forceful farm widow and her land girls, the latter group suspected of being German sympathisers <b>or</b> <b>lesbians,</b> <b>or</b> even of witchcraft. The imaginative effect to which Pirie put his script in establishing an atmosphere of strangeness - suppressed hate and passion, parochial paranoia - remains the most striking thing about the film.|$|R
25|$|Linguistic {{profiling}} {{also applies}} to gender and sexual orientation. Munson conducted a study in which naïve listeners were asked to distinguish between heterosexual male and female speakers, and gay male and bisexual <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> female speakers. He found that listeners tended to classify male and female speakers by masculinity and femininity, respectively; male speakers were perceived as gay if they sounded less masculine, while female speakers were identified as bisexual <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> if they sounded less feminine.|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{out against}} homophobia, Radcliffe began filming public service {{announcements}} in 2009 for The Trevor Project, promoting awareness of gay teen suicide prevention. He first learned of the organisation while working on Equus on Broadway in 2008 and has contributed financially to it. [...] "I have always hated anybody who is not tolerant of gay men <b>or</b> <b>lesbians</b> <b>or</b> bisexuals. Now I am in the very fortunate position where I can actually help or do something about it," [...] {{he said in a}} 2010 interview. In the same interview, he spoke of the importance of public figures advocating for equal rights. Radcliffe received The Trevor Project's Hero Award in 2011 for his contributions.|$|R
40|$|Despite recent strides toward equality, {{labor markets}} are often {{stratified}} on gender and racial grounds. Using Canadian Census data, Sean Waite and Nicole Denier find that these wage gaps extend to sexual minorities; even when employed in lucrative occupations, {{gay men and}} lesbians earn significantly less than straight men. They also find that while straight women’s pay is penalised, the presence of children and marriage have no effect on the earnings of either gay men <b>or</b> <b>lesbians</b> in conjugal relationships...|$|R

5000|$|Al Sharpton, a Baptist {{minister}} and Civil rights leader, {{during his campaign}} for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 said that asking whether gays <b>or</b> <b>lesbians</b> {{should be able to}} get married was insulting: [...] "That's like saying you give blacks, or whites, or Latinos the right to shack up - but not get married ... It's like asking 'do I support black marriage or white marriage'[...] [...] [...] The inference of the question is that gays are not like other human beings".|$|R

2500|$|Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, {{claimed the}} Pope had not wished {{specifically}} to attack people with homosexual inclinations, {{and had not}} mentioned gays <b>or</b> <b>lesbians</b> in his text. Father Lombardi insisted, however, {{that there had been}} an overreaction to the Pope's remarks: [...] "He was speaking more generally about gender theories which overlook the fundamental difference in creation between men and women and focus instead on cultural conditioning." [...] Nevertheless, the remarks were interpreted as a call to save mankind from homosexuals and transsexuals.|$|R
25|$|According to her {{authorized}} biography {{published in}} 2005, Halonen {{is critical of}} some unnamed members of the Finnish civil service for being gay <b>or</b> <b>lesbian</b> and not coming out and campaigning for sexual equality.
