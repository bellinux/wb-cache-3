5|$|The Witches, 2013, by Martin Wallace, {{published}} by Treefrog Games. This {{is a game}} aimed at younger or more family oriented players. They must move around the town of Lancre and its surrounds, dealing with 'problems' ranging from a sick pig, to an invasion by vampires. Each player has a one-use special power. It is a semi-cooperative game, in that all players can lose if the game wins, but if they resolve all the problems, then <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> win.|$|E

He just says that he and Birmingham can't get along, and that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> cease to be a Nap. As he has no authority to oust the manager, he solves the perplexing problem by quitting himself.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} {{have all been}} slightly altered from the original story in the novel. The plot itself is not a direct adaptation but instead focuses on the individual characters' psycho-dramas which are the scenarios {{that make up the}} game. Notably, none of the characters interact with one another and eventually only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> be able to defeat AM.|$|E

25|$|Each voter is {{entitled}} to one vote each {{for the duration of}} the election. The voter may split his or her ticket. The candidate with the most votes wins the position; there is no run-off election, and the president and vice president may come from different parties.

25|$|Atlantika - Atlantika is a Philippine fantasy-drama series {{produced}} by GMA Network about the fictional undersea kingdom of Atlantika. Atlantika opens with {{the tale of}} three lovers: Haring Agat (Gardo Versoza), Reyna Celebes (Jean García) and Barracud (Ariel Rivera). Their love triangle sparks a war that divides the underwater domain and pushes Barracud to the dark side. Aquano the Senturyon (Dingdong Dantes) must fulfill his duty of saving Atlantika by searching for the two lost princesses of the kingdom. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> be the woman destined for him (Ruana) while the other must be defeated before she destroys Atlantika itself (Amaya). With four princess-possible candidates to choose from; Cielo (Iza Calzado), Alona (Isabel Oli), Helena (Katrina Halili) and Elisa (Valerie Concepcion), Aquano asks {{the help of the}} most skillful Senturyon in Atlantika, Camaro (Rudy Fernandez), to train him for the fight of his life.|$|E

500|$|Previous Mega Man games {{typically}} {{allowed the}} player {{to call on}} the transformable dog Rush or use other support items in order to traverse difficult or otherwise inaccessible parts of a stage. Mega Man 6 instead features a pair of [...] "Rush Adaptors" [...] that fuse Mega Man and Rush into special forms. The first, [...] "Jet Mega Man", lets the player fly upward or hover {{for a brief period}} of time, but prevents the use of charge shots. The second, [...] "Power Mega Man", utilizes a powerful, short-range punch attack for destroying large blocks. The player cannot slide when using either adapter. Mega Man 6 also presents less linear ways to complete the stages than in previous entries in the series. There are two pathways in many of the stages that lead to boss rooms, but the player is often required to use one of the Rush adaptors to begin an alternate route. Although either one will clear the stage, only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> give the player a letter circuit board for assembling the helper bird Beat. Collecting all four parts will allow the player to call on Beat to attack enemies.|$|E

500|$|While out fishing, Homer is {{abducted}} {{by the two}} aliens, Kang and Kodos. When they demand that Homer point them towards Earth's leader, Homer informs them of the upcoming presidential election and says the winner could be either Bill Clinton or Bob Dole. Kang and Kodos kidnap both Dole and Clinton, placing them in suspended animation tubes and assuming their forms through [...] "bio-duplication" [...] to ensure that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> become the next leader. Before returning Homer to Earth, the aliens soak him in rum, so nobody will believe him. As the election nears, the impostor candidates are seen to be acting strangely, holding hands in public and making bizarre declarations in unhumanlike monotone. Later on, Homer stumbles upon the badly hidden spaceship and tries to save Dole and Clinton, with both candidates agreeing they should join forces to defeat the aliens; however, Homer accidentally ejects them into space. On {{the day before the}} election, Homer crashes the spaceship into the Capitol and reveals the candidates' real identities. However, despite being exposed, Kang and Kodos declare to the people that they still have to choose one of them because it is too late to get new candidates. Kang is subsequently elected president and enslaves all of humanity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{bystander}} effect, or bystander apathy, is {{a social}} psychological phenomenon in which individuals {{are less likely to}} offer help to a victim when other people are present. The greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> help. Several factors contribute to the bystander effect, including ambiguity, cohesiveness and diffusion of responsibility. Research has shown that the term “bystander apathy” is an incorrect description because people feel genuine concern for the victim.|$|E

30|$|As {{opposed to}} other {{approaches}} in the literature, {{we do not}} need to assume the existence of an actual probability for the home (or away) team to win the match. Instead, the bettors are characterized by their subjective beliefs on this probability. An alternative interpretation is that each bettor is characterized by the the odd at which she is willing to bet, which includes the individual surplus of the act of betting itself. In this sense, a natural extension of the model, which does not change the results, is to assume that there are two subsets <b>of</b> bettors: <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>willing</b> to bet for the home team, another willing to bet for the away team, and both characterized by the minimum odd they will bet.|$|R

The crew takes them to the crossing, and Hercules and Meg ascend together to Olympus. As the clock ticks twice, Hades has decided that it's time for the outsiders to pay by punishing them. He arrives to see his prisoner Hook, and tells him that for each soul his friends help escape, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> have to stay forever. Hades forces Hook to decide which of his friends will pay for this by creating new tombstones for him to engrave with a chisel.|$|E
2500|$|Herman {{slips into}} the Countess' room and looks in fascination at the {{portrait}} of Muskovite Venus and how their fates, he feels, are linked: <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> die because of the other. He lingers too long before he can go to Liza's room and hears the Countess' retinue coming, so he conceals himself as the old lady approaches. The Countess deplores the manners {{of the day and}} reminisces about the better times of her youth, when she sang in Versailles [...] "Je crains de lui parler la nuit" [...] (Laurette's Aria) from André Grétry's opera Richard Cœur-de-Lion before the Pompadour herself. As she dozes off, Herman stands before her. She awakens in horror as he pleads with her to tell him her secret. When she remains speechless, he grows desperate and threatens her with a pistol — at which she dies of fright. Liza rushes in, only to learn that the lover to whom she gave her heart was more interested in the Countess's secret. She orders him out and falls sobbing.|$|E

[...] If the thought-form is not definitely directed to anyone else, it simply floats by itself, constantly [...] "radiating vibrations similar to those originally sent forth by its creator." [...] If it does not come into contact with any aura, its radiation is gradually depletes and it disintegrates. But if it manages to resonate with another aura that is nearby, then it is attracted and absorbed by the mental component of this aura. The result produced in the mental body into which this thought-form will fall, will be not just a thought of the same order as that which gave birth to it, but it will be [...] "actually the same thought. The radiation may affect thousands and stir up in them thoughts on the same level as the original, and yet it may happen that no <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> be identical with that original; the thought-form can affect only very few, but in those few cases it will reproduce exactly the initiatory idea." ...|$|E
