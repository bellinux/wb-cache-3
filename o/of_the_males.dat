5|$|The female is mildly {{aggressive}} to her suitors during estrus, {{and will}} often lunge at males, usually {{after a long}} period of being approached and followed. Vocalizations during mating include a whistling sound, most commonly by the female, usually during June and August, coinciding with female estrus. Other vocalizations recorded during estrus include chittering and growling. The testosterone levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> are seasonal, with peaks coinciding with female estrogen peaks.|$|E
5|$|Beetles have {{mouthparts}} {{like those}} of grasshoppers. The mandibles appear as large pincers {{on the front of}} some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see defence, below). Two pairs of finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> enlarged enormously compared with those of females of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Black mambas breed {{annually}} and mating {{occurs in the}} early spring, when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail. After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female by flicking his tongue over her entire body. As in other species of snakes and many other reptiles, fertilization is internal and the intromittent organs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> are {{in the form of}} hemipenes. Females lay clutches of eggs with an incubation period of some 80 to 90 days. Like most snakes female mambas are both oviparous and iteroparous. Egg-laying typically occurs during the middle of summer and egg clutches range from 6 to 17 eggs.|$|E

Two of the females laid eggs before dying, one laying 3,000 and the other 8,000.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{attracted}} by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males,</b> the male performs a display in which he rocks {{from side to side}} and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E
5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} do not live in too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males.</b>|$|E

5|$|Musculoskeletal {{analysis}} showed significant gender lifestyle variation. Greater leg muscle development {{was found in}} males of the Parc Cwm cromlech, possibly the result of hunting or herding, confirming the sexual dimorphism found in previous analyses of the remains. In contrast, no such variation was noticeable in the remains found during excavations from other nearby sites, for example the Tinkinswood burial chamber, in the Vale of Glamorgan. The variation in musculoskeletal stress markers may indicate a mobile lifestyle {{for at least some}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> analysed.|$|E
5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a {{minority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> attend an active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.|$|E
5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> approaches the female, {{he uses his}} upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Social {{behaviour}} {{is influenced}} by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different times of the year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males,</b> territoriality was observed for less than four months.|$|E
5|$|The WHO/EURO Multicentre Study of Suicide, {{established}} in 1989, demonstrated that, for each age group, the female rate of self-harm exceeded that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males,</b> {{with the highest}} rate among females in the 13–24 age group and the highest rate among males in the 12–34 age group. However, this discrepancy {{has been known to}} vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria, consistent with wide-ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self-harm in general. Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context of broader psychosocial interpretation. For example, feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported gender differences in rates of self-harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors, directly blaming medical discourse for pathologising the female.|$|E
5|$|The {{colouration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> {{allows them}} to visibly {{stand out from the}} brown forest floor. This bright colouration provides a sexual advantage for the adult males, increasing their likelihood of successfully mating. The result is rapid evolutionary selection within the species for brighter plumage and more conspicuous behaviour patterns in the males. The bright colouration also makes the males more susceptible to predation. Males are more expendable for this reason; {{only a small number of}} males are needed within any generation in order to perpetuate the species. While sexual selection leads to bright plumage, natural selection in turn favors defensive colouration in the birds. There is higher fitness in birds monitoring nests whose colouration acts as camouflage-protection from predation.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> adult <b>male</b> has a dark grey beak {{and pink}} eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are whiter and more {{distinctive}} than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> <b>The</b> feathers <b>of</b> its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male,</b> {{leading to a}} more barred or scalloped pattern to its plumage. Its legs and feet are a little lighter than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>male.</b> Moulting appears {{to take place in}} stages in late summer—some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.|$|R

5|$|The {{most diverse}} {{superfamily}} is the Acridoidea, with around 8,000 species. The two main families in this are the Acrididae (grasshoppers and locusts) with a worldwide distribution, and the Romaleidae (lubber grasshoppers), found chiefly in the New World. The Ommexechidae and Tristiridae are South American, and the Lentulidae, Lithidiidae and Pamphagidae are mainly African. The Pauliniids are nocturnal and can swim or skate on water, and the Lentulids are wingless. Pneumoridae are native to Africa, particularly southern Africa, and are distinguished by the inflated abdomens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males.</b>|$|E
5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a mating site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males,</b> and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas {{are large}} insects made {{conspicuous}} by the courtship calls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> They are characterised by having three joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and {{three to six}} segments, including a seta at the tip. The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on {{the rear of the}} forewing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hindwing. Cicadas lack the ability to jump as exhibited by other members of the Auchenorrhyncha. Another defining characteristic is the adaptations of the forelimbs of nymphs for underground life. The relict family Tettigarctidae differ from the Cicadidae in having the prothorax extending as far as the scutellum, and by lacking the tympanal apparatus.|$|E

5|$|Generally, each {{household}} prepares one badnjak, {{although more}} are cut in some regions. Depending {{on the local}} custom, Montenegrin Serbs may fell two, three, an arbitrary number greater than two, or the number equal to the male members of household plus one. The latter means that each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> has a log associated with him, with the thickest log representing the head of household and the thinnest linked to the family's prosperity. If {{there is only one}} man in the household, three rather than two logs are prepared. The logs may be cut from different species of tree. In parts of the Bay of Kotor, each household prepares four sets of badnjaks, as they are burned there not only on Christmas Eve, but also on the eves of New Years Day, Epiphany, and the Feast of Saint Sava.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a gregarious {{animal with}} a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly, the female herds, consisting of adult females and their young; secondly, the bachelor herds, consisting only of yearlings and older males; thirdly, the territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is {{highest in the}} densest populations and also increases with forage density. There is a strong attachment {{among members of the}} female herd, many of whom are related to each other. Large herds often get divided into smaller groups. While small calves stay with their mothers, the older ones form groups of their own within the herd. These herds have a social hierarchy, and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts. Separation of a young calf from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings stay within the female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations and, unlike the female herds, the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression on the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males.</b> These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males.|$|E
5|$|The males arrive {{first and}} remain in the {{location}} for several weeks while the females only stay long enough to mate and spawn. Rather than fighting {{for the right to}} mate with a female, male toads may settle disputes by means of the pitch of their voice. Croaking provides a reliable sign of body size and hence of prowess. Nevertheless, fights occur in some instances. In a study at one pond where males outnumbered females by four or five to one, it was found that 38% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>males</b> won the right to mate by defeating rivals in combat or by displacing other males already mounted on females. Male toads generally outnumber female toads at breeding ponds. A Swedish study found that female mortality was higher than that of males and that 41% of females did not come to the breeding pond in the spring and missed a year before reproducing again.|$|E
