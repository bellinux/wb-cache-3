5|$|On the Sunday {{closest to}} 11 November, known as Remembrance Sunday, the entire college assembles {{in front of}} St. George to await a {{procession}} of parents, alumni, guests and teachers. Two minutes silence is followed by The Last Post and a reading. Representatives {{of the student body}} (the Senior Chapel Prefect, who is the Head Boy <b>or</b> <b>Girl)</b> and of the Old Malvernian Society then place wreaths at the foot of St. George. A memorial service follows in the chapel for the more than 400 Malvernians who lost their lives in the Great War.|$|E
5|$|Over its 950 {{years of}} history Warwick Castle has been owned by 36 {{different}} individuals, plus four periods as crown property under seven different monarchs. It was the family seat of three separate creations of the Earls of Warwick, {{and has been a}} family home for members of the Beaumont, Beauchamp, Neville, Plantagenet, Dudley and Greville families. The first creation of the Earldom specifically included the right of inheritance through the female line, so the castle three times had a woman (<b>or</b> <b>girl)</b> as the owner. Eleven of the owners were under 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy aged three. At least three owners died in battle, two were executed and one murdered. Every century except the 21st has seen major building work or adaptations at the castle.|$|E

25|$|The {{confusion}} arises {{here because}} the bather is not asked if the puppy he is holding is a male, but rather if either is a male. If the puppies are labeled (A and B), each has a 50% chance of being male independently. This independence is restricted when at least A or B is male. Now, if A is not male, B must be male, and vice versa. This restriction is introduced {{by the way the}} question is structured and is easily overlookedmisleading people to the erroneous answer of 50%. See Boy <b>or</b> <b>Girl</b> paradox for solution details.|$|E

2500|$|Sexual {{bullying}} is [...] "any bullying behaviour, whether {{physical or}} non-physical, {{that is based}} on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys <b>or</b> <b>girls</b> towards other boys <b>or</b> <b>girls</b> – although it is more commonly directed at girls.

25|$|The growth {{problem is}} even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are {{detected}} when premature pubic hair appears in childhood, because the bone age is often several years advanced {{at the age of}} diagnosis. While a boy (<b>or</b> <b>girl)</b> with simple virilizing CAH is taller than peers at that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow, and may go from being a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, many of these children will have already had central precocious puberty triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as leuprolide to slow continuing bone maturation.|$|E
25|$|Forced {{pregnancy}} is {{the practice of}} forcing a woman <b>or</b> <b>girl</b> to become pregnant, often {{as part of a}} forced marriage, including by means of bride kidnapping, through rape (including marital rape, war rape and genocidal rape) or as part of a program of breeding slaves (see Slave breeding in the United States). It is a form of reproductive coercion, was common historically, and still occurs in parts of the world. In the 20th century, state mandated forced marriage with the aim of increasing the population was practiced by some authoritarian governments, notably during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, which systematically forced people into marriages ordering them to have children, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution. Forced {{pregnancy is}} strongly connected to the custom of bride price.|$|E
25|$|In Worcester {{skittles}} all pins {{are live}} until they {{land in the}} pit behind the diamond, or leave the alley on an open side. They can rebound off a side wall back into the diamond taking down other pin(s). In some alleys, such as the Saracens Head in Worcester, the Diamond is flanked by two side walls making {{the possibility of a}} spare, achieved by bouncing pins off the wall more of a possibility. It is more than common to hear the cries of 'let it roll' go out in the alleys of the city to stop an over enthusiastic 'sticker up' (a young lad <b>or</b> <b>girl</b> employed to put the pins back up after they have been knocked down) removing a pin from the alley before it has finished knocking down the others. However, if a ball hits the cush, or wall or passes through the diamond and bounces back out of the pit before felling pins the frame must be reset.|$|E

25|$|H. B. Tennison {{was born}} February 12, 1930. He was 6feet, 3inches tall and weighed 130pounds. He was {{extremely}} shy and was said by his sister, Mrs. Alys Jo Daniel, {{that he had}} a sunny disposition and that she does not remember him being a moody person. Tennison did not have many boy <b>or</b> <b>girl</b> companions. He played the trombone in the Arkansas High School band with Booker, but they were not friends. He was very fond of comic books and loved listening to radio plays, especially quiz programs. He used to work as a part-time usher at the Paramount theater (now the Perot) in downtown Texarkana. Though he was an average student and was not interested in school work, he graduated in June 1948. After high school, he traveled for his father's Memphis firm, Tennison Bros. Inc., which manufactured sheet metal products. Tennison swallowed poison and died on November 4, 1948. A private funeral consisting of family and close friends was held at his family's home on Hickory street Saturday, November 6 at 4 p.m. He is buried in Hillcrest Cemetery on US Highway 67 West.|$|E
25|$|Say we {{are told}} that a woman has two children. If we ask whether either of them is a girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once {{we are told}} that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy <b>or</b> <b>girl</b> paradox.|$|E

500|$|Makar Alekseyevich Devushkin (Макар Алексеевич Девушкин) [...] {{the protagonist}} of Poor Folk is a shy, poor and lonely forty-seven-year-old clerk and copyist. He has been {{compared}} to other clerks from the [...] "natural school" [...] such as [...] "The Overcoat"'s Akaky Akakievich. Although trying to use literature to understand life, Devushkin does not discuss these topics separately, and falsely believes that Dobroselova's letters reflect his life, taking short stories as realistic works. He exhibits typical sentimental characteristics; according to Robert Payne, Dostoyevsky [...] "writes on the edge of sentimentality, but he is a completely credible and rounded figure". Devushkin's name derives from devushka, meaning maiden <b>or</b> <b>girl,</b> possibly symbolizing virginity and innocence, although Joseph Frank remarked it is an incongruent description.|$|E

Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times described [...] "Woods" [...] as a [...] "Wisconsin death trip that becomes a testimonial to rebirth through isolation" [...] and noted a significant difference from [...] "Lost in the World", commenting that the song was more about West's [...] "exhausted cry of one who's always new in town, chasing whatever goal <b>or</b> <b>girl</b> is in the room, fueled by consumer culture's relentless buzz, but finally left unsatisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{books are}} divided into chapters, each one narrated {{in the third person}} limited {{through the eyes of a}} point of view character, an {{approach}} Martin learned himself as a young journalism student. Beginning with nine POV characters in A Game of Thrones, the number of POV characters grows to a total of 31 in A Dance with Dragons (see table). The short-lived one-time POV characters are mostly restricted to the prologue and epilogue. David Orr of The New York Times noted the story importance of [...] "the Starks (good guys), the Targaryens (at least one good guy, <b>or</b> <b>girl),</b> the Lannisters (conniving), the Greyjoys (mostly conniving), the Baratheons (mixed bag), the Tyrells (unclear) and the Martells (ditto), most of whom are feverishly endeavoring to advance their ambitions and ruin their enemies, preferably unto death".

500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Pitchforks Ryan Dombal, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was [...] "a hedonistic {{exploration}} into a rich and famous American id", while Chris Martins from Spin {{said it was an}} alternately grandiose and eloquent production that [...] "owed as much to the artist's self-aggrandizing ego as to the voracious id that would destroy it publicly". Music writer Ann Powers interprets West's predominant theme on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy to be [...] "the crisis of the jet-lagged cosmopolitan ... the exhausted cry of one who's always new in town, chasing whatever goal <b>or</b> <b>girl</b> is in the room, fueled by consumer culture's relentless buzz, but finally left unsatisfied". Powers views the songs to work [...] "as pornographic boasts, romantic disaster stories, devil-haunted dark nights of the soul" [...] and perceives West's [...] "uncertainty about his own place in the world" [...] to be connected to the subject of race, stating [...] "The rootlessness West celebrates and despairs of on Fantasy belongs to someone who feels unwelcome everywhere. This isn't just a personal problem. It's the curse of what the author Michael Eric Dyson has called 'the exceptional black man', embraced for his talents but singled out for the color of his skin".|$|E
500|$|When Robbie {{first began}} filming, {{she was told}} that Donna was bisexual.

I think it's a good message to send out because it's not such a big deal to lots of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a kiss between herself and fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus {{was raised}} as a Christian and {{identified}} herself as such during her childhood and early adult life. Some recent quotes such as [...] "You are all stardust. You couldn’t {{be here if}} stars hadn’t exploded... So forget Jesus. Stars died so you can live", and social media content have led to questions surrounding her religious beliefs. Cyrus includes references to Tibetan Buddhism in the lyrics of [...] "Milky Milky Milk" [...] (2015). Cyrus came out as pansexual to her mother when she was 14, and has said: [...] "I never want to label myself! I am ready to love anyone that loves me for who I am! I am open."
