[...] On Carey's official Facebook page on May 12, 2012, shortly after the release, she wrote, [...] "I spent four years writing this song, only because after I performed in Schenectady, NY, I started hearing this melody and singing it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> myself as I was taking a bath, looking at the moon..

500|$|According to {{literary}} scholar Anne Myles, {{the life of}} Mary Dyer [...] "functions as a powerful, almost allegorical example of a woman returning, <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> <b>to</b> the same power-infused site of legal and discursive control." [...] The only first-hand evidence available as to the thoughts and motives of Dyer lie in the letters that she wrote. [...] But Myles sees her behavior as [...] "a richly legible text of female agency, affiliation, and dissent." [...] Looking at Burrough's account of the conversation between Dyer and Governor Endicott, Myles views {{the two most important}} dimensions as being agency and affiliation. The first is that Dyer's actions [...] "can be read as staging a public drama of agency," [...] a means for women, including female prophets, to act under the power and will of God. [...] While Quaker women were allowed to preach, they were not being assertive when doing so because they were actually [...] "preaching against their own wills and minds." ...|$|E

Another youth named Karl Busch stepped forward when a woman asked him to try to talk to the Americans. Busch knew some English from school and remembered a war film where the actor René Deltgen yelled [...] "Stop Firing" [...] <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> end the fighting. Young Busch cautiously went outside yelling [...] "Stop Firing!" [...] in English over and over. [...] The American shooting stopped and Lt. Timmermann asked him why. Busch said they wanted to surrender but were afraid of being shot.|$|E

In addition, a judge ordered that neither the girl's mother nor any member of her family have any contact with the girl. A DCF official stated that Alessandra should no longer be with her mother because [...] "the mother, Jennifer Perez, not only psychologically abused the child by exposing her to the torture of the twins, but also by threatening the child <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> keep quiet and encourage [...] her to be complicit in the deception, that is including a calculated effort by the mother to keep the child from disclosing it to DCF officials." ...|$|E

Her father's health having temporarily stabilized {{he was able to}} attend, though twelve days after her ceremony her father suffered a stroke and was taken to a private sanatorium, the Bon Sauveur at Caen, where he remained for three years before returning to Lisieux in 1892. In this period Thérèse deepened the sense of her vocation; to lead a hidden life, to pray and offer her suffering for priests, to forget herself, to increase discreet acts of charity. She wrote, [...] "I applied myself especially to practice little virtues, not having the facility to perform great ones ... In her letters from this period of her novitiate, Thérèse returned <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the theme of littleness, referring to herself as a grain of sand, an image she borrowed from Pauline...'Always littler, lighter, in order to be lifted more easily by the breeze of love.'
