50|$|A {{study was}} done on the eating habits of Arion fasciatus, which found that it does <b>not</b> find <b>fresh</b> leaves as palatable, likely because they {{generally}} feed under the leaf litter layer.

5000|$|Another ministerial {{colleague}} {{noted that}} Rev. Leavitt's sermons [...] "are <b>not</b> <b>fresh</b> and beautiful by the imagination, not ardent and overflowing with love, but didactic, dry, and clean, and very long.

50|$|Some sources {{claim that}} Linoli's study {{proves that the}} {{specimens}} are miraculous because blood would naturally decay and Linoli's analysis {{is based on a}} comparison with normal (<b>fresh)</b> blood, <b>not</b> thousand-year-old blood.

2500|$|There are {{indications}} that the soft earth and peat underlying canal walls may have given way.

50|$|According to the {{writings}} of Marco Polo, in the 13th century the Tatars were able to condense milk. Marco Polo reported that ten pounds (4.5 kg) of milk paste was carried by each man, who would subsequently mix the product with water. However, this probably refers to the soft Tatar curd (katyk), which can {{be made into a}} drink (ayran) by diluting it, and therefore refers to fermented, <b>not</b> <b>fresh,</b> milk concentrate.|$|R
