5|$|Manchester City's {{stadium is}} the City of Manchester Stadium, {{also known as}} Eastlands and the Etihad Stadium since July 2011 because of {{sponsorship}} commitments. The stadium is situated in East Manchester and {{is part of a}} 200-year <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> from Manchester City Council after the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The stadium has been City's home {{since the end of the}} 2002–03 season, when the club moved from Maine Road. Before moving to the stadium, Manchester City spent in excess of £30million to convert it to football use. The field of play was lowered by several metres, adding another tier of seating around the entire pitch. A new North Stand was also built. The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over Barcelona in a friendly match. In August 2015, a 7,000 seat third tier on the South Stand was completed, in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season. Current capacity stands at 55,097. A North Stand third tier has planning approval and work on it is expected to begin by 2017, increasing capacity to around 61,000.|$|E

40|$|In 2008, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), in {{cooperation}} with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), will issue a new proposal to change the current accounting regulation with respect to leasing to an alternative approach. This new lease-accounting approach, called the “asset and liability approach”, capitalises all leases on the balance sheet. This contrasts with the current lease-accounting approach, called the “risk and reward approach”, which discriminates between the recognition of financial leases on the balance sheet and the disclosure of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> off the balance sheet. As with the current risk and reward approach, also the asset and liability approach has many opponents. This study investigates: - what the impact on financial ratios might be when <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> are capitalised on the balance sheet, - what company characteristics determines the choice for <b>operating</b> <b>leases,</b> and - whether financially-distressed companies use more <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> than healthy companies. The results show that <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> have become a major financing source, which is not only attributable to the accounting treatment of <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> However, the information on <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> as required in the footnotes to the financial statements is not transparent, nor reliable. The current lease-accounting standards might be maintained but improved, and this could be an intermediate solution that is acceptable for the proponents of both lease-accounting approaches...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{documents}} {{the importance of}} leasing in the UK retail sector and estimates the potential balance sheet impact of new accounting proposals to bring all leases onto lessees’ balance sheets. Off-balance sheet <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> are {{shown to be a}} major source of finance, and far more important (3. 3 times higher) than on-balance sheet long-term debt; by contrast, finance <b>leases</b> are immaterial. <b>Operating</b> <b>leased</b> assets, the major part of which is ‘land and buildings’ (98 %), represent a significant proportion (28 %) of reported total assets. Capitalization of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> would {{have a major impact on}} nine key performance ratios and would alter the ranking of companies markedly. The findings suggest that <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> need careful consideration in estimating retailers’ financial risk, in comparing cross-national performance and in research studies of capital structure decisions...|$|R
25|$|When {{the project}} commenced, it was {{believed}} that Westrail, then responsible for the provision and management of metropolitan rail transport for Transperth, would not have enough rolling stock to operate the new line. Further to that, the funding available to Westrail would not permit the purchase of rolling stock from current or future operating funds. On 20 November 1989, the State Cabinet allowed Westrail to pursue an <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> to permit the acquisition of the required 22 2-car A-series trains. On 30 November 1989, the contract to construct the trains was awarded to Walkers-ABB despite a funding deal not being in place. Westrail sought out a financing arrangement to enable the purchase.|$|E
25|$|A contract, later {{known as}} Contract 1, was {{executed}} on February 21, 1900, between {{the commission and}} the Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont, {{for the construction of}} the subway and a 50-year <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> from the opening of the line. Ground was broken at City Hall on March 24. A plan for an extension from City Hall to the Long Island Rail Road's Flatbush Avenue terminal station (now known as Atlantic Terminal) in Brooklyn was adopted on January 24, 1901, and Contract 2, giving a lease of only 35 years, was executed between the commission and the Rapid Transit Construction Company on September 11, with construction beginning at State Street in Manhattan on November 8, 1902. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 as the operating company for both contracts; the IRT leased the Manhattan Railway, operator of the four elevated railway lines in Manhattan and the Bronx, on April 1, 1903. Operation of the subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of all stations from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch.|$|E

50|$|An <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> is a lease whose term {{is short}} {{compared}} to the useful life of the asset or piece of equipment (an airliner, a ship, etc.) being leased. An <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> is commonly used to acquire equipment on a relatively short-term basis. Thus, for example, an aircraft which has an economic life of 25 years may be leased to an airline for 5 years on an <b>operating</b> <b>lease.</b>|$|E

40|$|While leases {{are widely}} used to finance {{productive}} assets in the U. S, lease accounting has been sharply criticized for providing incomplete and unreliable information to investors because many leases are arranged off-balance sheet as <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> As such, a higher cost of equity capital may be required by investors to compensate for unrecorded liabilities and imperfect information. In this dissertation, I provide the empirical evidence as to how equity market participants perceive the off-balance sheet leases. ^ First, I investigate the firm characteristics that determine the choice on <b>operating</b> versus capital <b>leases.</b> By summarizing the results from prior literature, I identify the determinants from three areas: operating risks, financial constraints and tax-driven incentives. The results suggest that both economic and opportunistic reasons drive a firm 2 ̆ 7 s lease choice. Specifically, fast-growing, financially constrained, or low-tax firms opt for off-balance sheet <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> ^ Second, I {{examine the impact of}} off-balance sheet <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> on the cost of equity, and whether it would be different from that of capital leases or conventional debt. The results suggest that off-balance sheet <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> are “value relevant” as indicated by an increased cost of equity capital being associated with greater use of <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> However, investors also seem to suffer from the off-balance sheet position of disclosed <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> The leverage effect of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> is largely attenuated relative to capital leases and conventional debt. ^ Third, I explore the role of information intermediaries in compensation for the deficiency in accounting for leases. The results indicate that the cost of equity, with respect to the use of off-balance sheet leases, diminishes in greater analyst followings and the existence of credit ratings. Specifically, the diminishing effect of 2 ̆ 7 financial analysts is more pronounced on off-balance sheet <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> than that on capital leases and conventional debt. Lastly, whether a firm is audited by a big 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 firm appears to have no effect on either off- or on-balance sheet leases. ^ This study contributes to the Financial Accounting Standard Board 2 ̆ 7 s lease accounting project and helps investors assess the risk of firms with off-balance sheet leases. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Operating</b> <b>leases</b> {{are quite}} {{important}} in some industries. There are two possible errors {{that should be}} avoided when valuing a company with <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> First, one should not neglect the implied lease debt. Such neglect distorts the calculation of free cash flow, required {{rate of return on}} the equity under partial debt financing, WACC, and residual equity value in the discounted cash flow model. Second, lease expense and implied lease debt should not be forecasted as constant, historical fractions of sales revenue in the (non-steady-state) explicit forecast period. This paper outlines an approximate procedure for handling <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> in the discounted cash flow model. This procedure avoids the two possible errors that were mentioned. ...|$|R

40|$|The FASB, in {{conjunction}} with the International Accounting Standards Board, is currently in the planning stages of a project that would revise SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases. What is proposed is that leases that are presently accounted for as <b>operating</b> <b>leases,</b> that is, those leases that do not meet the current requirements for on-balance-sheet treatment, would be accounted for as capital leases and brought onto the financial statements. For companies that use a significant amount of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> to finance operations, the financial statement impact could be far-reaching, including material effects on various measures of profitability, financial leverage, debt coverage and cash flow. In this article, we look at the retail industry, an industry that uses <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> extensively, to evaluate how certain key measures of financial performance and position might be affected by the capitalization of <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> Among the findings are an increase in EBITDA, through reductions in income from continuing operations and earnings per share. Financial leverage is increased and debt coverage measures are reduced. Measures of profitability, such as return on assets and return on equity are reduced.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM DISCUSSION Leases are {{a common}} way for {{companies}} to acquire assets. However, the current lease regulation is criticized and a proposed new lease standard (exposure draft) has been released. The presented changes in the new exposure draft include capitalizing all leases, which will affect companies’ financial ratios. These regulation changes may affect the market value for affected companies. PURPOSE The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe and explore the effects and possible consequences capitalizing <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> has on market value of equity. We want to investigate if investors already adjust for capitalized <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> in their assessment of market value of equity.

The capitalized data is then tested against our hypothesis using a regression model. RESULT AND CONCLUSION Our results indicate that investors do not adjust current market value of equity for capitalized <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> SUGGESTION AND FURTHER RESEARCH An event study for the same companies after the implementation of the new standard would be interesting to see if the new standard in fact has an effect on market value of equity...|$|R
