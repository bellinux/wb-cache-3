500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV News at Dylan's Candy Bar, Minaj revealed that she had kept the collaboration a secret from everyone she knew because she was [...] "so surprised" [...] at being asked to work with Carey and {{did not believe that}} the collaboration would actually come to fruition. [...] "That one, I didn’t believe until I was physically in the studio that I was doing with something with Mariah," [...] Minaj said. [...] "She’s an icon, I’ve loved her since I was little, like ’Vision of Love,’ ’Someday.’ I was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> girls in the mirror singing her songs with my mother.” A release date of February 23, 2010, for the album was slated, and then pushed back to March 9. It was then further pushed back to March 30. However, it was confirmed in March 2010 that production of Angels Advocate had halted and the project was shelved indefinitely. Island Def Jam stated that the singer was instead working on a new project and [...] "new surprises". Metro revealed that Carey was possibly recording a Christmas album.|$|E
500|$|Sevigny {{has long}} been {{considered}} a fashion icon and regularly appears on best dressed lists. Throughout her career, she has modelled for several high-profile designers, including Miu Miu, H, Louis Vuitton and Chloé. Prior to her career as an actress, she had achieved fame for her unique style. While her sense of style in the early 1990s only reflected small downtown scenes and trends, it still made a significant impression on high class fashion chains which began to emulate Sevigny's look. Her interest in fashion and clothing, {{as well as her}} career as a fashion model in her late teenage years and early twenties, have led to a career as a prominent and well-respected fashion designer. She has expressed interest in fashion design throughout the entirety of her career, even dating back to her childhood: [...] "Little House on the Prairie was my favorite show. I would only wear calico print dresses, and I actually slept in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> nightcaps!", she told People in 2007. Her unorthodox style (which garnered her initial notoriety in the early '90s) has often been referred to as very eclectic. Sevigny has since released several clothing lines designed by herself, both solo and in collaboration, and has earned a title as a modern fashion icon.|$|E
