5|$|From 1830 to 1833, {{geologist}} Charles Lyell {{published his}} multi-volume work Principles <b>of</b> <b>Geology,</b> which, building on Hutton's ideas, advocated a uniformitarian {{alternative to the}} catastrophic theory <b>of</b> <b>geology.</b> Lyell claimed that, rather than being the products of cataclysmic (and possibly supernatural) events, the geologic features of the Earth are better explained {{as the result of}} the same gradual geologic forces observable in the present day—but acting over immensely long periods of time. Although Lyell opposed evolutionary ideas (even questioning the consensus that the fossil record demonstrates a true progression), his concept that the Earth was shaped by forces working gradually over an extended period, and the immense age of the Earth assumed by his theories, would strongly influence future evolutionary thinkers such as Charles Darwin.|$|E

5|$|Visiting in 1787, the {{geologist}} James Hutton {{found his}} first {{example of an}} unconformity {{to the north of}} Newton Point near Lochranza, which provided evidence for his Plutonist theories of uniformitarianism and about the age of the Earth.

5|$|Arthur Holmes (1890–1965) {{was born}} in England and became Regius Professor <b>of</b> <b>Geology</b> at the University of Edinburgh in 1943. His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that slow moving convection currents in the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' {{as it was then}} called. He also pioneered the discipline of geochronology. He lived long enough to see the theory of plate tectonics become widely accepted, and he is {{regarded as one of the}} most influential geologists of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev William Buckland, a {{professor}} <b>of</b> <b>geology</b> at Oxford, collected more fossilized bones of Megalosaurus {{and became the}} first person to describe a dinosaur in a scientific journal. The second dinosaur genus to be identified, Iguanodon, was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell– the wife of English geologist Gideon Mantell. Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern iguanas. He published his findings in 1825.|$|E

The Museum is free and open on weekdays during the academic year from 9 am until 5 pm. Ely also hosts several laboratories, dedicated to the study of earth materials, paleoclimatology, clastic sedimentology, and geophysics. Within Ely, there are also classrooms, a GIS laboratory, and a map collection.|$|E
5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study of the solid and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth. The field <b>of</b> <b>geology</b> encompasses {{the study of the}} composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.|$|E

5|$|Her {{education}} was extremely limited. She {{was able to}} attend a Congregationalist Sunday school where she learned to read and write. Congregationalist doctrine, unlike that of the Church of England at the time, emphasised {{the importance of education}} for the poor. Her prized possession was a bound volume of the Dissenters' Theological Magazine and Review, in which the family's pastor, the Reverend James Wheaton, had published two essays, one insisting that God had created the world in six days, the other urging dissenters to study the new science <b>of</b> <b>geology.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1905 Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University, {{convinced}} Smyth to {{join the}} Princeton faculty, where Smyth remained until retiring in 1934.

Among his students were Arthur Francis Buddington and Albert Orion Hayes. His courses in petrology and chemical geology introduced students to subjects that were relatively new in the United States.|$|E
