5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E

For the record, it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they {{thought they were going to}} get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen. I'm telling you, amazing things will happen.|$|E
25|$|In November 2002, {{the book}} “Victoria, Victoria!” came out, {{speaking}} further about her eating disorder. Victoria said: “I {{felt like an}} accelerating train, going right down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. I really hated how I looked like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt like everything {{in my life and}} around me was controlled by others. The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could control was the food I put in me”. She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E

25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James {{had no right to}} summon him, and ought to be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> ensure him by the faith that I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it. Moreover, fellow, I care for nothing but for misentreating of my sister, that would God she were in England on a condition she cost the Schottes King not a penny.|$|E
500|$|... "The Games {{were opened}} by the Governor of Western Australia, Sir Charles Gairdner on 10 November 1962. In his opening speech Gairdner stated that [...] "The public must {{learn that the}} {{handicapped}} person is not an invalid. I am handicapped, but the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> loathe is for people to treat me as an invalid. We, the public, must realise {{what can be done}} to rehabilitate people who have suffered a grevious physical disadvantage".|$|E
500|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E

500|$|Fielder-Civil (born August 1978), {{a former}} video {{production}} assistant, {{had dropped out}} of Bourne Grammar School and, aged 16, moved to London from his native Lincolnshire. In a June 2007 interview, Winehouse admitted she could sometimes be violent toward him after she had been drinking, saying: [...] "If he says <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> don't like, then I'll chin him." [...] In August 2007, they were photographed, bloodied and bruised, in the streets of London after an alleged fight, although she contended her injuries were self-inflicted. Winehouse married Fielder-Civil on 18 May 2007, in Miami Beach, Florida.|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, The Observer Music Monthly interviewed Timberlake {{and stated}} that the track [...] "is arguably the album's 'Cry Me a River'." [...] In response, Timberlake said, [...] "It is similar. You go back to Aaliyah's biggest record, 'Are You That Somebody' – it's similar to that too because it's that percussive ballad." [...] When asked about the lyrics, [...] "There's just <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> need from you: say I do", being autobiographical, he said no, adding that the line before that, [...] "this ring here {{represents}} my heart", is about marriage and love. Timberlake stated, [...] "It's not specifically about marriage, but about a humble approach to love. None of it is autobiographical, though obviously I have experience to draw from." ...|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{contains}} minor {{scenes from}} Crichton's Jurassic Park and The Lost World novels that were ultimately not {{featured in the}} film versions, such as the Pteranodon aviary {{and the use of}} the boat. Laura Dern's cameo was shot in a day. In an earlier draft, Neill and Dern's characters were a couple in the process of splitting up. Johnston said, [...] "I didn't want to see them as a couple anymore. For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> don't think they look like a couple. It would be uncomfortable to still see them together. And Laura Dern doesn't look like she's aged for the past fifteen years!" [...] The film's longest rough cut was approximately 96 minutes, without credits. According to Johnston, [...] "We lost maybe 8 minutes, so it was never really that long." ...|$|E

500|$|The Killer {{was shown}} at several film festivals outside Asia {{including}} the 1989 Toronto Festival of Festivals and, during the film's United States premiere, at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January 1990. It was also {{shown at the}} Sundance Film Festival in the United States and the Cannes Film Festival in France in 1990. Film producer Terence Chang suggested that The Killers success around the world made several Hong Kong filmmakers jealous: [...] "It created {{a certain kind of}} resentment in the Hong Kong film industry. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can say for sure is, the American, European, Japanese, Korean and even the Taiwanese audiences and critics appreciated The Killer a lot more than it was in Hong Kong." [...] The Killer received a wide release in the United Kingdom on 8 October 1993.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Taylor, {{director}} of the animal rights group Animal Aid, called for an outright ban of the Grand National, saying: [...] "It's a deliberately hazardous, challenging and predictably lethal event." [...] The RSPCA's equine consultant David Muir stated: [...] "I was gutted that two horses died... What I will do now is go back {{and have a look}} at each element, with the BHA and the racecourse management, to see if the jump contributed to what happened, look at the take-off and landing side and so on, and see if the evidence suggests something can be done about it. I'm trying to make the race better, safer where I can, but the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can never do is eliminate risk: that's always going to be there." [...] Muir did however add: [...] "There's no way I'm going to get the National banned." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two clubs was in the FA Cup semi-finals; the tie was decided by a replay as the initial game {{finished}} goalless. The match was settled in extra time when Giggs {{ran the length of}} the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal. In the close season, Anelka was involved in a protracted transfer saga and vowed to never play for Arsenal again. He cited the media in England as a reason for wanting to leave the club: [...] "The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{can tell you is that}} I can't stand the English Press, who cause me enormous problems on a personal level," [...] but it was implied that his [...] "gold-digging brothers" [...] wanted Anelka to move abroad to make more money – they served as his agents.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of {{a man like that}} of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops a little more of the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit... The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do not want him to do is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team on which I play." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{a change}} in {{administration}} in Washington, in May 2017 {{it was reported that}} Cindy McCain was under consideration for a prominent role at the U.S. Department of State, possibly focusing on issues related to human trafficking. [...] In June 2017, there were further reports that after extensive recruiting by the chief executive following a recommendation from Ivanka Trump, she had agreed to become an Ambassador-at-Large dealing with matters of human trafficking, refugees, and humanitarian aid. [...] No official announcement has yet been made regarding this. [...] In July 2017 she faced the news that her husband had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. [...] She issued a public statement saying that, [...] "We as a family will face the next hurdle together. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do know is he is the toughest person I know. He is my hero and I love him with all my heart." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{as sharp}} as you're good," [...] she said smilingly. [...] "Now, there's just <b>ONE</b> <b>thing</b> more <b>I</b> want you to do. Forget all about this--won't you?" ...|$|R

500|$|After {{deciding}} {{upon the}} idea to use a genie, Gilligan approached Carter for feedback. Carter {{was impressed with the}} story, saying, [...] "Vince had been playing around with somebody finding something in a storage locker. He played around with several different ideas and one day he came in with one idea of a genie and three wishes. The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> noticed right away was that the relationship between Mulder and the genie was very sweet." [...] After finalizing his script, Gilligan began to worry that he had [...] "painted himself in a corner": [...] "I did not intend to write a hard episode to direct [...] But before I realize it, I was blowing up a trailer, having a truck hit an invisible man, and all sorts of genie effects. [...] I looked at all the people on the set [...] and thought, 'Oh man, I'm going to be exposed as an impostor.'" [...] Luckily, the cast and crew helped the new director ease into his position. In addition, many of the members of production noted that the work environment under Gilligan was largely stress-free.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Star Wars Headspace was mixed, holding a weighted mean of a 48 out of 100 {{on the site}} Metacritic based on seven reviews. Drew Mcweeny reviewed it for <b>One</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>I</b> Love Today, his daily column on HitFix which is meant to highlight certain aspects of modern-day popular culture. He honored the compilation's concept of an EDM Star Wars tribute as funny: [...] "I'm not sure how long I'll listen to it, because in the end, it's still {{an hour or so}} of EDM, but it was a delightful soundtrack to a busy weekend, and all of the small surprises built into it should make it something that any Star Wars fan will be able to easily enjoy." [...] A correspondent for The Boston Globe wrote that it was much better than he expected it to be, giving all credit to the producers who contributed to the compilation. Los Angeles Times critic Randall Roberts spotlighted the distinguishing characteristic of each song. [...] Bromwich, who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media, scored the release a 6.9 out of ten, highlighting the record's goal of just being [...] "simple fun" [...] and [...] "Neither [...] stale tribute nor sloppy lovefest". At the same time, however, he also disliked that the nostalgic style was seemingly [...] "a way of avoiding risk".|$|E
500|$|At Peking Airport, contingents of the Chinese {{military}} {{await the}} arrival of the American presidential aircraft [...] "Spirit of '76", carrying Nixon and his party. The military chorus sings the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. After the aircraft touches down, Nixon emerges with Pat Nixon and Henry Kissinger. The president exchanges stilted greetings with the Chinese premier, Chou En-lai, who heads the welcoming party. Nixon speaks of the historical significance of the visit, and of his hopes and fears for the encounter ("News has a kind of mystery"). The scene changes to Chairman Mao's study, where the Chairman awaits {{the arrival of}} the presidential party. Nixon and Kissinger enter with Chou, and Mao and the president converse in banalities as photographers record the scene. In the discussion that follows, the westerners are confused by Mao's gnomic and frequently impenetrable comments, which are amplified by his secretaries and often by Chou. The scene changes again, to the evening's banquet in the Great Hall of the People. Chou toasts the American visitors ("We have begun to celebrate the different ways") and Nixon responds ("I have attended many feasts"), after which the toasts continue as the atmosphere becomes increasingly convivial. Nixon, a politician who rose to prominence on anti-communism, announces: [...] "Everyone, listen; just let me say <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> opposed China, I was wrong".|$|E
