As there is no tow path, a line to haul the barge had to be floated under the bridge and then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.|$|E
5|$|Acquacotta con funghi is an aquacotta soup {{variation}} {{that uses}} porcini mushrooms {{as a primary}} ingredient.

50|$|Low {{humidity}} conditions <b>or</b> <b>watering</b> {{the plants}} with a water source which contains {{high levels of}} dissolved salts {{will result in the}} leaves yellowing and rapidly dying from the tips back to the rhizome. The plants should be provided with rain <b>water</b> <b>or</b> distilled <b>water</b> <b>or</b> a very pure water source. The medium should always remain moist as the plants do not have any significant storage structures like most orchids.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{mortuary}} inscription of Pacificus, archdeacon of Verona, {{records that}} he constructed a night clock (horologium nocturnum) {{as early as}} 850, his clock {{has been identified as}} being an observation tube used to locate stars with an accompanying book of astronomical observations, rather than a mechanical <b>or</b> <b>water</b> clock, an interpretation supported by illustrations from medieval manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|An {{oxide layer}} forms around {{beryllium}} that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000°C. Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming {{a mixture of}} beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid <b>or</b> <b>water</b> as this forms the oxide. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.|$|E
5|$|Drilling at low speed: The {{pilot hole}} is {{expanded}} by using progressively wider drills (typically {{between three and}} seven successive drilling steps, depending on implant width and length).

5|$|Hot chocolate, {{also known}} as hot cocoa, {{drinking}} chocolate or just cocoa is a heated beverage consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk <b>or</b> <b>water,</b> and usually a sweetener.

5|$|The {{existing}} underwater protection {{was replaced}} by the Pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil <b>or</b> <b>water</b> that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo warhead. It lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes.

5|$|Vortex {{streets are}} zigzagging {{patterns}} of whirling vortices {{created by the}} unsteady separation of flow of a fluid, most often air <b>or</b> <b>water,</b> over obstructing objects.
