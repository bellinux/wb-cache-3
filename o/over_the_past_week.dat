2500|$|The Washington Post {{wrote that}} Todays {{alteration}} [...] "would more readily paint Zimmerman as a racial profiler. In reality's version, Zimmerman simply answered {{a question about}} the race of the person whom he was reporting to the police. Nothing prejudicial at all in responding to such an inquiry... it's a falsehood with repercussions. Much of the public discussion <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week</b> has settled on how conflicting facts and interpretations call into question whether Zimmerman acted justifiably or criminally...

2500|$|According to Jewish law, Shabbat {{starts a}} few minutes before sunset. Candles are lit at this time. It is {{customary}} in many communities to light the candles 18 minutes before sundown (tosefet Shabbat, though sometimes 36 minutes), and most printed Jewish calendars adhere to this custom. The Kabbalat Shabbat service is a prayer service welcoming the arrival of Shabbat. Before Friday night dinner, it is customary to sing two songs, one [...] "greeting" [...] two Shabbat angels into the house and the other praising the woman of the house for all the work she has done <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week.</b> After blessings over the wine and challah, a festive meal is served. Singing is traditional at Sabbath meals. In modern times, many composers have written sacred music for use during the Kabbalat Shabbat observance, including Robert Strassburg.|$|E

The foreign {{ministry}} {{reported that he}} had been [...] "receiving treatment <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week</b> for an undisclosed illness." [...] An opposition website, Ethiopian Review, {{reported that he had}} died of a heart attack. Lij Mulugeta Aserate Kassa, an adviser at the Ethiopian embassy in the United Kingdom, and a member of a cadet branch of Ethiopia's deposed Imperial family, [...] noted that Abune Paulos had been in good health the previous day and had led a church service. He later fell ill and was taken to Balcha Hospital, according to an independent Orthodox website, Deje Selam, where he died early in the following morning. Although Lij Mulugeta said that he could not confirm the cause of death, Patriarch Abune Paulos was known to have suffered from hypertension and diabetes. [...] Ethiopians were stunned to learn that Prime Minister Meles Zenawi had also died only four days after the Patriarch.|$|E

40|$|An 86 {{year old}} AA woman was {{referred}} to University Hospital from the dialysis center where she had complained of worsening dyspnea <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 2 <b>weeks.</b> She denied cough, fever, chills or rigors. Per her dialysis notes, bi-basilar crackles had been noted in recent weeks and an effort to increase dialysis volume was made; however, this led to episodes of hypotension (confirmed by dialysis records). At the time of admission, the patient also complained of bilateral chest pain which was constantly present but increased with deep inspiration.

2500|$|The album debuted {{at number}} {{two on the}} US Billboard 200 with 192,000 copies sold in its first week of release, which was lower than the first week sales of Metamorphosis. IGN Music said that {{partly because of the}} album's high debut, [...] "at this very moment Hilary Duff is perhaps the reigning queen of bubblegum pop theatrics"; it also said that Duff's image was [...] "undergoing an overhaul" [...] through photo shoots in {{magazines}} such as Blender, possibly making her less [...] "squeaky clean" [...] like her predecessors Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears. In its second week, the album slipped to No. 6 selling 95,500, down 51% over the first week of release; the following week the album stayed at No. 6, selling 83,775 and falling 12% <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week.</b> Unlike Metamorphosis, Hilary Duff went no higher on the Billboard 200, and the RIAA certified it platinum a month after its release. Hilary Duff was number 112 on Billboard magazine's year-end top albums chart in December 2004 and number sixty-five on Billboard magazine's year-end top albums chart in November 2005.|$|E
60|$|While these delicacies {{were being}} transacted below, Amelia, leaving the drawing-room, walked upstairs and found herself, she scarce knew how, {{in the little}} room which she had {{occupied}} before her marriage, and in that very chair {{in which she had}} passed so many bitter hours. She sank back in its arms {{as if it were an}} old friend; and fell to thinking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week,</b> and the life beyond it. Already to be looking sadly and vaguely back: always to be pining for something which, when obtained, brought doubt and sadness rather than pleasure; here was the lot of our poor little creature and harmless lost wanderer in the great struggling crowds of Vanity Fair.|$|E

40|$|Extract] <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>weeks</b> I have {{facilitated}} three {{workshops for}} psychologists. I have a standard introduction these days which alerts participants that I {{am not going}} to teach cognitive behavioural techniques. It is not an apology but a conscious political statement to explicitly identify that therapy can be practised in more than one modality. Interestingly, the majority of participants nod and smile on hearing this introduction. Many later say what a relief it is to hear about something other than CBT. These days, it certainly seems that nearly every workshop is about CBT for one condition or another. I think that people are starting to tire of the monoculture...|$|R

40|$|The {{depleting}} {{impact of}} experimentally manipulated expressive suppression (ES) on cognition (especially executive functioning and related processes) has been well-established (Baumeister, 2002 a). However, {{the impact of}} ES that occurs naturally {{in the course of}} daily life has not been examined. 62 adults (M = 22. 89 years old) completed questions about recent ES burden (<b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two <b>weeks</b> and on the test day) and completed cognitive measures assessing executive functioning, working memory, and speed of information processing. Individuals with higher-than-usual burden of ES on the test day exhibited poorer executive performance and those with high ES <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two <b>weeks</b> exhibited poorer processing speed above and beyond depression, suggesting that ES burden as it occurs in the course of daily life is associated with compromised cognitive performance...|$|R
40|$|Dear Reader, Those {{among us}} who have reached a certain age tend to have {{developed}} a long-term perspective and inclination {{to look back on}} individual years and to compare them for their respective blessings and injuries. In that sense, 2016 seems to take a special rank as an annus horribilis not just in my own assessment but in numerous commentaries we have come across <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>weeks.</b> Foremost in our awareness featured the surprises: Nobody in my direct acquaintance foretold the Trump phenomenon or the Brexit decision.
