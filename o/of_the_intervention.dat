5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for the subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> is not {{the extent to which}} the consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but {{the extent to which the}}y differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 10 August 1919, one of {{the largest}} engagements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> occurred, taking place at Seltso and the {{surrounding}} villages along the Dvina. In a confused battle through the marshy swamps Sadlier-Jackson's brigade battled a large Bolshevik force, with the Fusiliers—including the two Australian companies of the 45th Battalion—fighting their way through with their bayonets and re-occupying Seltso. Perhaps as many as 1,000 prisoners were taken and 19 field guns captured. Due to the terrain the Fusiliers had been unable to manoeuvre their mountain guns through the swamp, whilst Sadlier-Jackson had to use an observation balloon for situational awareness. During this battle an Australian, Corporal Arthur Sullivan, won the Victoria Cross (VC) for saving a group of drowning men while under fire.|$|E

In another, it was proposed by Caecina Severus that the wives of governors be banned from joining their husbands in the provinces. Caecina delivered a speech in support of the bill, followed with speeches by both Valerius Messalinus and Drusus in opposition to it.

5|$|By {{the end of}} October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which {{consisted}} of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end {{the impression that the}} Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's First Chief Directorate was put under orders that {{something had to be done}} about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention)</b> on 27 December 1979.|$|E

5|$|The SASR {{played a}} key role in the Australian-led {{international}} peacekeeping force (INTERFET) in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. In the days prior to the commencement of INTERFET, the SASR was involved in the RAAF evacuation of United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) staff, Australians and refugees from East Timor following increasing violence by Indonesian military-backed militia after the East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. The SASR subsequently provided the initial INTERFET forces to secure the point of entry at the airport and seaport in Dili. 3 Squadron, along with Allied Special Forces elements from the NZ SAS and British SBS, formed INTERFET's special forces element, known as Response Force (RESPFOR). The SASR spearheaded most operations conducted by the international force during the early days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> in East Timor and, as in Vietnam, served as the eyes and ears of the force, patrolling extensively through militia-controlled areas in vehicles and on foot as INTERFET expanded to take control of the rest of East Timor. It was involved in a number of significant contacts with pro-Indonesian militia, including at Suai on 6 October 1999 during which two SASR soldiers were wounded, and later at Aidabasalala on 16 October 1999. On 22 October 1999, the SASR conducted a combined air insertion in Black Hawk helicopters and an amphibious landing from HMAS Brunei into the Oecusse Enclave to secure the beachhead ahead of an amphibious assault by the main force, after the insertion of Navy Clearance Divers by submarine the previous night to conduct a reconnaissance and survey of the amphibious landing site. It was reported that the SASR also conducted covert patrols in the Enclave before the landings. Other tasks included VIP protection and other special forces tasks as required by the task force commander. 3 Squadron was later awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation on 25 March 2000. 1 Squadron replaced 3 Squadron in December 1999, and completed its tour in February 2000.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{multiplicity}} {{and complexity}} of symptoms in patients treated with chemotherapy requires multifaceted symptom management <b>interventions.</b> <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this systematic review was to describe the characteristics and evaluate <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> complex nursing interventions that target multiple symptoms in patients receiving chemotherapy. DESIGN: We searched Medline, Embase, Cinahl and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomized controlled trials that compared complex nursing interventions to usual care and that provided data on symptom prevalence, severity, distress or limitations. Characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> were described in a narrative way. Regarding <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interventions,</b> ratios <b>of</b> means were calculated in order to present data in a comparable and clinically interpretable way. RESULTS: We included 11 studies, some with considerable risk of bias. Despite being heterogeneous, <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> have patient education, symptom assessment and coaching in common. Although some interventions fail to show significant effects, others significantly reduce aspects of symptom burden by 10 - 88 %. CONCLUSION: Although some complex nursing interventions in this systematic review produce clinically meaningful and statistically relevant reductions in symptom burden, based on the available data {{it is not possible}} to make definitive conclusions about the vital parts, circumstances or preferred target population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interventions.</b> Quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studies and modeling and piloting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> are important challenges for future research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this article}} was to review primary {{prevention}} interventions targeting childhood obesity implemented in the after school environment from 2006 and 2011. A total of 20 interventions were found from 25 studies. Children in <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> ranged from kindergarten to middle schoolers, however a majority was in the 4 th and 5 th grades. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> targeted both physical activity and dietary behaviors. Among those that focused on only one dimension, physical activity was targeted more than diet. <b>The</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> greatly varied, but many were short-term or brief. Many interventions were also based on some behavioral theory, with social cognitive theory as the most widely used. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> focused on short-term changes, and rarely did any perform a follow-up evaluation. A major limitation among after school interventions was an inadequate use of process evaluations. Overall, interventions resulted in modest changes in behaviors and behavioral antecedents, and results were mixed and generally unfavorable with regards to indicators of obesity. Recommendations for enhancing <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> after school based childhood obesity interventions are presented...|$|R
