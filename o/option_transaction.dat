40|$|International audienceWe examine in {{details the}} pattern and {{systematic}} tendencies of clustering in CAC 40 index <b>option</b> <b>transaction</b> prices during the 1997 - 1999 period. Similar to extant studies in many financial markets, {{there is evidence}} of strong clustering at full index points and option prices are 90 % more likely to end with the digit 0 (multiples of 10) than with the digit 5. While the 1999 contract downsizing led to some reduction in clustering at full index point, the basic pattern of clustering remains intact. The pattern of clustering rejects the attraction theory, but is consistent with the notion of cost recovery by market makers. We find important drivers for CAC 40 index option price clustering, namely, the level of option premium, option volume and underlying asset volatility. Higher premium level, higher asset volatility and lower volume are seen to increase option price clustering. We also observe a U-shaped pattern of clustering on an intraday and intra-year basis. The option premium and volatility effects are consistent with a price level effect. The volatility effect also lends support to the notion of cost recovery by market makers. The volume effect likely represents a liquidity effect and is consistent with the Price Precision Hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{consequences}} of issuing and purchasing options on publicly traded property have been well understood since Black and Scholes developed a model for option pricing. No model of options, however, provides an accurate economic analysis of the actual transactions that issuers and purchasers engage in when options are bought and sold. One consequenceof this gap in understanding is that the rules for taxing options remain poorly developed. This Article provides a transactional analysis of option sales for the first time. The focus is on covered options, but the analysis also has implications for options in which the underlying property serves merely as a reference obligation and is owned by neither party to the transaction. The analysis demonstrates that while all options have as one component a swap of variable risks or returns on the underlying property for a fixed payment, 2 ̆ 2 in the money 2 ̆ 2 options involve, in addition, a forward transfer of the benefits and correlative burdens of a part of the underlying property that is equivalent to a forward sale of that part. Commentators have not identified this embedded forward sale because the payment arrangement between the parties to the <b>option</b> <b>transaction</b> obscures it; however, a comparison of option prices derived under the Black-Scholes model with the theoretical prices of such forwards demonstrates that the transactions are identical. The analysis also illuminates the relationships between options and other common financial transactions, such as collars, and it permits a clear assessment of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} possible tax rules for financial options...|$|E
40|$|Paul Daugerdas gained notoriety {{for himself}} and his {{erstwhile}} firm, Jenkens 2 ̆ 6 Gilchrist, as the designer of a tax shelter that uses contingent liabilities to generate artificial tax losses on a grand scale. The basic shelter transaction is surprisingly simple. In essence, it uses offsetting options to inflate the basis of property that is distributed by a partnership and then contributed to and sold by another partnership, resulting in a large tax loss without any corresponding economic loss. In principle, this type of shelter could be replicated indefinitely and generate unlimited tax losses. Mr. Daugerdas is by no means unique. The transactions that he approved as shelter counsel on behalf of Jenkens 2 ̆ 6 Gilchrist differ only in trivial details from myriad other transactions peddled by other lawyers and accountants. Contingent-liability tax shelters are a highly risky business. Mr. Daugerdas and others like him reaped enormous rewards for themselves and their clients, but some of the tax shelters they designed for credulous and wealthy clients have backfired spectacularly. Congress and the Treasury have taken remedial action to shut down abusive tax shelters, and several courts have invoked the longstanding judicial doctrines to strike down transactions that lack economic substance and have no real business or investment purpose, despite purported compliance with the literal terms of the tax laws. The proliferation of abusive tax shelters could never have gotten off the ground without the active participation of high-priced counsel. Upon discovering that the anticipated tax benefits failed to materialize, disgruntled clients have rushed to sue the lawyers, accountants, investment advisers, and banks that created and marketed defective shelters. This article discusses several challenges faced by Congress, the Treasury, and the courts in dealing with contingent-liability tax shelters. The article examines the role of Daugerdas and his firm in creating and marketing contingent-liability shelters, against the broader background of the tax shelter industry. The article explains the basic structure of the offsetting <b>option</b> <b>transaction</b> and its attempt to manipulate the partnership tax provisions. The article analyzes the contrasting rationales of two recent judicial decisions involving defective tax shelters, and argues in favor of applying Treasury regulations retroactively to shut down contingent-liability tax shelters...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the tax {{treatment}} of equity option contracts is examined. The writer gives {{an overview of}} the derivatives market in general and discusses the nature and effect of equity options in detail. Limited amendments have been made to the South African Income Tax Act No 58 of 1962 ('the Act') since the emergence of derivative instruments and at present only three types of derivative instruments are recognised: forward exchange and option contracts relating to forward exchange, interest rate swaps based on notional capital amounts and option contracts. Other than section 241 of the Act which deems all receipts and accruals from foreign exchange contracts to be income, the other sections dealing with derivatives do not concern themselves with capital or revenue classification. Accordingly, the classification of receipts and accruals arising from an equity <b>option</b> <b>transaction</b> is generally governed by the ordinary principles of South African tax law with the added problem of there being limited South African case law applying these general prinCiples to such transactions. The research undertaken in this thesis results in the establishment of a framework designed to determine the classification as revenue or capital the receipts and accruals arising from equity option contracts. Speculating, trading and investing in equity options is examined with regard to the general principles of South African tax and available case law. Hedging transactions are analysed with specific reference to their exact nature as well as general tax principles and available case law. The analogy of Krugerrands is used to draw parallels with the tax treatment of receipts and accruals arising from equity options used for hedging purposes. Once the theoretical framework has been established for revenue or capital classification, the actual tax treatment of both revenue and capital receipts is examined with reference to the Act and issues such as the gross income definition, the general deduction formula, trading stock and timing provisions are analysed and applied to receipts and accruals arising from equity option transactions. The thesis concludes with a summary of the findings and recommendations are made based on the research conducted...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} hedging <b>options</b> under proportional <b>transaction</b> costs. The Black-Scholes environment assumes frictionless markets in which one can replicate the option payoff exactly by continuous rehedging. However, when transaction costs are involved, frequent rehedging results in the accumulation of transaction costs. Conversely, infrequent hedging results in replication errors. This document attempts to evaluate several rehedging strategies by Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations are constructed so that hedging errors and transaction costs are separated permitting the relative trade-offs to be inspected. Results show that an analytic approximation to a utility maximization approach is both effective and simple to implement. The strategy results in the requirement to hedge to within a dynamic band around the Black-Scholes delta. The band {{is a function of}} the option's gamma. <b>options,</b> <b>transaction</b> costs, hedging,...|$|R

40|$|Traders of option market {{prefer to}} use basic pricing model with few {{parameters}} than use new and untested models due to the need and purchasing decisions of hedge transactions. A pricing model with less and reliable parameters is beneficial for option traders in terms of use. Therefore, prices that are commonly received by traders form an important indicator of decision making for traders. Price that is easily calculated and generally accepted has fair price quality and affects purchasing decisions directly. Besides purchasing decisions, traders must protect the portfolios against risk. Thus, especially in <b>option</b> <b>transactions,</b> <b>option</b> sensitivity parameters which are improved on options should be used.

However, this approach has one major drawback that prevents the broad application of this approach in practice: the lack of a closed-form solution. We overcome this drawback by presenting a simple yet efficient analytic approximation of the solution. We provide an empirical testing of our approximation strategy against the asymptotic and some other well-known strategies and find that our strategy outperforms all the others. <b>Option</b> hedging, <b>Transaction</b> costs, Approximation methods, Simulations,...|$|R
