5|$|Sustainable use <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> has {{targeted}} {{the idea of}} dematerialization, converting the linear path <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by product stewardship and {{the increasing use of}} material flow analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E
