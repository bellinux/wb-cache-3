50|$|Citation styles can be broadly {{divided into}} styles {{common to the}} Humanities and the Sciences, though there is {{considerable}} overlap. Some style guides, such as the Chicago Manual of Style, are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as MLA and APA styles, specify formats {{within the context of}} a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles. The various guides thus specify <b>order</b> of <b>appearance,</b> <b>for</b> example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{reports the}} {{research}} effort {{aimed at the}} micromechanical description of various phenomena characteristic for elastic-viscoplastic deformations of polycrystalline materials. The attention {{has been focused on}} metals and alloys of high specific strength, in which the inelastic deformation at the local level is constrained by an insufficient number of easy deformation modes and the presence of lamellar substructure. The monograph consists of seven chapters. The first chapter has an introductory character. It outlines the motivation and scope of the thesis and indicates fields of applicability of the results obtained. In Chapter 2 a model of a single crystal deforming by slip and twinning is proposed, together with a new reorientation scheme formulated in <b>order</b> to account <b>for</b> <b>appearance</b> of twin-related orientations in polycrystalline aggregates. In {{the second part of the}} chapter an implementation of this model within known scale transition schemes is discussed. The validation of the proposed framework, when modelling the overall response and texture evolution for polycrystalline materials of hig...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{friction}} and frequency measurements {{as a function}} of temperature have been carried out in Nb and Nb-Zr policrystalline samples, using a torsion pendulum in the temperature range between 300 K and 700 K, the heating rate was 1 K/min and the pressure was kept better than 5 x 10 - 3 mbar. Metals with bcc lattice containing solute atoms dissolved interstitially often show anelastic behaviour due to a process know as stress-induced <b>ordering,</b> responsible <b>for</b> the <b>appearance</b> of Snoek peaks. In the Nb sample it has been identified two constituent peaks corresponding to the interstitial-matrix interactions (Nb-O and Nb-N), but for the Nb-Zr samples with interstitial solute concentrations very close to those measured for the unalloyed Nb, it was not observed any mechanical relaxation peaks due to the presence of oxygen and nitrogen in solid solution...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated separation between systems supporting memory <b>for</b> <b>appearance</b> and memory <b>for</b> location. However, the interpretation of these results is complicated by a confound occurring because of the simultaneous presentation of objects in multiple-item arrays when assessing memory <b>for</b> <b>appearance</b> and the sequential presentation of items when assessing memory for location. This paper reports an experiment in which sequential or simultaneous modes of presentation were factorially manipulated with memory <b>for</b> visual <b>appearance</b> or memory <b>for</b> location. Spatial interference (tapping) or visual interference (dynamic visual noise) were presented during retention. Appearance versus location interacted {{with the type of}} interference task, but mode of presentation did not. These results are consistent with the view that different subsystems within visuo-spatial working memory support memory <b>for</b> <b>appearance</b> and memory <b>for</b> location.

40|$|Randomness and discreteness <b>for</b> <b>appearance</b> of pop-out of {{the single}} crystal silicon with a (100) {{orientation}} were studied by a self-made indentation device. For a given maximum penetration load, the load Ppo <b>for</b> <b>appearance</b> of pop-out fluctuates in a relatively large range, which {{makes it hard to}} study the effect of the loading/unloading rate on the load Ppo. Experimental results with different maximum penetration loads indicate that the critical penetration load <b>for</b> <b>appearance</b> of pop-out is in the range of 15 mN~ 20 mN for the current used single crystal silicon. For a given maximum penetration load, the load Ppo <b>for</b> <b>appearance</b> of pop-out seems random and discrete, but in the point of statistics, it has an obviously increasing trend with increase of the maximum penetration load and also the fraction Ppo/Pmax approximately keeps in the range of 0. 2 ~ 0. 5 for different maximum penetration loads changing from 15 mN to 150 mN...|$|R
