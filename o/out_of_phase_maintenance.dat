50|$|This phase based {{technique}} was also exploited by Steve Reich in tape works composed between 1965 and 1966. Tape loops of phase-identical segments of recorded sound were played synchronously using multiple tape recorders and were then gradually moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> by increasing or decreasing the playback speed {{of one of}} the players. The result of the recordings moving in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> with each other was a transformative process where different timbres, beats, and harmonics were heard; some of which sounded markedly different from the original segment of recorded material. If the sound source had a natural cadence, the phasing created continuously shifting changes to the perceived rhythm as the material drifted in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase.</b> By using additional tracks and loops with identical source material the possibilities for creating a wider range <b>of</b> <b>phasing</b> relationships increases.|$|R
50|$|Acoustic {{reactance}} represents, as well, {{the pressure}} that is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> with the motion and causes no average energy transfer. For example, a closed bulb connected to an organ pipe will have air moving into it and pressure, but they are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> so no net energy is transmitted into it. While the pressure rises, air moves in, and while it falls, it moves out, but the average pressure when the air moves in {{is the same as}} that when it moves out, so the power flows back and forth but with no time averaged energy transfer. The electrical analogy for this is a capacitor connected across a power line. Current flows through the capacitor but it is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> with the voltage, so no net power is transmitted into it.|$|R

25|$|To {{appreciate}} how this quadrature phase shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates {{while maintaining a}} constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal displacements of the dot, relative {{to the center of}} the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> by one quarter of a cycle. The displacements are said to be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> by one quarter of a wavelength.|$|R

50|$|A humbucking pickup, {{shown in}} {{the image on the}} right, is {{composed}} of two coils. Each coil is wound reverse to one another. However, the six magnetic poles are opposite in polarity in each winding. Since ambient hum from power-supply transformers, radio frequencies, or electrical devices reaches the coils as common-mode noise, it induces an equal voltage in each coil. Because the windings are reversed in each pickup coil, the induced voltages cancel each other out. However, the signal from the guitar string is doubled, due to the phase reversal caused by the <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> magnets. The magnets being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> in conjunction with the coil windings being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> put the guitar string signal from each pickup in phase with one another. Therefore, the voltage of the signal is approximately doubled, if the two coils are connected in series.|$|R
