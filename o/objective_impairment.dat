Results from empirical studies examining associations between insomnia and cognitive impairment, however, are mixed. Research is needed that compares treatment-seeking and community-based insomnia study samples, measures subjective {{as well as}} objective cognitive functioning, and considers participants ’ pre-insomnia cognitive function. Design and Participants: We used data from the Dunedin Study, a representative birth cohort of 1, 037 individuals, to examine whether insomnia in early midlife was associated with subjective and objective cognitive functioning. We also tested whether individuals with insomnia who reported seeking treatment for their sleep problems (treatment-seekers) showed greater impairment than other individuals with insomnia (non-treatment-seekers). The role of key confounders, including childhood cognitive ability and comorbid health conditions, was evaluated. Measurements: Insomnia was diagnosed at age 38 according to DSM-IV criteria. Objective neuropsychological assessments at age 38 included the WAIS-IV IQ test, the Wechsler Memory Scale, and the Trail-Making Test. Childhood cognitive functioning was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). Results: A total of 949 cohort members were assessed for insomnia symptoms and other study measures at age 38. Although cohort members with insomnia (n = 186, 19. 6 %) had greater subjective cognitive impairment than their peers at age 38, they did not exhibit greater <b>objective</b> <b>impairment</b> on formal testing. Treatment-seekers, however, exhibited significant <b>objective</b> <b>impairment</b> compared to non-treatment-seekers.

Five hundred and sixteen patients (352 men, 164 women) {{with an average of}} 58  years of age (range, 18 – 100) were asked to simultaneously complete the DASH and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) scores at their initial visit to a hand surgeon. Pearson's correlations between each of the DASH items and the CES-D score were obtained. The DASH score was then adjusted for the influence of Depression for women and men using ordinary least-squares regression and subtracting the product of the regression coefficient and the CES-D score from the raw DASH score. The average DASH score was 24 points (SD, 19; range, 0 – 91), and the average CES-D score was 10 points (SD, 8; range, 0 – 42). Thirteen of the 30 items of the DASH demonstrated correlation greater than r[*]=[*] 0. 20. Adjustment of these DASH items for the depression effect led to significant reductions in the mean (5. 5 points; p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and standard deviation (0. 8 points; p[*]<[*] 0. 01) of DASH scores. Adjustment for depression alone had a significant but perhaps clinically marginal effect on the variance of DASH scores.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} cerebral white matter lesions (WML) and subjective cognitive dysfunction. Background: Subjective cognitive dysfunction is present when a person perceives failures of cognitive function. When annoying enough, these failures will be expressed as complaints. Subjective cognitive dysfunction may be a prelude to or coincide with <b>objective</b> cognitive <b>impairment.</b> WML have been related to <b>objective</b> cognitive <b>impairment</b> and dementia, but their relationship with subjective cognitive dysfunction is not clear. Previous population-based studies on the latter relationship have been limited in sample size, recording of subjective cognitive function, and assessment of WML severity. Methods: We randomly sampled 1, 049 elderly nondemented participants from the general population. Data on subjective cognitive dysfunction and its progression were derived from a 15 -item questionnaire. Objective cognitive performance was assessed using a series of neuropsychological tests. WML were scored on MRI for periventricular and subcortical regions separately. Results: WML were associated with more subjective cognitive failures. WML were more severe for participants reporting progression of these failures compared with participants without these failures, especially within participants with better than average cognitive performance (p = 0. 008, for periventricular WML). Participants with severe WML reported progression of cognitive failures {{more than twice as}} often than did those with little or no WML. The relationship between the severity of WML and subjective cognitive failures was present for periventricular and subcortical WML.

The prevalence of subjective cognitive failures in patients was determined and compared with 146 age- and sex-matched stroke-free controls. The relation of subjective failures with objective cognitive performance was investigated with linear and logistic regression analysis. 160 patients with a TIA and 277 with an ischemic stroke were included. After a mean follow-up of 10. 1 (SD 8. 3) years, the prevalence of subjective memory failures was 86. 4 % and that of subjective executive failures was 67. 4 % in patients, versus 69. 7 % (p = 0. 008) and 41. 4 % (p = 0. 002) in controls. A weak association between subjective memory failures and objective immediate (beta - 0. 12, p = 0. 011) and delayed memory performance (beta - 0. 13, p = 0. 010) was observed in patients. Subjective cognitive failures are prevalent after stroke in young adults, but not strongly related to <b>objective</b> cognitive <b>impairment.</b> Therefore, extensive neuropsychological assessment is essential for determination of <b>objective</b> cognitive <b>impairment.</b> However, it is important that subjective cognitive failures are recognized as they may indicate underlying psychosocial problems...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Growing {{interest}} {{in understanding the}} relationship between subjective memory complaints (SMCs) and objective measures of memory abilities {{emphasizes the importance of}} SMC assessment for diagnostic purposes. The present study investigated the relationship between SMCs and objective memory deficits in elderly adults by analysis of the factor structure of the Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ). METHODS: Objective and subjective assessment of memory function was carried out in 112 elderly adults. Principal component analysis was then performed to study the factor structure of the EMQ in relation to the assessment. RESULTS: <b>Objective</b> memory <b>impairment</b> was evident in 8. 9 % of elderly adults. The factor analysis showed that the most interpretable solution to detect objective changes with the EMQ comprised only 20 out of 28 items of the original list, with three factors explaining 48 % of total variance. This version was more sensitive for detecting SMCs in elderly adults, since one out of the three factors was able to differentiate subjects with objective memory deficits from those without. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results illustrate that this 20 -item version of the revised EMQ may serve as an easy-to-use instrument during clinical screening, to evaluate <b>objective</b> memory <b>impairment</b> in individuals who report SMC...|$|R

40|$|OBJECT: Chronic fatigue {{syndrome}} (CFS) patients report usually cognitive complaints. They also have frequently comorbid depression {{that can be}} considered a possible explanation for their cognitive dysfunction. We evaluated the cognitive performance of patients with CFS in comparison with a control group of healthy volunteers and a group of patients with MDD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with CFS, 25 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 25 healthy control subjects were given standardized tests of attention, working memory, and verbal and visual episodic memory, and were also tested for effects related to lack of effort/simulation, suggestibility, and fatigue. RESULTS: Patients with CFS had slower phasic alertness, and also had impaired working, visual and verbal episodic memory compared to controls. They were, however, no more sensitive than the other groups to suggestibility or to fatigue induced during the cognitive session. Cognitive impairments in MDD patients were strongly associated with depression and subjective fatigue; in patients with CFS, there was a weaker correlation between cognition and depression (and no correlation with fatigue).

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} insomnia and chronic use of benzodiazepines on the cognitive and psychomotor per-formance of older adults. Three conditions, matched on age, gender, and education, were compared: 20 prolonged users of benzodiazepines for insomnia, 20 unmedicated insomniacs, and 20 good sleepers. The participants completed neu-ropsychological tests of memory, attention/concentration, psychomotor speed, and executive functions, as well as sub-jective evaluations of their actual performance. Individuals with insomnia, both medicated and unmedicated, per-formed worse than good sleepers on the attention/concentration factor. There was no other objective evidence of performance impairments. However, unmedicated insomniacs had lower performance expectancies and subjectively rated their performance more negatively relative to medicated insomniacs and good sleepers. Both insomnia conditions also rated their performance as lower compared with their perceived potential. It is suggested that the attention/concen-tration difficulties experienced by medicated and unmedicated older adults with insomnia {{may be linked to}} a state of hyperarousal. The discrepancies between subjective reports of daytime deficits and <b>objective</b> <b>impairments</b> may reflect a generalized faulty appraisal of sleep and daytime functioning among individuals with insomnia complaints.

40|$|Background: Subjective memory {{complaints}} are a requirement {{in the diagnosis}} of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as they are thought to indicate a decline in objective memory performance. However, recent {{research suggests that the}} relationship between subjective memory complaint and <b>objective</b> memory <b>impairment</b> is less clear. Thus, it is possible that many people without subjective memory complaints who develop Alzheimer's disease are precluded from a diagnosis of MCI. Methods: The present study examined the relationship between subjective memory complaint assessed using the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) and <b>objective</b> memory <b>impairment</b> assessed using standard neuropsychological measures in cases of amnestic MCI (n = 48), non-amnestic MCI (n = 27), and unimpaired healthy participants (n = 64). Results: Correlational and regression analyses indicated that subjective memory complaints displayed a poor relationship with objective memory performance. A subsequent discriminant function analysis indicated that subjective memory complaints failed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of MCI and resulted in increased rates of false negative and false positive diagnoses. Conclusion: The {{results of the present study}} suggest that a diagnostic criterion of subjective memory complaint reduces the accuracy of MCI diagnosis, resulting in an elevated rate of false positive and false negative diagnoses. The results of this study in conjunction with recent research indicate that a criterion of subjective memory complaint should be discarded from emerging diagnostic criteria for MCI...|$|R

40|$|Current {{diagnosis}} and treatment of movement impairment post-stroke is based on the subjective assessment of select movements by a trained clinical specialist. However, modern low-cost motion capture technology allows for the development of automated quantitative assessment of motor impairment. Such outcome measures are crucial for advancing post-stroke treatment methods. We sought to develop an automated method of measuring the quality of movement in clinically-relevant terms from low-cost motion capture. Unconstrained movements of upper extremity were performed by people with chronic hemiparesis and recorded by standard and low-cost motion capture systems. Quantitative scores derived from motion capture were compared to qualitative clinical scores produced by trained human raters. A strong linear relationship was found between qualitative scores and quantitative scores derived from both standard and low-cost motion capture. Performance of the automated scoring algorithm was matched by averaged qualitative scores of three human raters. We conclude that low-cost motion capture combined with an automated scoring algorithm is a feasible method to assess objectively upper-arm impairment post stroke. The application of this technology may not only reduce the cost of assessment of post-stroke movement impairment, but also promote the acceptance of <b>objective</b> <b>impairment</b> measures into routine medical practice...|$|E
30|$|The {{reported}} complication {{rates of}} palmar versus dorsal locking plates {{in the literature}} remain contradictory. While several studies report higher complication rates after palmar locked plating [9 – 11], others show {{no difference between the}} two approaches [12, 13]. Making the situation even more confusing, other studies report higher complication rates after dorsal plating [3, 14]. In the present study, the complication rates encountered in the dorsal group were significantly higher. This difference remained statistically significant even after comparison of the type C fractures only; however, this could be attributed to the more demanding surgical technique of dorsal plating with possible devascularization of soft tissues and bony structures, as well as the iatrogenic tendon injury with the addition of longer operative time. Additionally, the positioning of dorsal plates right under the tendon sheaths can further irritate the tendons postoperatively and lead to implant-associated pain. While implant removal rates in the dorsal group were also significantly higher, it was interesting that in almost half of the cases, implant removal was initiated by the patients themselves, {{even in the absence of}} <b>objective</b> <b>impairment.</b> The problem of foreign body feeling has not yet been overcome, even after plate design optimization [15].

Method: This paper reports an analysis of data from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing study. Structured interviews were conducted with community-dwelling older people to assess a range of aspects of cognitive functioning and mood. Data from two time points approximately 24 months apart were used in this analysis. At baseline, participants without dementia or severe cognitive impairment were categorised into three groups according to cognitive status. Mood was investigated by assessing symptoms of anxiety and depression which were defined using a diagnostic algorithm. Associations were tested using logistic regression and chi square analyses. Results: A clear association was shown between SMC and mood, both cross-sectionally and over time. The relationship between our two competing definitions of MCI suggested that mood problems were more strongly related to the presence of SMC than <b>objective</b> cognitive <b>impairment.</b> Conclusion: SMC may be a function of anxiety and depression rather than being related to objective cognitive function.

However, both fatigue associated conditions as the {{chronic fatigue syndrome}} (CFS) and sleepiness associated conditions as the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) reported cognitive impairment with lowered attention, concentration and memory performances. Fifteen pure CFS patients, without primary sleep disorders or clinically relevant sleepiness, were compared to 15 untreated SAHS patients, without clinically relevant fatigue, and to 16 healthy controls of similar age. Auditory verbal learning test (AVLT), digit span, digit symbol and finger tapping test (FTT) were used as cognitive and behavioural measures. In addition we assessed daytime EEG spectral power and P 300 evoked potentials. With exception for the digit span, all tests showed lower performances in patient groups. Recall on the AVLT did not differ between the two patient groups, but the digit and symbol spans showed more severe impairment in SAHS patients. Psychomotor performance on the FTT presented with slower hit rates in SAHS than in CFS. EEG theta power was highest in CFS patients. P 300 latencies and amplitudes did not differ between groups.

This study investigated the relation between subjective appraisal of cognitive function, objective cognitive task performance, and brain activity during a cognitive task using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Sixteen fibromyalgia patients and 13 healthy pain-free controls completed a battery of questionnaires, including the Multiple Ability Self-Report Questionnaire (MASQ), a measure of self-perceived cognitive difficulties. Participants were evaluated for working memory performance using a modified N-back working memory task while undergoing Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI measurements. Fibromyalgia patients and controls did not differ in working memory performance. Subjective appraisal of cognitive function was associated with better performance (accuracy) on the working memory task in healthy controls but not in fibromyalgia patients. In fibromyalgia patients, increased perceived cognitive difficulty was positively correlated with the severity of their symptoms. BOLD response during the working memory task did not differ between the groups. BOLD response correlated with task accuracy in control subjects but not in fibromyalgia patients. Increased subjective cognitive impairment correlated with decreased BOLD response in both groups but in different anatomic regions. In conclusion, “fibrofog” appears to be better characterized by subjective rather than <b>objective</b> <b>impairment.</b> Neurologic correlates of this subjective experience of impairment might be separate from those involved in the performance of cognitive tasks...|$|E
40|$|Background and <b>objectives</b> <b>Impairment</b> of HDL {{function}} {{has been}} associated with cardiovascular events in patients with kidney failure. The protein composition of HDLs is altered in these patients, presumably compromising the cardioprotective effects of HDLs. This post hoc study assessed the relation of distinct HDL-bound proteins with cardiovascular outcomes in a dialysis population. Design, setting, participants, & measurements The concentrations of HDL-associated serum amyloid A (SAA) and surfactant protein B (SP-B) were measured in 1152 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on hemodialysis participating in The German Diabetes Dialysis Study whowere randomly assigned to double-blind treatment of 20 mg atorvastatin daily ormatching placebo. The association of SAA(HDL) and SP-B(HDL) with cardiovascular outcomes was assessed in multivariate regression models adjusted for known clinical risk factors. ResultsHigh concentrationsof SAA(HDL) were significantly andpositively associatedwith the riskof cardiac events (hazard ratio per 1 SD higher, 1. 09; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 01 to 1. 19). High concentrations of SP-B(HDL) were significantly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio per 1 SD higher, 1. 10; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 02 to 1. 19). Adjustment for HDL cholesterol did not affect these associations. Conclusions In patientswith diabetes on hemodialysis, SAA(HDL) and SP-B(HDL) were related to cardiac events and all-cause mortality, respectively, and they were independent of HDL cholesterol. These findings indicate that a remodeling of theHDLproteomewas associatedwith a higher risk for cardiovascular events andmortality in patients with ESRD...|$|R
40|$|Article abstract—Objective: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} cerebral white matter lesions (WML) and subjective cognitive dysfunction. Background: Subjective cognitive dysfunction is present when a person perceives failures of cogni-tive function. When annoying enough, these failures will be expressed as complaints. Subjective cognitive dysfunction may be a prelude to or coincide with <b>objective</b> cognitive <b>impairment.</b> WML have been related to <b>objective</b> cognitive <b>impairment</b> and dementia, but their relationship with subjective cognitive dysfunction is not clear. Previous population-based studies on the latter relationship have been limited in sample size, recording of subjective cognitive function, and assessment of WML severity. Methods: We randomly sampled 1, 049 elderly nondemented participants from the general population. Data on subjective cognitive dysfunction and its progression were derived from a 15 -item questionnaire. Objective cognitive performance was assessed using a series of neuropsychological tests. WML were scored on MRI for periventricular and subcortical regions separately. Results: WML were associated with more subjective cognitive failures. WML were more severe for participants reporting progression of these failures compared with participants without these failures, espe-cially within participants with better than average cognitive performance (p 5 0. 008, for periventricular WML). Partici-pants with severe WML reported progression of cognitive failures {{more than twice as}} often than did those with little or no WML. The relationship between the severity of WML and subjective cognitive failures was present for periventricular and subcortical WML. Conclusions: WML are associated with subjective cognitive failures and in particular with reportin...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of social dysfunctions {{in a general}} population sample and in different diagnostic groups was investigated by using the Social Interview Schedule (SIS). Based {{on the results of}} the general population sample, several of the a priori derived cut-off scores of the SIS were modified. The analysis of the general population sample revealed sex-specific relationships between age and different aspects of social functioning. Especially for younger women significantly more objective social restrictions, were found due to the burden of multiple role responsibilities. With regard to different diagnostic subgroups including patients and mostly untreated cases from the community sample with Affective Disorders and Anxiety Disorders, results indicate that the degree of social impairment and dysfunctions and the degree of satisfaction with different role areas are strongly dependent on type of disorder and on former treatment status. Specific findings are: (1) The highest number of social impairments and dysfunctions were found in cases and patients with affective syndromes and in schizophrenic patients, but not in schizoaffective patients. (2) Management difficulties and dissatisfaction in intimate relationships were primarily found in depressed women. (3) Unlike anxiety patients, anxiety cases, although mostly chronically ill, had significantly less <b>objective</b> <b>impairments</b> and a lower rate of dissatisfaction than depressed cases. The results are discussed with special reference to the possible key role of depression for the development of social dysfunctions, as measured by the SIS. (4) Problems were, however, acknowledged concerning the use of the SIS with severely disturbed chronic schizophrenic patients...|$|R
