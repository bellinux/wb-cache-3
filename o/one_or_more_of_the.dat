5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E

Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye muscles it controls.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} {{methods that}} rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar-based methods. Methods that require observation of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods. Urine test kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson found no evidence that there was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio call was received from Amana to indicate the nature of any problem, or even that the crew was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E
5|$|Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr all {{released}} solo albums in 1970.

With Starr's participation, Harrison staged the Concert for Bangladesh in New York City in August 1971. Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974, later bootlegged as A Toot and a Snore in '74, Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.|$|E

5|$|The General Society of Mayflower Descendants, or The Mayflower Society, is a genealogical {{organization}} {{of individuals who}} have documented their descents from <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 102 passengers who arrived on the Mayflower in 1620.

5|$|The outputs of a {{structural}} alignment are a superposition {{of the atomic}} coordinate sets and a minimal {{root mean square deviation}} (RMSD) between the structures. The RMSD of two aligned structures indicates their divergence from one another. Structural alignment can be complicated by the existence of multiple protein domains within <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input structures, because changes in relative orientation of the domains between two structures to be aligned can artificially inflate the RMSD.|$|E

5|$|A {{multiple}} sequence alignment (MSA) is {{a sequence}} alignment {{of three or}} more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA. In many cases, the input set of query sequences are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship by which they share a lineage and are descended from a common ancestor. From the resulting MSA, sequence homology can be inferred and phylogenetic analysis can be conducted to assess the sequences' shared evolutionary origins. Visual depictions of the alignment as in the image at right illustrate mutation events such as point mutations (single amino acid or nucleotide changes) that appear as differing characters in a single alignment column, and insertion or deletion mutations (indels or gaps) that appear as hyphens in <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequences in the alignment. Multiple sequence alignment {{is often used to}} assess sequence conservation of protein domains, tertiary and secondary structures, and even individual amino acids or nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' {{powers were}} now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the {{completion}} of the Second Settlement, July 1, 23 BC. Almost as importantly, the Principate now had constitutional stability. Later Roman Emperors were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often newly appointed Emperors would decline <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> honorifics given to Augustus in order to display humility. Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had been granted them by the Senate. Later Emperors took to wearing the civic crown, consular insignia, and the purple robes of a Triumphant general (toga picta), which became the imperial insignia well into the Byzantine era.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
