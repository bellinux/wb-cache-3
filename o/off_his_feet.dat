5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1992, Duggan {{was moved}} to undercard status. In early 1993, he was {{involved}} in a feud with the then near 600 pound Yokozuna, who was the number one contender to the WWF Championship. Manager Mr. Fuji was bad mouthing America and Duggan challenged his protégé to a match. The match was promoted by claiming that no one had knocked Yokozuna <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> even though Yokozuna had fallen <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> shortly before, during the 1993 Royal Rumble match. The stipulations to the match were if Duggan knocked Yokozuna <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> Duggan would win. On the February 6 edition of Superstars, Duggan won the match after knocking Yokozuna down completely, but then was manhandled by the much bigger Yokozuna after the match and fell victim to four Banzai Drops, sidelining Duggan for about four months.|$|E

Shortly after the fight, Frazier announced his retirement.|$|E

Trish tried to hit Kane with a steel chair, but Lita hit her with a crutch. Viscera then executed a Chokebomb on Kane, but only got a two count. Kane then came back and hit a big boot and a chokeslam to get the pinfall. Trish then verbally slammed Viscera, who responded by bear hugging and splashing Trish, who was then taken out on a stretcher.|$|E

Louis Lowery, a photographer with the Marine publication “Leatherneck” who was coming down the volcano after an enemy grenade explosion on top had knocked him <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and broke his camera. Lowery told them that the flag had already been raised at 10:40 am, and he had gotten photos of the flag on the summit.

500|$|In early May, the 2nd Brigade was {{selected}} to move to Cape Helles to reinforce the British forces for the Second Battle of Krithia. After being transferred by boat, on 8 May, Bennett advanced with his battalion in impossible conditions. Bennett was the only officer of the 6th, and one of few in the 2nd Brigade, to survive the advance unscathed, although he was lucky do so; as he led the charge, a Turkish bullet hit the ammunition pouch he wore, exploding the ammunition in it.

She's way out of his league, {{but there is a}} lot of chemistry between them. I think they'd make a really good couple. That would be cool. Fatboy may be young, but he's got an old soul and he's not just some young boy messing about. There is potential there if Denise could see it, but because of the age thing, I think she might worry that people were saying things about her. Right now, she's just enjoying herself." [...] Norwood added that while the pair's relationship was sexual, a serious future for them could be possible.|$|E
500|$|In {{what was}} billed as the [...] "biggest main event in sports entertainment," [...] the match pitted WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan {{defending}} the title against André the Giant (with Bobby Heenan). Howard Finkel introduced the guest ring announcer, Bob Uecker, who in turn introduced the guest time keeper, Entertainment Tonight host Mary Hart. The fans booed André heavily and pelted him and his manager Bobby Heenan with trash as they rode the cart to the ring. In contrast, Hogan, who walked to the ring, came out to a huge ovation. Approximately two minutes into the match, Hogan attempted to body slam André, but {{he was unable to}} lift The Giant and nearly lost the match when Andre fell on him and almost pinned him. After the match had battled back and forth, André gave Hogan an Irish whip {{to the far side of}} the ring and attempted a big boot on Hogan, but Hogan ducked it and came off the ropes to give André a clothesline to take him <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> for the first time in the match.
