5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The provisions {{are very similar}} to those for sale of goods agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods,</b> but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} Coffin {{came to realize}} that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> he sold in his {{business}} were produced with slave labor.

5|$|The story survives {{through the}} Hundred Rolls, the great {{survey of the}} English {{hundreds}} made by Edward I, in 1274-5, on returning to his new kingdom from crusade. The scheme, impractical as it might seem, was supposedly based on contemporary sagas of Viking heroes.

5|$|To {{cater to}} the heavy leisure traffic {{at the end of}} the 19th century, Cromer Beach had a large station {{building}} in a half-timbered style, and a large goods yard. The station originally included a bar, which was closed in 1966. Following the introduction of conductor-guard working, the ticket facilities were no longer needed and the building fell into disuse; it was renovated and reopened as a public house in 1998. A large supermarket was built on the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> yards in 1991.|$|E
5000|$|Plato’s Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> {{is often}} criticized as too general. [...] Plato’s Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> does not define {{things in the}} {{physical}} world that are good, and therefore lacks connectedness to reality. [...] Because Plato’s Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> lacks instruction, or ways for the individual to be <b>good,</b> Plato’s Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> is not applicable to human ethics since there is no defined method for which goodness can be pursued. Through Socrates in The Republic, Plato acknowledges <b>the</b> Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> as an elusive concept and proposes that <b>the</b> Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> be accepted as a hypothesis, rather than criticized for its weaknesses. According to Socrates in The Republic, the only alternative to accepting a hypothesis is to refute all the objections against it, which is counterproductive in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> contemplation.|$|R
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Plato, Aristotle discusses <b>the</b> Forms <b>of</b> <b>Good</b> in critical terms {{several times in}} both of his major surviving ethical works, the Eudemian and Nicomachean Ethics. Aristotle argues that Plato’s Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> {{does not apply to}} the physical world, for Plato does not assign “goodness” to anything in the existing world. Because Plato’s Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> does not explain events in the physical world, humans {{have no reason to believe}} that <b>the</b> Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> exists and <b>the</b> Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> is thereby irrelevant to human ethics.|$|R

5|$|Although {{it is now}} {{possible}} to reach the station through the Temple Quay office development (on the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> shed) or from the Bristol Ferry Boat Company landing stage on the Floating Harbour, the traditional and main approach is from Temple Gate. Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Tudor-style offices, later used by the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, face this road and are flanked on the north side by an archway that used to be the main station for departing passengers; a matching arch on the other side was the arrivals gateway but was removed when the station was expanded in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
5|$|However, by {{this point}} the Palace Gates Line was in severe decline. Passenger numbers had fallen greatly since {{the opening of the}} Piccadilly line, while freight usage dropped {{throughout}} the 1950s as a result of improved road haulage and declining demand for coal. The line was closed to passengers on 7 January 1963. With freight usage dwindling to a trickle following the ending of passenger services, the goods yard was closed on 7 December 1964. The site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> yard was used {{for the construction of a}} large apartment block known as The Sandlings, and Noel Park & Wood Green railway station was converted into commercial premises, before being demolished in the early 1970s to become the site of the eastern section of Wood Green Shopping City.|$|E

5000|$|Aristotle {{along with}} other {{scholars}} sees <b>the</b> Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> as synonymous with <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> One.

[...] Since Plato does not define good things, interpreting Plato’s Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> through <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> One allows scholars to explain how Plato’s Form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> relates to <b>the</b> physical world.

5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require the owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had {{to decide whether the}} customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount and the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead {{in the right way}} so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E
5|$|After the action, {{one of the}} English privateers quarrelled {{with one}} of his French shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, Morgan arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the man would be hanged on his return to Port Royal. Morgan kept his word and the sailor was hanged. After {{dividing}} the spoils of the conquest of Puerto Principe, Morgan announced a plan to attack Porto Bello (now in modern-day Panama). The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main, and on one of the main routes of trade between the Spanish territories and Spain. Because of the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> passing through its port, Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town. The 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left Morgan's service and returned to Tortuga. Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs {{parallel}} to the railway, north of the line. There {{was to be a}} fully accessible footbridge across the line, with both ramp and stairs, as well as a pedestrian crossing across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> yard would be maintained for Network Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would be no need for a footbridge. There would be disabled parking and a pick up/drop off point adjacent to the entrance, although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. Noise mitigation options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths. The line is due to reopen in 2020.|$|E
5|$|The road {{followed}} by Alboin to reach Italy {{has been the}} subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek. According to Neil Christie the Lombards divided themselves into migrational groups, with a vanguard scouting the road, probably following the Poetovio – Celeia – Emona – Forum Iulii route, while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> and chattels they brought with them, and possibly also because they were waiting for the Saxons to join them on the road. By September raiding parties were looting Venetia, but it was probably only in 569 that the Julian Alps were crossed at the Vipava Valley; the eyewitness Secundus of Non gives the date as May 20 or 21. The 569 date for the entry into Italy is not void of difficulties however, and Jörg Jarnut believes the conquest of most of Venetia had already been completed in 568. According to Carlo Guido Mor, a major difficulty remains in explaining how Alboin could have reached Milan on September 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the May of the same year.|$|E
