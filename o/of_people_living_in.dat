5|$|The {{pillars of}} the {{economic}} plan were trade and fiscal budget surpluses and a high exchange rate for the United States dollar. The surplus was increased by taxes levied during de la Rúa's presidency and the devaluation which occurred during the Duhalde administration. Kirchner sought to rebuild the Argentine industrial base, public works and public services, renegotiating the operation of public services privatized by Carlos Menem and owned by foreign companies. His policies were accompanied by a nationalist rhetoric sympathetic to the poor. However, despite of the financial prosperity, {{there was no significant}} decrease in the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> poverty, which was 8 to 10 million people, or almost 25% of the country.|$|E
5|$|As the {{population}} expanded, {{some of these}} settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was again settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing) becoming permanent settlements. Perhaps ten per cent of {{the population}} lived {{in one of the}} burghs that had grown up in the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. They may have had a mean population of about 2,000, and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 {{at the beginning of the}} era, but many were much smaller than 1,000. During the seventeenth century, the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the capital grew rapidly. It also expanded beyond the city walls in suburbs at Cowgate, Bristo and Westport and by 1750, with its suburbs, it had reached a population of 57,000. The only other towns above 10,000 by the end of the period were Glasgow with 32,000, Aberdeen with around 16,000 and Dundee with 12,000.|$|E
5|$|Other {{people from}} much further afield {{in the former}} British colonies have arrived since the 1950s: in particular, 6% <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> England have family origins in the Indian subcontinent, mostly India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 2.90% of the {{population}} are black, from Africa and the Caribbean, especially former British colonies. There is {{a significant number of}} Chinese and British Chinese. In 2007, 22% of primary school children in England were from ethnic minority families, and in 2011 that figure was 26.5%. About half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 was due to immigration. Debate over immigration is politically prominent; according to a 2009 Home Office poll, 80% of people want to cap it. The ONS has projected that the population will grow by nine million between 2014 and 2039.|$|E

She simply sits in the club with her band and sings for her small, mostly black and Latino audience. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Harlem, doing their daily chores, including a supporting cast of transvestite prostitutes, a pimp, and a black gang member who shows off the scars on his body. During the intermediate verses, Madonna is shown writhing {{in the lap of}} an older, maternal woman, who symbolically baptizes her by splashing water on her forehead. Near the video's end, Madonna walks through the neighborhood and climbs a set of stairs to have a reunion with her family, a young Latin man and their supposed son. The video ends with Madonna smiling towards the camera while sitting at the nightclub.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the redistribution of population {{as a result of}} the clearances and the industrial revolution that began in the eighteenth century, these numbers must have been evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing), becoming permanent settlements. Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of many burghs that had grown up in the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. It has been suggested that they had a mean population of about 2,000, but many were much smaller than 1,000, and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 at the beginning of the era. During the seventeenth century the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the capital grew rapidly.

5|$|Junction 28 of the M5 {{lies within}} the parish of Cullompton {{and a short}} {{distance}} from the town centre. Other major road links are the A373 to Honiton and the former A38 to Exeter which runs through the town, and is now the B3181. In 2001 61.6% <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Cullompton travelled to work by car or van and 83% of households had at least one car. In October 1969 a bypass was completed but after only five years this was upgraded to form part of the M5. Since this time traffic coming from the south of Cullompton to the M5 junction has had to pass through the centre of the town. There are now problems with air quality in the town and Mid Devon District Council have made the whole of the built up area in Cullompton an Air quality management area. Traffic on the exit slip road leaving the M5 northbound often backed up onto the motorway, so the Highways Agency and Devon County Council made junction improvements by widening roads, introducing traffic lights and reopening the left hand lane of the northbound slip road, at a cost of £1.3m. This cost was covered by businesses moving to Cullompton.|$|E
