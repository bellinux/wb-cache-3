5|$|The next European {{known to}} have visited the Key Biscayne area was Pedro Menéndez de Avilés. In 1565 his ship took refuge in Biscayne Bay from a storm.

The mission was abandoned three years later in 1570. No other mission was established <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> until 1743, but it was withdrawn a few months later.|$|E
5|$|General Lee {{responded to}} the British landing with several actions. He began {{reinforcing}} positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at {{the northern end of}} Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> opposite Fort Sullivan.|$|E

5|$|Two {{other factors}} {{have often been}} cited in Stroma's depopulation: the {{building}} of the nuclear power station at nearby Dounreay in the 1950s, which created many new jobs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland,</b> and in the same decade the construction of a harbour on Stroma on which many islanders were employed. Although it has been claimed that this gave the islanders the incentive (and the means) to leave, local historian Donald A. Young points out that of islanders who left after 1945, only one went directly from Stroma to Dounreay. Most of the rest either continued fishing or carried on crofting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland,</b> while others found alternative jobs. Some ex-islanders eventually found jobs at Dounreay, but they had already moved to the mainland for work or education.|$|E

5|$|Although {{extrapolated}} peak winds {{based on}} whatever reports are available exist for every storm in 1861, estimated minimum barometric air pressure listings are only {{present for the}} three storms that directly affected the United States. Two hurricanes during the year made landfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> United States, and as they progressed inland, information on their meteorological demise was limited.

5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of the Great Powers. The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980s and {{increased}} prosperity <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland,</b> Chinese domestic workers were dominant.

During the 1990s Indonesia and Thailand followed the Filipino model of labour export to deal with domestic economic crises, and Hong Kong families began hiring workers from those countries as well. The Indonesians provided competition, since those workers were often prepared to accept half the minimum wage.|$|E
