40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The human genome {{contains more than}} 1, 000 microRNA (miRNA) genes, which are transcribed mainly by RNA polymerase II. <b>The</b> canonical pathway <b>of</b> miRNA biogenesis includes <b>the</b> nuclear processing <b>of</b> primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by the ribonuclease Drosha and further cytoplasmic processing <b>of</b> pre-miRNAs by <b>the</b> ribonuclease <b>Dicer.</b> This review discusses <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> miRNA end heterogeneity generated primarily by Drosha and Dicer cleavage and focuses on <b>the</b> structural aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dicer</b> step <b>of</b> miRNA biogenesis. We examine <b>the</b> structures <b>of</b> miRNA precursors, both predicted and experimentally determined, as well as <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> various motifs that disturb <b>the</b> regularity <b>of</b> pre-miRNA structure on Dicer cleavage specificity. We evaluate <b>the</b> structural determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length diversity <b>of</b> miRNA generated by Dicer from different precursors and highlight <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> asymmetrical motifs. Finally, we discuss <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>Dicer</b> protein partners on cleavage efficiency and specificity and propose <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> pre-miRNA structural plasticity to <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dicing</b> complex...|$|R
40|$|Alterations in <b>the</b> {{expression}} <b>of</b> microRNAs (miRNAs) {{have been}} proposed {{to play a role}} in <b>the</b> pathogenesis <b>of</b> acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). <b>Dicer</b> is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main regulators <b>of</b> miRNA biogenesis, and deregulation of its expression has been indicated as a possible cause of miRNA alterations observed in various cancers. Our aim was to analyze <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dicer</b> protein and its relationship with ALL and CLL. This cross-sectional study was performed from 2010 to 2012 in Shahid Faghihi Hospital, Shiraz, Iran. In this study, 30  patients with CLL, 21  patients with ALL, 10 child healthy donors, and 19 adult healthy donors were recruited. The patients’ samples were checked via flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunocytochemistry. The controls’ samples were also examined in the hematology ward. Total RNA was extracted from the bone marrow and peripheral blood samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients and controls. Then, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to estimate <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>Dicer</b> miRNA. <b>The</b> outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expression analysis <b>of</b> <b>Dicer</b> revealed statistically significant differences between the ALL patients/child healthy controls (mean±SD, 0. 19 ± 0. 28  vs. 0. 73 ± 0. 12; P< 0. 001) and the CLL patients/adult healthy controls (mean±SD, 0. 24 ± 0. 25  vs. 0. 41 ± 0. 28; P= 0. 033). This is <b>the</b> first piece <b>of</b> evidence showing that <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dicer</b> gene greatly decreased in the patients with ALL in comparison to the child controls. <b>The</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dicer</b> gene was also downregulated in the patients with CLL compared to the adult controls. Given the above findings, <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>Dicer</b> may play an important role in the progression and prognosis of these diseases...|$|R

25|$|The dalled pieces move {{according}} to dice throws. Each player's pieces move first through the home row to the stern, then through row C towards the prow, {{then into the}} enemy row back towards the stern. From here it moves into row C again, etc., never returning to the home row. The showings of the two dice may be either added and used to move one piece, or used separately for two different pieces. E.g., a throw of a dal and a three allows the player (i) to dal one piece (moving it one position) and then move another dalled piece three positions; (ii) to dal one piece and move it {{a total of four}} positions; (iii) to move two dalled pieces, one three positions and the other one position; or (iv) to move one dalled piece four positions. The showings of both dice must be used in a move. If that is not possible, the showing of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dice</b> must be used. If that is not possible either, the move is lost. At a throw of dal-dal (two dals), the player has an extra throw.|$|E
25|$|Boltzmann {{accomplished}} the feat of {{showing that the}} second law of thermodynamics is only a statistical fact. The gradual disordering of energy {{is analogous to the}} disordering of an initially ordered pack of cards under repeated shuffling, and just as the cards will finally return to their original order if shuffled a gigantic number of times, so the entire universe must some-day regain, by pure chance, the state from which it first set out. (This optimistic coda to the idea of the dying universe becomes somewhat muted when one attempts to estimate the timeline which will probably elapse before it spontaneously occurs.) The tendency for entropy increase seems to cause difficulty to beginners in thermodynamics, but is easy to understand {{from the standpoint of the}} theory of probability. Consider two ordinary dice, with both sixes face up. After the dice are shaken, the chance of finding these two sixes face up is small (1 in 36); thus one can say that the random motion (the agitation) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dice,</b> like the chaotic collisions of molecules because of thermal energy, causes the less probable state to change to one that is more probable. With millions of dice, like the millions of atoms involved in thermodynamic calculations, the probability of their all being sixes becomes so vanishingly small that the system must move to one of the more probable states. However, mathematically the odds of all the dice results not being a pair sixes is also as hard as the ones of all of them being sixes, and since statistically the data tend to balance, one in every 36 pairs of dice will tend to be a pair of sixes, and the cards -when shuffled- will sometimes present a certain temporary sequence order even if in its whole the deck was disordered.|$|E

30|$|Analyzing {{the data}} in Table  2 {{confirms}} that the rotatable trapway has superior performance in water saving. To be noticed that according to <b>the</b> mentioned procedure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiments, <b>the</b> amounts <b>of</b> flushwater used do not express truthfully <b>the</b> real amount <b>of</b> water required to replace the blackwater. The figures in this table give only a comparative aspect <b>of</b> flushing in <b>the</b> two cases <b>of</b> fixed trapway and the rotatable one. For example, the last figure in the Table (98 %) means that 2  l of flushwater when being discharged from the siphon box at flowrate of 10.7  l/min could displace out 98 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dices</b> to <b>the</b> exit pipe. But in real application more water is required to replace all the blackwater in the bowl. Also 0.5  l of flushwater at flowrate of 3.2  l/min could displace out 100 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dices</b> to <b>the</b> exit pipe <b>of</b> a tilted trapway. Really, additional amount of at least 365  ml is required to refill the bowl after retaining the trapway pipe to its ordinary position. The required flushwater flowrate can be obtained directly from the fresh water supply system without the need to install siphon boxes. <b>The</b> final result <b>of</b> this analysis is that less than one liter of flushwater is sufficient with using the rotatable trapway system approach.|$|R

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{cellular}} functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ribonuclease <b>Dicer</b> is {{to process}} microRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) into mature microRNAs (miRNAs).

We demonstrate that AGO 2, PACT and TRBP were required for <b>the</b> efficient functioning <b>of</b> <b>Dicer</b> in cells, and we suggest that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> these proteins is to assure better synchronization of cleavages triggered by two RNase III domains of Dicer...|$|R
