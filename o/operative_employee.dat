40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the social {{positions}} of individual organizational members in organizational strategy processes. Strategy is a social practice existent {{in a wide variety of}} different organizations, influencing, either directly or indirectly, a large number of organizational members. Strategy research has, however, largely neglected the individuals, whose actions and practices make up the strategy process, concentrating on organizations as seemingly homogenous entities. There is even less research exploring the contributions of middle managers and employees acting as strategic agents. The objective of this study is to understand and illuminate the variety of social positions assumed by organizational members from the CEO to the <b>operative</b> <b>employee</b> level in organizational strategy processes. The research is built around a set of 301 qualitative interview texts from 12 organizations. The interviewees are treated as knowledgeable agents capable of reflecting their social positions and roles in the strategy process. The data is analyzed in a grounded theory -setting. The data analysis consists of three 'encounters' with the interview texts. In the first encounter, a three-dimensional schema is created for analyzing the social positions. In the second encounter, 20 social positions are identified and explored under the categories of champion, citizen and cynic. In the third encounter, the 20 positions are divided into three performance categories: role-players, role-seekers and bystanders. Roles performed and reasons for not performing a desired role are traced and discussed. The research contributes to strategy research a viewpoint on the role that the social practice of strategy plays in the work of various organizational members. Through the exposition of social positions and performance categories, it deepens the understanding on why strategies succeed or fail in being enacted by individual organizational members. Furthermore, it allows a large group of organizational members to use voice in the discussion on strategy. The practical contribution of the research is associated with such issues as the communication of strategy, participation in the strategy process, as well as dissent and cynicism in the strategy process. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to explore what politicians, administrators and <b>operative</b> <b>employees</b> in a public sector {{organization}} expect from a new administrative reform (i. e. an attempt to implement the Balanced Scorecard). A case study approach was chosen and 13 actors were interviewed. The findings shows that the expectations on changes are highest among the politicians, moderate among the administrators and lowest among the <b>operative</b> <b>employees.</b> The differences {{can be explained by the}} way the reform is anticipated to favour or disfavour the actors, which in turn are influenced by the actors' past experiences. Another finding is that most of the expressed expectations concern expectations of the administrative reform, but some expectations also concern expectations on the reform.

40|$|Since 1980 the organizations´ {{financial}} management {{has changed and}} in 1992 the founders Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton introduced Balanced Scorecard. Balanced Scorecard focuses on both the financial ratio and non-financial ratios that together lead the company towards long term strategic goals. At the introduction phase of the Balanced Scorecard it´s significant to take the organizations employee’s attitudes in consideration to successfully handle the modification. Our purpose with this study is: To describe and analyze the <b>operative</b> <b>employees</b> attitudes to the Balanced Scorecard within an organization and understand how this will affect the control model's future in the organization. To answer the purpose, a deductive approach were used and then combined with a qualitative analysis. We also choose to collect the empirical data through a case study on HSB Norr, where nine employees were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. There were a total of nine respondents and five of these had a personal interview and four had a telephone-interview. Through the use of theory and the empirical collection compiled an analysis. The analysis revealed interpretations by setting the empirical data to theory. In the conclusion the research questions were answered. A conclusion that could be drawn was that the co-workers generally have a positive attitude {{to the implementation of}} the Balanced Scorecard within HSB Norr. Since there was a demand of the implementation of the Balanced Scorecard this could also affect the attitude of the <b>operative</b> <b>employees</b> in a positive way. Another conclusion was that the employees probably would use the old implemented model even after the implementation of the Balanced Scorecard.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis aims at investigating relevant {{factors in}} performance {{management at the}} logistics service provider Kuehne + Nagel (AG & Co. KG) in Altenwerder, Hamburg. A shop floor management approach is developed and adjusted to specific requisites of the contract logistics warehousing environment. Key performance indicators are identified and adapted {{to the requirements of}} shop floor employees. Thereby, shop floor management ought to serve as process optimization and establishment of regular communication structures involving operative personnel as well as local management. The literature research examines the shop floor management approach in line with lean and Kuehne + Nagel Production System principles. Corporate communication types as well as change management processes for the operative level in the warehousing industry are pointed out. Furthermore, two surveys with <b>operative</b> <b>employees</b> of the pilot project are conducted, researching their perceptions before and after project implementation. Due {{to the nature of the}} qualitative analysis with Kuehne + Nagel employees, findings of this thesis are subjective. This work attempts to provide Kuehne + Nagel with project guidelines for an adjusted shop floor management approach as well as underline required procedures within human resource and change management...|$|R
5000|$|The Romanian Intelligence Service is a militarized institution, {{although}} it is {{not a part of the}} Romanian Armed Forces. The hierarchy from the service is defined by military ranks. The highest ranking employee has the rank of general officer (with four stars). Civilian personnel is composed mostly of accountants, IT and law specialists. [...] The number of employees is classified. However, rumors about the number of employees exists. The newspaper Adevărul was able to find in 2006 an estimate of 12,000 agents, a figure confirmed by former SIE director Cătălin Harnagea. According to former DIE general Ion Mihai Pacepa, this figure is double the number of agents of the similar service of France (which has a population three times larger than Romania's) and larger than Germany's secret services, Pacepa noting the unusual size of Romania's secret services, leading to claims that Ceaușescu's police state has been incompletely dismantled and that the number of officers has actually increased since 1989. In an interview in [...] "Jurnalul Naţional", George Maior denied the numbers Harnagea claimed, saying that the SRI has an estimated number of 3000 <b>operative</b> <b>employees.</b> According to Maior, the average salary in the service is 2500 RON (560 Eur), a salary above the average income in Romania.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of rewards on employee retention and to construct a model which could be used to predict the retention intention of <b>operative</b> level <b>employees</b> in apparel industry. This was carried out as a cross sectional field study among a sample of 320 <b>operative</b> level <b>employees</b> in the apparel industry. Convenience sampling was applied to select the sample and the investigation was done in three leading garment factories in the industry. A self administered, pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data which met the accepted standards of validity and reliability. Correlation test was used to identify the strength of association among variables, and the stepwise regression analysis to fit a regression model. p-value was used to test the mentioned hypotheses. It is found that basic salary, welfare and incentives are significantly correlated with the retention intention of employees. The fitted regression model explains 67. 7 % variation in dependent variable where basic salary and welfare are taken as the best two predictors of retention intention in the tested domain. Basic salary is more important in predicting employee retention than welfare as its standardized coefficient of beta is greater. It could be recommended to review basic salaries and welfare facilities given for operative level workers in garment factories frequently, rather having exit interviews and turnover analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptation}} of profit sharing creates {{a fundamental change}} in employee compensation by making a portion of total compensation directly dependent upon the total profits of the firm and the performance of the employee. The major goal {{of this study is to}} test for and measure the impact of the independent variable, a profit sharing plan implemented at Shahvand Industrial Company, upon communication behaviour, communication outcomes, and organisational outcomes as dependent variables. A quasi-experimental non-equivalent control group design with pre and posttest was the research design used to test the effects of profit sharing participation on permanent-part-time <b>operative</b> <b>employees</b> implemented by SIC. Several conclusions were reached as a result of the statistical analysis of the data collected in this study. Overall, few of the hypothesised effects of profit sharing participation appeared to have been realised according to the empirical results of this study. The finding that certain communication behaviours were more favourable for profit sharing participants than for non-participants support the general hypothesis of the integrated profit sharing model. The observed changes in communication behaviours indicate that information sharing and idea generation are important components of the profit sharing process. The results of this study did not reveal any changes in either communication or organisational outcomes. A significant finding of this study is that the implementation of profit sharing plans require a relatively long period of time. Patience is required to achieve high levels of success and management must make long-term commitment to profit sharing. Findings of this study should be interpreted with caution, taking into consideration that most of the previo. us researches on profit sharing have been conducted in Western European or American countries, while the current study was based on data collected from an organisation in a developing country. This implies that the findings reported in this thesis may not be comparable in certain respects to results derived from companies in major industrialised economies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceResearch {{into public}} service {{motivation}} is currently witnessing exponential growth. However, the universal {{application of the}} concept to all categories of public employees raises questions. Indeed, {{the origins of the}} concept, which {{can be traced back to}} political science studies in the United States, may suggest that the concept applies mainly to senior management but much less to operatives of various types, whose motivations seem more instrumental. Research into the antecedents of PSM has thus shown that high hierarchical levels were associated with employee profiles with a high level of PSM (Bright, 2005; Camilleri, 2007). Some authors go as far as to consider that the concept does not apply at all to operative jobs (Gabris and Simo, 1995). The purpose of this article is therefore to analyse the differences between the public service motivation of operatives and that of other categories of employees. To do so, we draw on two empirical studies, one quantitative (n = 2 868), conducted among the public employees of cities in 12 countries, and the other qualitative, conducted among public employees working in the technical service of a French town. Our results show that the level of PSM is not lower among operatives but that, on the other hand, it is different in its nature and dimensions. Notes to practitioners The issue of the PSM of <b>operative</b> public <b>employees</b> takes on a managerial dimension. Indeed, it has potential policy implications for human resource management policies to be implemented and on the segmentation of the public employees in the light of these policies. Our results thus argue for the mainstreaming of the public service dimension in the management of executives and would suggest that it is in the interest of public organisations to encourage the public service motivation of their employees by designing tasks in such a way that public employees can better appreciate the result of their work among customers and users...|$|R
40|$|The same plan of {{investigation}} as {{was used in}} a previous study of jute workers (Gandevia and Milne, 1965) {{has been applied to}} a survey of 50 workers in the blowroom and carding and spinning area of a Sydney cotton mill. Significant decreases in ventilatory capacity were recorded on Friday, Monday, and the following Thursday, with, on the average, complete `overnight' recovery, as indicated by similar morning values. Slightly, but not significantly, greater differences were observed in seven subjects with mild byssinotic symptoms and in five subjects with an observed productive cough on request. No effect of sex, shift, or history of cough and sputum was demonstrable. By contrast with the jute workers, no influence of smoking habit was apparent. The larger decreases in ventilatory capacity were observed in those with the higher F. E. V. 1 · 0 :F. V. C. ratios, whereas the reverse trend was noted in the jute workers. The occurrence of significant large decreases in those employed in the industry for less than a month, in conjunction with other evidence, suggests that a factor of `self-selection' may be <b>operative</b> among cotton <b>employees</b> in this country and {{may be related to the}} apparently low prevalence of clinically important byssinosis. Attention is drawn to two different patterns of change of ventilatory capacity over a week in subjects exposed to dusts sometimes associated with symptoms of byssinosis; the relationship of these changes and of chronic bronchitis to the development of clinical byssinosis is discussed...|$|R
