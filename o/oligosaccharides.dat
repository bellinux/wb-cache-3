5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and <b>oligosaccharides</b> from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E

40|$|Moraxella catarrhalis {{is a human}} {{pathogen}} that causes serious diseases such as otitis media in children and lower respiratory ailments such as {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in the elderly. M. catarrhalis produces a surface-embedded lipooligosaccharide (LOS) that is composed of lipid A and <b>oligosaccharide.</b> Lipid A constitutes the outer-membrane embedded hydrophobic component of the LOS and is responsible for its endotoxic activity, while the <b>oligosaccharide</b> is usually highly hydrophilic in nature. There are presently three major serotypes of M. catarrhalis, A, B and C, which have differing <b>oligosaccharide</b> profiles in their LOS, along with varying antigenic responses. The <b>oligosaccharide</b> components of these serotypes has been structurally characterised previously. Several studies, including our own have generated and used truncated forms of the <b>oligosaccharide</b> to understand how the glycosyltransferase enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the <b>oligosaccharide</b> function in this biosynthetic process. As part of our ongoing interest in understanding the assembly of both the <b>oligosaccharide</b> and lipid A portions of the LOS for the development of therapeutic agents, we have investigated the lipid A structure of a serotype B glycosyltransferase mutant LOS. Of note, the lipid A or endotoxin of serotype A wild type M. catarrhalis has previously been characterised. The resulting <b>oligosaccharide</b> was highly truncated as expected, however of particular interest was that the lipid A phosphorylation and fatty acyl chain substitution pattern of this mutant differs from that previously reported for serotype A wild type M. catarrhalis.

40|$|The {{nature and}} {{function}} of <b>oligosaccharide</b> modification in glucocerebrosidase, a membrane-associated lysosomal hydrolase, have been investigated in cultured human skin fibroblasts. Glucocerebrosidase is synthesised as a 62. 5 -kDa precursor with high-mannose-type <b>oligosaccharide</b> chains and an apparent native isoelectric point of 6. 0 - 7. 0. Subsequent processing of the <b>oligosaccharide</b> moieties to sialylated complex-type structures results in formation of 65 - 68 -kDa forms of the enzyme with apparent native isoelectric points of 4. 3 - 5. 0. These forms are transported to lysosomes and subsequently modified by the sequential action of lysosomal exoglycosidases, finally resulting in a 59 -kDa form with an isoelectric point near neutrality. The existence of <b>oligosaccharide</b> modification of the enzyme in the lysosomes {{is illustrated by the}} accumulation of different intermediate forms of glucocerebrosidase in mutant cell lines deficient in lysosomal exoglycosidases. The enzyme does not undergo proteolytic modification during maturation. The possible physiological relevance of the <b>oligosaccharide</b> modification of glucocerebrosidase in the lysosomes was investigated by studying the properties of the enzyme in fibroblasts deficient in lysosomal exoglycosidases, and also the properties of homogeneous pure glucocerebrosidase from placenta, modified in the <b>oligosaccharide</b> moieties by digestion in vitro with glycosidases. Modification of the <b>oligosaccharide</b> moieties of glucocerebrosidase had no significant effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme as measured with either artificial or natural substrates in the presence of artificial or natural activators. There was also no effect of modification of the <b>oligosaccharide</b> chains on the intracellular stability of the enzyme or on its apparent hydrophobicity.
