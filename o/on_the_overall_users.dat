40|$|While Spoken Dialogue Systems {{have gained}} in {{importance}} in recent years, most systems {{applied in the}} real world are still static and error-prone. To overcome this, the user is put into the focus of dialogue management. Hence, an approach for adapting the course of the dialogue to Interaction Quality, an objective variant of user satisfaction, is presented in this work. In general, rendering the dialogue adaptive to user satisfaction enables the dialogue system to improve the course of the dialogue and to handle problematic situations better. In this contribution, we present a pilot study of quality-adaptive dialogue. By selecting the confirmation strategy based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> current IQ value, the course of the dialogue is adapted in order to improve <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience.

We contribute to <b>the</b> state-of-the-art work <b>on</b> multimedia scheduling in three aspects: 1) we jointly optimize {{the transmission of}} live and time-shifted video under scarce uplink resources by transmitting a basic quality in real-time and uploading a refined quality for on-demand consumption. 2) We propose a producer-consumer deadline-aware scheduling algorithm that incorporates both the physical state of the mobile producer (e. g., cache fullness) and the scheduled playout time at the end-user. 3) We show that the scheduling decisions in 1) and 2) can be determined locally for each mobile producer. We additionally present an analytical framework for de-centralized scalable video transmission and prove that there exists an optimal solution to our problem.

40|$|User Experience {{has become}} a key success factor for today's {{software}} applications. As {{the only part of}} a software application a user has direct contact with, the user interface contributes to a large degree to <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience. This applies especially to ambient intelligence (AmI) systems that are more user centered than traditional systems. Although a system's software architecture is considered {{as one of the most}} significant technical factors in ensuring project success, its influence on user experience is usually neglected in today's software development. Thereby, the connection between the user interface part of a system and the system's core functionality is of particular importance. A system's distribution architecture and in particular the used client type has a significant influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience. <b>The</b> central contribution of this thesis is the introduction of an application's client type as an explicit adaptation factor in software development in general and in user interface generation in particular to improve user experience. As AmI systems are characterized by openness, heterogeneity and run-time dynamics, their user interfaces have to be generated to provide always an adequate user experience for the frequently changing usage situation. Thus, the appropriate client type needs to be determined automatically during user interface generation. To support developers in the client type selection, we provide a comprehensive characterization of nowadays commonly used client types: fat clients, thin clients, smart clients, rich internet clients and ultra-thin clients. Furthermore, we propose a method that allows the selection of an adequate client type for the current usage situation. Based on a detailed quality model that allows the assessment of the influence of several client type characteristics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience and a usage situation model that describes context factors affecting the client type selection, the method determines the recommended client type automatically using a weighting function. With a concrete implementation of our client type selection method, supporting a fully automatic user interface generation approach that we applied within the ambient assisted living (AAL) domain, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Finally, we describe further tool-support for user interface developers using a semi-automatic UI generation approach as well as for developers using a traditional software development process. Ultimately, the client type selection should be considered explicitly for every application during development...|$|R

It is an important element that affects <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> Quality of Experience (QoE), which may even mask the impact of the quality level of the (audio and visual) signal itself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> perception. This work is a preliminary study aimed at evaluating the weight of the interactivity, which relies on subjective assessments that have been conducted varying the artefacts, genre and interactivity features on video streaming services evaluated by the subjects. Subjective evaluations have been collected from 25 subjects in compliance with ITU-T Recommendation P. 910 through single-stimulus Absolute Category Rating (ACR). It resulted that the impact of the interactivity is influenced by the presence of other components, such as presence of buffer starvations and type of content displayed.

40|$|This article reports three {{case studies}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{usability}} {{and acceptance of}} an industrial robotic prototype {{in the context of}} human-robot cooperation. The three case studies were conducted in the framework of a two-year project named AssistMe, which aims at developing different means of interaction for programming and using collaborative robots in a user-centered manner. Together with two industrial partners and a technological partner, two different application scenarios were implemented and studied with an off-the-shelf robotic system. The operators worked with the robotic prototype in laboratory conditions (two days), in a factory context (one day) and in an automotive assembly line (three weeks). In the article, the project and procedures are described in detail, including the quantitative and qualitative methodology. Our results show that close human-robot cooperation in the industrial context needs adaptive pacing mechanisms in order to avoid a change of working routines for the operators and that an off-the-shelf robotic system is still limited in terms of usability and acceptance. The touch panel, which is needed for controlling the robot, had a negative impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>user</b> experience.

40|$|Ever since Mark Weiser’s {{vision of}} Ubiquitous Computing the {{importance}} of context has increased in the computer science domain. Future Ambient Intelligent Environments will assist humans in their everyday activities, even without them being constantly aware of it. Objects in such environments will have small computers embedded into them which {{have the ability to}} predict human needs from the current context and adapt their behavior accordingly. This vision equally applies to future production environments. In modern factories workers and technical staff members are confronted with a multitude of devices from various manufacturers, all with different user interfaces, interaction concepts and degrees of complexity. Production processes are highly dynamic, whole modules can be exchanged or restructured. Both factors force users to continuously change their mental model of the environment. This complicates their workflows and leads to avoidable user errors or slips in judgement. In an Ambient Intelligent Production Environment these challenges have to be approached. The SmartMote is a universal control device for ambient intelligent production environments like the SmartFactoryKL. It copes with the problems mentioned above by integrating all the user interfaces into a single, holistic and mobile device. Following an automated Model-Based User Interface Development (MBUID) process it generates a fully functional graphical user interface from an abstract task-based description of the environment during run-time. This work introduces an approach to integrating context, namely the user’s location, as an adaptation basis into the MBUID process. A Context Model is specified, which stores location information in a formal and precise way. Connected sensors continuously update the model with new values. The model is complemented by a reasoning component which uses an extensible set of rules. These rules are used to derive more abstract context information from basic sensor data and for providing this information to the MBUID process. The feasibility of the approach is shown by using the example of Interaction Zones, which let developers describe different task models depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> user’s location. Using the context model to determine when a user enters or leaves a zone, the generator can adapt the graphical user interface accordingly. Context-awareness and the potential to adapt to the current context of use are key requirements of applications in ambient intelligent environments. The approach presented here provides a clear procedure and extension scheme for the consideration of additional context types. As context has significant influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>User</b> Experience, this results not only in a better usefulness, but also in an improved usability of the SmartMote...|$|R

40|$|A common {{objective}} of remote sensing is the mapping of land cover. Traditionally, {{this has been}} achieved using hard classifiers such as the maximum likelihood classifier. In these circumstances, accuracy is readily assessed using the confusion matrix or contingency table. Based <b>on</b> this matrix <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>user’s</b> and producer’s accuracies can be estimated as can the same accuracies per class. Further, Kappa statistics can be estimated that allow for randomness in the matrix. During the last 10 years or so, researchers have increasingly applied fuzzy classifiers, such as the fuzzy c-means classifier and the mixture model that estimates the membership of a pixel, to each class. Clearly, where a pixel represents a mixture of land cover classes (for example, 20 percent cereals, 50 percent heathland, and 30 percent forest) fuzzy classifiers provide the opportunity for greater accuracy, and for this reason, fuzzy classification has become a fundamentally important approach in remote sensing. There is no accepted standard method for assessing the accuracy of a fuzzy classification. A scatterplot between the observed values and the estimated values provides a useful graphical representation of {{the accuracy of the}} estimates; however, quantitative summary of the information in the scatterplot has proved elusive and researchers have often used ad-hoc combinations of statistics, such as the mean error, root mean square (RMS) error, and correlation coefficient. The RMS error is insufficient because it is insensitive to the variance per class and <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> number of classes. For example, a class that has small membership x in all pixels (say 0 %stlgxstlg 10 %) may be estimated with small RMS error by setting all pixels to the mean membership for that class (say 5 percent) even though the correlation between observed and estimated memberships is zero. The likelihood of having small memberships per class increases with the number of classes c. The correlation coefficient is insufficient because it is insensitive to bias such that r may be large when the scatterplot lies away from the 1 : 1 line. A particular problem arises for classes whose memberships are bimodal (i. e., little mixing {{as is often the case}} for "water" classes where pixels are either close to 0 percent or 100 percent water but rarely lie between). Then r can be large when the correlation within each "cluster" is zero. Several statistics were evaluated that address these issues including schemes for standardising the RMS error and weighting schemes for estimating overall precision and bias. First, the above issues were explored using fuzzy maps of land cover obtained for four different sites representing different biomes (New Forest, U. K.; Cukurova Deltas, Turkey; BOREAS site, Canada; HAPEX-Sahel site, Niger). These fuzzy maps were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery (trained on classified fine spatial resolution imagery) using a standard feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network. Second, the proposed statistics were evaluated using simulated data involving classes with different distributions of memberships and different numbers of these classes...|$|R

40|$|Corporations and {{government}} agencies that use Avatars claim there are substantial benefits for using them in their respective organizations; including 24 / 7 service availability, quick answers without a phone queue, and improved consistency in the responses provided. “There are also potential cost savings by having an Avatar answering questions compared to using personnel” (Lind and Salomonson, 2006). However, these benefits may not be great enough as the lack of possible human communication may lead to alienation between individuals and organisations. Furthermore, a robot may “miss out” on business opportunities that a human would act on. A robot will not hear and understand nuances in speech, with the risk that a potentially problematic situation may not be adequately resolved, leading to dissatisfaction with products and services delivered. Many companies measure the satisfaction with Avatars by analysing question and answer logs {{to see if the}} Avatar appears to give satisfactory answers. Few of these companies have actually asked their customers (e. g. IKEA and SAS until recently) what they really feel {{about the quality of the}} answers they receive. User Centered Design, Participatory Design and other methods are the preferred ways of developing such systems, but these do not include all stakeholders. This thesis addresses this exclusion of all stakeholders by applying a co-design research approach for developing avatars for e-Services. Case studies from Mark Municipality, Sweden and Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS) are presented in this thesis showing how improvements of service quality aspects with Avatars can be managed by applying a four-step Co-Design research approach. From the first step of Co-Design, through interviews, log analysis and a channel survey, findings show that the failed dialogues with Avatars Eva (SAS) and Elin (Mark) are mainly concerned with five factors: interactivity; dialogue capability; consistency; knowledge; and synonyms. In the second step of carrying out customer workshops, a number of ideal scenarios are suggested for the Avatars to perform better. In the third step, SAS decision makers decided to implement the first three scenarios: Eva’s synonyms, knowledge and consistency. Mark decision makers decided to shut down their Avatar Elin, as they did not believe they had the necessary resources. In the fourth step, another channel survey was carried out for SAS as well as a new log analysis in order to know the impact of the redevelopment of the above three scenarios. An important result of the study was that the company adopted the continuous use of Co-Design as an approach to continuous improvement of the service quality performed by the Avatar Eva. This, for example, led to an increase of 14 percentage points <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> <b>overall</b> satisfaction level. <b>The</b> results also open a new set of questions framing the relation and transformation between Co-Design as a research approach for knowledge creation and Co-Design as a method for innovation and service quality improvements.
