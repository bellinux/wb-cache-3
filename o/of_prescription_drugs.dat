5|$|While {{prohibited}} drugs are generally {{viewed as being}} the most dangerous, the misuse <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> are linked to more deaths in several countries. Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are extremely rare.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1990 s rates <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> {{abuse and}} {{overdose}} have skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. As a result states have enacted and implemented new drug control policies {{in hopes of}} slowing and reversing this health epidemic. The goals {{of this study were}} to (a) determine the impact these state-based drug control policies have on <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse and overdose and (b) deduce what leads some states to pass stricter policies than others. Results indicated that the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> overdose in 2008 largely impacted the future strength of a state’s drug control policy. States with higher rates of drug overdose and abuse in earlier years tended to develop tougher policy by 2013. In addition, states’ <b>Prescription</b> <b>Drug</b> Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) were found to be strongly related to the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse in states. While not significantly differing from national trends at first, after about five years of PDMP operation, states began to see a slow or decrease in their rates <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of the {{expansion}} <b>of</b> public <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> insurance coverage from Medicare Part D on the elderly and find evidence of substantial crowd-out.

40|$|Background: <b>Prescription</b> <b>drug</b> {{abuse in}} Southwest Virginia {{is a serious}} problem {{affecting}} indi-viduals, families, and communities. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize and understand the extent <b>of</b> the <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse problem in Southwest, Virginia as well as the dynamics that surround that abuse. More specifically, the study focused on learning the extent of the problem along with which <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> are typically used prior to entering treatment, reasons for <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> and methadone abuse, and the sources for <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> use, misuse and abuse. Methods: Mixed methodology was employed which included surveying methadone clinic con-sumers at two treatment clinics in Southwest, Virginia and seven focus field interviews of key community stakeholders. Results: The extent <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse is high and that the demographics <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> users are getting younger and now involve more males than females. Oxycodone, hydroco-done, methadone, and morphine were the most commonly used drugs prior to enrollment in the clinics with over one-half of methadone-maintained consumers reporting that they had abused benzodiazepines along with opioids. Focus groups and clinic consumer data highlighted the key etiological factors in <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse: use (due to workforce related injuries) turning to abuse, wanting to get high, overprescribing and physician issues, lack of information, and cultural acceptance of drug taking as problem solving behavior. The two most common sources for the abused <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> were physicians and street dealers. Conclusions: A constellation of conditions have led to the epidemic <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse in Southwest Virginia, including poverty, unemployment and work-related injuries, besides, public health education programs on the dangers <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> opiate misuse and abuse are urgently needed...|$|R
