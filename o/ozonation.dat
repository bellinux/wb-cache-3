25|$|Ozone (3) is {{generated}} by passing oxygen (2) through a high voltage potential resulting in a third oxygen atom becoming attached and forming 3. Ozone is very unstable and reactive and oxidizes most organic material it comes in contact with, thereby destroying many pathogenic microorganisms. Ozone {{is considered to be}} safer than chlorine because, unlike chlorine which has to be stored on site (highly poisonous {{in the event of an}} accidental release), ozone {{is generated}} on-site as needed. <b>Ozonation</b> also produces fewer disinfection by-products than chlorination. A disadvantage of ozone disinfection is the high cost of the ozone generation equipment and the requirements for special operators.|$|E
25|$|Water from Hetch Hetchy {{is some of}} {{the cleanest}} {{municipal}} water in the United States; San Francisco is one of six U.S. cities not required by law to filter its tap water, although the water is disinfected by <b>ozonation</b> and, since 2011, exposure to UV. The water quality is high because of the unique geology of the upper Tuolumne River drainage basin, which consists mostly of bare granite; as a result, the rivers feeding Hetch Hetchy Reservoir have extremely low loads of sediments and nutrients. The watershed is also strictly protected, so swimming and boating are prohibited at the reservoir (although fishing is permitted at the reservoir and in the rivers which feed it).|$|E

2500|$|Ozone is an {{unstable}} molecule which readily gives up one atom of oxygen providing a powerful oxidizing agent which is toxic to most waterborne organisms. It {{is a very}} strong, broad spectrum disinfectant that is widely used in Europe. It is an effective method to inactivate harmful protozoa that form cysts. It also works well against almost all other pathogens. Ozone is made by passing oxygen through ultraviolet light or a [...] "cold" [...] electrical discharge. To use ozone as a disinfectant, it must be created on-site and added to the water by bubble contact. Some {{of the advantages of}} ozone include the production of fewer dangerous by-products and the absence of taste and odour problems (in comparison to chlorination). Another advantage of ozone is that it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water. Ozone has been used in drinking water plants since 1906 where the first industrial <b>ozonation</b> plant was built in Nice, France. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted ozone as being safe; and it is applied as an anti-microbiological agent for the treatment, storage, and processing of foods. However, although fewer by-products are formed by <b>ozonation,</b> it has been discovered that ozone reacts with bromide ions in water to produce concentrations of the suspected carcinogen bromate. [...] Bromide can be found in fresh water supplies in sufficient concentrations to produce (after <b>ozonation)</b> more than 10 parts per billion (ppb) of bromate — the maximum contaminant level established by the USEPA.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ozonation</b> – {{a process}} of infusing water with ozone – {{can be used in}} {{aquaculture}} to facilitate organic breakdown. Ozone is also added to recirculating systems to reduce nitrite levels through conversion into nitrate. If nitrite levels in the water are high, nitrites will also accumulate in the blood and tissues of fish, where it interferes with oxygen transport (it causes oxidation of the heme-group of haemoglobin from ferrous (...) to ferric (...) , making haemoglobin unable to bind [...] ). Despite these apparent positive effects, ozone use in recirculation systems has been linked to reducing the level of bioavailable iodine in salt water systems, resulting in iodine deficiency symptoms such as goitre and decreased growth in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) larvae.|$|E

Proposals to reduce bromate formation include: lowering the water pH below 6.0, limiting the doses of ozone, using an alternate water source with a lower bromide concentration, pretreatment with ammonia and addition of small concentrations of chloramines prior to <b>ozonation.</b>|$|E
