25|$|The diet of {{the snow}} leopard varies across its range and with the time of year, and depends on prey availability. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on bharals (Himalayan blue sheep), but in other {{mountain}} ranges, such as the Karakoram, Tian Shan, Altai and Tost Mountains of Mongolia, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex and argali, a type of wild sheep, although the latter has become rarer in some parts {{of the snow}} leopard's range. Other large animals eaten when available can include various types of wild goats and sheep (such as markhors and urials), other goat-like ruminants such as Himalayan tahr and gorals, plus deer, red panda, wild boars, and langur monkeys. Smaller prey consists <b>of</b> <b>marmots,</b> woolly hares, pikas, various rodents, and birds such as the snow cock and chukar.|$|E
500|$|The {{yellow-bellied marmot}} (Marmota flaviventris), {{also known as}} the rock chuck, is a large, stout-bodied ground {{squirrel}} in the marmot genus. It is one of fourteen species <b>of</b> <b>marmots,</b> and is native to mountainous regions of southwestern Canada and western United States, including the Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada, and Mount Rainier in the state of Washington, typically living above [...] The fur is mainly brown, with a dark bushy tail, yellow chest and white patch between the eyes, and they weigh up to approximately [...] They live in burrows in colonies of up to twenty individuals with a single dominant male. They are diurnal and feed on plant material, insects, and bird eggs. They hibernate for approximately eight months starting in September and lasting through the winter.|$|E
500|$|In {{polygynous}} species, males {{will try}} to monopolize and mate with multiple females. As with monogamy, polygyny in rodents can come in two forms; defense and non-defense. Defense polygyny involves males controlling territories that contain resources that attract females. This occurs in ground squirrels like yellow-bellied marmots, California ground squirrels, Columbian ground squirrels and Richardson's ground squirrels. Males with territories are known as [...] "resident" [...] males and the females that live within the territories are known as [...] "resident" [...] females. In the case <b>of</b> <b>marmots,</b> resident males {{do not appear to}} ever lose their territories and always win encounters with invading males. Some species are also known to directly defend their resident females and the ensuing fights can lead to severe wounding. In species with non-defense polygyny, males are not territorial and wander widely in search of females to monopolize. These males establish dominance hierarchies, with the high-ranking males having access to the most females. This occurs in species like Belding's ground squirrels and some tree squirrel species.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} laws of {{the natural}} habitat structure of European subspecies <b>of</b> the steppe <b>marmot</b> over {{the period of the}} 20 – 21 st centuries in Rostov Region have been analyzed. Essential changes in the way of usage of nature and foremost the decrease of number of stock-raising capacities and pasture areas took place all over the territory of European subspecies <b>of</b> the steppe <b>marmot</b> natural habitat. There {{is no doubt that the}} agricultural usage of land contributed to the inhabitance of big quantity <b>of</b> steppe <b>marmots,</b> namely keeping big quantities of horses and cattle which had large territories used as pasture areas. During these periods, we can see the substantial decreases <b>of</b> the steppe <b>marmot’s</b> population despite full prohibition of hunt (since 1929 there has been no industrial hunting for steppe marmots). In first case, over a 30 -year period, the steppe marmots completely disappeared from the territory of Rostov Region. The second period is not over yet. Here we can foresee two variants of the situation development. At present the period <b>of</b> the steppe <b>marmot</b> disappearance has reached its midpoint. If the quantity of cattle and horses remains the same we can surely make forecasts of continued decrease <b>of</b> <b>marmot’s</b> population.

50|$|The species {{does not}} usually dig its own burrow, instead using those <b>of</b> <b>marmots,</b> ground squirrels, hamsters, moles, voles, jerboas and others, after {{slightly}} widening them. Its burrow is often poorly constructed, {{as it does}} not inhabit one long enough to warrant restructuring. Nesting burrows are not lined, and have many outlets, ranging from three to 20. Alongside the nest chamber is a food store. Independently dug burrows are typically shallow and simple in construction.|$|E

50|$|Alaska marmots {{are found}} {{scattered}} throughout Alaska as small colonies each consisting of various families. Their locations {{have been documented}} in the Brooks Range from Lake Peters to Cape Lisburne and Cape Sabine that lies westward. There have been sightings <b>of</b> <b>marmots</b> near rivers in the Northern Baird mountains and in the Mulik Hills. They have also been sighted near copter Peak in the DeLong Mountains. Species have also been secured south of the Brooks Range in the Spooky Valley and in the Kokrines Hills.|$|E
50|$|A typical colony <b>of</b> <b>marmots</b> {{consists}} of a male, two to three females, and their young, sometimes living in groups {{of more than a}} dozen animals; young marmots stay with their family for at least two years, so a burrow is often home to a newly born litter and a litter of two-year-olds. Marmots seldom move to other colonies with the exception of sub-adults of two to three years old, which may leave the home colony to start a new family elsewhere; females move only a few hundred meters, though males often move several kilometers away from their birth burrow.|$|E
50|$|The Olympic marmot is the second-rarest North American marmot, {{behind the}} {{critically}} endangered Vancouver Island marmot. Marmots were first sighted in the Olympic Peninsula in the 1880s. In the 1960s, David P. Barash conducted a three-year study of Olympic marmots {{after which he}} reported {{that there was an}} abundance <b>of</b> <b>marmots</b> in the mountains. In 1989, the total Olympic marmot population was calculated to be only about 2,000, but this low number was due to poor data collection. Other than this population census, little further research was done on the Olympic marmot until the late 1990s, when concerns arose about population status.|$|E

5000|$|The {{population}} crash {{may also}} {{be due to the}} Allee effect, named after zoologist Warder Clyde Allee. Allee proposed that social animals require a critical mass in order to survive, because survival requires group activities such as warning of predators and migration. A decline below that threshold precipates rapid decline. Ecologist Justin Brashares suggests that at least some <b>of</b> the <b>marmot's</b> group behavior is learned, so that the loss <b>of</b> <b>marmot</b> [...] "culture" [...] has caused them to become more solitary, and interact aggressively rather than cooperatively when they do encounter each other.|$|R

5000|$|The Alaska marmot (Marmota broweri), {{also known}} as the Brooks Range marmot or the Brower's marmot, is a species of rodent in the family Sciuridae. It is found in the scree slopes of the Brooks Range, Alaska. They eat grass, {{flowering}} plants, berries, roots, moss, and lichen. These marmots range from about 54 cm to 65 cm in length and 2.5 kg to 4 kg in weight. Alaska celebrates every February 2 as [...] "Marmot Day," [...] a holiday intended to observe the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>marmots</b> in that state and take the place of Groundhog Day.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolutionary}} lineages of the 14 marmot species distributed {{across the}} Holarctic are relatively ambiguous. Cytochrome b sequences indicated that M. broweri {{is most likely}} related to M. caudata, cenzbieri, marmota, and monax. In support to the cytochrome b results, experimentation involving mitochondrial DNA has suggested that M. broweri is most likely related to M. caudata and M. menzbieri. However, morphological data have linked M. broweri to M. camtschatica. In addition, somatic chromosome analysis <b>of</b> <b>marmots,</b> ecological data and behavioral data have shown {{that there is a}} link between M. broweri and M. caligata. The conflicting data pertaining to phylogeny creates inconsistent marmot lineage relationship hypotheses.|$|E

40|$|No {{aspect of}} the biology of a species should be {{neglected}} {{if we are to}} achieve a comprehensive understanding of its evolutionary history. Marmots have been thoroughly used as model organisms by eco-ethologists interested in the evolution of mammal societies. In contrast, phylogenetic and morphological studies have received less attention and have seldom involved all living species. Over the last few years, several studies have been published, which investigate morphological variation in marmots using modern morphometric techniques. These studies have improved our understanding <b>of</b> <b>marmot</b> evolution, supporting subgeneric classifications based on DNA sequences, suggesting an early occurrence of interspecific differences during ontogeny, showing the importance of allometry in the development of age-specific traits, and revealing an unexpected acceleration in the rate of morphological divergence of the youngest and most endangered marmot species, M. vancouverensis.

5000|$|The {{endangered}} Vancouver Island marmot {{remains one}} of the world's rarest mammals. In 1997 there were so few numbers <b>of</b> <b>marmots</b> on Vancouver Island that managers took the bold step of capturing some to create a [...] "genetic lifeboat" [...] and therefore create the possibility of restoring wild populations. The first marmots went to Toronto Zoo in 1997, but this initial effort was quickly followed by efforts made by the Calgary Zoo and Mountainview Conservation and Breeding Centre in Langley, BC. The Marmot Recovery Foundation also built a dedicated marmot facility on Mt. Washington, Vancouver Island to further facilitate captive breeding and pre release conditioning. The fundamental idea was to produce marmots in a fashion that would facilitate their eventual return to the wild.|$|E
