Spectators attended the planned explosion, but it was stopped just in time by CoE attorney David Waid.|$|E
5|$|In October {{with the}} World Series {{approaching}} and Tancredo's team the Colorado Rockies representing the National League, {{he decided to}} offer a bet with fellow candidate Mitt Romney whose team the Boston Red Sox were representing the American League. Tancredo proposed that he would {{drop out of the}} race if Boston won but only if Romney agreed to drop <b>out</b> <b>if</b> Colorado won. Luckily for Tancredo, the Romney campaign turned down the bet and Boston won the world series.|$|E
25|$|A run <b>out</b> cannot occur <b>if</b> no fielder {{has touched}} the ball. As such, if a batsman plays a {{straight}} drive which breaks the non-striker's stumps whilst he is outside his crease, {{he is not}} <b>out.</b> However, <b>if</b> a fielder (usually the bowler, in this case) touches the ball at all before it breaks the stumps at the non-striker's end, then it is a run <b>out,</b> even <b>if</b> the fielder never has any control of the ball.|$|R

After they made Carrier dig his own grave, they fatally shot him.|$|E
5|$|The Quincy Convention of October 1845 passed resolutions {{demanding}} that the Latter-day Saints withdraw from Nauvoo by May 1846. A few days later, the Carthage Convention called for establishment of a militia that would force them <b>out</b> <b>if</b> they {{failed to meet the}} May deadline. To try to meet this deadline and to get an early start on the trek to the Great Basin, the Latter-day Saints began leaving Nauvoo in February 1846.|$|E

5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} {{the most urgent}} needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had adopted the German Type UB II design for {{what became known as}} the Austro-Hungarian U-27 class in mid 1915, and had six of that class being built under license in Austria-Hungary by late 1916. In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find <b>out</b> <b>if</b> Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E

Alice's eldest daughter, Anna, and son, Tom, take a genetic test to find <b>out</b> <b>if</b> they will develop the disease. Alice's younger daughter Lydia, an aspiring actress, decides not to be tested.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is growing}} {{increasingly}} jealous of Gabe's relationship with Erin. While observing Gabe's room, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{tells him that}} a Chinese virility supplement that Gabe keeps in his room is incredibly potent. Once alone Andy drinks the entire bottle of the supplement, which makes him intoxicated, prompting him to admit his jealousy to Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith). Phyllis volunteers to talk to Erin and find <b>out</b> <b>if</b> she is having sex with Gabe, but as Phyllis is fairly intoxicated herself, her inquiries segue into an explicit account of her sexual experiences with her husband Bob, which mortifies Erin. Andy's intoxication turns into sickness, and he ultimately retreats to Gabe's room and vomits on the bed.|$|E
5|$|As the Sun expands, it will {{swallow the}} planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; {{although}} the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) {{will cause the}} planets' orbits to move farther <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up {{as a result of}} tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, Erin {{tries to}} break up with Andy, saying she no longer loves him and is angry that he left and barely communicated with her. Andy vehemently protests the breakup and says their {{relationship}} can work <b>out</b> <b>if</b> she just pretends to still love him. Erin walks outside to Pete, saying she could not do it. Pete tells her he is okay with this, since all he wants is for her to be happy. Emboldened by this, she gives him a kiss, runs back up to Andy's office, and breaks up with him. In her brief breakup speech she repeats her complaints about his three-month absence, not realizing that he is talking to David Wallace on speakerphone.|$|E

They also manage to secure the allegiance of House Mormont when Davos warns the young Lady Lyanna Mormont of the dangers the White Walkers pose. However, {{they are unable to}} secure the allegiance of House Glover, with Lord Robett Glover pointing out how Robb Stark failed to protect his home from the Ironborn.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{when the}} player confronts an enemy officer, the officer will {{challenge}} {{them to a}} one-on-one duel. If the player accepts, they will be transported to a small arena away from the main battlefield where a one-on-one fight with the officer will take place until either is victorious or time runs <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> the player declines, your morale will drop. If the player wins, their morale will rise and the enemy officer will {{be removed from the}} battlefield. If you accept the officers challenge they do become more difficult to beat in the duel.|$|E

5|$|The 2005season marks {{only the}} eighthtime in 50years that exactly twoteams {{have gone into}} the bowl season undefeated. This {{has been a major}} {{criticism}} of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top twoteams can generate controversy. If more than twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiation}} zone is {{the region of}} the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer, since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a convection zone. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high opacity (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.|$|E
