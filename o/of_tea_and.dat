In a typical day he would wake at 7am, paint from around 9 or 10am until 4pm, after which {{he would have a}} meal. Following the meal he would take a walk, and attend life classes between 6 and 8pm. On returning home he would drink two cups <b>of</b> <b>tea,</b> <b>and</b> go to bed at midnight.|$|E

He had celebrated his 22nd birthday just four days before.|$|E
5|$|Harry asked printer James E. James (who had printed Frank Comments), if {{he could}} borrow the {{printing}} blocks he used for photos, as they were too expensive for the fledgling company at the time. Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News, Pantosphinx and local cinemas, but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements {{at the side of}} the front cover page. After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return to the office and work throughout the night, pausing only to go to the Pier Head to buy a cup <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> a hot pie at four in the morning. Virginia's parents helped the paper during this time, as they paid for classified ads, and arranged for Harry and his future wife's first photographs together.|$|E

40|$|Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) is {{characterized}} by the presence of p-synephrine, an amine structurally and pharmacologically related to ephedrine. Besides the same adverse effects as ephedrine, nowadays it is believed that altered levels of p-synephrine can be associated to the occurrence of migraine and cluster headaches. Leaves and fruits of this species are highly commercialized in form <b>of</b> <b>teas</b> <b>and</b> herbal preparations, but without taking into account the risks associated with its use. This work describes a survey <b>of</b> <b>teas</b> <b>and</b> herbal preparations containing C. aurantium, commercialized in Porto Alegre (RS/Brazil), in order to verify the presence of p-synephrine. Comparing with the mean amount available in the supermarkets, around 20 % <b>of</b> the <b>teas</b> <b>and</b> 10 % <b>of</b> the herbal preparations declared the presence of C. aurantium in their labels. In a sampling <b>of</b> 15 <b>teas</b> <b>and</b> 2 herbal preparations selected for the analysis, the presence of p-synephrine was characterized in all samples, with levels between 0. 0040 to 0. 2308 %, leading to a caution that even being natural products, they are not free of adverse effects...|$|R

25|$|From the 12th century, a huge {{industry}} centred {{around the}} manufacture and trade of burnay clay pots, {{used for the}} storage <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> other perishables, {{was set up in}} the northern Philippines with Japanese and Okinawan traders. These pots were known as 'Ruson-tsukuri' (Luzon-made) in Japanese, and were considered among the best storage vessels used for the purpose of keeping tea leaves and rice wine fresh. Hence, Ruson-Tsukuri pots became sought after in Northeast Asia. Each Philippine kiln had its own branding symbol, marked {{on the bottom of the}} Ruson-tsukuri by a single baybayin letter.|$|E

A strong-willed and shrewd businessman, de Rothschild amassed a fortune that made him one of the richest men in the world.

25|$|Although Henry had by {{this time}} {{come to believe that}} {{conflict}} with Great Britain, and independence, was inevitable, he had no strategy for advancing this. The Burgesses were sitting when in 1774, word came that Parliament had voted to close the port of Boston in retaliation for the Boston Tea Party, and several burgesses, including Henry, convened at the Raleigh Tavern to formulate a response. According to George Mason, a former burgess from Fairfax County, who joined the committee in the work, Henry took the lead. Mason and Henry would form a close political relationship that would last until Mason's death in 1792. The resolution that Henry's committee produced set June 1, 1774, the date upon which the Port of Boston was to be closed, as a day of fasting and prayer. It passed the Burgesses, but Dunmore dissolved the body. Undeterred, the former legislators met at the Raleigh Tavern, and reconstituted themselves as a convention, to meet again in August, after there was time for county meetings to show local sentiment. They also called for a boycott <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> <b>and</b> other products.|$|E
