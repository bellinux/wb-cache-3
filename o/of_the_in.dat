5|$|Marie Stopes and David Watson {{analysed}} coal ball {{samples and}} decided that coal balls formed in situ. They {{stressed the importance of}} interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls. Some supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>in</b> situ theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed in situ, stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal balls are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The {{same year}} Gaudí {{apparently}} {{took part in}} the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> , <b>in</b> collaboration with his disciple Francesc Berenguer, though the project's authorship is not clear or to what extent they each contributed to it. The style of the building evokes Gaudí's early work, such as the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions; it had an entrance gate {{in the shape of a}} fishing net, currently installed in the Park Güell. The building was demolished in 1939. Also in 1906 he designed a new banner, this time for the Guild of metalworkers and blacksmiths for the Corpus Christi procession of 1910, in Barcelona Cathedral. It was dark green in colour, with Barcelona's coat of arms in the upper left corner, and an image of Saint Eligius, patron of the guild, with typical tools of the trade. The banner was burned in July 1936.|$|E

25|$|Behind the scenes, Miles and Teo {{took the}} tapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>In</b> a Silent Way {{sessions}} and transformed some beautiful, folk-tinged, melody-driven sets into two exquisite, beguiling and otherworldly pieces of music. Using techniques that pre-dated {{the proliferation of}} tape loops, cut-ups, edits and sequencing in rock, pop, hip hop and dance music, Miles and Teo took apart the original recording and reassembled them outside of any traditional or accepted jazz structure or melodic framework. This idea of taking jazz away from its birth, genesis and flowering as a live art and into the studio would soon become standard practice, but in 1969 it was groundbreaking.|$|E

25|$|Kary Mullis {{conceived}} PCR in 1985 as an {{in vitro}} simplified reproduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>in</b> vivo process of DNA replication. Taking {{advantage of the}} chemical properties of DNA {{and the availability of}} thermostable DNA polymerases, PCR allows for the enrichment of a DNA sample for a certain sequence. PCR provides the possibility to obtain a large quantity of copies of a particular stretch of the genome, making further analysis possible. It is a highly sensitive and specific technology, which makes it suitable for all kinds of genetic diagnosis, including PGD. Currently, many different variations exist on the PCR itself, {{as well as on the}} different methods for the posterior analysis of the PCR products.|$|E
25|$|Room and {{pillar mining}} {{consists}} of coal deposits that are mined by cutting {{a network of}} rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left behind {{in order to keep}} up the roof. The pillars can make up to forty percent of the total coal in the seam, however where there was space to leave head and floor coal there is evidence from recent open cast excavations that 18th-century operators used a variety of room and pillar techniques to remove 92 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>in</b> situ coal. However, this can be extracted at a later stage (see retreat mining).|$|E
25|$|The human {{target is}} the {{essential}} distinguishing feature of the impalement arts. It has been asserted by several sources, including well-known knife throwers, that the power and appeal {{of this type of}} act lies as much in audience appreciation of the target as in admiration of the skill of the thrower or archer. Various theories have been put forward to explain this, ranging from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device <b>of</b> <b>the</b> , <b>in</b> which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 16th century Baku's wealth and {{strategic}} position attracted {{the focus of}} its larger neighbors; in the previous two centuries, it was under the rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>in</b> Iran-centred Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu. The fall of the Ak Koyunlu brought the city immediately into the sphere of the newly formed Iranian Safavid dynasty, led by king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501-1524). Ismail I laid siege to Baku in 1501 and captured it; he allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power, under Safavid suzerainty. His successor, king Tahmasp I (r. 1524-1576), completely removed the Shirvanshahs from power, and made Baku {{a part of the}} Shirvan province. Baku remained {{as an integral part of}} his empire and the successive Iranian dynasties to come for the next centuries, until the irrevocable cession in the first half of the 19th century. The House of Shirvan, who ruled Baku since the 9th century, was extinguished in the course of the Safavid rule.|$|E
25|$|The right brigade of the 7th Division {{advanced}} against {{light resistance}} to the first objective (red line) but came under fire from machine-guns in the 21st Division area. As the neighbouring division came up the 91st Brigade was able to resume its advance towards In Der Ster Cabaret until fire from Joiner's Rest held them up. Reinforcements allowed the final objective (blue line) to be taken. A defensive flank was formed along Jolting Houses road and Jetty Trench, meeting the 21st Division {{to the west of}} Reutel. The left brigade had an easy advance to the first objective. As the attack continued some troops crossed into the area of the 1st Australian Division, causing a gap but the German defenders were not able to exploit this and the final objective was reached. Occupation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>In</b> Der Ster plateau gave the two divisions observation over {{the lower part of the}} valley, enfilading ground on which any counter-attack from the south against the 1st Australian Division must move.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{tetrapods}} with limbs, plesiosaurs {{must have}} had a certain gait, a coordinated movement pattern <b>of</b> <b>the,</b> <b>in</b> this case, flippers. Of the infinite number of possibilities, in practice attention has been largely directed {{to the question of whether}} the front pair and hind pair moved simultaneously, so that all four flippers were engaged at the same moment, or in an alternate pattern, each pair being employed in turn. Frey & Riess in 1991 proposed an alternate model, which would have had the advantage of a more continuous propulsion. In 2000, Theagarten Lingham-Soliar evaded the question by concluding that, like sea turtles, plesiosaurs only used the front pair for a powered stroke. The hind pair would have been merely used for steering. Lingham-Soliar deduced this from the form of the hip joint, which would have allowed for only a limited vertical movement. Furthermore, a separation of the propulsion and steering function would have facilitated the general coordination of the body and prevented a too extreme pitch. He rejected Robinson's hypothesis that elastic energy was stored in the ribcage, considering the ribs too stiff for this.|$|E
