25|$|A tube of {{particular}} structural, seismic, economic, and political {{interest is the}} BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) transbay tube. This tube was constructed {{at the bottom of}} San Francisco Bay through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer <b>oval</b> <b>shell</b> encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of crushed stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) spaghetti in a bowl of gelatin dessert. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding slip joint was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark Ferry Building.|$|E
60|$|These Creatures to {{the naked}} eye seemed {{to be a kind of}} black Mite, but much nimbler and {{stronger}} then the ordinary Cheese-Mites; but examining them in a Microscope, I found them to be a very fine crusted or shell'd Insect, much like that represented in the first Figure of the three and thirtieth Scheme, with a protuberant <b>oval</b> <b>shell</b> A, indented or pitted with an abundance of small pits, all covered over with little white brisles, whose points all directed backwards.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after this}} {{they came to}} a long sandbank, where the old trader said they should find as many turtles' eggs as they wished for, {{although}} to Barney and Martin there seemed to be nothing on the bank at all. The freshwater turtle of the Amazon, of which there are various species, {{is one of the most}} useful of reptiles. Its flesh supplies abundance of good food; and the eggs, besides being eaten, afford an excellent oil. The largest species grow to the length of three feet, and have a flattish <b>oval</b> <b>shell</b> of a dark colour, and quite smooth. Turtles lay their eggs about the beginning of September, when the sand-banks begin to be uncovered. They scrape deep holes for them, and cover them carefully over, beating down the sand quite flat, and walking across the place several times, for the purpose of concealment. The eggs are then left to be hatched by the heat of the sun. But alas for the poor turtles, men are too clever for them. The eggs are collected by the natives in thousands, and, when oil is to be made of them, they are thrown into a canoe, smashed and mixed up together, and left to stand, when the oil rises to the top, and is skimmed off and boiled. It keeps well, and is used both for lamps and cooking. Very few of the millions of eggs that are annually laid arrive at maturity.|$|E

40|$|The Early Cambrian brachiopod, Eoobolus, {{is one of}} {{the first}} representatives of the superfamily, Linguloidea, the {{defining}} characteristics of which include the classical morphology of <b>oval</b> <b>shells</b> and a pedicle that emerges from between the two valves. The material described here from the Mural Formation (Jasper National Park, Canadian Rocky Mountains) provides well-preserved muscle scars and larval shells that allow a discussion of the muscle system and the larval morphology of Eoobolus. The dorsal larval shell exhibits a morphology similar to other Cambrian linguloids, but also to paterinids, Mickwitzia muralensis, and some rhynchonelliforms. This suggests that there was a lesser degree of disparity among brachiopod larvae in the Cambrian than there is today. The muscle system of Eoobolus is similar to other linguloids, but differs from that of Recent lingulids and discinids by having one or two more pairs of oblique muscles. New data on the distribution of features characteristic of the family Eoobolidae question the validity of this family...|$|R
5000|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 6 mm and 11 mm. The <b>oval,</b> {{elongated}} <b>shell</b> is rather thin, and shining. The elevated spire has a conic shape.

The color of the shell is yellowish or rose, with red and white flammules and decurrent lines,sometimes punctate with red.|$|R
