5000|$|A minor {{problem was}} the oil hose from {{the lower part of}} the engine to the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> This was too short since a running engine was moving {{separate}} from the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> This hose was almost solid being under pressure and in time the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> would crack. This was solved by connecting the oil hoses for the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> to and from the engine [...] "up side down" [...] to make the lower hose, now connecting to the top of the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> longer and movable.|$|R

50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>cooling</b> {{is the use}} {{of engine}} oil as a coolant, {{typically}} to remove surplus heat from an internal combustion engine. The hot engine transfers heat to the oil which then usually passes through a heat-exchanger, typically a type of radiator known as an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> The <b>cooled</b> <b>oil</b> flows back into the hot object to cool it continuously.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, it {{is usually}} {{desirable}} to minimize the number of heat transfer stages {{in order to maximize}} the temperature difference at each stage. However, Detroit Diesel 2-stroke cycle engines commonly use <b>oil</b> <b>cooled</b> by water, with the water in turn cooled by air.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>cooling</b> is {{commonly}} used to cool high-performance motorcycle engines that are not liquid-cooled. Typically, the cylinder barrel remains air-cooled in the traditional motorcycle fashion, but the cylinder head benefits from additional cooling. As there is already an oil circulation system available for lubrication, this oil is also piped to the cylinder head and used as a liquid coolant. Compared to an oil system used solely for lubrication, <b>oil</b> <b>cooling</b> requires additional <b>oil</b> capacity, a greater flow rate through the oil pump, and an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> (or a larger cooler than normal).|$|R

50|$|In July 2007, Bajaj {{began selling}} the Bajaj Pulsar 220 DTS-Fi and Pulsar 180 DTS-i, the former {{featuring}} fuel injection and <b>oil</b> <b>cooled</b> engines, a digital dash, and modern styling. This bike has some features which are totally {{new to the}} Indian market, like the fuel injection itself, rear disc brake and clip-on handlebars (the first two only available in the 220 model).|$|E
50|$|Transforming AC {{voltages}} up to high voltages {{for long}} distance transmission {{and down to}} lower voltages at locations close to their use was a very attractive way {{to get access to}} a new source of power. Improvements in transformer design allowed the original air cooled transformers at the Folsom powerhouse to be replaced in 1900 with more efficient <b>oil</b> <b>cooled</b> transformers.|$|E

This unit is simply a CSD and an <b>oil</b> <b>cooled</b> generator inside the same case. Troubleshooting is simplified as this unit is the line-replaceable electrical generation unit on the engine.|$|E
5000|$|The air and <b>oil</b> <b>cooled</b> {{models can}} be divided into the first {{generation}} and second generation, colloquially referred to as 'slabbies' and 'slingshots' respectively. The 1985-1987 models featured very flat bodies compared to modern sport-bikes, hence the term 'slab-sided'. The 1988-1991 (1992 USA) models are sometimes referred to as slingshots because the carburetors introduced in 1988 were marketed as slingshot carburetors (slingshot describes the cross section of the semi-flat slide carbs).|$|E
50|$|In 1975, the M60A1(RISE) meaning Reliability Improved Selected Equipment was introduced. Its AVDS-1790-2C {{diesel engine}} {{featured}} several changes {{in order to}} improve service life and reliability: new top-loading air cleaners; stronger cylinders; improved starter, fuel injection lines, and nozzles; and better turbosuperchargers. A new 650 ampere <b>oil</b> <b>cooled</b> alternator, a solid state regulator and new wiring harness with more accessible disconnect were also incorporated into its electrical system. The M60A1(RISE)(PASSIVE), which debuted in 1977, featured passive night vision sights for gunner and commander, a new night vision device for the driver and a deep water fording kit.|$|E
5000|$|To {{accommodate}} the ram air tubes, the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> becomes lower and wider.|$|R
50|$|The {{reasons for}} this complex system were threefold. One was to {{eliminate}} any extra aerodynamic drag that a protruding <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> would produce, in this case eliminating the extra drag factor by enclosing it within the engine's forward cowling. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the oil cooler's circular-shaped core to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The downside to this design was that the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} 1918 it was {{announced}} that ABC Motors Ltd had transferred its motor cycle manufacturing and selling rights to Sopwith Aviation Co Ltd, with Granville Bradshaw of ABC Motors Ltd concentrating on design. This allowed him to sell his designs to other companies. He designed a number of engines for Panther motorcycles. He also designed motorcycle engines where the cylinder barrels were <b>oil</b> <b>cooled,</b> and these were made under licence by J Walmsley & Co (Preston) Ltd. The flat-twin 500cc version of this engine was utilised from 1921 on the Zenith-Bradshaw motorcycle. A single cylinder 348cc version was optional for OK-Supreme, Sheffield-Henderson, Dot, Orbit, and Coventry-Mascot in 1922; and a 1100cc V-twin version of this oil-cooled engine was adopted for the Belsize light car.|$|E
5000|$|A new grille, headlights, front {{sidelights}} {{and so-called}} [...] "integrated" [...] bumpers freshened the 900's look for 1987, though the sheet metal was largely unchanged. Several common parts for the 900 and 9000 were introduced for 1988 model year, including brakes and wheel hubs. This {{also meant that}} Saab finally abandoned the use of parking brakes which acted on the front wheels. Vented front brakes also became standard. The Aero model received slightly bigger fender extensions so as to accommodate larger wheels, while the window trim was blacked out on all models. Catalyzed models of all fuel injected engines became available to European buyers, all with cruise control as standard to further help lower emissions. A water and <b>oil</b> <b>cooled</b> turbocharger (replacing the older oil-cooled unit) was also introduced to improve the unit's durability.|$|E
50|$|The Bajaj Pulsar is a {{motorcycle}} brand owned by Bajaj Auto in India. The two wheeler {{was developed by}} the product engineering division of Bajaj Auto in association with Tokyo R&D, and later with motorcycle designer Glynn Kerr. Currently there are five variants available, with engine capacities of 135 cc, 150 cc, 180 cc, 200 cc, 220 cc and 400 cc (Renamed Dominar before release) Previously it was also offered with a 200 cc DTS-i <b>oil</b> <b>cooled</b> engine, which now has been discontinued. Instead a new version Pulsar 200NS was launched in 2012. But then Pulsar 200NS production was discontinued in August 2015 (to be reintroduced in early 2017 with BS IV Emission compliance). With an average monthly sales of around 86,000 units in 2011, Pulsar claimed a 2011 market share of 47% in its segment. By April 2012, more than five million units of Pulsar were sold.|$|E
