25|$|The song Hop Hop has {{political}} tones. It {{describes how}} the states exploit the citizens for their own purposes, how today's political systems are good for nothing, since {{the world is full}} of violence, war, human rights are many times oppressed, we are a subject to global warming and governments do little to save us. Tarkan explained in the interview that the song examines these problems and encourages people to unite, no matter what color <b>our</b> <b>skin</b> is or what religion we follow.|$|E
500|$|Grigorieva {{was born}} in Saransk, Russia. [...] Her parents were music professors. [...] She grew up in Ukraine, and {{at the age of}} 15 moved to Moscow to attend {{university}} in order to learn piano. [...] She said of her experience of learning music as a child, [...] "Diplomas were everything. It wasn't unusual for students to play ten hours a day. <b>Our</b> <b>skin</b> would start to crack. We'd literally have bleeding fingers." [...] Grigorieva finished conservatoire studies in Kazan, and moved to London where she continued her studies and taught music to others. After studying at the Royal College of Music, she moved to the United States and spent time living in New York City and Los Angeles, California. She taught music in the U.S., and patented a technique of instructing music notation to children. Grigorieva composed and performed music, and produced works for theatre and advertisements. A 2006 song she wrote, [...] "Un Dia Llegara", became popular on the Josh Groban album, Awake; this garnered her recognition as a songwriter.|$|E

500|$|Negative reviews {{included}} Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{who gave}} the film one-and-a-half stars out of four saying: [...] "The movie deserves more stars for its bottom-line craft, but all the craft in the world can't redeem its story." [...] Bob Mondello of NPR said the film was [...] "A sadistic, unmotivated home-invasion flick." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that [...] "No one is getting at anything in The Strangers, except the cheapest, ugliest kind of sadistic titillation." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News compared the film to 2007's Vacancy - a comparison which [...] "does [...] "Strangers" [...] no favors. Vacancy director Nimród Antal gave us a pair of heroes who fought like hell to survive, becoming closer and stronger in the effort. Bertino's undeveloped protagonists are colossally stupid and frustratingly passive." [...] Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post panned the film, calling it [...] "a fraud from start to finish." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, said the film [...] "uses cinema to ends that are objectionable and vile," [...] but admitted that [...] "it does it well, with more than usual skill." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said of the director, [...] "Bertino has the pretensions of an artist and the indelicacy of a hack. He tries to get under <b>our</b> <b>skin</b> with a pile driver." [...] Stephen Whitty of The Newark Star-Ledger opined of the film, [...] "Unfolding with an almost startling lack of self-awareness, young filmmaker Bryan Bertino's debut is such a careful, straight-faced knockoff of '70s exploitation films that it plays like a parody." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alveda King, a {{minister}} and pro-life activist and former Georgia State Representative {{who is a}} niece {{of the civil rights}} leader Martin Luther King, appealed to rally attendees to [...] "focus not on elections or on political causes but on honor, on character ... not the color of <b>our</b> <b>skin.</b> Yes, I too have a dream.... That America will pray and God will forgive us our sins and revive us our land." [...] King also addressed the civil rights leaders and members of the black community who had been critical of the rally, responding that [...] "My daddy, Rev. A. D. King, my granddaddy, Martin Luther King, Senior – we are a family of faith, hope and love. And that's why I'm here today. Glenn says there is one human race; I agree with him.
