5|$|The film {{is based}} on the real life of Ron Woodroof, a patient <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS, who {{was the subject of a}} lengthy 1992 article in The Dallas Morning News written by {{journalist}} and author Bill Minutaglio. A month before Woodroof died in September 1992, screenwriter Craig Borten was told about the story by his friend, so he went and interviewed him to create the screenplay; Borten recorded many hours of interviews with Woodroof and had access to his personal journals. Borten wrote a script for what he believed would make a great movie and attempted to attract interest in making the film in mid 1996, with Dennis Hopper attached to direct. Columbia Pictures was set to buy the script but the film was unable to secure financial backing.|$|E

In this cross-sectional study conducted between 2002 - 2003, a randomized sampling was done on 121 drug addict prisoners. A blood sample was taken from each case and serologic tests for HBV, HCV <b>and</b> <b>HIV</b> were done, then complementary tests for <b>HIV</b> (ELISA <b>and</b> Western-blot) were done.

The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>HIV,</b> HCV <b>and</b> HBV were 5. 8, 23. 1 and 4. 1 %, respectively. Injection was the most common route of drug use. Marital status was significantly related to <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> HCV infection. Tatooing and shared syringe use were significantly related to all these infections.

The global HIV pandemic is examined in the context <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> evolution, <b>and</b> the global diversity <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> subtypes <b>and</b> recombinants is discussed in detail.

It is hypothesized that the association observed between syphilis and HIV among MSM is probably due to similar risks associated with both infections. Analysis of data from a survey among MSM in seven Chinese cities reveal that the factors significantly associated with co-infection are older age, education up to senior high school, unprotected anal intercourse, recent STD symptoms, and incorrect knowledge about routes of transmission.|$|E

25|$|While cases <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>and</b> AIDS {{in women}} have {{stabilized}} internationally, Chile {{has seen a}} rise in HIV/AIDS infection. Societal beliefs about traditional women's roles as mothers leads to women being less likely to use contraceptives, increasing the opportunity for disease. Chilean women also often feel subordinate to men due to these traditional belief systems, making women less likely to negotiate {{for the use of}} condoms. In 2007, 28 percent of people with HIV/AIDS in Chile were women. Numbers of women living with HIV is lower than those with AIDS. A study by Vivo Positivo showed that 85 percent of women living with HIV/AIDS reported that they had little to no education or information about HIV/AIDS until diagnosis.|$|E
