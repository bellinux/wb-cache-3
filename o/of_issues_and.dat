Newsletters were published by local performance groups, and fans gathered for Rocky Horror conventions. By the end of 1979, there were twice-weekly showings at over 230 theatres. The National Fan Club was established in 1977 and later merged with the International Fan Club. The fan publication The Transylvanian printed a number <b>of</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> a semi-regular poster magazine was published {{as well as an}} official magazine.|$|E
5|$|Three {{important}} {{works were}} published in 1990: the Publication of Design Management – A Handbook <b>of</b> <b>Issues</b> <b>and</b> Methods by Mark Oakley (Editor), the book Design Management by French researcher Brigitte Borja de Mozota, and the Publication of Design Management – Papers from the London Business School by Peter Gorb (Editor). This new method-based design management approach helped to improve communication amongst technical and marketing managers. Examples of the new methods included trend research, the product effect triad, style mapping, milieus, product screenings, empiric design methods, and service design, giving design a more communicative and central role within organizations.|$|E

Between 2001 and 2003 at Harvard's Berkman Center, Zittrain and Benjamin Edelman studied Internet filtering.

25|$|The {{measure was}} {{sponsored}} by Bill Sizemore and his Oregon Taxpayers United anti-tax group, {{as part of the}} Oregon tax revolt. Proponents were upset by rising property taxes, largely caused by increasing real-estate values in the Portland area. Proponents were concerned about levy elections when there was little awareness <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> turnout was expected to be low. Under Oregon law, two regularly scheduled statewide elections, the primary election in May and the general election in November, are held in every even-numbered year. In addition, four regularly scheduled elections can be held at the local level every year. Beyond this, the legislature may call a special election at any time.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, {{designed}} to solve {{many of the}} issues that had arisen due to the British occupation of Dutch properties during the Napoleonic Wars, as well as issues regarding the rights to trade that existed for hundreds of years in the Spice Islands between the two nations, was a treaty that addressed a wide array <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> did not clearly describe the limitations of expansion by either side in the Malay world. The British establishment of Singapore on the Malay Peninsula in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles exacerbated the tension between the two nations, especially as the Dutch claimed that the treaty signed between Raffles and the Sultan of Johore was invalid, and that the Sultanate of Johore was under the Dutch sphere of influence. The questions surrounding the fate of Dutch trading rights in British India and formerly Dutch possessions in the area also became a point of contention between Calcutta and Batavia. In 1820, under pressures from British merchants with interests in the Far East, negotiations to clarify the situation in Southeast Asia started.|$|E
500|$|His {{second term}} as {{governor}} was undistinguished, but he split with fellow Whig Daniel Webster over a variety <b>of</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> lost the 1843 election to Democrat Marcus Morton. [...] He was reelected to the Senate in 1845, {{where he served}} until 1851. [...] He opposed the Mexican-American War, and worked to prevent the extension of slavery to the territories, {{although he did not}} take a hard line on the matter, voting for most of the provisions of the Compromise of 1850. [...] He retired from public service in 1853, and died the next year.|$|E
500|$|Samuel Shute (January 12, 1662 – April 15, 1742) was an English {{military}} officer and royal {{governor of the}} provinces of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. [...] After serving in the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession, he was appointed by King George I as governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire in 1716. [...] His tenure was marked by virulent disagreements with the Massachusetts assembly on a variety <b>of</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> by poorly conducted diplomacy {{with respect to the}} Native American Wabanaki Confederacy of northern New England that led to Dummer's War (1722–1725).|$|E

500|$|The {{prevailing}} {{public reaction}} to the disaster was one of shock and outrage, directed against a number <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> people: why were there so few lifeboats? Why had Ismay saved his own life when so many others died? Why did Titanic proceed into the ice field at full speed? The outrage was driven not least by the survivors themselves; even while they were aboard Carpathia {{on their way to}} New York, Beesley and other survivors determined to [...] "awaken public opinion to safeguard ocean travel in the future" [...] and wrote a public letter to The Times urging changes to maritime safety laws.|$|E
500|$|Borah opposed Taft over {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> in March 1912 {{announced}} his support of the candidacy of Roosevelt over Taft for the Republican presidential nomination. [...] Most delegates to the 1912 Republican National Convention in Chicago selected by primary supported Roosevelt, but as most states held conventions to select delegates, Taft's control of the party machinery gave him the advantage. [...] A number of states, especially in the South, had contested delegate seats, matters which would be initially settled by the Republican National Committee. Borah was Idaho's Republican National Committeeman {{and was one of}} those designated by the Roosevelt campaign to fight for it on the RNC. As Taft controlled the committee, Borah found few victories. [...] Borah was among those who tried to find a compromise candidate, and was spoken of for that role, but all such efforts failed.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} shot in Vancouver during the summer, where {{temperatures}} were over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented that despite the heat, guest actor Leonard Nimoy [...] "was doing pages and pages of dialogue, and he handled it like a pro," [...] while co-star Joshua Jackson joked that [...] " [...] wife said he practices biofeedback, so {{he knows how to}} control his body temperature". Chappelle called the episode [...] "intriguing because it's a summation of everything that came before it, so we're resolving a lot <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> a lot of questions. But it's also a springboard into the rest of the season". Actor John Noble, who played Walter Bishop, called it [...] "probably one of our strongest and densest episodes" [...] because it [...] "changes the whole direction of the show".|$|E

500|$|The colony's {{governance}} {{had come}} under increased scrutiny by King Charles II {{beginning in the}} 1660s, but it faced a substantial threat in the late 1670s. [...] Crown agent Edward Randolph was sent to New England in 1676 to collect customs duties and to enforce the Navigation Acts. [...] He documented a list <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> took his complaints to the Lords of Trade in London. [...] The colonial leadership was divided on how to answer this threat. [...] Dudley {{was part of a}} moderate faction which supported accommodating the king's demands, along with his brother-in-law Simon Bradstreet and William Stoughton. [...] They were opposed by hardliners who did not want the crown to interfere in the colony's business. [...] These factions were separated in part along class lines; the wealthier land owners and merchants who dominated the legislature's upper house (called the [...] "court of assistants") favored accommodation, while the more representative lower house favored the hardliners.|$|E
500|$|Theramenes' {{reputation}} {{has undergone}} a dramatic shift since the 19th century, when Xenophon's and Lysias' unfavorable accounts were widely accepted, and Theramenes was execrated as a turncoat and blamed for instigating {{the execution of the}} generals after Arginusae. [...] The discovery of Aristotle's Constitution of the Athenians in 1890 reversed this trend for the broad assessment of Theramenes' character, and Diodorus' account of the Arginusae trial has been preferred by scholars since Antony Andrewes undermined Xenophon's account in the 1970s; Diodorus' more melodramatic passages, such as his elaborate presentation of Theramenes' last moments, are still discounted, but he is now preferred on a number <b>of</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>and</b> on the Arginusae trial in particular. Aristophanes, in The Frogs, pokes fun at Theramenes' ability to extricate himself from tight spots, but delivers none of the scathing rebukes one would expect for a politician whose role in the shocking events after Arginusae had been regarded as particularly blameworthy, and modern scholars have seen in this a more accurate depiction of how Theramenes was perceived in his time; Lysias, meanwhile, who mercilessly attacks Theramenes on many counts, has nothing negative to say about the aftermath of Arginusae.|$|E
