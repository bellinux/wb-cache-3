40|$|The aim of {{the first}} part of this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of a new synthetic steroid (7 alpha, 17 alpha) - 17 -hydroxy- 7 -methyl- 19 -norpregn- 5 (10) -en- 20 -yn- 3 -one (Org OD 14), on anterior pituitary (AP) and neurointermediate pituitary lobe (NIL) contents and on circulating levels of beta-endorphin (beta-EP) in rats. Three weeks after ovariectomy, groups of 9 rats were treated with either Org OD 14 (2 or 10 micrograms/day/rat for 14 days) or a placebo. In addition, 2 groups of ovariectomized rats were also treated with oestradiol benzoate (EB) (2 or 10 micrograms/day/rat for 14 days) to compare the effectiveness of the new steroid with that of a classical <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>substance.</b> beta-Ep concentrations were measured in plasma and in AP and NIL extracts by means of double-antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA), employing a specific anti-camel beta-EP (C-terminal fragment). Both doses of Org OD 14 induced a significant dose-related increase in plasma and pituitary lobe beta-EP concentrations as compared with the results on placebo treatment. By comparison, EB was active only at a dose of 10 micrograms/day. Despite the common stimulatory effects of EB and Org OD 14 on pituitary beta-EP, these findings suggest that the two steroids have different modes of action. The second part of the study investigated the changes in beta-EP and beta-lipotrophin (beta-LPH) plasma levels in a group of post-menopausal women treated for 6 months with Org OD 14 (2. 5 mg/day) in comparison with the levels in a placebo-treated group. The clinical efficacy of Org OD 14 treatment in post-menopausal symptoms was confirmed, as well as its lack of or only transient effect on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. beta-EP and beta-LPH plasma levels were significantly higher in the Org OD 14 -treated group than in the placebo group as from the second month until the end of the observation period...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{literature}} survey into the consequences of hormone disrupting, and more in particular <b>oestrogenic,</b> <b>substances</b> for human health are summarized. For about 55 environment-contaminating (groups of) substances {{it is assumed that}} they may interfere with human reproduction via a hormone disrupting mechanism, probably via a wide range of toxic mechanisms. Available data indicate {{that a large number of}} these substances does not elicit their effects, if any, through interaction with the oestrogen receptor. The attention for the xenoestrogenic substances follows a reported possible decline in the quality of the human sperm. For other phenomena, e. g. breast and testicular cancers an increase in occurrence is reported. It is thought that these phenomena might be related to an increased exposure to <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>substances.</b> However, experimental data, supporting this hypothesis do not exist. A preliminary estimation indicates that exposure to anthropogenic environmental oestrogens contributes much less to the total exposure to oestrogens than exposure to endogenous or almost inevitable exposure to natural oestrogens via the food. At least part of the reported phenomena may be attributable to other factors which have changed in time e. g. diet composition and total energy intake. For a more definite conclusion about any causal relationship between the occurrence of health phenomena and exposure to environmental hormone disruptors additional scientific research into the nature and severity of the reported phenomena, the extent to which people are exposed and the association between the two of these is required...|$|R
40|$|For many years,ovariectomy {{has been}} known to cause {{cessation}} of oestrus and modification of secondary sex characteristics in animals# In 1913, Fellner observed that transient oestrous symptoms could he produced by injecting an ovariectomized animal with extracts of ovaries. These oestrous symptoms could be followed in the rat by observing histological changes in the vaginal epithelium and in 1923 this keratinization of the vaginal wall was used in the development by Allen and Doisy (1923) of a quantitative test for oestrogenic substances. Four years later, using this method of bioassay, Ascheim and Zondek (1927) discovered that extracts of human pregnancy urine possessed much greater oestrogenic activity than did ovarian extracts. This observation led to a closer examination of pregnancy urine and within two years the first crystalline <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>substance,</b> oestrone (oestra- 1 : 3 : 5 -triene- 5 -ol- 17 *-one), was isolated from urine independently by two groups of workers - Doisy, Veler and Thayer (1929) and Butenandt (1929). In the following year, oestriol (oestra- 1 : 3 : 5 -triene- 3 : 16 a: 17 p-triol) was isolated from the same source first by Marrian (1930) and soon after by Doisy, Thayer, Levin and Curtis (1930), In 1933, Schwenk and Hildebrandt succeeded in reducing oestrone to an oestradiol (later shown to be oestradiol 17 p (oestra- 1 : 5 : 5 - triene- 3 : 17 p-di. ol)) which was found to possess higher oestrogenic activity than either oestrone or oestriol. As a result of this finding, oestradiol- 17 P was adopted as the probable active principle secreted by the ovaries. Although this oestrogen was isolated from pregnant mares * urine (Wintersteiner, Schwehk and Whitman, 1935) and sows 1 ovaries (Mac Corquodale, Thayer and Doisy, 1936) it was not until 1939 that Smith, Smith, Huffman, MacCorquodale» Thayer and Doisy isolated it from human pregnancy urine. Between 1939 and 1953 no further metabolites of oestrogen metabolism were isolated from urine although a number of investigators reported the presence in various urine extracts of unknown substances whose chemical and physical properties suggested that they might prove to be derivatives of known oestrogens (Pincus and Pearlman, 1943; Serchi, 1952; Zondek and Finkelstein, 1952; Migeon, 1953; Braunsberg, Stern and Swyer, 1954), Only one of these led to the actual isolation of an oestrogen metabolite, viz. 16 -oxo-oostrone (oestra- 1 : 3 : 5 triene- 3 -ol- 16 : 17 -dione) which Serchi (1953) obtained in crystalline form from the urine of nonpregnant women...|$|E

40|$|Oestrogenic hormones were {{originally}} isolated from ovarian follicles and from placental tissue and {{were believed to}} occur only in female animals. Laqueur et al.

One of the <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>substances</b> in human male urine was subsequently identified as oestrone (Dingemanse et al., 1938), while later on oestradiol and oestriol were also found to be present in urine from men (see: Diczfalusy & Lauritzen, 1961). Since then, the occurrence of oestrogens in the urine of male animals from several species has been described (see: Velle, 1966). However, information on the precise origin of these oestrogenic hormones and on the regulation of the production of oestrogens in the male animal is still limited.

40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} may {{be addressed}} (Nicola. Beresford@Brunel. ac. uk). Abstract–Vitellogenin (VTG) is a precursor of egg-yolk protein {{and is therefore}} present at high concentrations in the plasma of female fish. In male fish, VTG concentrations are usually undetectable or low, but can be induced upon exposure to <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>substances</b> either via the water or the diet. This work was carried out to determine the reason for apparently elevated VTG concentrations in unexposed stock male fathead minnow maintained in our laboratory.

This reduction in male VTG concentrations drastically increased the sensitivity of the VTG test in further studies carried out with these fish. Moreover, a review of published concentrations of VTG in unexposed male fathead minnow suggests that this problem may exist in other laboratories. The fathead minnow is a standard ecotoxicological fish test species and so these findings will be of interest to any laboratory carrying out fish tests on endocrine disrupting chemicals...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lignans – <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>substances</b> {{present in}} various foods – are {{associated}} with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, but not much is known regarding their effects on survival. METHODS: In a follow-up study of 2653 postmenopausal breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2005, vital status and causes of death were verified through end of 2009. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for estimated enterolignans, lignan-rich foods, and dietary fibre in relation to overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age at diagnosis and adjusted for prognostic/confounding factors. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 6. 4 years, and 321 women died, 235 with breast cancer. High estimated enterolactone and enterodiol levels were associated with significantly lower overall mortality (highest quintile, HR 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 40 – 0. 89, PTrend 0. 02 and HR 0. 63, 95 % CI 0. 42 – 0. 95, PTrend 0. 02, respectively).

40|$|Coumestrol is a plant {{oestrogen}} {{found in}} many forage crops, particularly in alfalfa (Medicago sati-va). A high level of <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>substances</b> fed to cattle or sheep may result in several adverse biologi-cal effects, including increased teat length, gesta-tion time, and uterine weight, as well as prolapsed vagina. In contrast, beneficial effects of alfalfa silage have also been reported; an increased rate of growth and milk production can serve as good examples (Vagnoni and Broderick, 1997; Broderick et al., 1999). Although it {{has been known for}} a long time that alfalfa haylage containing 37 ppm of coumestrol or more caused clinical signs of oestro-genic stimulation in cattle (Lookhart, 1980), data on coumestrol content in alfalfa silage are surpris-ingly sporadic. In contrast, a great attention has been paid to the quality of silages from the aspect of water activity, dry matter content, application of inoculants, and length of chopped forage (Whiter and Kung, 2001; Broderick et al., 2002) as these conditions are important for the proper fermenta-tion. e objective of the present study was to inves-tigate the effect of several additives (inoculant, su-crose, formic acid, and their combination) on the coumestrol level in alfalfa silages made of herbage from the first and second cut.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comTranscriptional activation of the gene coding for the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin by oestrogens does not follow the classical model of oestrogen receptor action. The oxytocin promoter does not contain an oestrogen response element (ERE), but instead a high-affinity binding site for nuclear orphan receptors. In the present study, the oestrogen-dependent up-regulation of the bovine oxytocin promoter is investigated in MDA-MB 231 cells. Control by oestrogen is shown {{to be dependent on}} the integrity of the nuclear orphan receptor binding site and the presence of ligand-activated oestrogen receptor, but independent of oestrogen receptor binding to DNA. Partial agonists tamoxifen and raloxifen and the pure antagonist ICI 182 780 all show agonistic activities on transcription, while exhibiting normal binding affinities to oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha. Nuclear orphan receptors oestrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) and germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) are expressed to significant levels in MDA-MB 231 cells. Binding of ERRalpha to the oxytocin promoter binding site can be demonstrated, suggesting the involvement of this nuclear orphan receptor in oestrogen-dependent up-regulation. The oestrogenic stimulation of the oxytocin promoter apparently is dependent on the stimulation of the transcriptional activity of this nuclear orphan receptor by ERK- 1 /ERK- 2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases). This novel nonclassical mechanism of oestrogen action most probably is not restricted to the regulation of neuropeptide hormone expression, but may further contribute to the multitude of tissue-specific effects of <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>substances.</b> M.

Depending on the activation or not the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis we can find central precocious puberty or peripheral. New aetiologies are being discussed during the last decade due to the big part of idiopathic precocious and early puberty is being diagnosed. Apart of genetics, metabolic, social and environmental risk factors are on the table.

40|$|Leguminous {{fodder crops}} such as lucerne contain <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>substances</b> and their {{precursors}} that may interfere with reproduction in sheep. There is no definite information about the actual levels of oestrogenicity of New Zealand lucerne crops and {{the magnitude of the}} effect that they have on the reproduction of sheep. There is no information about when a crop may be unsafe for ewes to graze just prior to mating and a simple measurement of sheep is needed to provide an alert so sheep farmers can move sheep off a crop or leave them on knowing {{that there will be no}} deleterious effects on subsequent lambing performance. The sheep farm study was an incidental finding from a farmer who noticed udder development in pre-pubertal (25 - 28 weeks of age) lambs (n = 22) grazing lucerne (oestrogenicity ranging from 98. 6 – 149. 6 µg oestradiol equivalent/kg DM) compared with lambs grazing grass (n = 36) that showed no udder development. Differences in teat length, teat width, mammary development and vulva colour were measured on two occasions – straight after grazing oestrogenic lucerne (12 March) and 35 days later (16 April), 4 weeks after the removal from the lucerne crop. The experimental study was designed to provide a reference calibration with known dosage of an oestrogen. For this 12 Coopworth ewes (42 - 44 weeks of age) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments (n = 4, per treatment) : 0, 0, 1, 1. 0 mg β-oestradiol every 3 days for 40 days. Measurements of teat length, teat width and mammary development was measured every 6 days and, on day 41, the ewes were killed and vulva colour, mammary weight, ovary weight and uterus weight were measured and the number of follicles and corpora lutea were counted. In both studies photographs of the mammary region were taken to provide an alternative measurement technique to use of calipers. Results of the sheep farm study showed lambs grazing oestrogenic lucerne were heavier, had longer teat lengths (2. 1 mm difference), with larger teat widths (4. 63 mm difference) than sheep grazing grass and mammary development (in 14 out of 25 lambs grazing lucerne) had occurred. There was no change in vulva colour. After removal from lucerne there was a slight reduction in the oestrogen-related changes and the grass-fed lambs had experienced some mammary/teat development in the intervening period. In the experimental trial, there were dose-related effects on the live weight, teat length, mammary development, uterus weight, ovary weight and mammary weight. There were no changes in teat width, vulva redness or colour saturation, numbers of ovarian follicles and there were no corpora lutea present. Measurements taken from photographs provided reliable information about mammary/teat dimensions. Although the pre-pubertal lambs grazing lucerne were receiving less oestradiol equivalent daily than the older ewes supplied with known amounts of oestradiol (181. 2 – 274. 9 µg oestradiol equivalent versus 333. 3 µg oestradiol per day, respectively), they showed a greater sensitivity to this hormonal stimulus than was exhibited by the pubertal ewes...|$|R
40|$|The histochemical {{demonstration}} of adrenergic innervation in the isthmus of the rabbit oviduct (Brundin, 1965) {{raises the possibility}} that these nerves are of significance in the control of egg transport.

40|$|More than 1400 herbal {{products}} or herbal-derived compounds are commonly commercialised for health uses worldwide (Tyler, 1996). Herbs are considered dietary supplements, and therefore {{are subjected to}} a very limited form of regulation, and advertisements normally highlight their potential activities without mentioning any side effect. Also, herbs are generally believed to be 'natural', and hence safe. Many nutritional supplements contains herb compounds usually not present in the diet (e. g. Ginko biloba, horse- chestnut), and only 10 % of the herbs used in nutritional supplements are commonly present in the food (e. g. garlic, soy, blueberry, green the, ginger, curcuma) (Eisenberg et al., 1993). There is much interest in "alternative natural approaches" in sport. It is appealing for athletes to use 'natural' substances with similar activity to 'pharmacological' ones in term of improving performance, are not considered doping, and are considered side-effects free (Table 1). Indeed, many herbal dietary supplements marketed on internet are presented as legal alternative to illicit drugs (Denneey et al., 2005). EcdysteroidsEcdysteroids are the steroid hormones of arthropods (Figure 1). They also occur in some plants, where they are known as phytoecdysteroids, and are believed to contribute to deter invertebrate predators. In insects, they regulate moulting and metamorphosis, may regulate reproduction and diapause. Most actions of ecdysteroids are mediated by intracellular receptor complexes, which regulate gene expression in a tissue- and development-specific manner (Lehmann et al 1989). Several phytoecdysteroids have anabolic growth-promoting effects on mice, rats, pigs and Japanese quails. Ecdysteroids stimulate muscle growth, and this anabolic effect promotes increased physical performance without training. Ecdysteroids are also able to increase muscle ATP content in vitamin D-deprived rats (Báthori, 2002). Ecdysteroids stimulate protein synthesis in the mouse liver, heart and muscles, and act on lipids methabolism, reduce glucagon-induced hyperglycaemia, and enhance glucose utilization by tissues. The mechanism involved {{seems to be an}} increase of tissue sensitivity to insulin (Bathori and Pongracz, 2005). PhytooestrogensPhytooestrogens are biologically active plant substances with a chemical structure similar to oestradiol. This structural similarity accounts for their ability to bind to oestrogen receptors, and exert various oestrogenic or anti-oestrogenic effects. There are three main classes of phytooestrogens: isoflavones, coumestans, and lignans. Most of the phytooestrogens have a higher affinity to oestrogen receptor beta than alpha. The former is strongly expressed in the ovary, uterus, brain, bladder, testis, prostate, bone, cardiovascular system, and lungs. Expression of oestrogen receptor beta appears to occur at different sites in the brain than oestrogen receptor alpha. (Setchell and Cassidy, 1999) The oestrogenic effect of phytooestrogens produces reproductive disturbances in sheep, and a phytooestrogen-rich diet is associated with a lower risk of breast and prostate cancer, and of cardiovascular disease (Adlercreutz, 1990). In vitro, phytooestrogens exert both proliferative (oestrogenic) and antiproliferative (antioestrogenic) effects in human cell lines (Wang et al., 1996). In humans, isoflavones increase the length of the follicular phase, with suppression of the midcycle surges of FSH and LH. Some dietary phytooestrogens can produce mild oestrogenic effects in postmenopausal women, including oestrogen- like effects on vaginal cytology and reductions in hot flushes, and oestrogen-like activity on bone and lipid metabolism (Cassidy et al., 1994). Isoflavones demonstrate anticarcinogenetic activity, inhibiting angiogenesis and cell progression, inhibiting aromatase enzyme, and stimulating sex hormone binding globulin synthesis (Messina et al., 2006). Most of the phytooestrogens-based preparations freely available on the market are proposed as legal and non-toxic anti-oestrogenic compounds (to counterbalance the side effects of anabolic steroids, mainly based on methoxyflafones (Usui, 2006)), as fat lowering {{products or}} sexual enhancing compounds based mainly on plant extracts from Commiphora Mukul (Guggulsterone), Eurycoma Longifolia (methoxyflavone), Vitex Agnus Castus and Astragalus Root (isoflavones). Plant sterolsPlant sterols interfere with the uptake of both dietary and biliary cholesterol from the intestinal tract in humans. They appear to decrease the solubility of cholesterol in the oil and micellar phases, thus displacing cholesterol from bile salt micelles and interfering with its absorption. Fish develop infertility when exposed to high levels of wood pulp, which is rich in sitosterol, in the water. High levels of intake of plant sterols may produce an oestrogenic effect, with a significant decrease in testicular weight and sperm concentrations after beta-sitosterol treatment. An increase in the uterine weight of female rats and an increase in basal luteinizing hormone secretion in immature male and female rabbits were also observed following plant sterols treatment. The clinical significance of these findings in humans is unknown, as studies in mammals did not demonstrate any oestrogenic effect in vivo or in vitro (Baker et al., 1999). Plant sterols do not bind to oestrogen receptors. Furthermore, plant sterols do not stimulate transcriptional activity of human oestrogen receptors (Baker et al., 1999). A large number of plant sterols-based preparations are freely available on the market. Most of them are proposed as legal and non-toxic anabolic and fat lowering products, and as sexual enhancing compounds based mainly on plant extracts coming from Gotu Kola, Smilax Officinalis, Muira Puama (which contain fucosterol, stigmasterol, sistosterol, and campesterol). An overviewSome herbal products may be safe and may contain active constituents with beneficial physiologic effects. Also, some herbs are safe in modest amounts but they may become toxic at higher doses. For example, liquorice root can be used safely for treating duodenal and gastric ulcers, but large amounts of liquorice can cause serious side effects such as hypokalemia, high blood pressure, and heart failure. Finally, other herbs, toxic by themselves: for example, germander, an herb used in some weight-loss programs, can cause fatal hepatitis. Other herbs may be toxic because of possible contaminants: the Chinese herbs caowu and chuanwu used for the management of rheumatism, arthritis, bruises, and fractures may contain highly toxic potentially fatal alkaloids such as aconitine. Therefore, despite the increased tendency to seek natural therapies, athletes have to be aware that "natural" does not equal to "safe. " Herbs should not be touted as miraculous side effects-free substances, but rather as compounds that work through simple biochemistry. The effects of most herbal supplements have not been studied using rigorous scientific methodology, and the hyperbolic advertising and advocacy literature surrounding herbal products often contains untested claims, and under-reports side effects. All the preparations mentioned above exhibit hormone-like activity. Evidence in animals of reproductive disturbances associated with ingestion of feed rich in <b>oestrogenic</b> <b>substances</b> includes a lower conception rate in sheep after prolonged isoflavones consumption, infertility in cattle after consuming feed containing coumestrol, decreased fertility in captive cheetahs fed with dietary oestrogens, hyperoestrogenism in pigs fed with diets containing zearalenone, uterotropic effects in mice fed with soybean, reduced fecundity in adult males rats fed a high phytoestrogen diet for 3 days (Glover and Assinder, 2006; Srilatha, 2004) Also, in a population-based cohort study in the United Kingdom, a vegetarian diet during pregnancy was associated with a 5 -fold higher risk of hypospadias, and consumption of a high phytooestrogens containing diet can prolong the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle by suppressing FSH and LH secretion. Unfortunately, little it is known about the endocrinological and reproductive side effects of the mentioned herbal preparations, and even less is known when considering that the used dosages for increasing physical performances have not been studied at all. Given the risks of both short and long term toxicity, side effects and drug interaction, studies regarding the use of herbal supplements are essential (Glover and Assinder, 2006). Athletes should be aware that the safety of these supplements is still unproven, their effect as performance enhancers has not been shown, and the long term effects are unknow...|$|R
