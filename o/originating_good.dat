30|$|Results {{show that}} the {{probability}} of matching with a bad school is always greater than the probability of matching with a good school for teachers originating from bad schools. This is not very surprising. It is attributable to higher rates of transfer at bad schools, leading to more vacancies, and fewer teachers of all types searching for positions at bad schools, leading to less competition for these positions. Table 4 also shows that the probability of finding a match increases with experience level and with <b>originating</b> from a <b>good</b> school. For matching with a <b>good</b> school, <b>originating</b> from a <b>good</b> school dominates experience level. To match with a bad school, higher experience dominates school origin. These probabilities confirm the utility parameter results observed in Table 4, that good and bad schools have different priorities in recruiting teachers.|$|R

Despite these bans, contraband is regularly uncovered in inspections of cargo containers and in domestic markets. This study characterizes the economic factors affecting agricultural and wildlife smuggling by drawing on inspection and interdiction data from USDA and the U. S.

Findings reveal that agricultural and wildlife smuggling primarily include luxury goods, ethnic foods, and specialty goods, such as traditional medicines. Incidents of detected smuggling are disproportionately higher for agricultural <b>goods</b> <b>originating</b> in China and for wildlife <b>goods</b> <b>originating</b> in Mexico.
