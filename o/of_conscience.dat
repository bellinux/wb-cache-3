5|$|Religious views <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> usually {{see it as}} {{linked to}} a {{morality}} inherent in all humans, to a beneficent universe and/or to divinity.

40|$|This study {{examines}} an emotion-based theory <b>of</b> the <b>conscience,</b> which provides forensic practitioners tools {{for assessing the}} state <b>of</b> the <b>conscience.</b> It is operationalized as an emotion-regulating function, making use of empathy, self-conscious emotions, such as shame, pride or guilt, and moral judgment. This was put to test in a questionnaire survey with 59 delinquent and 275 non-delinquent juveniles. As was hypothesized, the functioning <b>of</b> the <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> these groups differed, with offenders having lower levels of some aspects of empathic capacity, being less prone to experiencing shame and guilt, being more prone to experiencing pride, and being more punishment oriented than victim oriented. The research confirmed that operationalization <b>of</b> the <b>conscience</b> in terms <b>of</b> empathy, self-conscious emotions, and moral orientation is feasible...|$|R

5|$|In the 1980s, Franklin {{participated in}} an {{organized}} campaign to win the right for conscientious objectors to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes.

Franklin asserted that the freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed this form of conscientious objection. Her paper was {{to be part of}} an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating the Income Tax Act.

5|$|Paine's creed encapsulates many of {{the major}} themes {{of the rest of}} his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a {{skepticism}} regarding most supernatural claims (here the afterlife, later in the text, miracles); a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself; an animus against corrupt religious institutions; and an emphasis on the individual's right <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects <b>of</b> <b>conscience,</b> and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} the notion <b>of</b> “literary <b>consciences</b> <b>of</b> the crisis”, i. e., forms <b>of</b> opposite <b>consciences</b> in times <b>of</b> capitalist crises that express themselves {{by means of}} literary works, marked by a profound negativity {{in relation to the}} present. These forms <b>of</b> <b>consciences</b> are engaged in the dual task of describing the effects of barbarism settled by the crisis and also of narrating the changes that occurred in the society and the ways of life of individuals. Furthermore, they would be charged with utopian energy, {{in such a way that}} the negation of the present world opens space to the possibility of another world. With this notion, I intend to reaffirm the specificity, in the historical present characterized by structural crisis, potentiality and relevance of literature to the construction of a radical critique of present time. I return to the works of Franz Kafka, Aldous Huxley and Samuel Beckett, aligning them with distinct historical periods: The Age of Catastrophe, the Golden Age and the Fall, respectively...|$|R

Rowlf {{became the first}} Muppet to make regular appearances on a network show, The Jimmy Dean Show. Henson was so grateful for this break that he offered Jimmy Dean a 40% interest in his production company, but Dean declined, stating that Henson deserved all the rewards for his own work, a decision <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> Dean never regretted. From 1963 to 1966, Henson began exploring film-making and produced a series of experimental films. His nine-minute experimental film, Time Piece, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1966. The year 1969 saw the production of The Cube, another Henson-produced experimental movie.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January the {{fourteen}} began a one-week hunger strike which was joined, according to rights activist Mohamed al-Maskati, by another 150 prisoners.

He was transferred to hospital in April as he kept reducing the amount of his glucose intake. On 30 April 2012, the Court of Cassation reduced Al-Hur Yousef al-Somaikh's sentence from two years to six months and he was released as he had already served his sentence. The court also announced that the thirteen other defendants would be retried by a (civilian) criminal court of appeal, but they were not released from prison, leading to criticism from the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Freedom of Religion, {{covered in}} Articles 25–28, {{provides}} religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, {{there is no}} official State religion, and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and neutrally. Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> {{and the right to}} preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality and health, {{and the power of the}} State to take measures for social welfare and reform. The right to propagate, however, does not include the right to convert another individual, since it would amount to an infringement of the other's right to freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects, subject to public order, morality and health, to manage their own affairs in matters of religion, set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes, and own, acquire and manage property in accordance with law. These provisions do not derogate from the State's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination. The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution. Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent.|$|E
