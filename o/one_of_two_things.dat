5|$|To {{amend the}} Constitution, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> must happen before the National Assembly can {{consider}} the measure: The president must suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send {{a petition to}} the National Assembly. Both chambers of the National Assembly must discuss the proposed amendments {{for a minimum of}} three months. Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there is a state of emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it must be approved by either two-thirds of both chambers of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus. Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.|$|E

These large supplies are common among species that live entirely off yolk during their development. Most female frogs had around 40 ripe eggs, almost double that {{of the number of}} juveniles ever found in the stomach (21–26). This means <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>things,</b> that the female fails to swallow all the eggs or the first few eggs to be swallowed are digested.|$|E

At a penalty shootout, the goalkeeper's job is critical and will largely determine the outcome of the match.

However, {{there was}} a marked {{difference}} between the polling figures for the two Conservative candidates. Keith Taylor got 302 votes more than his co-candidate. This can only {{be accounted for by}} some combination <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> following <b>things</b> either a large number of electors voted for only one candidate, that candidate being Keith Taylor, or {{there was a}} not insignificant amount of voters who opted for Conservative-Labour votes and/or Conservative-Liberal Democrat votes with Keith Taylor being the Conservative they selected for those options.|$|R

Clinopyroxene thermobarometry is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> several geothermobarometers. <b>Two</b> <b>things</b> make this method especially useful: first, clinopyroxene is a common phenocryst in igneous rocks easy to identify; and secondly, the crystallization of the jadeite component of clinopyroxene implies a growth in molar volume being thus a good indicator of pressure.|$|R

In fact, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> other <b>things</b> could have been true: that the testes modified or activated a constituent of the blood or that the testes removed an inhibitory factor from the blood. It was not proven that the testes released a substance that engenders male characteristics until it was shown that the extract of testes could replace their function in castrated animals.
