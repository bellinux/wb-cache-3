25|$|It is {{possible}} for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks {{can be part of}} the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the <b>oven</b> <b>door,</b> are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|E
25|$|The pavlova has a {{crisp and}} crunchy outer shell, and a soft, moist marshmallow-like centre, in {{contrast}} to meringue which is usually solid throughout. It has been suggested the addition of cornflour {{is responsible for the}} marshmallow centre, although it has been debated that the cornflour is just another egg white stabiliser in addition to the acid. The consistency also makes the pavlova significantly more fragile than meringue. Because the pavlova is notorious for deflating if exposed to cold air, when cooking is complete it is left in the oven to fully cool down before the <b>oven</b> <b>door</b> is opened.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooking chamber}} {{is similar to}} a Faraday cage to prevent the waves from coming out of the oven. Even though there is no {{continuous}} metal-to-metal contact around the rim of the door, choke connections on the door edges act like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent leakage. The <b>oven</b> <b>door</b> usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of conductive mesh some distance from the outer panel to maintain the shielding. Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the microwaves' wavelength (12.2 cm for the usual 2.45 GHz), microwave radiation cannot pass through the door, while visible light (with its much shorter wavelength) can.|$|E

Manufacturers are having to look to their design and development processes to service these demands. Traditional approaches have been to use prototype testing and only delve more deeply into specific aspects of the performance when issues arise. In this work the complex flow within the cooling circuit of {{the door of a}} pyrolytic oven is studied. A combination of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and experimental techniques is used. It will be shown that CFD can help with the achievement of an optimal solution, with the understanding of the flow behaviour {{and that there is a}} synergy between the numerical and experimental techniques. Using only one of these techniques would limit the understanding of the flow behaviour and could lead to a less than optimal solution to the design problem.

40|$|The Behavior of Spent Fuel in Storage (BSFS) Project has {{conducted}} research to develop data on {{spent nuclear fuel}} (irradiated U 0 {sub 2 }) {{that could be used}} to support design, licensing, and operation of dry storage installations. Test Series B conducted by the BSFS Project was designed as a long-term study of the oxidation of spent fuel exposed to air. It was discovered after the exposures were completed in September 1990 that the test specimens had been exposed to an atmosphere of bottled air contaminated with an unknown quantity of fluorine. This exposure resulted in the test specimens reacting with both the oxygen and the fluorine in the oven atmospheres. The apparent source of the fluorine was gamma radiation-induced chemical decomposition of the fluoro-elastomer gaskets used to seal the <b>oven</b> <b>doors.</b> This chemical decomposition apparently released hydrofluoric acid (HF) vapor into the oven atmospheres. Because the Test Series B specimens were exposed to a fluorine-contaminated oven atmosphere and reacted with the fluorine, it is recommended that the Test Series B data not be used to develop time-temperature limits for exposure of spent nuclear fuel to air. This report has been prepared to document Test Series B and present the collected data and observations...|$|R
40|$|Coke oven {{battery is}} complex and {{multifaceted}} facility in terms of air pollutant emissions. As far as stack or quenching tower does not cause major difficulties of emission measurement, the fugitive emission measurement from sources such as battery top elements (charging holes, ascension pipes) or <b>oven</b> <b>doors</b> is still complicated and not fully solved problem. This article presents the discussion concerning main problems and errors likely {{to be made in}} particular stages of procedure of fugitive emissions characterization from coke oven battery (selection of sampling points, sampling itself, measurement of air velocity over battery top and laboratory analyses). In addition, results of concentrations measurements of selected substances characteristic for the coking process (naphthalene, anthracene, 4 PAHs and TSP) originating from fugitive sources of coke oven battery and subjected to reporting under the E-PRTR are presented.

50|$|No. 1: A one-storey {{residential}} {{house at}} the corner of the street. There are six windows on both the facade and the other street side of the building. The door and window sides have Gothic parts, and some parts of the wall were built during the Middle Ages. It was fully renovated in 1712 by Doctor Lawrence. Arany Sas Gyógyszertár (Golden Eagle Pharmacy) operated here until 1745. Frames of the Tárnok utca side door are from around 1780. The facade was rebuilt in Classical style in 1820 but the Baroque statue niche was left in place. In 1974 Margit Kovács’s sculpture Madonna with Her Child was placed here. Some original <b>ovens,</b> <b>door</b> and window frames dating from the 16th century were found. No. 2: This is a one-storey residential house with a facade broken with some cantilevers. It was underwalled during the 16th century. There are two old windows frames on the facade to the Anna utca. One is from the Middle Ages, and one is from the 15th century. Door is covered with barrel vault. It was reorganised at numerous occasions. In the Middle Ages it was two separate buildings. There was a lane between them up to the arriving of the Ottomans. This building was designed by Károly Hild for Rozália Weiner. It was rebuilt in 1934.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of our investigation into the measurement and filtering of microwave radiation, and the subsequent development of a microwave reduction solution for modern building architecture utilising Energy Saving Glass (ESG), in conjunction with Frequency Selective (FSS) surfaces through which useful signals can be filtered. In the investigation, radiation power density levels arising from the three common microwave sources (radio base stations, mobile phones, and microwave ovens) were measured, and the results were compared with the standards provided by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. For the radio base stations, the relationship between radiation intensity levels and the important location parameters at the measurement point, e. g., line of sight, distance and elevation, are discussed in detail. Our results show that locations having the same elevation level as the RBS receive higher level of radiation, compared to those locations not at the same level. Power density of the radiation from microwave ovens was measured at various distances and angles. The results indicate that most of the radiation is emitted through the main <b>door</b> of the <b>ovens,</b> with the <b>doors</b> normally being assembled utilising simple float glass. ESG was found to have desirable radiation attenuating characteristics, and was identified as an effective replacement for float glass in microwave <b>oven</b> <b>doors.</b> In our investigation of the third potentially hazardous source of microwave radiation, the mobile handset, measurements were carried out in order to analyse power density levels during both call and idle times. Our results confirm that some handsets do not change power level, while others use higher power to communicate with the base station during a call. It is our recommendation that the manufacturers label each handset with the specific transmission power level in order to provide users with the relevant information. The conclusions drawn from our investigations lead us to recommend that ESG be used in buildings close to RBS, so that the levels of unnecessary radiation are reduced. However, useful signals would still be transmitted by utilising the dual bandpass FSS filters designed as part of this work. We designed two distinct models of bandpass FSS filters on hard coated ESG. The first filter that we designed will block microwave signals coming from weather radar, personal communication devices, power transmission lines and emergency service radios, while transmitting useful UMTS and Wi-Fi signals; minimising the radiation impact.

6000|$|Donkin {{looked out}} for a fair wind along with the rest. No one knew the venom of his {{thoughts}} now. He was silent, and appeared thinner, as if consumed slowly by an inward rage at the injustice of men and of fate. He was ignored by all and spoke to no one, but his hate for every man dwelt in his furtive eyes. He talked with the cook only, having somehow persuaded the good man that he--Donkin--was a much calumniated and persecuted person. Together they bewailed the immorality of the ship's company. There could be no greater criminals than we, who by our lies conspired to send the unprepared soul of a poor ignorant black man to everlasting perdition. Podmore cooked what there was to cook, remorsefully, and felt {{all the time that}} by preparing the food of such sinners he imperilled his own salvation. As to the Captain--he had sailed with him for seven years, now, he said, and would not have believed it possible that such a man... "Well. Well... There it was... Can't get out of it. Judgment capsized all in a minute... Struck in all his pride... More like a sudden visitation than anything else." [...] Donkin, perched sullenly on the coal-locker, swung his legs and concurred. He paid in the coin of spurious assent for the privilege to sit in the galley; he was disheartened and scandalised; he agreed with the cook; could find no words severe enough to criticise our conduct; and when in the heat of reprobation he swore at us, Podmore, who would have liked to swear also if it hadn't been for his principles, pretended not to hear. So Donkin, unrebuked, cursed enough for two, cadged for matches, borrowed tobacco, and loafed for hours, very much at home, before the stove. From there he could hear us {{on the other side of}} the bulkhead, talking to Jimmy. The cook knocked the saucepans about, slammed the <b>oven</b> <b>door,</b> muttered prophesies of damnation for all the ship's company; and Donkin, who did not admit of any hereafter (except for purposes of blasphemy) listened, concentrated and angry, gloating fiercely over a called-up image of infinite torment--as men gloat over the accursed images of cruelty and revenge, of greed, and of power....|$|E
