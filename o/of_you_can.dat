5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} the release <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which {{was aimed at}} the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular {{and the concept of}} remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went through the process of mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.|$|E

500|$|The plot of [...] "Day of the Jackanapes" [...] {{is based}} on the 1959 {{political}} thriller novel The Manchurian Candidate. Before filming an episode of his show, Krusty is stopped by the two network executives, who attempt to explain to him why the sitcom Seinfeld worked as a series. After Krusty has announced the cancellation of his show, a group of crying children are seen at the Krustylu Studios, where the show is filmed. The name of the studio {{is based on}} Desilu Studios, a television company based in Los Angeles. In an interview with Kent Brockman, Krusty says that he taped over all episodes of his show that Sideshow Bob was in with episodes of the reality court show Judge Judy. This is a reference to how NBC reused tapes of early episodes of The Tonight Show to film new programs. While in the Springfield Elementary School's tool-shed, Sideshow Bob accidentally steps on a rake and says [...] "Rakes, my old arch-enemy." [...] The scene is a reference to the season 5 episode [...] "Cape Feare", in which Sideshow Bob repeatedly steps on rakes.

500|$|Bryan Singer met Kevin Spacey {{at a party}} after a {{screening}} of the young filmmaker's first film, Public Access, at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival. Spacey had been encouraged {{by a number of}} people he knew who had seen it, and was so impressed that he told Singer and McQuarrie {{that he wanted to be}} in whatever film they did next. Singer read a column in Spy magazine called [...] "The Usual Suspects" [...] after Claude Rains' line in Casablanca. Singer thought that it would be a good title for a film. When asked by a reporter at Sundance what their next film was about, McQuarrie replied, [...] "I guess it's about a bunch of criminals who meet in a police line-up," [...] which incidentally was the first visual idea that he and Singer had for the poster: [...] "five guys who meet in a line-up," [...] Singer remembers. The director also envisioned a tagline for the poster, [...] "All <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go to Hell." [...] Singer then asked the question, [...] "What would possibly bring these five felons together in one line-up?" [...] McQuarrie revamped an idea from one of his own unpublished screenplays — the story of a man who murders his own family and disappears. The writer mixed this with the idea of a team of criminals.|$|E
