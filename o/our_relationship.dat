25|$|Shafarevich {{argued that}} ancient {{socialism}} (such as Mesopotamia and Egypt) was not ideological, as an ideology socialism was {{a reaction to}} the emergence of individualism in the Axial Age. He compared Thomas More's (Utopia) and Campanella's (City of the Sun) visions with what is known about the Inca Empire, and concluded that there are striking similarities. He claimed that we become persons through <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> with God, and argued that socialism is essentially nihilistic, unconsciously motivated by a death instinct. He concluded that we have the choice of either pursuing death or life.|$|E
25|$|Both ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{put forward a}} new {{conceptualization}} of the self. Some ecofeminists, such as Marti Kheel, argue that self-realization and identification with all nature places {{too much emphasis on}} the whole, {{at the expense of the}} independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of androcentrism rather than anthropocentrism. To others, like Karen J. Warren, the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract individualism and embraces the interconnectedness of the living world; relationships, including <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> with non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what it means to be human. Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as racism or speciesism, are all forms of discrimination and are no different from sexism. Thus, anthropocentrism is simply another form of discrimination as a result of our flawed value structure and should be abolished.|$|E

25|$|Ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{have been in}} {{dialogue}} for some time now, and while the debate between them has been very fruitful over the years, the exploration of their relationship remains important. As valuable as our individually reconnecting {{with the natural world}} may be, and as much as such experiences should be encouraged, some have questioned whether this approach is sufficient, given the magnitude of the threat that human encroachment poses to the nonhuman world. With this in mind, the call has been made for a broader challenge to the dominant culture than deep ecological experience may offer. This call has come most forcefully from another school of environmental ethics: ecofeminism. While sharing with deep ecologists a general concern for biocentrism and an appreciation for personal interaction with nonhuman reality, ecofeminists have also offered some harsh criticism of Leopold, Callicott, and advocates of the deep ecological approach, as well as extensionists like Singer and Regan. Like deep ecology, ecofeminism is not a singular theory, and covers a broad range of thought; in rough terms, its criticism of other forms of nature ethics is grounded in an attempt to synthesize the insights of environmental ethics and animal advocacy with a feminist analysis of Western ethics and culture. The resulting attempt to rethink <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> to the animal and nature casts speciesism and anthropocentrism as symptoms of a deeper patriarchy in the Western tradition that needs to be deconstructed before a successful animal ethic can be produced. As Josephine Donovan details, there is evidence to suggest a strong emotional and philosophical affinity among Anglo-American antivivisectionists and suffragettes, who viewed their causes as common responses to Enlightenment rationalism and scientism, and jointly sought a “feminizing” of culture that would liberate human and animal alike. Ecological feminism began as a critique and rejection of the western cultural worldview with its overemphasis on rationality, and linearity. It argued against a Cartesian science which elevated the material and objective above the spiritual and the subjective as appropriate ways of knowing the world. Like deep ecology, ecological feminism stresses the importance of experience, and personal experience at that. However, the ecofeminists seem to be talking about experience in a sense more related to bioregionalism than deep ecology.|$|E

500|$|The {{previous}} single from X, [...] "Talk", was {{a tribute}} to the German band Kraftwerk; similarly, [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was intended by Coldplay to acknowledge American band R.E.M.

So the one great thing about being famous is that I get to meet people who I respect. <b>Our</b> <b>relationship</b> is akin to a dog and its master. I'll always look up to him." [...] The band felt the track resembled R.E.M.'s 1991 single, [...] "Losing My Religion".

500|$|Fred [...] "Curly" [...] Morrison, {{a former}} Browns running back {{who worked as}} an {{advertising}} executive for CBS television, learned in 1960 that Dave Jones was looking to sell the Browns and told the story to Art Modell, a 35-year-old advertising and television executive from Brooklyn. Modell was intrigued, {{partly because of the}} potentially lucrative television rights that one of the NFL's most successful franchises could bring as football began to challenge baseball as America's biggest sport. Having borrowed as much money as he could, Modell completed the purchase in March 1961 for $3.925 million. Bob Gries, who had a share in the Browns from the beginning, agreed to buy in again at the new valuation and take a stake of almost 40%, defraying Modell's costs substantially. As the previous owners did when they took over, Modell quickly assured Cleveland fans that Brown would [...] "have a free hand" [...] in running the organization and awarded him a new eight-year contract. [...] "As far as I'm concerned Paul Brown can send [...] in by carrier pigeon", Modell said. [...] "In my opinion he has no peer as a football coach. His record speaks for itself.
