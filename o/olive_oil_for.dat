25|$|The {{discovery}} of many ancient olive presses in various locations indicates that olive oil production was highly developed in ancient Israel. The oil production center {{dating from the}} 7th century BCE discovered at Ekron, a Philistine city, has over one hundred large olive oil presses, and is the most complete olive oil production center from ancient times to be discovered. It indicates that ancient Israel was a major producer of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>for</b> its residents {{as well as for}} other parts of the ancient Near East, such as Egypt and especially Mesopotamia. In addition to the large-scale olive oil production for commerce and export, presses have been found in ordinary houses, indicating that this was also a cottage industry.|$|E

25|$|The lights can be candles or oil lamps. Electric {{lights are}} {{sometimes}} used and are acceptable {{in places where}} open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated (an incandescent flashlight would be acceptable for this purpose), while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special candelabrum referred to as either a Chanukiah (the modern Israeli term) or a menorah (the traditional name, simply Hebrew for 'lamp'). Many families use an oil lamp (traditionally filled with <b>olive</b> <b>oil)</b> <b>for</b> Hanukkah. Like the candle Chanukiah, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shamash light.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{posited that}} one could have {{inferred}} that meal-offerings would require the purest <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>for</b> if the Menorah, whose oil was not eaten, required pure olive oil, how much more so should meal-offerings, whose oil was eaten.

Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2003[...] The Mishnah taught that there were three harvests of olives, and each crop gave three kinds of oil (for a total of nine types of oil). The first crop of olives were picked {{from the top of the}} tree; they were pounded and put into a basket (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil. The olives were then pressed beneath a beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil. The olives were then ground and pressed again to yield the third oil. Only the first oil was fit for the Menorah, while the second and third were for meal-offerings. The second crop is when the olives at roof-level were picked from the tree; they were pounded and put into the basket (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil (of the second crop). The olives were then pressed with the beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil (of the second crop). The olives were then ground and pressed again to yield the third oil. Once again, with the second crop, only the first oil was fit for the Menorah, while the second and third were for meal-offerings. The third crop was when the last olives of the tree were packed in a vat until they became overripe. These olives were then taken up and dried on the roof and then pounded and put into the basket (Rabbi Judah said around the inside of the basket) to yield the first oil. The olives were next pressed with the beam (Rabbi Judah said with stones) to yield the second oil. And then they were ground and pressed again to yield the third oil. Once again, with the third crop, only the first oil was fit for the Menorah, while the second and third were for meal-offerings..|$|E

Beside him they laid a mantle and a doublet for raiment, and gave him soft olive oil in the golden cruse, and bade him wash in the streams of the river. Then goodly Ulysses spake among the maidens, saying: 'I pray you stand thus apart while I myself wash the brine from my shoulders, and anoint me with <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>for</b> truly oil is long a stranger to my skin.

60|$|Then I {{deemed it}} no harm to slip {{back to the}} {{vineyard}} where the Maid lay, and there I met the good Father Pasquerel, that was her confessor. He told me that now she was quiet, either praying or asleep, for he had left her as still as a babe in its cradle, her page watching her. The bolt had sped by a rivet of her breast-piece, clean through her breast hard below the shoulder, and it stood a hand-breadth out beyond. Then she had wept and trembled, seeing her own blood; but presently, with such might and courage as was marvel, she had dragged out the bolt with her own hands. Then they had laid on the wound cotton steeped with <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>for</b> she would not abide that they should steep the bolt with weapon salve and charm the hurt with a song, as the soldiers desired. Then she had confessed herself to Pasquerel, and so had lain down among the grass and the flowers. But it was Pasquerel's desire to let ferry her across secretly to Orleans. This was an ill hearing for me, yet it was put about in the army that the Maid had but taken a slight scratch, and again would lead us on, a thing which I well deemed to be impossible. So the day waxed late, and few onslaughts were made, and these with no great heart, the English standing {{on the walls and}} openly mocking us.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{lack of a}} {{geographical}} identification protocol <b>for</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> can lead to fraud and health risks.

The defined protocol is applied to samples of PDO Nîmes <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> The accuracy of the extraction procedure is tested against isotopic standards. The values obtained are in conformity with NIST certified values. This consistency demonstrates that no modification of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio is brought about by this protocol.
