5|$|In 2009, Virginia Tech {{was ranked}} 14th in total defense, sixth in passing defense, and 52nd in rushing defense. In scoring defense, the Hokies were 11th nationally, {{permitting}} {{an average of}} 15.75 points per game. The top individual performer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> was linebacker Cody Grimm, who tied for the most forced fumbles in college football during the regular season, with seven. In recognition of the achievement, he earned the Dudley Award, given annually to the top Division I football player in Virginia, and was named a first-team All-ACC and third-team All-America player. Cornerback Stephen Virgil, a starter for the Hokies in 10 of their regular-season games, was declared ineligible for the Chick-fil-A Bowl because of poor grades. Defensive coordinator Bud Foster was wooed by several other teams between {{the conclusion of the}} regular season and the Chick-fil-A Bowl, but Foster remained at Tech after the school created an annuity for Foster, granted if he remained with the team for five more years.|$|E
5|$|Linebacker Ben Taylor was the Hokies' {{defensive}} leader. He was No. 1 on {{the team}} in tackles with 103. That figure included 1.5 sacks. He also had two interceptions, five pass breakups, and one forced fumble. Four year starting linebacker Jake Houseright was the team's No. 2 tackler. He had 75, including five tackles for loss. He also had five pass breakups and recovered one fumble. Free safety Willie Pile, who was {{in his first year}} as a starter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense,</b> was Tech's leading performer in pass coverage. He had six interceptions—the most {{on the team}}—broke up 10 passes, forced one fumble, and recovered one fumble.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August, however, Osuna and San German {{abandoned}} the town, and with 1,200 cavalry soldiers, broke {{the lines of}} circumvallation near the quarter of Santa Engracia, between two Portuguese redoubts, reaching Alburquerque shortly thereafter. San German was replaced in the command of Badajoz by Rodrigo de Múgica y Butrón, his Maestre de Campo General. The Spanish concentrated their efforts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of a large ravelin in Pradaleras garrisoned by 2,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, against Portuguese artillery fire from Cerro del Viento and San Miguel. In late August, news {{of the formation of}} a relief army under Philip IV of Spain's favorite Luis de Haro reached the Portuguese camp, increasing the pressure upon Mendes de Vasconcelos to bring his siege to a conclusion. Unfortunately, the damage caused by the bombardment of the Spanish positions was minor, and heat and disease was decimating the Portuguese army.|$|E

5|$|Potential Republican gubernatorial {{candidates}} were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign}} that the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> against the inevitable Democratic attacks on the Bradley administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Party leaders were encouraged, however, by the deep Democratic divisions at the Music Hall Convention. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Republican senator William Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state Auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was the choice of Governor Bradley, while the latter was supported by Lexington Herald editor Sam J. Roberts. Taylor, like Goebel, was a skilled political organizer. He was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations and seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|The {{injuries}} that had plagued USC {{throughout the season}} continued as All-American tackle Sam Baker left the game because of a hamstring strain and freshman guard Zack Heberer, already substituting for an injured Chilo Rachal, suffered a shoulder bruise. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense,</b> linebacker Rey Maualuga suffered a hip injury and safety Kevin Ellison broke his nose. An uncommon number of injuries, especially along the offensive line, depleted reserve players and forced Trojans {{to reach out to}} the general student population in order to find students with previous lineman experience to help on the scout team's offensive line; however, none were officially added to the roster.|$|E
5|$|This was the 90th {{meeting of}} the rival schools that have fought for the Paul Bunyan Trophy {{annually}} since 1953. Michigan State's 5–1 start was its best since the 1966 team. On the strength of zero fourth quarter points and only 9 second half points, Michigan entered the game tied for first nationally in average points allowed (8.3) and in second in both yards of total offense allowed (207.7) and defensive pass efficiency. Michigan State entered {{the game with a}} 34 points per game average, which was the schools best since the 1978 team. Although Michigan held a 58–26–5 series edge, the home team had won each of the last five meetings and Michigan State had won 7 consecutive home games.

5|$|With {{the defeat}} of these German drives, I Corps {{conducted}} its first offensive mission, participating in the Second Battle of the Marne from 18 July until 6 August, {{which resulted in the}} reduction of the more important salients driven into Allied lines by the German offensives. After a brief period in the defensive sectors of Champagne and Lorraine between 7 August and 11 September, the corps took part in the St. Mihiel attack on 12 September, which reduced the German salient there during the next four days. Then followed another period <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> in Lorraine as preparations advanced for what was to be the final Allied offensive of the war. On 26 September, I Corps troops began the attack northward that opened the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. From that day until 11 November 1918 when the war ended, I Corps was constantly moving forward.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrender}} of Candia ended the {{four and a}} half centuries of Venetian rule in Crete, and brought the Ottoman Empire to its temporary territorial zenith. At the same time however, the cost and casualties incurred during this prolonged war contributed greatly to the decline of the Ottoman state during the latter 17th century. On the other hand, Venice had lost its greatest and most prosperous colony, its pre-eminent trading position in the Mediterranean had diminished, and its treasury was exhausted, having spent some 4,253,000 ducats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of Candia alone. To all this, the Dalmatian gains were insufficient compensation. Upon his return to Venice in 1670, Morosini was tried on charges of insubordination and treason, but was acquitted. Fifteen years later, he would lead the Venetian forces in the Morean War, where the Republic attempted, for the last time, to reverse its losses and reestablish itself as one of the major powers of the Eastern Mediterranean. During that war, in 1692, a Venetian fleet attempted to retake Candia, but failed. The last Venetian strongholds off Crete fell in the last Turkish–Venetian War in 1715. Crete would remain under Ottoman control until 1897, when it became an autonomous state. The island continued under Ottoman suzerainty until the Balkan Wars. In their aftermath, the Ottoman Sultan dropped any claim on the island, and on 1 December 1913 it was formally united to Greece.|$|E
