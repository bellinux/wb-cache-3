5|$|Isabella {{adopted a}} {{tolerant}} religious policy, enabling {{the spread of}} Calvinism, especially in Partium and Kolozsvár.

He died suddenly without male issue in 1564/5, which Mary S. Lovell suggests may have been {{as a result of}} poisoning by his younger brother. All his property was left Bess, to the detriment <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>daughters</b> and brother. When Bess died in 1608 the house was left to her son Charles Cavendish.|$|E
5|$|In March 1553 Suleiman urged Isabella {{to return}} to Hungary. Péter Petrovics rose against Ferdinand, and an {{assembly}} of the Székely people declared their loyalty to John Sigismund.

Deciding in April 1554 that Hungary should be restored to John Sigismund, Suleiman allowed Péter Petrovics to take control of two fortresses in Banat. Henry II of France, engaged in war against the Habsburgs, also urged Isabella {{to return to}} Hungary, promising one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>daughters</b> in marriage to John Sigismund.|$|E

5|$|Leo the Wise died in 912, and {{hostilities}} soon resumed as Simeon {{marched to}} Constantinople {{at the head}} of a large army. Though the walls of the city were impregnable, the Byzantine administration was in disarray and Simeon was invited into the city, where he was granted the crown of basileus (emperor) of Bulgaria and had the young emperor Constantine VII marry one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>daughters.</b> When a revolt in Constantinople halted his dynastic project, he again invaded Thrace and conquered Adrianople. The Empire now faced the problem of a powerful Christian state within a few days' marching distance from Constantinople, as well as having to fight on two fronts.|$|E

During the 1470 meeting of Emperor Frederick and Matthias, a marriage between Matthias and the Emperor's five-year-old daughter Kunigunde of Austria was also discussed, but the Emperor {{was not willing to}} commit himself to the marriage.|$|E

The knife bounced off Wickliffe's breastbone without damaging any major internal organs, and a U.S. Navy officer prevented a second blow from hitting Wickliffe. Wickliffe's attacker, J. McLean Gardner, was disarmed and arrested. Later that night, he wrote Wickliffe a letter of apology. Wickliffe was not seriously injured, and returned home {{three days after the}} attack. Gardner was tried and found to be insane; he was later sent to an asylum.|$|E
