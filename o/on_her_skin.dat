5|$|The woman's veil forms {{a diamond}} shape, {{balanced}} by the inverse flow of a light vest worn beneath her dress. She is shown at a slight angle, but her pose is centred by the interlocked broad lines of arms, décolletage and veil. The woman's head is delicately lit, leaving no strong tonal contrasts <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b> She has a long, thin face, plucked eyebrows and eyelids, and a plucked hairline to create a fashionably high forehead. Her hair is tightly pinned back {{on the rim of}} the bonnet and rests above her ear. Her high headdress and severe hairline accentuate her elongated face, giving it a sculpted appearance.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana {{presents}} a similar account about Kamadhenu, however, here the sage is Vashista {{and the king}} is Vishwamitra. Once, king Vishwamitra with his army arrived at the hermitage of sage Vashista. The sage welcomed him and offered a huge banquet – to the army – that was produced by Sabala – as Kamadhenu is called in the text. The astonished king asked the sage to part with Sabala and instead offered thousand of ordinary cows, elephants, horses and jewels in return. However, the sage refused to part with Sabala, who was necessary {{for the performance of}} the sacred rituals and charity by the sage. Agitated, Vishwamitra seized Sabala by force, but she returned to her master, fighting the king's men. She hinted Vashista to order her to destroy the king's army and the sage followed her wish. Intensely, she produced Pahlava warriors, who were slain by Vishwamita's army. So she produced warriors of Shaka-Yavana lineage. From her mouth, emerged the Kambhojas, from her udder Barvaras, from her hind Yavanas and Shakas, and from pores <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin,</b> Haritas, Kiratas and other foreign warriors. Together, the army of Sabala killed Vishwamitra's army and all his sons. This event led to a great rivalry between Vashista and Vishwamitra, who renounced his kingdom and became a great sage to defeat Vashista.|$|E
5|$|Cale exposes Manticore to the world. Renfro {{decides to}} burn the {{facility}} {{to cover up the}} evidence and is killed in the process. Aided by Joshua (Kevin Durand), a transgenic with canine DNA, Max escapes the facility and frees the other transgenics including Alec (Jensen Ackles), a fellow X5, who later joins Jam Pony. When Max is reunited with Cale he immediately becomes ill and almost dies. Max discovers that Manticore has infected her with a virus specifically designed to kill Cale, and the two must avoid all physical contact to keep him alive. Max learns that Joshua was the first transgenic created by Sandeman, Manticore's founder. Over the course of the season, it is revealed that a millennia-old breeding cult has bred their own super-soldiers who rival the Manticore-produced transgenics. Ames White (Martin Cummins), a government agent tasked with eliminating the freed transgenics, is revealed {{to be a member of}} the cult. When a strange message written in Max's genetic code makes an appearance <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> it is revealed that Sandeman is a renegade from the breeding cult and Ames White is his son. White is still loyal to the cult and hates his father's transgenic creations with a passion. Believing that Max is a threat to the breeding cult's plans they attempt to kill her, but she escapes to Terminal City, an abandoned part of Seattle where hundreds of outcast transgenics have been hiding. When the police begin to surround Terminal City Max convinces the other transgenics to stand their ground rather than run. The series ends with the military surrounding Terminal City as the residents raise their newly designed flag from one of the buildings, and wait for a possible invasion.|$|E

25|$|Working with {{writer and}} {{director}} Theo van Gogh, Hirsi Ali wrote the script and provided the voice-over for Submission (2004), a short film that criticised the treatment of women in Islamic society. Juxtaposed with passages from the Qur'an were scenes of actresses portraying Muslim women suffering abuse. An apparently nude actress dressed in a semi-transparent burqa was shown with texts from the Qur'an written <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b> These texts are among those often interpreted as justifying the subjugation of Muslim women. The film's release sparked outrage among many Dutch Muslims.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Inndia" [...] {{was shot by}} Edward Aninaru, and was uploaded onto Inna's official YouTube channel on 19 September 2012. It was preceded by a lyrics video released on 28 June 2012 on the same platform. The visual begins with shots of a woman smoking and female strippers pole dancing in a club. Inna enterers the building and sits down at the bar starting {{a conversation with the}} female bartender. Subsequently, the singer is seen pole dancing for a gentleman. Later in the video, she cares for a female stripper named [...] "Inndia" [...] with a scar on her face, who sits in a bathtub next to her. Inna also secretly watches how Inndia is beaten by her boss in another scene. Both manage to escape the respective room after Inna breaks a glass over the man's head. Subsequently, they enter the club where the singer pole dances in front of a huge crowd along with other females. [...] "Inndia" [...] is shortly seen sitting on a couch with two other women, who write the words [...] "rock" [...] and [...] "party" [...] <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> with eyeliner. Cut scenes show Inna wearing black lingerie on a bed with a female dressed similarly.|$|E

5000|$|She was graceful in her {{movements}} and expressions, with a constantly changing gaze. The actress was attractive rather than beautiful. Her chin and nose were both somewhat pronounced. Greta's personality was delightful {{and she never}} showed an awareness to the audience that she was conscious of being <b>on</b> camera. <b>Her</b> <b>skin</b> was fair and she possessed blonde hair.

2500|$|She {{says that}} the most terrifying of all her {{memories}} there was when she (in common with other slaves) was marked by a process resembling both scarification and tattooing, which was a traditional practice throughout Sudan. As her mistress was watching her with a whip in her hand, a dish of white flour,ikllj a dish of salt and a razor were brought by a woman. She used the flour to draw patterns <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> and then she cut deeply along the lines before filling the wounds with salt to ensure permanent scarring. A total of 114 intricate patterns were cut into her breasts, belly, and into her right arm.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the album's title Cheryl {{revealed}} she had already contemplated an album title which contained the phrase 3 Words before the title track was recorded. She had considered titles like Three Syllables, although the strongest contender was Unveiled as Cheryl [...] "felt like she didn't have any protection without the girls [...] " [...] and because it correlated with the veil on the album cover. The album's cover was photographed by fashion photographer Nick Knight. It shows the singer bare-shouldered, {{looking over her shoulder}} in an veiled and be-flowered headpiece, the album's title tattooed <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b> Knight said, [...] "although she is photographed all the time by the paparazzi, she is not {{in front of the camera}} for a shoot in the same way as professional models are – she is less used to the process."

Suddenly she began to stare at him, to draw in her knees and feet toward her, sideways, with a feminine movement, as she smoothed out her skirt, and kept it down with a hand on which she leaned. She was a tall, handsome girl, from what he could judge of her half-sitting figure in her torn silk dust-cloak, which, although its cape and one sleeve were split into ribbons, had still protected her delicate, well-fitting gown beneath. She was evidently a lady.|$|E

60|$|She was {{the first}} in the house; and while I was still without I saw a match flash and the lamplight kindle in the windows. The station was a {{wonderful}} fine place, coral built, with quite a wide verandah, and the main room high and wide. My chests and cases had been piled in, and made rather of a mess; and there, {{in the thick of the}} confusion, stood Uma by the table, awaiting me. Her shadow went all the way up behind her into the hollow of the iron roof; she stood against it bright, the lamplight shining <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b> I stopped in the door, and she looked at me, not speaking, with eyes that were eager and yet daunted; then she touched herself on the bosom.|$|E
6000|$|... “Not for Legitimacy,” I {{interrupted}} the inquiry lightly. “But what’s the use asking such questions? It’s like asking the veiled figure of fate. It doesn’t know its own mind nor its own heart. It has no heart. But what if I were to start asking you—who {{have a heart}} and are not veiled to my sight?” She dropped her charming adolescent head, so firm in modelling, so gentle in expression. Her uncovered neck was round like the shaft of a column. She wore the same wrapper of thick blue silk. At that time she seemed to live either in her riding habit or in that wrapper folded tightly round her and open low to a point in front. Because {{of the absence of}} all trimming round the neck and from the deep view of her bare arms in the wide sleeve this garment seemed to be put directly <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> and gave one the impression of one’s nearness to her body which would have been troubling but for the perfect unconsciousness of her manner. That day she carried no barbarous arrow in her hair. It was parted on one side, brushed back severely, and tied with a black ribbon, without any bronze mist about her forehead or temple. This smoothness added to the many varieties of her expression also that of child-like innocence.|$|E
6000|$|And, at last, bending {{lower down}} to feel her breath, {{the beauty and}} {{sweetness}} of those lips {{could no longer be}} resisted, and I touched them with mine. Having once tasted their sweetness and fragrance, it was impossible to keep from touching them again and again. She was not conscious--how could she be and not shrink from my caress? Yet there was a suspicion in my mind, and drawing back I gazed into her face once more. A strange new radiance had overspread it. Or was this only an illusive colour thrown <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> by the red firelight? I shaded her face with my open hand, and saw that her pallor had really gone, that the rosy flame on her cheeks was part of her life. Her lustrous eyes, half open, were gazing into mine. Oh, surely consciousness had returned to her! Had she been sensible of those stolen kisses? Would she now shrink from another caress? Trembling, I bent down and touched her lips again, lightly, but lingeringly, and then again, and when I drew back and looked at her face the rosy flame was brighter, and the eyes, more open still, were looking into mine. And gazing with those open, conscious eyes, {{it seemed to me that}} at last, at last, the shadow that had rested between us had vanished, that we were united in perfect love and confidence, and that speech was superfluous. And when I spoke, it was not without doubt and hesitation: our bliss in those silent moments had been so complete, what could speaking do but make it less! ...|$|E
