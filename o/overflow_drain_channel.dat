50|$|Lake Cochichewick is a lake in North Andover, Massachusetts that {{collects}} {{water from}} Weir Hill {{and other local}} uplands. Its <b>overflow</b> <b>drains</b> into the Cochichewick River, which joins the Merrimack. Brooks School, a private co-educational prep school, {{is located on the}} shores of the lake.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is formed}} by a dam {{constructed}} in the 1950s. Originally the <b>overflow</b> <b>drained</b> to a gully during the winter months, but in 2003, the state spent almost $400,000 building a spillway and release valve to reduce downstream erosion. During the winter of 2007-08, park officials accidentally left the release valve open, causing the lake level to drop far below normal, exposing mudflats that would normally be underwater.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} performance of a new APS-sized CCD image sensor using an advanced 6. 8 µm pixel. The pixels are arranged in a 3970 (H) × 2646 (V) format to support a 3 : 2 aspect ratio. Unique to this pixel is the implementation of an under-the-field oxide (UFOX) lateral <b>overflow</b> <b>drain</b> (LOD) and thin light-shield technology that provides higher charge capacity, higher quantum efficiency, and wider incident angle response. Each pixel contains a microlens to improve sensitivity and a dual-split HCCD shift register with high sensitivity amplifiers, which are used to increase frame rate while lowering noise...|$|R

40|$|Both in {{electrodialysis}} and {{in reverse}} electrodialysis ionic shortcut currents through feed and <b>drain</b> <b>channels</b> cause a considerable loss in efficiency. Model calculations {{based on an}} equivalent electric system of a reverse electrodialysis stack reveal {{that the effect of}} these salt bridges could be reduced via a proper stack design. The critical parameters which are to be optimized are ¿/r and R/r, where ¿ is the lateral resistance along the spacers, R is the resistance of the feed and <b>drain</b> <b>channels</b> between two adjacent cells, and r is the internal resistance of a cell. Because these two parameters are dimensionless, different stacks can be easily compared. The model is validated with two experimental stacks differing in membrane type and spacer thickness, one with large ionic shortcut currents and one where this effect is less. The loss in efficiency decreased from 25 to 5 % for a well-designed stack. The loss of efficiency in reverse electrodialysis and in electrodialysis can be reduced with the aid of the design parameters presented in this paper...|$|R

50|$|The Monterey Bay outlet of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers {{was blocked}} off by uplift about 2 million years ago, and runoff from the Sierra began to {{transform}} the Central Valley into a gigantic lake, called Lake Clyde. This lake stretched 500 mi north to south and was at least 1000 ft deep. About 650,000 years ago the lake catastrophically <b>overflowed,</b> <b>draining</b> into San Francisco Bay and creating the Carquinez Strait, the only major break for hundreds of miles in the Coast Ranges. The narrow outlet trapped some of the sediments of the rivers in the Central Valley, forming the inland Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Since then, this inland sea has periodically reformed during times of intense flooding, the most recent being the Great Flood of 1862. Dams, levees and floodways constructed during the 20th century have thus far prevented this phenomenon from re-occurring.|$|R

40|$|In early 2005 {{a cluster}} of orthostat stones was exposed by coastal erosion at Meur, Sanday, Orkney. The {{excavation}} revealed a stone trough within the centre of an open space defined by walls. It was associated {{with at least one}} compartment and a secondary corbelled cistern with an <b>overflow</b> <b>drain</b> and was surrounded by a mound of dark soil and burnt stones. This burnt mound structure, comparable with other burnt mounds in the Northern Isles, was occupied at some time between the late 2 nd millennium and the mid 1 st millennium BC. The evidence from Meur and its comparison with evidence from elsewhere strongly indicates cooking as the primary function of this burnt mound. It is proposed that such cooking took the form of communal feasts that served to optimise the limited resources of the island's land holdings and so maintain social cohesion. This accords with evidence from elsewhere on Sanday for social and economic stability throughout this period. ...|$|R
50|$|The toys quickly {{start to}} sing and dance in a rave-like fashion, aided by a {{carefree}} Rex throwing a bubble bath solution into the tub, and blocking the <b>overflow</b> <b>drain</b> with a sponge. However, he suddenly realizes that if the tub overflows, it will leak out into the hall; the bath toys care little if this happens and continue to party. He tries {{to turn off the}} water, but only causes the handle to fall off, and the drain stays plugged when he tries to pull it out. Finally, he spots the knob on the faucet that stops the flow from the faucet, but realizes too late that this only diverts the water to the shower head. The tub starts to overflow, and the other bath toys are unconcerned about the problem. Outside the bathroom, Woody, Buzz, {{and some of the other}} toys arrive to check on Rex when the bathroom door suddenly bursts open and a flood of water pours out.|$|R

40|$|Suspended {{sediment}} is a {{major source}} of pollution in irrigation-dominated watersheds. However, {{little is known about the}} process and mechanisms of suspended sediment transport in <b>drain</b> <b>channels</b> directly connected to agricultural fields. This paper explains sediment dynamics using averaged 5 min flow discharge Q (m 3 s 1) and suspended sediment concentration C (mg l 1) collected during one crop season in a small catchment containing a first-order <b>drain</b> <b>channel</b> and its connected six agricultural fields within the Salton Sea watershed. The statistical properties and average trends of Q and C were investigated for both early (i. e. November) and late (i. e. January) stages of a crop season. Further in-depth analysis on sediment dynamics was performed by selecting two typical single-field irrigation events and two multiple-field irrigation events. For each set of irrigation events, the process of suspended sediment transport was revealed by examining hydrograph and sediment graph responses. The mechanisms underlying suspended sediment transport were investigated by analysing the types of corresponding hysteresis loop. Finally, sediment rating curves for both hourly and daily data at early and late stages and for the entire crop season were established to seek possible sediment-transport predictive model(s). The study suggests that the complicated processes of suspended sediment transport in irrigation-dominated watersheds require stochastic rather than deterministi...|$|R

40|$|A {{new concept}} for the low-frequency {{dispersion}} aspect of large-signal modeling of microwave III-V field-effect transistors is presented. The approach circumvents the integrability problem between the small-signal transconductance G mRF and the output conductance G dsRF {{by means of}} an integral formulation and simultaneously yields a proper description of the <b>drain</b> <b>channel</b> current in the small- and large-signal regime. In the theoretical description of the approach and in an extraction example of an AlGaN/GaN HEMT, it is shown that three independent 2 -D nonlinear quantities determine the intrinsic <b>drain</b> <b>channel</b> current (G mRF, G dsRF, and dc current). The concept is transferred to the modeling of the nonlinear charge control, where the integrability problem between the large-signal charge functions and the small-signal intrinsic capacitance matrix (C gs, C gd, and C ds) is addressed consistently under consideration of the charge control delays. For the large-signal modeling under pulsed-dc/RF excitation, the dc continuous wave (dc-CW) modeling approach is combined with the state-modeling concept using a superposition formula for drain current and charges, respectively. The new model is implemented in ADS using a 12 - and 14 -port symbolically defined device for both the dc-CW and pulsed-RF case, respectively. The model has been verified by comparison to measured CW and pulsed-RF load-pull and waveform data at 10 -GHz fundamental frequency...|$|R
