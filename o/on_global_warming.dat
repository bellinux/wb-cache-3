5|$|First Light is a {{young adult}} science fiction and mystery novel by Rebecca Stead, first {{published}} in 2007. The novel follows Peter, who is in Greenland {{with his father and}} mother for research <b>on</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming,</b> and Thea, who lives in Gracehope, an underground colony located below Greenland. First Light explains how global warming is melting Gracehope and Peter and Thea's attempt to persuade the people to leave. The novel addresses the effects of global warming as a theme.|$|E

Teased as a child for her weight, Winslet takes a stand against body-shaming and bullying. She narrated an Australian animated short film named Daisy Chain (2015), about a victim of cyber-bullying. In 2017, Winslet teamed with Leonardo DiCaprio's environmental foundation for a fundraiser <b>on</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming.</b> Also that year, DiCaprio and Winslet auctioned off a private dinner with themselves to raise money for a British mother's cancer treatment.|$|E
5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens {{about global warming}} via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has given {{more than a thousand}} times. The idea to document his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting <b>on</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming,</b> which coincided with the opening of The Day After Tomorrow. Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{formation}} of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts. In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research <b>on</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming.</b> The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.|$|E

5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases <b>on</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming.</b>|$|E
5|$|Various {{advocacy}} groups have given Biden scores or grades {{as to how}} well his votes align with the positions of each group. The American Civil Liberties Union gives him an 80 percent lifetime score, with a 91 percent score for the 110th Congress. Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and supports governmental funding to find new energy sources. Biden believes action must be taken <b>on</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming.</b> He co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States {{to be a part}} of the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate. Biden was given an 85percent lifetime approval rating from AFL-CIO, and he voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E
5|$|To {{convince}} {{the rest of}} the colony, Peter and Thea plan to use a piece of mythology, that a dog with four white paws would be supposedly born {{when it was time to}} leave. Such a dog had been born several days ago but has yet to open his eyes. Thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries to {{convince the}} colony at a reenactment of the Settler's escape to Greenland with several allies who know of Rowen's actions. Just as Thea and her allies are about to lose the argument, Peter arrives with the dog, whose eyes are open. That, coupled with the fact that Peter is an eye adept, the first in a hundred years, convinces the colony to listen to Thea instead of Rowen. The novel ends eight months later as the people of Gracehope are slowly educated <b>on</b> <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> and the dangers of staying in their colony.|$|E

40|$|<b>Global</b> <b>warming</b> and its {{importance}} are controversial. While {{a variety of}} estimates exists about the likelihood of <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> and the economic cost, financial market information can provide an objective assessment of expected losses due to <b>global</b> <b>warming.</b> We consider a Merton-type asset pricing model in which asset prices {{are affected by the}} changes in investment opportunities caused by <b>global</b> <b>warming.</b> In this setting, in theory <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> has a negative risk premium and most assets have negative loadings <b>on</b> the <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> factor. Financial assets in sectors that are more sensitive to <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> have more strongly negative loadings. Empirically, utilizing a variant of Campbell and Diebold‟s (2005) weather forecasting model in conjunction with Vassalou‟s (2003) approach for extracting financial market “news”, we obtain the <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> factor. We find that indeed the risk premium is significantly negative, that loadings for most assets are negative, and that industry portfolios considered to be more vulnerable to <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> (see IPCC (2007) and Quiggin and Horowitz (2003)) have significantly stronger negative loadings <b>on</b> the <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> factor.
