5000|$|The player must {{additionally}} manage {{resources on}} their island. Resources come in six types: coins, wood, <b>oil,</b> <b>ores,</b> empire points, and energy. Coins are a general resource for purchasing most in-game buildings, and are gained through property values (much like CityVille) and certain {{industries such as}} farms (unlike other [...] "Ville" [...] games, food is not a resource. Farm output is directly converted into coins.) Wood is used for certain buildings and resources, and is harvested by clearing trees and building lumber mills and starting lumber contracts. Oil is used for building practically any mechanized unit, it is harvested by <b>oil</b> wells. <b>Ores</b> come in varying types, such as aluminum, copper, gold, iron, and uranium, each required for different specialty units and buildings. Ore is harvested through ore mines, trading, and defeating other units. Empire tokens are real-world currency used to speed up certain elements {{of the game and}} assist in others (such as providing an extra ally during an attack or purchasing a power-up,) they can also auto-complete missions and fill seats in government buildings. In addition, defeating AI players provides liberty bonds which are used for land-expansion, along with coins. There are also experience points, which level up the player.|$|R

50|$|A {{decade of}} surveys {{by dozens of}} {{domestic}} research and design departments {{have resulted in the}} construction of a 10-30 ton deep-water port in natural conditions.

With China's accession to the World Trade Organization, the western port hinterland of the Yangtze River Delta has increasingly attracted international capital as well as domestic investment, resulting in a demand for energy, raw materials and products in large quantities. There is an urgent demands for coastal port facilities, which provides excellent opportunities both for developers and around the Yangtze River estuary, and for foreign investors. After completion, the Yangtze River Ocean Port will become the anchor of further economic prosperity in Jiangsu, complementing the Shanghai international shipping center.|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} {{methods of}} process-based {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) fail {{to account for the}} role of ecosystem goods and services derived from natural capital. This study presents an in-depth analysis of resource consumption and atmospheric emissions across a wood-derived bioethanol supply chain. The analysis is based on energy consumption, Industrial Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ICEC), and Ecological Cumulative Exergy Consumption (ECEC) of resources used in the production of one ton of ethanol from woodchips using the near-neutral hemicellulose extraction technology. We found that when compared with fossil-based fuels and corn ethanol, wood-based cellulosic ethanol derived under the near-neutral hemicellulose extraction process demonstrated superior environmental performance. Renewable resources - mostly sunlight and detrital matters-are the dominant contributors to ICEC analysis, whereas non-renewable resources such as crushed stone, crude <b>oil,</b> <b>ores</b> and minerals contribute more to total ECEC. Lime manufacturing, inorganic chemicals production for green liquor preparation, and anthraquinone production have the highest resource consumption. The woodchip washing process and transportation stages consume relatively fewer resources. A performance metric analysis suggests that even though cellulosic ethanol uses a renewable feedstock, its environmental sustainability performance is reduced due to the large consumption of non-renewable resources during the ethanol production stage...|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} explain the {{motivating}} factors behind Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) patterns to the Middle East and Africa through a quantitative framework that utilizes a pooled cross-sectional time-series data set that covers 57 countries from 2003 - 2010. Prior research on the issue has hypothesized that China attempts to use external FDI to developing areas to promote national interests and help sustain economic growth. However, {{there has been an}} almost exclusive focus on economic determinants while generally ignoring political variables. The approach in this project attempts to fill this scholarly void by employing a broad array of independent variables that account for both economic and political influences in producing a timely model that yields robust results that will allow for generalizable statements to be made regarding the data. The findings demonstrate that pre-existing trade relations and strategically important natural resources (<b>oil,</b> <b>ores,</b> and metals) within host economies influence Chinese FDI to the Middle East and Africa. In addition, the study empirically shows that external FDI from China was heavily concentrated in economies with lower per capita income and directed toward regimes that may be classified as mildly authoritarian. The dissertation concludes with an analysis of larger policy implications and suggestions for future scholarly inquiry...|$|R
