50|$|Pushing {{the clutch}} pedal {{disengages}} the engine from the powertrain like wheels, drive shafts and gearbox. Releasing the accelerator makes the engine slowing down to idle. Turning of the ignition takes further affects. Pulling the key causes locking the steering wheel. Some vehicles drop head- or stoplights when ignition is turned off. After {{the engine is}} stopped, applying the brake longer time or give a few pushes to the brake releases the reserve of the vacuum servo, causing a lost of the brake support. A belt driven power steering fails immediately. Real hybrid vehicles have electric driven support of power steering and brake. Bigger engines and engines with higher compression ratio can cause damage to components of the powertrain at a rough start over clutch from gliding vehicles kinetic power or trailing drag.

5000|$|Current density-voltage ( [...] j-V) {{curves and}} {{impedance}} spectra are investigated and recorded. Impedancespectra are realized applying an ac current of 1-2A RMS (root-mean-square) {{in the frequency}} range from 30 kHzto 10−1 Hz. Impedance spectra shows that the resistance is high at low frequencies(<10 kHz) and near zero at high frequencies(>10 kHz). [...] Since high frequency corresponds to electrolyte activities, while low frequencies corresponds to electrodes process, it can be deduced {{that only a small}} fraction of the overall resistance is from the electrolyte and most resistance comes from anode and cathode. Hence, developing high performance electrodes are essential for high efficiency SORFC. Area specific resistance(ASR) can be obtained from the slope of j-V curve. Commonly used/tested electrodes materials are nickel/zirconia cermet (Ni/YSZ) and lanthanum-substituted strontium titanate/ceria composite for SORFC cathode, and lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) for SORFC anode. Other anode materials can be lanthanum strontium ferrite(LSF), lanthanum strontium copper ferrite(LSCuF) and lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCoF). Studies show that Ni/YSZ electrode was less active in reverse fuel cell operation than in fuel cell operation,and this can be attributed to a diffusion-limited process in the electrolysis direction, or its susceptibility to aging in a high-steam environment,primarily due to coarsening of nickel particles. Therefore, alternative materials such as the titanate/ceria composite (La0.35Sr0.65TiO3-Ce0.5La0.5O2−δ)or (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5O3 (LSCM) have been proposed electrolysis cathodes.Both LSF and LSM/YSZ are reported as good anode candidates for electrolysis mode.

5000|$|While Ni based {{superalloys}} {{are excellent}} high temperature materials and have proven very useful, Co based superalloys potentially possess superior hot corrosion, oxidation, and wear resistance {{as compared to}} Ni-based superalloys. For this reason, efforts have also been put into developing Co based superalloys {{over the past several}} years. Despite that, traditional Co based superalloys have not found widespread usage because they have a lower strength at high temperature than Ni based superalloys. The main {{reason for this is that}} they appear to lack the γ’ precipitation strengthening that is so important in the high temperature strength of Ni-based superalloys. A 2006 report on metastable γ’-Co3(Al,W) intermetallic compound with the L12 structure suggests Co based alloys as alternative to traditional Ni based superalloys. However this class of alloys was reported in a PhD thesis by C. S. Lee in 1971. The two-phase microstructure consists of cuboidal γ’ precipitates embedded in a continuous γ matrix and is therefore morphologically identical to the microstructure observed in Ni based superalloys. Like in the Ni-based system, there is a high degree of coherency between the two phases which is one of the main factors resulting in the superior strength at high temperatures. This provides a pathway for the development of a new class of load-bearing Co based superalloys for application in severe environments. In these alloys 'W' is the crucial addition for getting γ’ intermetallic compound that makes them much denser (>9.6 gm/cm3) compared to Ni-based superalloys. Recently a new class of γ - γ’ cobalt based superalloys have been developed that are [...] "W" [...] free and have much lower density comparable to nickel based superalloys. In addition to the fact that many of the properties of these new Co based superalloys could be better than those of the more traditional Ni based ones, Co also has a higher melting temperature than Ni. Therefore, if the high temperature strength could be improved, the development of novel Co based superalloys could allow for an increase in jet engine <b>operation</b> <b>temperature</b> resulting in an increased efficiency.|$|E
