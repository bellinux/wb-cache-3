5|$|In 1945 Rossen {{joined a}} picket line against Warner Bros, making {{an enemy of}} Jack Warner. Rossen signed a {{contract}} with an independent production company formed by Hal Wallis, who had previously been Warner Bros.' head of production. However Rossen wrote only two full scripts for this company, The Strange Love <b>of</b> <b>Martha</b> Ivers in 1946 and Desert Fury in 1947. In The Strange Love <b>of</b> <b>Martha</b> Ivers Rossen used a short story by John Patrick to introduce the main plot, which was set fifteen years later and which Rossen wrote himself. The relationship between Rossen and Wallis broke down when Rossen received offers from other production companies.|$|E
5|$|Farber {{noted the}} strong female {{characters}} of the 1930s and 1940s, and laments their replacing by all-male relationships from the 1950s onwards. For the earlier pattern Farber cited Rossen's 1946 script The Strange Love <b>of</b> <b>Martha</b> Ivers, which was over melodramatic but portrayed a woman consumed by power, money and success. Lilith created {{one of the few}} strong women in the 1960s. Rossen generally destroyed the main character.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} also the first in which Freema Agyeman appears, {{although}} she is not playing the role <b>of</b> <b>Martha</b> Jones, which she would play in series 3, but a minor character named Adeola (who is later revealed to be Martha's cousin). Russell T Davies admired Agyeman's performance as Adeola and called her back to fill the role of companion that Piper had chosen to leave.|$|E
50|$|Situated on the hilly, western {{coast of}} the Island <b>of</b> <b>Martha's</b> Vineyard, the Lambert's Cove region can most closely be {{distinguished}} by its hilly terrain. The area contains the northernmost extension of the hilly range that extends {{from the tip of}} Aquinnah to Upper Lambert's Cove. The appearance of such hills on the island falls {{in stark contrast to the}} relatively flat land of the rest <b>of</b> <b>Martha's</b> Vineyard. This flatland is often attributed to the glacial activity that separated Martha's Vineyard from the mainland 10,000 years ago during the last Ice Age. The eastern parts <b>of</b> <b>Martha's</b> Vineyard, including Lambert's Cove, avoided the glacial scraping and thus retained their hilly terrain. The Lambert's Cove region is also home to many of the oak and beech trees on the island <b>of</b> <b>Martha's</b> Vineyard. As opposed to the scrub oaks and pines located on the rest <b>of</b> <b>Martha's</b> Vineyard, Lambert's Cove is home to many of the thicker and greener forests on the island.|$|R

5|$|While head of {{production}} at Warner, Hal Wallis considered {{that some of}} his best films – including The Roaring Twenties, Marked Woman and The Sea Wolf – were written by Rossen. Wallis was very pleased with Rossen's script in 1946 for The Strange Love <b>of</b> <b>Martha</b> Ivers, which was produced by Wallis own company. However, Rossen turned down Wallis's next two films. Both Wallis as producer and Rossen as writer-director wanted to operate as independents, rather than under the control of a studio.|$|E
5|$|Martha bumps into Jonah, who is {{now going}} {{by the name of}} Michael. Martha tries {{to get him out of}} town, vandalises his van and {{verbally}} abuses him. She falls into a mine shaft with him and he saves her. They grow closer and later they start a relationship, which no one approves <b>of.</b> <b>Martha</b> looks after Jack while he is in a coma after he is shot. Jack reveals he still loves her, but he decides to stand by Sam. Martha realises she loves Jack as well as Michael. She and Michael leave town, but Martha returns days later to stop Jack and Sam's wedding, but she fails.|$|E
5|$|The current {{building}} {{is the third}} theatre on the site following destructive fires in 1808 and 1857. The façade, foyer and auditorium were designed by Edward Barry, and date from 1858, but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive £178 million reconstruction in the 1990s. The main auditorium is a Grade 1 listed building. The inclusion of the adjacent old Floral Hall, previously {{a part of the}} old Covent Garden Market, created a large new public gathering place. In 1779 the pavement outside the playhouse was the scene of the murder <b>of</b> <b>Martha</b> Ray, mistress of the Earl of Sandwich, by her admirer the Rev. James Hackman.|$|E

5|$|After his {{education}} was completed, Beverley returned to Virginia {{and began a}} career in public service. He was the Clerk of Court for Essex County for 29 years (1716–1745), when the first Essex County courthouse was on Beverley's Blandfield estate. Beverley was also an Essex County judge from 1720 to 1740. He {{was a member of}} the Virginia House of Burgesses in Williamsburg, elected to represent Orange (1736–1738) and Essex Counties (1742–1749). During his first term as Orange County burgess, Beverley served with Robert Green. He represented Essex County with James Ganett until 1747, after which he served with William Daingerfield until 1749. Beverley's appointment as county lieutenant and commander-in-chief of the militias of Augusta and Orange Counties in 1741 was confirmed in the Orange County Court on November 3, 1741. In 1750 he was appointed to the Virginia Governor's Council, the upper house of Virginia's colonial legislature, replacing John Custis IV (father-in-law <b>of</b> <b>Martha</b> Dandridge Custis). Beverley's appointment to the Governor's Council fulfilled an ambition which his father was unable to achieve.|$|E
5|$|At the {{election}} party, Lana arrives with Chloe, but she once again leaves again when Lex calls. This time Lex kisses {{her when he}} learns of her break up, which causes Lana to leave. Like before, Lex pursues Lana, but this time Clark arrives in time to stop the bus. Jonathan goes to the farm after receiving a mysterious call during the party, and is greeted by Lionel Luthor (John Glover). Lionel insinuates he knows Clark's secret and shows a picture to Jonathan, which causes Jonathan to begin punching Lionel in anger. Jonathan dismisses Lionel and laboriously walks away, breathing heavily. Martha and Clark drive up and catch him as he has a heart attack, and, after taking a final look at his family, Jonathan dies in the arms <b>of</b> <b>Martha</b> and Clark. At Jonathan's funeral, all of Clark's close friends attend, {{as well as the}} Luthors. When the funeral is over, Clark picks up a handful of dirt and sprinkles it into his father's grave.|$|E
5|$|After {{purchasing}} {{a majority of}} the houses on Wisteria Lane, Paul announces that he plans to open a halfway house for ex-convicts on the street. A protest against his plan escalates into a violent riot and Susan is trampled by the unruly crowd. As a result, Susan loses a kidney and learns that her second kidney is deformed and she is at severe risk of renal failure. Susan reluctantly agrees to undergo dialysis while waiting for a transplant. After Paul throws her out, Beth submits paperwork indicating that in the event of her death, her kidney would be given to Susan, and then commits suicide. Despite initial refusal, Paul allows the operation to move forward and he and Susan reconcile. After discovering that Paul has been depressed following Beth's suicide, Susan begins cooking meals for him with the assistance of Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), Beth's mother and Martha Huber's sister, who secretly adds antifreeze to the food in an effort to kill him. Paul nearly dies {{as a result of the}} poisoned food. Unaware that Felicia is helping prepare his meals, Paul has Susan arrested for attempting to kill him. Eventually, Susan is released, Paul confesses to the murder <b>of</b> <b>Martha</b> Huber, and Felicia presumably dies in a car crash while fleeing town. Susan and her family move back onto Wisteria Lane. During a dinner party, Gabrielle's former stepfather, Alejandro (Tony Plana), who raped her during her childhood, attempts to harm Gabrielle until her husband, Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) kills him. Susan, Lynette, and Bree agree to help cover up the crime.|$|E

5|$|Grant Morrison later {{chose to}} heavily reimagine Kathy Kane in 2011 for his Batman Incorporated series. It is {{established}} that Kathy Kane was born Katherine Webb, {{and that she}} had been an aspiring independent film director prior to marrying a millionaire named Nathan Kane, the son of Roderick and Elizabeth Kane and brother <b>of</b> <b>Martha</b> (Kane) Wayne, Bruce Wayne's mother. Nathan and Kathy were madly in love with one another, and it was Nathan who ended up buying Kathy her circus as a birthday present. After Nathan's untimely death, Kathy was approached by a young man known only as Agent-33, who recruited her into a covert spy organization called Spyral. As part of her first assignment, Kathy was tasked with tracking down Batman and discovering his true identity. Donning a female variation of Batman's costume in order to gain his attention, she embarked on a career as a costumed crime-fighter while attempting to get close to Batman. Her plan succeeded but the two fell in love with one another, despite Kathy legally being Wayne's aunt. As a result, she refused to reveal his identity to her superiors at Spyral. Later, Kathy was confronted by the head of Spyral, a Nazi supervillain named Dr. Dedalus (Otto Netz) who claimed to be her real father and threatened to expose her to Batman unless she continued her mission. Heartbroken, she broke off her relationship with Bruce in order to save him from Dedalus' plan. In the present, Batman and the South American vigilante El Gaucho are told by the villainess Scorpiana that El Gaucho was responsible for Kathy's murder, as he had originally been Agent-33 prior to becoming a superhero. Batman tells Gaucho that Scorpiana must be lying since Kathy had been killed by the League of Assassins, but Gaucho claims that there is some truth in her accusations, and that Batman wouldn't understand. In the follow-up one-shot Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes, students of an assassin training facility masquerading as St. Hadrian's Finishing School For Girls in England are shown wearing variations of Kathy's Batwoman costume, with the original masks replaced by skulls. Later, these women are shown to be agents of Spyral, dedicated to hunting down Talia al Ghul, whose organisation Leviathan is waging war with Batman. Kathy reappears alive in the concluding issue of Batman Incorporated, in which she shoots Talia al Ghul dead in the Batcave. Identifying herself as St Hadrian's headmistress and requesting Batman not to go looking for her, she thanks Batman for leading Talia into her trap and reports to Spyral headquarters that one more international criminal has been killed.|$|E
