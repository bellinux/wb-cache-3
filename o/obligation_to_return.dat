25|$|Commercial {{bank money}} or demand {{deposits}} are claims against financial institutions {{that can be}} used for the purchase of goods and services. A demand deposit account is an account from which funds can be withdrawn at any time by check or cash withdrawal without giving the bank or financial institution any prior notice. Banks have the legal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> funds held in demand deposits immediately upon demand (or 'at call'). Demand deposit withdrawals can be performed in person, via checks or bank drafts, using automatic teller machines (ATMs), or through online banking.|$|E
25|$|Pettitte was one {{of several}} Yankees named in the Mitchell Report, {{released}} on December 13, 2007. Mitchell and his staff received the information on Pettitte from McNamee, who told them he injected Pettitte with HGH on 2–4 occasions in 2002 so that he would heal from an elbow injury quicker. Pettitte verified McNamee's claim, admitting to using the HGH on two occasions in 2002, as it was meant to help heal an injury, and not to enhance his performance. Pettitte said he felt an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to the team as quickly as possible. He denied any further usage of HGH during his career; he also denied use of steroids or any other performance-enhancing drug.|$|E
25|$|At the time, land {{ownership}} in England {{was based on}} the feudal system. When a landowner left England to fight in the Crusades, he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues, on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return. However, Crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return. Unfortunately for the Crusader, English common law did not recognize his claim. As far as the King's courts were concerned, the land belonged to the trustee, who was under no <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> it. The Crusader had no legal claim. The disgruntled Crusader would then petition the king, who would refer the matter to his Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience. At this time, the principle of equity was born.|$|E
50|$|In early 1837, he left Edo {{and made}} the long journey to Fukuyama to {{formally}} enter his domain. This {{would be the only}} time that Abe set foot in his domain, as his career as a bureaucrat within the Tokugawa shogunate eclipsed his <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Fukuyama under the sankin-kōtai system.|$|R

500|$|However, Lord Ellenborough {{indicated}} that Ashford could ask that Thornton be allowed [...] "to go without a day", that is, be released without <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to court. The matter was adjourned until 20 April for Ashford to consider his options, whether to allow Thornton's release or {{meet him in}} battle. On 20 April, Ashford's counsel {{indicated that}} he had no objection to Thornton's discharge, so long as no action would be taken against his client. With the appellant reassured on that point, the appeal was dismissed. Thornton was then given a pro forma arraignment on the murder charge, to which he interposed a plea that he was acquitted previously. The plea being accepted, the case was ended, and Thornton was freed. With an angry mob outside, Thornton left (at Lord Ellenborough's direction) through a side door.|$|E

5000|$|In Canada Budka is {{most famous}} for his {{pastoral}} letter just before the outbreak of World War I, in which he urged Ukrainians in Canada with reservist <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> their homeland to enlist and fight. Their homeland was Austria, which soon was at war with Canada. Although he later retracted his letter, the damage was already done. [...] This helped inflame an existing suspicion and scrutiny of the Ukrainian Canadian community by the wider public and the government {{that led to the}} internment of Ukrainians in Canada during the war. Budka, who was naturalized as British subject (i.e. Canadian citizen) in 1918 or 1920 was charged twice with crimes of disloyalty and cleared in both cases.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{separate}} {{sense of the}} word [...] "voluntary" [...] in which some tax protesters use the term, the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> pay the tax and file the return is not voluntary—for either income tax or sales tax. For example, the Internal Revenue Code is full of statutes specifically imposing the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> file <b>returns</b> and pay taxes, and imposing civil and criminal penalties for willful failure to do so on a timely basis (see above). The difference is {{that in the case of}} the income tax, the taxpayer files the return, whereas in the case of the sales tax, the seller (not the customer) files the return.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} spring in February saw the food {{situation}} improve for the crusaders. That month Tatikios repeated his earlier advice {{to resort to}} a long-distance blockade but his suggestion was ignored; he then left the army and returned home. Tatikios explained to the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos that Bohemond had informed him {{that there was a}} plan to kill him, as they believed Alexios was secretly encouraging the Turks. Those close to Bohemond claimed that this was treachery or cowardice, reason enough <b>to</b> break any <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> Antioch <b>to</b> the Byzantines. News arrived that a Turkish army was approaching and Bohemond used the situation to his advantage. He declared that he would leave unless he was allowed to keep Antioch for himself when it was captured. Knowing fully that Bohemond had designs on taking the city for himself, and that he had probably engineered Tatikios' departure in order to facilitate this, Godfrey and Raymond did not give in to his demands, but Bohemond gained the sympathies and cooperation of the minor knights and soldiers.|$|R
2500|$|Rav Huna deduced from Judah's {{commitment}} to Jacob {{with regard to}} Benjamin in [...] "I will be surety for him; of my hand shall you require him," [...] that a guarantor becomes responsible for the debt that he has guaranteed.

2500|$|Organ gifting entails two {{simultaneous}} gifts: {{the gift}} of the organ itself and {{the gift of}} life. The first form of gift is a transaction where the giver provides an object to the receiver. [...] This action leads {{to the creation of a}} relationship among individuals where the receiver is compelled to provide a counter-gift. The <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> the gift has received various interpretations, but one common assumption is that the object that is given tends to keep a portion of the identity of the giver (hau used by Mauss). In the case of organ gifting, this personalization of the gifted object reaches extreme proportions because the gift is actually a piece of the giver's body.|$|E
2500|$|Tsarnaev's {{body was}} moved to a funeral home in North Attleborough; after protesters picketed the building, it was handed over to Graham, Putnam, and Mahoney Funeral Parlor in Worcester. Officials in Boston, Cambridge, at a state prison, and in over 120 other U.S. and Canadian {{locations}} refused to allow Tsarnaev's body {{to be buried in}} their jurisdictions. On May 9, Worcester police announced that Tsarnaev's body had been buried in an undisclosed location. It was later reported that Tsarnaev was buried in a small Muslim cemetery, Al-Barzakh Cemetery, in Doswell, Virginia. The burial was set in motion by Martha Mullen of Richmond, Virginia, who said she was appalled by the protests at the funeral home, which she said [...] "portrayed America at its worst" [...] and wanted {{to find a way to}} end the impasse. She contacted Islamic Funeral Services of Virginia, which agreed to provide an unmarked plot in their cemetery. The funeral agency released a statement saying [...] "What Tsarnaev did is between him and God. We strongly disagree with his violent actions, but that does not release us from our <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> his body to the earth." [...] Caroline County Sheriff Tony Lippa said the burial was legal. Locals, as well as the imam of the Virginia Islamic Centre, condemned the secretive burial.|$|E

6000|$|They {{found the}} Ionians still there, {{although}} the two months had fully expired. It {{is possible that the}} chiefs had received secret orders from Darius not to hasten their departure, even after the knots had all been untied; or perhaps they chose, of their own accord, to await their sovereign's return. The Scythians immediately urged them to be gone. [...] "The time has expired," [...] they said, [...] "and you are no longer under any <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> wait. <b>Return</b> <b>to</b> your own country, and assert your own independence and freedom, which you can safely do if you leave Darius and his armies here." ...|$|R

60|$|The senate {{came very}} slowly and reluctantly to the {{conclusion}} to follow this advice. They, however, all earnestly joined in attempting to persuade Regulus that he was under no <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to Carthage. His promise, they said, was extorted by {{the circumstances of the}} case, and was not binding. Regulus, however, insisted on keeping his faith with his enemies. He sternly refused to see his family, and, bidding the senate farewell, he returned to Carthage. The Carthaginians, exasperated at his having himself interposed to prevent the success of his mission, tortured him for some time in the most cruel manner, and finally put him to death. One would think that he ought to have counseled peace and an exchange of prisoners, and he ought not to have refused to see his unhappy wife and children; but it was certainly very noble in him to refuse to break his word.|$|E
6000|$|I suppose {{most of us}} (I know it of myself) {{believe that}} the people of the Southern States are {{entitled}} to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law,--that is a right fixed in the Constitution. But it cannot be made available to them without Congressional legislation. In the Judge's language, it is a [...] "barren right," [...] which needs legislation before it can become efficient and valuable to the persons to whom it is guaranteed. And as the right is constitutional, I agree that the legislation shall be granted to it, and that not that we like the institution of slavery. We profess to have no taste for running and catching niggers, at least, I profess no taste for that job at all. Why then do I yield support to a Fugitive Slave law? Because I do not understand that the Constitution, which guarantees that right, can be supported without it. And if I believed that the right to hold a slave in a Territory was equally fixed in the Constitution with the right to reclaim fugitives, I should be bound to give it the legislation necessary to support it. I say that no man can deny his obligation to give the necessary legislation to support slavery in a Territory, who believes it is a constitutional right to have it there. No man can, who does not give the Abolitionists an argument to deny the obligation enjoined by the Constitution to enact a Fugitive State law. Try it now. It is the strongest Abolition argument ever made. I say if that Dred Scott decision is correct, then the right to hold slaves in a Territory is equally a constitutional right with the right of a slaveholder to have his runaway returned. No one can show the distinction between them. The one is express, so that we cannot deny it. The other is construed to be in the Constitution, so that he who believes the decision to be correct believes in the right. And the man who argues that by unfriendly legislation, in spite of that constitutional right, slavery may be driven from the Territories, cannot avoid furnishing an argument by which Abolitionists may deny the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> fugitives, and claim the power to pass laws unfriendly {{to the right of the}} slaveholder to reclaim his fugitive. I do not know how such an arguement may strike a popular assembly like this, but I defy anybody to go before a body of men whose minds are educated to estimating evidence and reasoning, and show that there is an iota of difference between the constitutional right to reclaim a fugitive and the constitutional right to hold a slave, in a Territory, provided this Dred Scott decision is correct, I defy any man to make an argument that will justify unfriendly legislation to deprive a slaveholder of his right to hold his slave in a Territory, that will not equally, in all its length, breadth, and thickness, furnish an argument for nullifying the Fugitive Slave law. Why, there is not such an Abolitionist in the nation as Douglas, after all! such an Abolitionist in the nation as Douglas, after all! ...|$|E

2500|$|Since {{adhering}} to the Hague Abduction Convention, the world's most recognized and utilized instrument for addressing international child abduction or parental child trafficking, Mexico has been repeatedly criticized for enjoying the benefit of having its treaty partners protect Mexico's own internationally abducted children, while being consistently non-compliant in fulfilling its reciprocal <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> protect and <b>return</b> children abducted <b>to</b> Mexico.

He is concerned, in particular, with why people give gifts, and why they feel the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> make a <b>return.</b> In fact, he contended that inalienability is based on or legitimized by the belief that there is present in the object a power, a spirit, a spiritual reality that binds it to the giver, and which accompanies the object wherever it goes.
