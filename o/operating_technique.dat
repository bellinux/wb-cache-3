His methods did not use antiseptic but instead relied on soap and water, as was common at the time.

He was described as [...] "one of the most go-ahead surgeons of his day" [...] by Arthur Burgess, in his 1929 Presidential Address to the BMA. Burgess also noted that Whitehead's preference for aseptic surgery was demonstrated at the MRI in 1895 with an unorthodox mastectomy that omitted the use of antiseptic on the wound and thus aroused both interest and misgivings. The success of the operation was instrumental in causing a shift of practice within the hospital towards aseptic surgical methods.|$|E

50|$|Wrist {{arthroscopy}} is a {{minimally invasive}} <b>operating</b> <b>technique</b> {{that can be}} used to treat or diagnose wrist problems.

50|$|The mail {{on-the-fly}} was not {{a smooth}} <b>operating</b> <b>technique.</b> One problem with the technique was that the postal clerk had {{to pay close attention}} when he raised the train's catcher arm. If it was raised too early there was a chance of hitting and destroying switch targets, telegraph poles, and railway semaphore signals, as well as the train's mail catcher arm. If the clerk was too late in raising the train's catcher arm, he might miss the catcher pouch altogether.|$|E
50|$|Radio {{contests}} {{typically have}} different operator categories for Single or Multiple people using a single {{station in the}} contest. SO2R is an <b>operating</b> <b>technique</b> used by some competitors in the single-operator categories in contesting. While single-operator means that only one transmitter can be active at any time, in SO2R, a single station operator uses two radios to listen simultaneously to two different radio frequencies. When the two radios are on different radio bands, an operator can be listening to one radio while the other is transmitting. This can result in increased operating efficiency, as the operator can always be looking for new contacts to increase his or her score. SO2R operation {{can be a challenge}} to learn and requires practice to achieve proficiency.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{ultra-low}} power <b>operating</b> <b>technique</b> {{is presented}} for Mega-pixels current-mediated CMOS imagers. In the proposed technique, the reset and read-out phases occur simultaneously. {{as a single}} pixel is being read-out another pixel is being reset. Such a strategy reduces power consumption by more than 2 orders of magnitude for current-mediated Mega-pixels CMOS imagers, while still allowing for on-read-out, fixed pattern noise correction. Power consumption becomes independent of both read-out speed and imager array size. Additionally, the proposed <b>operating</b> <b>technique</b> leads to improved linearity for the pixel response, increased dynamic range as well as on-chip digital shutter functionality. A single additional address decoder is required to generate the reset signals, resulting in a marginal increase in silicon area. The wiring overhead is {{kept to a minimum}} with only a single control signal required to operate the current- mediated CMOS imager(1) ...|$|E

40|$|In 1949 Leslie Rush {{described}} a new method of management of Colles' fractures {{by means of}} a rigid medullary nail. Claude Py in 1969 followed this concept but used two flexible intramedullary pins. After briefly recalling the biomechanical principle and <b>operating</b> <b>technique,</b> the authors outline their series of 39 extra- and intra-articular fractures (10 males and 29 females) operated between March 1995 and April 1996 with an average follow-up of 6. 5 months (1. 5 - 14. 5 months). The radiological and functional results are discussed: 55 % of the cases showed good anatomical reduction whereas 59 % achieved a satisfactory functional result. The advantage of this <b>operating</b> <b>technique</b> lies in its simplicity. Nevertheless, considerable experience is necessary owing to the relatively high complication rate (secondary displacement, tendon or nerve lesions, reflex sympathetic dystrophy). However, this method requires only a limited amount of time and remains a good indication for extra-articular and simple articular fractures. In the case of severe posterior comminution, the use of cancellous bone graft can help to prevent secondary dorsal impaction and its repercussion on distal radio-ulnar function...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{a process}} based {{approach}} in landfill design and operation {{has been developed}} called bioreactor landfill. A bioreactor landfill is managed to accelerate decomposition of the organic wastes by controlling moisture content, recycling nutrients and seeding of microorganisms by circulating leachate back into the landfill cell. This research investigated the beneficial effect of using this concept in accelerating the biodegradation of wastes and simultaneously minimizes leachate problem in tropical landfill. In pilot scale experiment, four landfill lysimeters of 0. 9 m. and 2. 7 m. height were employed. The biodegradation of solid wastes in the lysimeters having different <b>operating</b> <b>techniques,</b> i. e. leachate circulation and leachate storage in the waste cells was compared with the conventional landfill operation. It was found that those <b>operating</b> <b>techniques</b> were beneficial to waste degradation and leachate management in tropical landfill. The water balance in those lysimeters was also verified.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a 4 T {{low-power}} linear-output current-mediated CMOS APS imager, in which reset and read-out operations are carried-out simultaneously on two pixels of the same row. The proposed <b>operating</b> <b>technique</b> greatly simplifies the pixel architecture with only four transistors and two control signals required, while six transistors and four control lines are required by its current-mediated counterpart. The imager achieves fixed pattern noise (FPN) correction during pixel-readout and exhibits a power consumption which is independent of the imager array size, since only a single current source is solicited {{at any given time}} due to the array-level <b>operating</b> <b>technique.</b> A linearization circuit technique using the transistor's channel length modulation effect is employed enabling to double the linear range of the pixel's photon-to-output signal transfer function. Performance analysis and experimental results are presented for a 32 x 32 image sensor array prototype, fabricated using AMS 0. 35 -mu m process.
