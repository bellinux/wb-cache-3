50|$|What makes wool {{a unique}} product {{is that it}} is {{essentially}} flame resistant. The combination of sulfur and nitrogen provides a blend of materials that provide a flame-resistant product. The reason wool is used for many types of heat protection is that it has a low ignition temperature. This is defined as the temperature in which an item will produce a flame. Wool can be heated to over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit before the igniting of this fabric. Even when the fabric comes in contact with flames it does not disseminate the flame. This provides an even greater protective quality with the wool’s low ignition temperature and the inability for flames to spread throughout the fiber. When wool is heated to a certain degree, it begins to “char” on the outside. This can provide a protective outer layer on the <b>outside</b> <b>fabric.</b> When the char {{on the outside of the}} fabric is consistent with the original properties of the wool, it can produce a safer version of the product. When the heat is directly applied to the fabric, the “char” forms a semi-liquid state which can be wiped off the fabric providing no evidence of the heat contact.|$|E

40|$|AbstractData from {{multiple}} sensors and actuators {{has been recorded}} from December 2001 to March 2008 at the LESO-PB building of the EPFL campus, using the EIB/KNX bus standard. Sensors and actuators provided data on room temperature, presence, lighting level, windows opening, blinds position, electric lights and heating power. Weather data has also been collected and includes ambient temperature, solar radiation on a horizontal surface (direct and diffuse components), wind speed and direction and rain alarm. The data was written continuously to a MySQL database, each EIB/KNX telegram being recorded into the database. The primary goal of that setup was the experimental validation and checking of advanced control algorithms for the actuation of solar shadings (<b>outside</b> <b>fabric</b> blinds), electric lighting and heating equipment.

40|$|The {{drying process}} of porous media {{is a subject}} of {{scientific}} interest, and different mathematical approaches {{can be found in}} the literature. A previous paper by the same authors showed that the celebrated Martin correlation for hot air jet heat and mass transfer yields different degrees of accuracy (from 15 % to 65 %, increasing at high values of input power) if tested on different fabrics, the remaining conditions being the same. In this paper the fabric drying has been experimentally investigated more in depth. A dedicated experimental apparatus for hot jet drying was assembled and operated, in which a hot jet impinges perpendicularly onto a wet fabric. A calibrated orifice was adopted to measure the jet flow rate, with an accuracy better than 3 %. The drying power was determined by continuously weighing with a precision scale a moistened patch exposed to the drying jet. The effect of the time of the exposure and the initial amount of water has been evaluated for each sample. During the hot jet exposure, the temperature distribution over the wet patch has been observed by an infrared thermo-camera. A mathematical model of water transport inside and <b>outside</b> the <b>fabric</b> was developed, in order to evidence the governing transport resistances.

50|$|In such an incident, {{both the}} warp and the weft of fabric {{may have been}} damaged. Invisible mending is the {{reconstruction}} of both the warp and weft using a long needle. The mender garners the material for the repair by picking all the necessary weft from the hem, and the warp from the extra fabric {{on the inside of}} longitudinal seams. The mender will reconstruct the warp and weft to match the original weave exactly. After this is done and the garment has been pressed, the mended part will be undetectable on the <b>outside</b> of the <b>fabric,</b> though on the reverse side the restored area will be marked by long hanging threads where the re-weaving was done. These hanging threads occur because (unlike in darning work) invisible mending is done without tacking, in case it deforms the fabric.|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{equation of}} the thermal resistance and adiathermic {{power of a}} coated fabric with nanocomposites is established. Samples, whose properties are analyzed by these equations, were constructed from commercial resins and Tunisian natural clay.

The mathematical equation, which modelling the coated fabric thermal behavior, contributes to analyze and explain the measured adiathermic power results by inserting the thermal resistance values. It was found that increasing quantity of clay enhance significantly the thermal insulation of a 400 g m - 2 Sergey fabric 100 % cotton. The calculated values show that the thermal resistances are in a good agreement with the measured adiathermic power values, which generally increases when the fabric becomes more resistant to the going through heat flow...|$|R
50|$|Jersey is a {{knit fabric}} used {{predominantly}} for clothing manufacture. It was originally made of wool, {{but is now}} made of wool, cotton, and synthetic fibres. Since medieval times Jersey, Channel Islands, where the material was first produced, had been an important exporter of knitted goods and the fabric in wool from Jersey became well known. The fabric {{can be a very}} stretchy single knitting, usually light-weight, jersey with one flat side and one piled side. When made with a lightweight yarn, this is the fabric most often used to make T-shirts. Or it can be a double knitted jersey (interlock jersey), with less stretch, that creates a heavier fabric of two single jerseys knitted together to leave the two flat sides on the <b>outsides</b> of the <b>fabric,</b> with the piles in the middle. Jersey is considered to be an excellent fabric for draped garments, such as dresses, and women's tops.|$|R

40|$|Romanies {{have long}} lived <b>outside</b> the <b>fabric</b> {{of society and}} have long been exposed to {{discrimination}} in Sweden {{as well as the}} rest of Europe. The {{purpose of this study is}} to elucidate the experiences of young Finnish romanies in their everyday lives as well as their perceptions of living as a minority group in Stockholm today. Previous scientific researchers have often concentrated their studies on the romanies as a group, so we, the authors have chosen to concentrate our research on the individual’s own experiences. We, the authors have chosen to use a qualitative approach, to give us the opportunity through using open ended interview techniques to comprehend and interpret the individuals own accounts. In this study we separately interviewed four men and four women, between the ages of eighteen and twenty two years old. The theoretical starting point comes from Lundströms (2007) problematizationof national identity, Beckers (2006) theory of deviation and Goffman (2011) theory of social stigma, where the focus lies on identity, deviation and group membership. The empirical data were analyzed by the theoretical approach and with earlier research including Rodell Olgac (2006). The authors have found through their studies that young Finnish romanies live under negative discrimination, which affects their everyday lives in several different ways. They feel segregated from mainstream society, which leads to difficulty at school and in their creation of self-identity. The study also showed that the Finnish romanies interviewed thought that wearing their traditional costumes was a contributing factor in suffering discrimination...|$|R

40|$|The study area, located {{north of}} Springdale, Newfoundland, is {{underlain}} by basic volcanic rocks of the Ordovician Little Bay Head {{section of the}} Lush's Bight Group. From {{the base of the}} section to the top a general lithologic gradation (with considerable interdigitation of units) is present as follows: close-packed pillowed lavas, isolated pillow breccia, broken pillow breccia, coarse aquagene tuff, fine aquagene tuff. [...] The section comprises the south limb of an anticline whose axial plane dips steeply northward and whose horizontal axis strikes east-northeast. Within the section discontinuous schist zones are approximately parallel to the volcanic layering. These are the result of inhomogeneous strain and are characterized by the presence of a strain-slip fabric, so that there are two fabrics in the zones and only one, an S or LS tectonite <b>fabric</b> <b>outside.</b> The schist zones are apparently pretectonic to the major anticline.

They must also maximize movement, and provide safety and comfort for firefighters who work in extreme conditions. The structure of {{protective footwear}} for firefighters consists of the main body, inner sole, protective sole, lining, shin guard, outer sole, and slip prevention grooves. There are two types footwear: rubber footwear and leather footwear. Rubber footwear uses vulcanized rubber on the outside, and aramid fiber for the lining, and has a pulling loop-type opening. Leather footwear has leather material on the <b>outside,</b> penetration prevention <b>fabric</b> on the inside, and a zipper-type opening. According to KFIS 008 (KFIS 2001), protective footwear for firefighters in Korea {{must be at least}} 30  cm high {{from the bottom of the}} outer sole. When the heel and soles are attached to the upper leather, no metal parts such as nails or screws can be used. The weight limitation for rubber footwear is 2.8  kg, and the limitation for leather footwear is 3.0  kg. The evaluation categories for protective footwear for firefighters include tension, electricity-resistance, water-resistance, heat-resistance, heat transmission, and internal heat conduction. The international and domestic standards for protective footwear for firefighters include NFPA 1971 (National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 2013), CSN EN 15090 (Safety Protection Standards (CSN EN) 2012), and ISO 15538 (International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 2001).|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) fully interlaced representative circular woven preform structures and to understand the effects of weave pattern and number of layers on 3 D circular woven structures. Various 3 D circular woven preforms were developed. Data generated from these structures included yarn-to-yarn space, density, yarn angle, yarn length and crimp. It was shown that the weave patterns affected the 3 D circular woven preform structures. The yarn-to-yarn spaces in the 3 D fully interlaced circular structures were high compared to the traditional 3 D orthogonal circular woven structures in <b>fabric</b> circumference (<b>fabric</b> <b>outside</b> surface) due to the interlacement of the yarn sets. The 3 D plain, twill and satin structures resulted in axial angle (a) in fabric length; circumferential angle (c), and interlaced radial angle (ri) in fabric circumference and fabric diameter due to the axial-circumferential and axial-radial interlacements. The weave patterns slightly affected the yarn angles. On the other hand, it was observed that the number of layers considerably affected the radial arc length and the radial length in wall thickness in the 3 D circular woven structure. The interlacement on 3 D plain, twill and satin circular woven structures resulted in axial crimp, circumferential crimp and radial crimp. The crimps in the 3 D fully interlaced circular woven structures slightly depended on the types of weave pattern and the number of layers.
