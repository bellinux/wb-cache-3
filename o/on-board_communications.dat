50|$|On {{the night}} of 30 March 1944, while flying in {{an attack on the}} city of Nuremberg, in Germany, during the Battle of Berlin air offensive, whilst 70 mi from the target, Pilot Officer Barton's Handley Page Halifax bomber (Serial number: LK797) was badly shot-up in attacks by two Luftwaffe night-fighters, a Junkers Ju 88 and a Messerschmitt 210, {{resulting}} in two of its fuel tanks being punctured, both its radio and rear turret gun port being disabled, the starboard inner engine being critically damaged and the internal intercom lines being cut. In a running battle, despite the attacks being persistent and determined, Barton as captain of the aircraft succeeded by good flying in throwing off and escaping his faster and more agile assailants. However, a misunderstanding in <b>on-board</b> <b>communications</b> in the aircraft {{at the height of the}} crisis resulted in three of the 7-man crew bailing out, leaving Barton with no navigator, bombardier or wireless operator. Rather than turn back for England, he decided to press on with the mission, against the odds of further attacks in a semi-wrecked aircraft that was leaking fuel and handicapped by lack of a full crew. Arriving over the target, he released the bomb payload himself and then, as Barton turned the aircraft for home, its ailing starboard engine blew-up. Subsequently he nursed the damaged airframe over a four-and-a-half hour flight with no navigational assistance back across the hostile defences of Germany and occupied Europe, and across the North Sea. As LK797 crossed the English coast at dawn 90 miles to the north of its base its fuel ran out because of the battle damage leakage and, with only one engine still running on vapours, and at too low a height to allow a remaining crew bail-out by parachute, Barton crash-landed the bomber at the village of Ryhope, steering away in the final descent from the houses and coal pit-head workings. Barton was pulled from the wrecked aircraft alive but died of injuries sustained in the landing before he reached the hospital. The three remaining on-board members of the crew survived the forced landing. One local man, a miner, also died when he was struck by a piece of the aeroplane's wreckage during the impact of the crash.|$|E

The {{objective is to}} study the precipitation of high energy electrons and protons from Van-Allen radiation belts to lower altitude of 600 - 900 km due to resonance interaction with low frequency EM waves. The unique communications system design of IITMSAT evolves from the challenging downlink data requirement of 1 MB per day in the UHF band posed by the mission and the satellite's payload, SPEED (Space based Proton and Electron Energy Detector). To ensure continuous downlink data stream in the short Low earth Orbit passes, a robust physical layer protocol was designed to counter time-varying aspects of a Space-Earth telecom link. For the <b>on-board</b> <b>communications</b> system, two types of design alternatives exist for each module. The first option is a custom design wherein a module is developed from scratch using discrete components. The other option is an integrated design wherein an electronics COTS module can be directly plugged into the subsystem. This module is evaluated by carrying out vibration and thermal tests. If an integrated module is low-cost and meets the design requirements, it is preferred over a custom design. In order to carry out performance tests under simulated link conditions, an RF attenuation test setup was designed that can work at extreme temperatures.

40|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly deploy {{inexpensive}} satellites to meet tactical goals {{has become an}} important goal for military space systems. In fact, Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) {{has been in the}} spotlight at the highest levels. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has identified that the critical next step is developing the bus standards and modular interfaces. Historically, satellite components have been constructed based on bus standards and standardized interfaces. However, this has not been done to a degree, which would allow the rapid deployment of a satellite. Advancements in plug-and-play (PnP) technologies for terrestrial applications can serve as a baseline model for a PnP approach for satellite applications. Since SpaceWire (SpW) has become a de facto standard for satellite high-speed (greater than 200 Mbp) <b>on-board</b> <b>communications,</b> it has become important for SpW to adapt to this Plug and Play (PnP) environment. Because SpW is simply a bulk transport protocol and lacks built-in PnP features, several changes are required to facilitate PnP with SpW. The first is for Host(s) {{to figure out what the}} network looks like, i. e., how pieces of the network, routers and nodes, are connected together; network mapping, and to receive notice of changes to the network. The second is for the components connected to the network to be understood so that they can communicate. The first element, network topology mapping & change of status indication, is being defined (topic of this paper). The second element describing how components are to communicate has been defined by ARFL with the electronic data sheets known as XTEDS.

40|$|The ISS {{provides}} an excellent opportunity for pioneering artificial intelligence software {{to meet the challenges}} of real-time communications (comm) link management. This opportunity empowers the ISS Program to forge a testbed for developing cognitive communications systems for the benefit of the ISS mission, manned Low Earth Orbit (LEO) science programs and future planetary exploration programs. In November, 1998, the Flight Operations Directorate (FOD) started the ISS Antenna Manager (IAM) project to develop a single processor supporting multiple comm satellite tracking for two different antenna systems. Further, the processor was developed to be highly adaptable as it supported the ISS mission through all assembly stages. The ISS mission mandated communications specialists with complete knowledge of when the ISS was about to lose or gain comm link service. The current specialty mandated cognizance of large sun-tracking solar arrays and thermal management panels in addition to the highly-dynamic satellite service schedules and rise/set tables. This mission requirement makes the ISS the ideal communications management analogue for future LEO space station and long-duration planetary exploration missions. Future missions, with their precision-pointed, dynamic, laser-based comm links, require complete autonomy for managing high-data rate communications systems. Development of cognitive communications management systems that permit any crew member or payload science specialist, regardless of experience level, to control communications is one of the greater benefits the ISS can offer new space exploration programs. The IAM project met a new mission requirement never previously levied against US space-born communications systems management: process and display the orientation of large solar arrays and thermal control panels based on real-time joint angle telemetry. However, IAM leaves the actual communications availability assessment to human judgement, which introduces unwanted variability because each specialist has a different core of experience with comm link performance. Because the ISS utilizes two different frequency bands, dynamic structure can be occasionally translucent at one frequency while it can completely interdict service at the other frequency. The impact of articulating structure on the comm link can depend on its orientation at the time it impinges on the link. It can become easy for a human specialist to cross-associate experience at one frequency with experience at the other frequency. Additionally, the specialist's experience is incremental, occurring one nine-hour shift at a time. Only the IAM processor experiences the complete 24 x 7 x 365 communications link performance for both communications links but, it has no "learning capability. " If the IAM processor could be endowed with a cognitive ability to remember past structure-induced comm link outages, based on its knowledge of the ISS position, attitude, communications gear, array joint angles and tracking accuracy, it could convey such experience to the human operator. It could also use its learned communications link behaviors to accurately convey the availability of future communications sessions. Further, the tool could remember how accurately or inaccurately it predicted availability and correct future predictions based on past performance. The IAM tool could learn frequency-specific impacts due to spacecraft structures and pass that information along as "experience. " Such development would provide a single artificial intelligence processor that could provide two different experience bases. If it also "knew" the satellite service schedule, it could distinguish structure blockage from schedule or planet blockage and then quickly switch to another satellite. Alternatively, just as a human operator could judge, a cognizant comm system based on the IAM model could "know" that the blockage is not going to last very long and continue tracking a comm satellite, waiting for it to track away from structure. Ultimately, once this capability was fully developed and tested in the Mission Control Center, it could be transferred on-orbit to support development of operations concepts that include more advanced cognitive communications systems. Future applications of this capability are easily foreseen because even more dynamic satellite constellations with more nodes and greater capability are coming. Currently, the ISS fully employs its high-data-rate return link for harvesting payload science. In the coming months, it will double that data rate and is forecast to fully utilize that capability. Already there is talk of an upgrade that quadruples the current data rate allocated to ISS payload science before the end of its mission and laser comm links have already been tested from the ISS. Every data rate upgrade mandates more complicated and sensitive communications equipment which implies greater expertise invested in the human operator. Future on-orbit cognizant comm systems will be needed to meet greater performance demands aboard larger, far more complicated spacecraft. In the LEO environment, the old-style one-satellite-per-spacecraft operations concept will give way to a new concept of a single customer spacecraft simultaneously using multiple comm satellites. Much more highly-dynamic manned LEO missions with decades of crew members potentially increase the demand for communications link performance. A cognizant <b>on-board</b> <b>communications</b> system will meet advanced communications demands from future LEO missions and future planetary missions. The ISS has fledgling components of future exploration programs, both LEO and planetary. Further, the Flight Operations Directorate, through the IAM project, has already begun to develop a communications management system that attempts to solve advanced problems ideally represented by dynamic structure impacting scheduled satellite service. With an earnest project to integrate artificial intelligence into the IAM processor, the ISS Program could develop a cognizant communications system that could be adapted and transferred to future on-orbit avionics designs...|$|E

This signal is Fourier transformed by the CMC Processor into a unique time slot for each user frequency. The CMC processor is driven by a waveform generator through a single sideband (SSB) modulator. The output of the coherent demodulator is composed of positive and negative pulses, which are the envelopes of the chirp transform processor output. These pulses correspond to the data symbols. Following the demodulator, a logic circuit reconstructs the pulses into data, which are subsequently differentially decoded to form the transmitted data. The coherent demodulation and detection of BPSK signals derived from a CMC chirp transform processor were experimentally demonstrated and bit error rate (BER) testing was performed. To assess the feasibility of such advanced receiver, the results were compared with the theoretical analysis and plotted for an average BER as a function of signal-to-noise ratio. Another goal of this SBIR program was the development of a commercial product. The commercial product developed was an arbitrary waveform generator. The successful sales have begun with the delivery of the first arbitrary waveform generator...|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{features}} offered exclusively on G-Book mX is Probe Communication Traffic Information. According to the press release from Toyota dated April 10, 2007, [...] "This unique Toyota traffic information service gathers driving data - such as speed and position - from vehicles equipped with G-Book mX to provide drivers with alternate routes for avoiding traffic congestion. Because it makes use of the <b>on-board</b> DCM (data <b>communications</b> module), the information gathering capability of this service is superior to similar systems, which rely solely on cell phones, and efficiently stores information about traffic congestion in real time at the G-Book Center. In this way the Probe Communication Traffic Information service supplements Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) information with updates on traffic congestion, providing drivers with highly accurate predictions about the current traffic situation and suggestions for the best alternate routes to take." [...] This feature is being marketed as an ability to drive eco-friendly, by helping to avoid pollution created by cars idling in traffic and allowing the driver to reach their destination sooner, and affording the opportunity to turn the car off, limiting emissions being added to the atmosphere.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} Design and Implementation of a Testing Equipment for Space High Speed Serial Links on National Instruments FPGA Platform and LabVIEW Environment. SpaceWire {{is the current}} {{generation}} rated up to 400 Mbps of spacecraft <b>on‑board</b> high‑speed serial <b>communications.</b> Major subjects of the Space Industry prefer resort to comprehensive, structured and reliable testing environment, like the well renown LabVIEW solution. Currently, there are no proper or complete solutions available on the testing‑equipment market able to offer for SpaceWire links both top‑rated speed and advanced Link Analyser functionalities under the LabVIEW environment. Willing to address this growing market request, National Instruments would offer a completed and natively LabVIEW integrated solution for SpaceWire testing purposes based on its PXIe hardware. The thesis discussed in these pages {{is the result of}} National Instruments and University of Pisa joint collaboration. The presented document first provides context and background theory on the spacecraft design, introducing the SpaceWire standard. Following, the required specifications are presented and translated into the SpaceWire Link Analyser system architecture to be implemented. Main body of text explains in details all the stages involving design and implementation of the system on National Instruments target PXIe FPGA hardware solution. Know‑how acquisition about the implementation of user custom designs on National Instruments LabVIEW FPGA solutions involved the major efforts and training during thesis activities. Lastly, the verification and validation strategy adopted is presented and discussed providing the achieved results...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of satellite <b>communications,</b> <b>on-board</b> processing (OBP) obtains more and more attentions due to the increased efficiency and performance. However, the large amounts of digital circuits in the OBP transponders {{are sensitive to the}} high-energy particles in space radiation environments, which may cause various kinds of single event effect. Among these effects, single event upset (SEU) is the major potential reason for the instability of the satellite communication systems. Triple modular redundancy (TMR) is a classical and effective method for mitigating the SEU in digital circuits. However, since three identical logic modules and a voting circuit are needed in TMR, the overhead is so high that the scheme may not be applicable on the on-board digital processing platform with very limited area and power resources. Therefore, how to design a more cost-effective fault-tolerant method becomes a critical issue. Considering that FIR-like processing is frequently used on OBP platform, in this article, a dual modules (DM) plus checking module based on residue code (DM-CRC) architecture for SEU-tolerant FIR design is proposed. Although this architecture reduces the area overhead dramatically, we find that the fault missing rate is still high if single-sample checking (SSC) is used. To solve this problem, a Multi-sample checking DM-CRC (MSC-DM-CRC) is further proposed. Our analysis shows that the MSC-DM-CRC scheme can make the fault missing rate small enough without reducing the actual throughput. By simulations it is shown that, when the modulus for CRC is 7 and the number of samples for MSC is 4, the reduction of area overhead relative to TMR is over 20 % and the fault missing rate is as low as 0. 05 %. 漏 2012 Yang et al...|$|R
