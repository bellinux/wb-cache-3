5|$|As 1953 began, Ferrier {{was busy}} rehearsing for Orpheus, an English {{language}} version of Orfeo ed Euridice to be staged in four performances at the Royal Opera House in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier's enthusiastic approval, some months previously. Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, {{in which she}} sang works by three living English composers: Howard Ferguson, William Wordsworth and Edmund Rubbra. During her regular hospital treatment she discussed with doctors the advisability of an <b>oophorectomy</b> (removal of the ovaries), but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be insignificant and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose {{not to have the}} operation.|$|E
5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she {{underwent a}} preventive <b>oophorectomy,</b> as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.|$|E
25|$|Partial <b>oophorectomy</b> (i.e., {{ovarian cyst}} removal not {{involving}} total <b>oophorectomy)</b> {{is often used}} to treat milder cases of endometriosis when non-surgical hormonal treatments fail to stop cyst formation. Removal of ovarian cysts through partial <b>oophorectomy</b> is also used to treat extreme pelvic pain from chronic hormonal-related pelvic problems.|$|E
30|$|The {{technique}} {{has continued to}} evolve: we now use 15  cm long ports and a rigid laparoscope. We have performed 6 successful total endoscopic vaginal <b>oophorectomies</b> from 8 attempts.|$|R
30|$|The {{rest of the}} surgeries, 134 in total, were laparoscopies. Eighteen {{of those}} (13.4 %) where tubal sterilization, 5 (3.7 %) salpingectomies (for hydrosalpinx), 58 (43.3 %) <b>oophorectomies</b> or ovarian {{cystectomy}} (most commonly, endometriomas), 26 (19.4 %) where hysterectomies for benign conditions (fibroids or simple endometrial hyperplasia), 6 (4.5 %) hysterectomies for malignant disease (radical surgery with lymphadenectomy), 17 (12.7 %) myomectomies (subserosal or intramural fibroids {{with a desire to}} preserve the uterus) and 4 (3 %) other procedures (adhesiolysis or chromopertubation).|$|R
50|$|As {{superintendent}} of the Provincial Training School Le Vann duties were to manage the school, to perform psychological analysis and to operate when other professionals were not available. Another of his major responsibility was to analyze the students that were candidates for sterilization. Once a sterilization request {{was approved by the}} Alberta Eugenics Board the school would use a number of different techniques to sterilize the child. The most popular were bilateral salpingectomy and <b>oophorectomies</b> for the female students and vasectomies and castration for the male students.|$|R
25|$|Partial <b>oophorectomy</b> or {{ovariotomy}} {{is a term}} {{sometimes used}} to describe a variety of surgeries such as ovarian cyst removal or resection of parts of the ovaries. This kind of surgery is fertility-preserving, although ovarian failure may be relatively frequent. Most of the long-term risks and consequences of <b>oophorectomy</b> are not or only partially present with partial <b>oophorectomy.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Oophorectomy</b> is {{associated}} with significantly increased all-cause long-term mortality except when performed for cancer prevention in carriers of high-risk BRCA mutations. This effect is particularly pronounced for women who undergo <b>oophorectomy</b> before age 45.|$|E
25|$|For {{women with}} high-risk BRCA2 mutations, <b>oophorectomy</b> around age 40 has a {{relatively}} modest benefit for survival; {{the positive effect of}} reduced breast and ovarian cancer risk is nearly balanced by adverse effects. The survival advantage is more substantial when <b>oophorectomy</b> is performed together with prophylactic mastectomy.|$|E
40|$|Ovarian {{cancer has}} {{received}} national attention {{as a highly}} virulent disease. Its lack of early warning symptoms {{and the failure to}} develop highly sensitive screening tests have led some physicians to recommend prophylactic <b>oophorectomies</b> to women with relatives who have had ovarian cancer. Others have recommended routine screening of otherwise normal women for CA 125, a circulating tumor marker, and ultrasound examinations. Each of these techniques is associated with substantial false-positive rates that could lead to unnecessary surgery. A review of epidemiologic data suggests that familial ovarian cancer kindreds are rare, but women with first-degree relatives who have had ovarian cancer have a significant risk themselves for developing ovarian cancer. In addition, women with a great number of ovulatory cycles are at an increased risk for the disease. Circulating tumor markers are frequently elevated in women with advanced ovarian cancer, but their value in early detection of ovarian cancer has yet to be established. Advances in endovaginal ultrasound and color Doppler flow technology have significantly improved our ability to assess pelvic organs. This article presents the background, rationale, and structure of the Yale Early Detection Program for ovarian cancer, whose goals are to identify the best techniques for diagnosing ovarian cancer in an early stage, to determine the frequency with which such tests should be employed, to assess false-positive results, and to identify women who might benefit from prophylactic <b>oophorectomies...</b>|$|R
30|$|This was a {{prospective}} {{case control study}} undertaken in a teaching hospital in London over a 2 -year period. Between 2006 and 2008, women scheduled for hysterectomy for menorrhagia with clinical uterine size of > 14  weeks were offered an attempt at VH after pre-treatment with goserelin acetate. Women in the study group received either one or two intramuscular doses of 3.6  mg of goserelin (Zoladex, Astra Zeneca, Ltd.) while {{a group of women}} with comparable uterine size who underwent TAH for menorrhagia served as control; this study therefore achieves Oxford level II evidence. <b>Oophorectomies</b> were not routinely performed in either group.|$|R
30|$|Human ovary surface {{epithelial}} (HOSE) {{cells were}} derived from ovaries removed by prophylactic <b>oophorectomies</b> [21]. The cells were transfected with SV 40 to extend their life span. They carried BRCA 1, 2 mutations. They were cultured in the base medium: 1 : 1 mix of MCDB 105 and 199 supplemented 15 % of human serum, 0.25  U/ml of insulin, 2  mM of l-glutamine. The media also contained 100  U/ml penicillin, 200  mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown in the cell culture 75  cm 2 flask (Corning) (catalog # 430641) in the CO 2 incubators at 37  °C. The cultures were propagated as described above.|$|R
25|$|<b>Oophorectomy</b> can {{significantly}} improve survival {{for women with}} high-risk BRCA mutations, for whom prophylactic <b>oophorectomy</b> around age 40 {{reduces the risk of}} ovarian and breast cancer and provides significant and substantial long-term survival advantage. On average, earlier intervention does not provide any additional benefit but increases risks and adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|Bilateral <b>oophorectomy</b> {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{done in the}} belief that the benefit of preventing ovarian cancer would outweigh the risks associated with removal of ovaries. However, {{it is now clear that}} prophylactic <b>oophorectomy</b> without a reasonable medical indication decreases long-term survival rates substantially and has deleterious long-term effects on health and well-being even in post-menopausal women.|$|E
25|$|Total hysterectomy: {{complete}} {{removal of the}} uterus and cervix, with or without <b>oophorectomy.</b>|$|E
30|$|SPSS Statistics 19 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) {{was used}} to analyze the data. Certain factors were not {{normally}} distributed. Year of birth was divided into three intervals, 1903 – 1940, 1941 – 1954 and 1955 +, due to differing patterns of breast-feeding over time (The National Board of Health and Welfare 2010). Age at diagnosis was dichotomized, younger than 50 years versus 50 years and older and was also used as a proxy variable for menopause. It was not possible determine the exact age of menopause in patients who reported previous hormone therapy use and had hormone induced bleedings as well as in patients who reported hysterectomies without <b>oophorectomies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Ovarian {{epithelial}} dysplasia {{was initially}} described in material from prophylactic <b>oophorectomies</b> for BReast CAncer gene (BRCA) mutation. Similar histopathological abnormalities have been revealed after ovulation stimulation. Given that tamoxifen (TAM) has a clomid-like effect and is sometimes used to induce ovulation, we studied the morphological features and immunohistochemical expression patterns of neoplasia-associated markers in adnexectomies previously exposed to TAM for breast cancer. We blindly reviewed 173 histopathological slides of adnexectomies according to three groups – oophorectomie sassociated with TAM exposure (n= 42), <b>oophorectomies</b> associated with clomiphene exposure (n= 15) and a spontaneously fertile non cancerous control group (n= 116). Morphological features (with an ovarian and tubal dysplasia scoring system) and immunohistochemical expression patterns of Ki- 67, p 53 and Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH 1 is an enzyme {{significantly associated with}} earlystage ovarian cancer) were evaluated and correlated. Mean tubal dysplasia score was significantly higher in the TAM group and clomiphene group than in controls (respectively 7. 8 vs 3. 5, P< 0. 007 and 6. 8 vs 3. 5, P= 0. 008). There is no statistical difference for the ovarian score in TAM group {{in comparison with the}} control group whereas we found a significant score for clomiphen group (6. 5, P= 0. 009). Increased ALDH 1 expression was observed in the two exposed group whereas expression patterns of Ki 67 and p 53 were moderate. Interestingly, ALDH 1 expression was low in non-dysplastic epithelium, high in dysplasia, and constantly low in the two carcinoma. Furthermore, we confirm our previous results showing that ALDH 1 may be a useful tissue biomarker in the subtle histopathological diagnosis of tubo-ovarian dysplasia. </p...|$|R
30|$|Of the 10 {{surgeries}} {{for early}} stage disease, {{the mean age}} was 42.3  years (range, 29 – 55), average BMI was 32.1  kg/m 2 (range, 17 – 65  kg/m 2), average estimated blood loss (EBL) was 212.5  ml (range, 50 – 1, 000  mL), surgical time was 306.1  min (range, 87 – 639), and average length of stay (LOS) was 1.6  days (range, 1 – 2). In this group, the surgical procedures performed included five hysterectomies, eight <b>oophorectomies,</b> one cystectomy, eight omentectomies, five pelvic lymph node dissections (average, 10.3; range, 5 – 18), four para-aortic lymph node dissections (average, 8.6; range, 3 – 12), four appendectomies, and seven upper abdominal and diaphragmatic biopsies. None of these patients were upstaged after surgical and pathological staging.|$|R
25|$|<b>Oophorectomy</b> {{before the}} age of 45 is {{associated}} with a fivefold mortality from neurologic and mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|Short-term hormone {{replacement}} with estrogen has negligible effect on overall mortality for high-risk BRCA mutation carriers. Based on computer simulations, overall mortality {{appears to be}} marginally higher for short-term HRT after <b>oophorectomy</b> or marginally lower for short-term HRT after <b>oophorectomy</b> in combination with mastectomy. This result can probably be generalized to other women at high risk in whom short-term (i.e., one- or two-year) treatment with estrogen for hot flashes may be acceptable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oophorectomy</b> for benign causes is {{most often}} {{performed}} by abdominal laparoscopy. Abdominal laparotomy or robotic surgery is used in complicated cases or when a malignancy is suspected.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{were then}} {{interviewed by the}} Board and {{recommendations}} were made for sterilization. If they could not attend, members sometimes saw the patient in their institutional ward. Consent was initially required for all operational procedures, either from the patients, their parent or guardian. A competent surgeon {{was appointed to the}} case; however the Act stated they were not liable to any civil action. Various types of operations were performed: vasectomies, salpingectomies (tubal ligation), orchidectomies (removal of the testes), <b>oophorectomies</b> (removal of the ovaries), and sometimes hysterectomies. Operations took place in approved hospitals designated by the Board. In addition to the appointed board members and presenters, it was not uncommon for other professionals, support staff, or visitors to attend patient interviews.|$|R
40|$|Types and {{frequency}} of ovarian masses in children over a 10 -year period Background: Ovarian masses represent a range of pathology from benign cyst to highly aggressive malignant tumors. It {{has been estimated that}} gynecologic malignancy account for approximately 2 % of all types of cancer in children, 60 - 70 % of these lesions arise in the ovary. Methods: All ovarian masses which were resected or biopsied in Mofid Children's Hospital from 2002 to 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Patient’s age, presenting symptoms, surgical procedures, pathological diagnosis, postoperative treatment, and outcome were obtained from medical records. Results: Fifty-seven girls (aged 40. 2 ± 57 months with the range of 1 day to 15 years) underwent different types of ovarian operations (24 salpingo-oophorectomies, 10 <b>oophorectomies,</b> 21 ovarian cystectomies, and 2 ovarian biopsies). 50 children had unilateral ovarian mass (49. 1 % right and 38. 6 left, respectively).

30|$|In Bo, 133 {{patients}} {{underwent a}} surgical procedure. This corresponded to 6.2  % of all hospital admissions over the total 6  month period. As {{this is likely}} to be an underestimate as the majority of the maternal surgical work was performed at the nearby MSF hospital in Gondama, we contacted MSF to obtain their obstetric data for that time period. MSF data showed that over this 6  month period 296 caesarean sections were performed, 82 ERPC’s, 36 operations for ectopic pregnancy, 8 hysterectomies or <b>oophorectomies</b> and 8 other undefined obstetric or gynaecological procedures. 90.9  % of all obstetric and gynaecological procedures were performed on an urgent basis and 72  % were between the ages of 16 – 35 (Surgical Activity Reports 2013). Total operations (maternal and non-maternal) for the MSF hospital and for Bo District Hospital combined gave a procedure rate of 231 operations per 100, 000 population per year (World Population Prospects 2012).|$|R
25|$|From the 1940s {{until the}} late 1980s, DES was FDA-approved as {{estrogen}}-replacement therapy for estrogen deficiency states such as ovarian dysgenesis, premature ovarian failure, and after <b>oophorectomy.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Oophorectomy</b> for endometriosis is {{used only}} as last resort, often in {{conjunction}} with a hysterectomy, as it has severe side effects for women of reproductive age and a low success rate.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen is {{also used}} in the therapy of vaginal atrophy, hypoestrogenism (as a result of hypogonadism, <b>oophorectomy,</b> or primary ovarian failure), amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and oligomenorrhea. Estrogens {{can also be used}} to {{suppress}} lactation after child birth.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{introduce}} a surgical technique that combines culdoscopy with laparoscopy and microlaparoscopy. Methods: This was a feasibility study conducted at The Mount Sinai Hospital of Queens. The technique is used when a larger port is required during laparoscopy or microlaparoscopy procedures. The additional port {{is placed in}} the vagina and, under laparoscopic surveillance, into the posterior cul-de-sac. Results: This operation has been performed successfully in 5 <b>oophorectomies,</b> 4 myomectomies, 3 salpingoophorectomies, and 1 salpingectomy. Conclusion: This technique reduces the need for abdominal ports in excess of 5 mm. These ports can have a visual or operative function depending on the nature or stage of the procedure. The vaginal port can serve a visual function similar to that of culdoscopy or may be used for the introduction of operative instruments and the extraction of specimens. A principal benefit of using the larger vaginal port is derived from the capability of assisting laparoscopy and allowing the surgeon to use fewer and smaller abdominal trocars...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{retrospectively}} {{evaluates the}} preoperative work-up and the classification and operative treatment of acute abdomen caused by gynaecological disorders in emergency admissions to our department. All female patients admitted {{in the emergency}} setting and operated on for gynaecological acute abdomen in our emergency department over the period from 1997 to 2002 {{were included in the}} study. A total of 103 patients were identified (54 undergoing emergency operations, 9 operated on within 72 hours, and 40 managed conservatively with medical therapy. The 54 emergency operations performed were 24 ovarian resections, 17 salpingectomies, 5 <b>oophorectomies,</b> 4 exploratory laparotomies, 2 uterine polypectomies and 2 hysterectomies. The non-specific presentation of the disease and an inadequate preoperative work-up in these patients often led to a generic diagnosis at admission. This approach tends {{to increase the number of}} operations performed on an emergency basis, whereas a wait-and-see type of management should be adopted. A proper use of surgery is mandatory especially in those patients in whom preservation of reproductive capability has a major impact on outcome...|$|R
40|$|Neuroendocrine {{carcinoma}} (NEC), {{also called}} small cell carcinoma or large cell carcinoma, {{is a rare}} and aggressive tumor that develops mainly in the lung and intestine. More rarely, NEC develops in gynecologic organs, with poor prognoses. We experienced a case of NEC in the broad ligament of the uterus. The patient was a 74 -year-old woman with symptoms of abdominal distension and constipation. Ultrasound sonography detected an abdominal tumor larger than 10 cm. She was then admitted to our hospital. She underwent surgery under the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, but the bilateral ovaries and uterus were normal in appearance, and a tumor was developing instead from the broad ligament of the uterus. The patient then received a hysterectomy, salpingo- <b>oophorectomies,</b> and lymphadenectomy, and the peritoneal membrane was stripped around the pelvic space. Despite our suggestion, she never accepted the adjuvant treatment. She discontinued her periodic follow-up with us and was followed in another hospital. Generally, the prognosis of NEC is poor, {{and there is no}} established treatment for a tumor in a gynecologic lesion. However, we anticipate that the accumulation of experience treating such cases will eventually lead to a standard treatment for NEC...|$|R
25|$|In humans, <b>oophorectomy</b> is {{most often}} {{performed}} because of diseases such as ovarian cysts or cancer; as prophylaxis to reduce the chances of developing ovarian cancer or breast cancer; or in conjunction with hysterectomy (removal of the uterus).|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{effect on}} all case {{mortality}} is relatively small. Women {{under the age}} of 45 years have a significantly increased long-term mortality that is believed to be caused by the hormonal side effects of hysterectomy and prophylactic <b>oophorectomy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Transgender men {{who have}} been oophorectomized must {{continue}} androgen therapy to avoid premature osteoporosis. Estrogen supplementation is theoretically not usually necessary, as some of the injected testosterone will be aromatized into estrogen sufficient to maintain bone (as it does in cisgender men). However, a single small study of trans men after <b>oophorectomy</b> demonstrated that androgens alone may be insufficient to retard bone loss. (van Kesteren P, et al. “Long-term follow-up of bone mineral density and bone metabolism in transsexuals treated with cross-sex hormones.” Clin Endocrin. 48(3):347-54. 1998.) It is likely the case that pre-oophorectomy, residual estrogen production is protective. However, after <b>oophorectomy,</b> some trans men may have insufficient estrogen to retard bone loss.|$|E
40|$|Aim. Ovarian {{epithelial}} dysplasia {{was initially}} described in material from prophylactic <b>oophorectomies</b> performed in patients at genetic risk of ovarian cancer. Similar histopathological abnormalities have been revealed after ovulation stimulation. Since infertility {{is also a}} risk factor for ovarian neoplasia, the aim {{of this study was to}} study the relationship between infertility and ovarian dysplasia. Methods. We blindly reviewed 127 histopathological slides of adnexectomies or ovarian cystectomies according to three groups—an exposed group to ovulation induction (n = 30), an infertile group without stimulation (n = 35), and a spontaneously fertile control group (n = 62) —in order to design an eleven histopathological criteria scoring system. Results. The ovarian dysplasia score was significantly higher in exposed group whereas dysplasia score was low in infertile and control groups (resp., 8. 21 in exposed group, 3. 69 for infertile patients, and 3. 62 for the controls). In the subgroup with refractory infertility there was a trend towards a more severe dysplasia score (8. 53 in ovulation induction group and 5. 1 in infertile group). Conclusion. These results raise questions as to the responsibility of drugs used to induce ovulation and/or infertility itself in the genesis of ovarian epithelial dysplasia...|$|R

She stated in February 2012 that military academies should not bar {{women who have}} undergone <b>oophorectomies</b> or hysterectomies from admittance. She opposed an April 2012 amendment to the Civil Servants Election and Recall Act submitted by Chi Kuo-tung proposing that legislative seats reserved for women be filled by women only, in cases that the original female candidate cannot take office, even if the candidate with the next-highest vote share is male. In August, Wu participated in a protest calling for Japan to apologize {{for the use of}} comfort women during World War II. Wu has criticized mother-child bonding programs offered by some hospitals as inflexible. In 2013, she pushed for amendments to the Domestic Violence Prevention Act recognizing violence between unmarried partners who do not live together as a crime. Wu has attempted to broaden the rage of services offered to people affected by domestic violence, stating that her efforts [...] "can change the chain of factors that lead to an environment of domestic violence and prevent future cases from happening."

40|$|Numerous studies {{support the}} role for {{mutations}} in the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) {{tumor suppressor gene}} and unopposed estrogen stimulation in the pathogenesis of uterine endometrioid carcinoma. However, the relation between PTEN signaling and estrogen/estrogen receptor in endometrial tumorigenesis remains unresolved. We used genetically engineered mice as a model to address this relation. Mice with a single deleted Pten allele (Pten+/−) spontaneously develop complex atypical hyperplasia and ∼ 20 % develop endometrial cancer. To {{determine the effect of}} removing endogenous estrogen, we performed <b>oophorectomies</b> on Pten+/− mice. Although there was a reduction in the number and severity of hyperplastic lesions, the endometrial phenotype persisted, suggesting that Pten mutation, independent of estrogen, can initiate the development of complex atypical hyperplasia. To recapitulate the situation in women with unopposed estrogen, we implanted 17 β-estradiol pellets in adult female Pten heterozygous mice, resulting in increased carcinoma incidence. Because studies have shown that estrogen largely acts on the endometrium via estrogen receptor ERα, we generated Pten+/−ERα−/− mice. Strikingly, 88. 9 % ofPten+/−ERα−/− mice developed endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma. Furthermore, Pten+/−ERα−/− mice showed a higher incidence of in situ and invasive carcinoma, suggesting that endometrial tumorigenesis can progress in the absence of ERα. Thus, the relation between Pten alterations and estrogen signaling in the development of endometrial carcinoma is complex; the results presented herein have important implications for the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma in women...|$|R
