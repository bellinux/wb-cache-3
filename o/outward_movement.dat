5|$|Wilson was a power pitcher. He has a {{repertoire}} of four pitches. He throws a straight four-seam fastball around 92-95mph; {{this is one of}} his main pitches. He also has a slider, a cut fastball, and a two-seam fastball. His slider traveled around 89mph. His cut fastball has allowed him to use fewer four-seam fastballs. In 2011, he started throwing the two-seam fastball as well. The two-seamer starts away on a right-handed hitter (or in to a left-handed hitter) and has dramatic inward (or <b>outward)</b> <b>movement</b> over the plate. He has also experimented with curveballs, screwballs, and knuckleballs.|$|E

The way in which drying can be controlled will now be explained. One of the most successful ways of wood drying or seasoning would be kiln drying, where the wood is placed into a kiln compartment in stacks and dried by steaming, and releasing the steam slowly.|$|E

30|$|The premaxillary {{region of}} the child is stimulated by the upward and <b>outward</b> <b>movements</b> of the tongue on the mother's breasts during {{suckling}} while the mandibular movements during suckling are thought to promote optimal jaw growth, whereas during non-nutritive sucking, the posteriorly acting forces of the buccinator muscle act against the forward acting forces of suckling during breastfeeding and may restrain jaw growth [15]. These NNS habits soothe the infants, reduce their teething discomforts and are believed to relax them during stressful situations [14].|$|R
25|$|Ion {{channels}} {{located on}} the surface membrane of the neuron allows for an influx of sodium ions and <b>outward</b> <b>movement</b> of potassium ions during an action potential. Selectively blocking these ion channels will decrease the likelihood of an action potential to occur. The drug riluzole is a neuroprotective drug that blocks sodium ion channels. Since these channels cannot activate, there is no action potential, and the neuron does not perform any transduction of chemical signals into electrical signals and the signal does not move on. This drug is used as an anesthetic {{as well as a}} sedative.|$|E
25|$|The thick {{ascending}} limb of {{the loop}} of Henle begins at the deeper portion of the renal outer medulla. Here, the urine has a relatively high concentration of sodium. As urine moves towards the more superficial portion of the thick ascending limb, NKCC2 is the major transport protein by which sodium is reabsorbed from the urine. This <b>outward</b> <b>movement</b> of sodium {{and the lack of}} water permeability in the thick ascending limb, creates a more diluted urine. According to the stoichiometry outlined above, each molecule of sodium reabsorbed brings one molecule of potassium and two molecules of chloride. Sodium goes on to be reabsorbed into the blood, where it contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structures}} of activated or agonist-bound GPCRs {{have also been}} determined. [...] These structures indicate how ligand binding at the extracellular side of a receptor leads to conformational changes in the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. The biggest change is an <b>outward</b> <b>movement</b> of the cytoplasmic part of the 5th and 6th transmembrane helix (TM5 and TM6). The structure of activated beta-2 adrenergic receptor in complex with Gs confirmed that the Gα binds to a cavity created by this movement.|$|E

40|$|AbstractN-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are obligate heterotetrameric ligand-gated ion {{channels}} that play critical roles in learning and memory. Here, using targeted molecular dynamics simulations, we developed an atomistic {{model for the}} gating of the GluN 1 /GluN 2 A NMDA receptor. Upon agonist binding, lobe closure of the ligand-binding domain produced outward pulling of the M 3 -D 2 linkers, leading to <b>outward</b> <b>movements</b> of the C-termini of the pore-lining M 3 helices and opening of the channel. The GluN 2 A subunits, similar to the distal (B/D) subunits in the homotetrameric GluA 2 α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazoleproprionate receptor, had greater M 3 <b>outward</b> <b>movements</b> and thus contributed more to channel gating than the GluN 1 subunits. Our gating model is validated by functional studies, including cysteine modification data indicating wider accessibility to the GluN 1 M 3 helices than to the GluN 2 A M 3 helices from the lumen of the open channel, and reveals why the Lurcher mutation in GluN 1 has a stronger ability in maintaining channel opening than the counterpart in GluN 2 A. The resulting structural model for the open state provides {{an explanation for the}} Ca 2 + permeability of NMDA receptors, and the structural differences between the closed and open states form the basis for drug design...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCarefully isolated, metabolically {{competent}} rat brain synaptosomes accumulate acidic {{amino acid}} neuro-transmitters down to very low external levels. This supports {{the suggestion that}} nerve endings are involved in terminating transmission at the synapses and in maintaining low levels of these molecules in the external environment in the brain. At saturating levels of acidic amino acids, the rate of inward and <b>outward</b> <b>movements</b> of the Na+-amino acid complex (exchange) is much faster than the net uptake. The transmembrane gradients of aspartate and glutamate approach each other under all conditions explored which indicates that these two amino acids share the same transport system...|$|R
2500|$|Movement {{of people}} across {{national}} borders is becoming increasingly common. [...] Traditionally, this has been {{described in terms of}} push and pull forces that drive migrant workers and immigrant laborers toward more developed countries. However, not all labor mobility is <b>outward</b> <b>movement</b> toward more advanced economies. [...] An increasing number of individuals move to less developed countries [...] to provide new expertise [...] or return their expertise to their country of origin. This includes a return movement or repatriation of internationally relocated individuals such as immigrants, refugees, sojourners, retirees, military personnel, international students, or other expatriates. [...] Such movements of people may influence interstate relationships concerning politics, economics and culture. [...] Thus, global workforce mobility research is relevant to both host and home country policies. [...] From a focus on longer-term and assigned expatriation, current research is focusing on the drivers and dynamics of a range of new alternative forms of global mobility in the workforce.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{etiology}} of subluxation in post-stroke patients is unclear but {{appears to be}} caused by weakness of the musculature supporting the shoulder joint. [...] The shoulder {{is one of the most}} mobile joints in the body. [...] To provide a high level of mobility the shoulder sacrifices ligamentous stability and as a result relies on the surrounding musculature (i.e., rotator cuff muscles, latissimus dorsi, and deltoid) for much of its support. [...] This is in contrast to other less mobile joints such as the knee and hip, which have a significant amount of support from the joint capsule and surrounding ligaments. [...] If a stroke damages the upper motor neurons controlling muscles of the upper limb, weakness and paralysis, followed by spasticity occurs in a somewhat predictable pattern. [...] The muscles supporting the shoulder joint, particularly the supraspinatus and posterior deltoid become flaccid and can no longer offer adequate support leading to a downward and <b>outward</b> <b>movement</b> of arm at the shoulder joint causing tension on the relatively weak joint capsule. [...] Other factors have also been cited as contributing to subluxation such as pulling on the hemiplegic arm and improper positioning.|$|E

Specific and counterbalancing forces seem to have been associated with US emigration over time: on the one hand, family-formation and EU-US economic-integration have triggered US <b>outward</b> <b>movements</b> while, on the other, the increase of income inequality and home-owners’ proportion has constrained the US emigration propensity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{acquired}} structural evidence that two components evident previously in the depolarization-evoked gating currents from voltage-gated Shaker K+ channels {{have their origin in}} sequential, two-step <b>outward</b> <b>movements</b> of the S 4 protein segments. A point mutation greatly destabilizes the “fully retracted” state of S 4 transmembrane translocation, causing instead an intermediate state to predominate at resting potentials. This state is distinguishable topologically and fluorometrically. That a point mutation effectively excludes half {{the range of}} S 4 motion from physiological voltages suggests that the diverse sensitivities among voltage-gated channels might reflect not only differences in S 4 valence, but also displacement. Existence of an intermediate subunit state helps explain why modeling channel activation has required positing greater than four closed states...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{responses of}} axons {{were used to}} monitor the time-course {{of a change in}} the concentration of an ion species in the fluid bathing the axons in connectives of isolated cockroach nerve cords. Initial exposure of the connectives to sodium-deficient Ringer resulted in a depletion of extra-axonal sodium which was much slower than the restoration observed on return of the sodium Ringer. It is suggested that this asymmetry could result from a sodium reservoir which delays the initial decline. Subsequent net inward and <b>outward</b> <b>movements</b> of sodium ions were rapid and symmetrical. Unlike sodium ions, lithium ions were apparently unable to reach the axon surfaces following sodium depletion. In view of the similar properties of sodium and lithium ions in many biological systems it is therefore unlikely the the sodium movements were passive. Instead, the results support the idea of net sodium transport by the perineurial and/or glial elements...|$|R

40|$|When {{examined}} by both light and scanning electron microscopy, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. sputigena, and C. ochracea displayed three distinct growth zones: the original streak, an intermediate zone, and the advancing edge, or halo zone. On Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems) -soy-blood agar, the cells translocated by gliding. C. gingivalis and C. sputigena formed large, irregular isolated colonies, while C. ochracea formed a more confluent cell mass. The cells within the streak zone {{and in most}} of the intermediate zone were heaped into mounds, with the individual cells displaying a definite flow pattern, the latter characteristic of C. sputigena and C. gingivalis. The halo zone consisted of tracks of cells which appeared to have translocated back upon themselves, or were restricted in their <b>outward</b> <b>movements</b> by adjacent cells. Also present within the halo zone were small aggregates of cells, referred to as pioneer colonies.

40|$|The {{question}} is posed: is a coherent theory of islandness – nissology – possible? Faultlines within constructions of islands and islandness are noted. Some of these axes of contestation have remained latent but {{have the potential}} to be sharply divisive. Three of the identified faultlines are examined – the nature of the island ‘edge’, the import for questions of island memory and identity of massive inward and <b>outward</b> <b>movements</b> of people, and the appropriation of island ‘realness’ by those for whom ‘island’ best functions as metaphor. A case is made for the excision of the latter from the purview of island studies. Despite apparent irreconcilability within island studies’ emerging faultlines, it is argued that place theory does constitute a theoretical framing that can work for island studies. Following a brief overview of the faultlines that also exist within place studies, it is noted that the difference-respecting and identity focused nature of phenomenology of place is particularly apposite for island studies, and the paper concludes with a consideration of what a phenomenology of islands might look like...|$|R
