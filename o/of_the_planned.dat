It also contained two full scripts from the planned series.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time all four Canadian {{divisions}} were assembled to participate in a battle. The nature and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planned</b> Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions. This brought the nominal strength of the Canadian Corps to about 170,000 men, of whom 97,184 were Canadian.|$|E

5|$|Production of the D-1 variant {{started in}} 1941 with 495 ordered. These {{aircraft}} were delivered between May 1941 and March 1942. The RLM wanted 832 machines produced from February 1941.

During this time, the WFG plant in Lemwerder moved production to Berlin. Over 165 Ju 87s had not been delivered and production was only 23 Ju 87 Ds per month out of the 40 expected. By the spring of 1942 to the end of production in 1944, 3,300 Ju 87s, mostly D-1s, D-2s and D-5s had been manufactured.|$|E

On the beach itself, infantry and tanks landed in four waves beginning at 06:30 and quickly secured the immediate area with minimal casualties. Meanwhile, engineers set to work clearing the area of obstacles and mines, and additional waves of reinforcements continued to arrive.
