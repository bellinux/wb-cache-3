Furthermore, they provide some rarely seen features, such as the option to tune the attack portion of the envelope with regard to keyboard velocity (enabling a voice to have a soft attack when played softly and vice versa) or envelope key-tracking (for instance, having shorter notes on a piano sound higher up the keyboard, mimicking the real instrument behaviour).|$|E
5000|$|An electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD, {{also known}} as an L3Vision CCD, a product commercialized by e2v Ltd., GB, L3CCD or Impactron CCD, a now-discontinued product offered in the past by Texas Instruments) is a {{charge-coupled}} device in which a gain register is placed between the shift register and the <b>output</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The gain register is split up into {{a large number of}} stages. In each stage, the electrons are multiplied by impact ionization in a similar way to an avalanche diode. The gain probability at every stage of the register is small (P < 2%), but as the number of elements is large (N > 500), the overall gain can be very high (...) , with single input electrons giving many thousands of output electrons. Reading a signal from a CCD gives a noise background, typically a few electrons. In an EMCCD, this noise is superimposed on many thousands of electrons rather than a single electron; the devices' primary advantage is thus their negligible readout noise.

5000|$|An {{important}} woofer specification is {{its power}} rating, {{the amount of}} power the woofer can handle without damage. The electrical power rating is not easily characterized and many manufacturers cite peak ratings attainable only for very brief moments without damage. Woofer power ratings become important when the speaker is pushed to extremes: applications requiring high <b>output,</b> <b>amplifier</b> overload conditions, unusual signals (i.e., non-musical ones), very low frequencies at which the enclosure provides little or no acoustic loading (and {{so there will be}} maximum cone excursion), or amplifier failure. In high-volume situations, a woofer's voice coil will heat up, increase its resistance, causing [...] "power compression", a condition where output sound power level decreases after extended high power activity. Further heating can physically distort the voice coil, causing scuffing, shorting due to wire insulation deterioration, or other electrical or mechanical damage. Sudden impulse energy can melt a section of voice coil wire, causing an open circuit and a dead woofer; the necessary level will vary with driver characteristics. In normal listening level music applications, the electrical power rating of woofers is generally unimportant; it remains important for higher frequency drivers.|$|E

40|$|This bachelor's thesis aims at {{designing}} the circuit diagram of {{input and output}} circuits of analog to digital and, simultaneously, digital to analog convertors intended to process audio signals and their realization. The introductory theoretical part deals with the qualitative requirements concerning the way low-frequency audio amplifiers process audio signal. The following part focuses on the active component base selection {{with respect to the}} achievement of the required quality and parameters as defined in the task description. The next part comprises the design of the input and <b>output</b> <b>amplifier</b> circuit diagram itself and then the realization of their functional samples. The input amplifier provides some of the functions which are common with high quality sound production; such as attenuator activation, input signal phase inversion, and MUTE function.

40|$|Digital imagers {{including}} Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD) {{are essential}} to most forms of modern photographic technologies. The quality of the data produced by digital imagers have made them an invaluable scientific measurement tool. Despite the numerous advantages of digital imagers, there are still factors that limit their performance. One such factor is {{the stability of the}} camera 2 ̆ 7 s gain, the ratio that dictates the imager 2 ̆ 7 s ability to convert incident photons to a measurable output voltage. Variations in gain can affect the linearity of the device and produce inaccurate measurements. One of the factors that determines the gain of the camera is the sensitivity of the <b>output</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the performance of two different <b>output</b> <b>amplifier</b> structures: the traditional source follower (SF) and the charge feedback amplifier (CFA). In studies of other solid state detectors, the CFA has shown a greater stability against variations in certain system parameters and environmental conditions such as operating temperature. It is thought that the CFA shows a superior stability over the SF, because the gain of the SF is dependent on multiple capacitances associated with the reset and output transistors, whereas the CFA gain is only dependent on its feedback capacitance. Furthermore, the CFA is able to handle a larger amount of charge than the SF, which increases the dynamic range of the <b>output</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In this research, <b>output</b> <b>amplifier</b> stability is measured using gain and linearity data collected from a CCD manufactured with both types of amplifiers. Preliminary data is presented that indicates the CFA exhibits a greater linearity, larger dynamic range, and a more stable gain than the SF. Despite this the CFA suffers from a significantly larger level of noise. Suggestions for future research are also given as to how to verify and expand upon the results presented here...|$|E
