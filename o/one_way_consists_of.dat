2500|$|In DESI, {{there is}} a {{high-velocity}} pneumatically assisted electrospray jet that is continually directed towards the probe surface. The jet forms a micrometer-size thin solvent film on the sample {{where it can be}} desorbed. The sample can be dislodged by the incoming spray jet allowing for particles to come off in an ejection cone of analyte containing secondary ion droplets. A lot of study is still going into looking at the working principals of DESI but there are still some things known. The erosion diameter of the spray spot formed by DESI is known to be directly tied to the spatial resolution. Both the chemical composition and the texture of the surface will also affect the ionization process. The nebulizing gas used most commonly is N2 set at a typical pressure of 160 psi. The solvent is a combination of methanol and water, sometimes paired with 0.5% acetic acid and at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The surface can be mounted it two different ways, <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> a surface holder that can carry 1 x 5cm large disposable surface slides that lie on a stainless steel surface. The steel surface has a voltage applied to provide an appropriate surface potential. The surface potential that can be applied is the same at which the sprayer can be set at. The second surface is made with an aluminum block that has a built in heater, this allows for temperature control with temperatures up to 300°C with newer stages having built in CCD’s and light sources. Their spectra are that similar to ESI. They feature multiply charged ions alkali metal adducts and non covalent complexes that originate from the condensed phase of the sample/solvent interaction. DESI [...] is revealed to have a more gentle ionization condition that leads to a more pronounced tendency for metal adduct formation and a lower specific charging of secondary droplets.|$|E
40|$|The essay {{provides}} {{support to}} the hypothesis that financing of provincial public spending through national transferences leads to overspending. We rest on persuasive economic and politicoinstitutional arguments. Fiscal illusion and the Leviathan model help to explain the overspending. And cartelization of tax collection helps to explain why governors are so reluctant to decentralize this task. We conclude that a fiscal organization closer {{to that of a}} confederation would be desirable. Two ways of organizing fiscal relations between the Nation and the provinces are considered. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> paying for national spending by means of periodic provincial transferences; control of public spending by tax-payers would be the greatest possible in this scenario, though leaving national financing in provincial hands could be a risky affair.

40|$|In {{this article}} we study the nature of time in Mechanics. The {{fundamental}} principle, according to which a mechanical system evolves governed by a second order differential equation, implies {{the existence of an}} absolute time-duration in the sense of Newton. There is a second notion of time for conservative systems which makes the Hamiltonian action evolve at a constant rate. In Quantum Mechanics the absolute time loses its sense as it does the notion of trajectory. Then, we propose two different ways to reach the time dependent Schrodinger equation. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> considering a "time constraint" on a free system. The other way is based on {{the point of view of}} Hertz, by considering the system as a projection of a free system. In the later manner, the "time" appearing in the Schrodinger equation is a linear combination of the time-duration with the "time" quotient of the action by the energy on each solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Both of them are based on an earlier work, where we have found a quantization rule canonically associated with each non-singular metric defined in the configuration space.

40|$|A longstanding {{question}} in investigations of interlanguage is whether target-deviant structures {{can be attributed}} to transfer from the L 1, or instead are part of the developmental acquisition sequence for the target language, evidenced by all learners of that language. Even if target-deviant structures in the L 2 can logically be attributed to the L 1, this {{does not necessarily mean that}} transfer is the source. How can we identify which target-deviant structures are due to transfer, and which are developmental? Researchers have typically approached answering this {{question in}} two ways. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> comparing the use of a target structure in L 2 learners from different L 1 backgrounds. If the L 2 learners appear to have the same interlanguage errors for that target structure, then transfer is not the most likely explanation. Another method for assessing the potential role of transfer is to compare the errors produced by L 2 learners with those produced by children acquiring the target language as their L 1. Again, if similarities are found, then the source of the errors in the L 2 interlanguage is probably not transfer from their L 1. A third method of determining the role of transfer would be to compare L 2 interlanguage with the language produced by L 1 learners who have specific language impairment (SLI). This method has not been widely used although it has a certain advantage over comparing L 2 with normally-developing L...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- As the {{complexity}} of electronic systems increases every day, new ways for describing these systems also appear. <b>One</b> interesting <b>way</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> capturing the whole system's functionality using a system level executable specification language. This high level specification is the entry point to a top-down design flow that results in the final implementation of the system. In this context synthesizable IP cores can be designed ad-hoc or obtained from third parties, with open source cores being an especially interesting option. A complete implementation of an AES/DES cryptoprocessor, from SystemC[1] specification to FPGA implementation-comparing an ad-hoc solution to one with open source IP cores- is fully described in this paper. Verification of the design in various levels using Transaction Level Modelling Style is presented. This methodology is extended in order to verificate the physical implementation presenting the concept of Physical Transactors.

This optimistic view of human capital production was rapidly abandoned. In the late 1960 s some economists began to revise {{the assumption that the}} black box's functioning was neutral with regard to human capital production. Supply-side economics of education appeared first under the form of production-function analysis. It was initially believed that the information delivered by such input/output approach would help policy makers and administrators choose the most productive 'mix' of inputs. But the major conclusion of this line of research is that there is apparently, no clear and undeniable relation between both expenditure per student and the specific resources they can buy (teachers' degrees and experience, smaller student-teacher ratios) on the one hand, and student achievement on the other hand. This probably means that further conceptual development is necessary to overcome the current analytical-and also political-deadlock, This paper argues that <b>one</b> promising <b>way</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> introducing organisational assets as well as non-monetary inputs into the production function paradigm...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{standard}} asymptotic theory is not applicable or is very unreliable in models with identification problems or weak instruments. <b>One</b> possible <b>way</b> out <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> using a variant of the Anderson-Rubin ((1949), AR) procedure. The latter allows one to build exact tests and confidence sets only for the full vector of the coefficients of the endogenous explanatory variables in a structural equation, but not for individual coefficients. This problem may in principle be overcome by using projection methods (Dufour (1997), Dufour and Jasiak (2001)). At first sight, however, this technique requires the application of costly numerical algorithms. In this paper, we give a general necessary and sufficient condition that allows one to check whether an AR-type confidence set is bounded. Furthermore, we provide an analytic {{solution to the problem of}} building projection-based confidence sets from AR-type confidence sets. The latter involves the geometric properties of "quadrics" and can be viewed as an extension of usual confidence intervals and ellipsoids. Only least squares techniques are needed to build the confidence intervals. Copyright The Econometric Society 2005. ...|$|R

The software Matrix. xla has been developed to run such a method. The main task of this thesis is to analyze the accuracy of the results given by the method and the software. The theoretical methodology behind the Matrix method is explained. The working procedure of program Matrix. xla is enlightened and tested on specific examples to point out several issues. Among these concerns, merging of the final solution, introduction of split streams and handling utility streams are further investigated. A complete solution is produced for the merging. However, given the complexity of the splitting issue, only one specific solution is developed together with some highlights of how to proceed for a general one. Concerning the utilities, a complete solution is elaborated. Nevertheless, this solution can be pushed further by modifying some concepts inside the Matrix method. Several ideas explaining how to proceed in this direction are described. This work brings a better understanding of how a retrofit is identified by the automated Matrix method tool and brings solutions to improve its and the Matrix method’s routine.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{probabilistic}} {{approach to the}} problem of packet forwarding in information centric networks is analysed and further developed. This type of networks are based on information identifiers rather than on the traditional host addresses. The approach is compact forwarding where the Bloom filter is the key method for aggregating forwarding information that allows moving packets at line speed labelled with fiat identifiers. The Bloom filter reduces state at the nodes, simplifies multicast delivery and introduces new trade-offs in the traditional routing and forwarding design space. However) it is a lassy method which produces some potential bandwidth penalties, loops, packet storms, and security issues due to false positives. This thesis focuses on false posit ive control for the probabilistic in-packet forwarding method and proposes two approaches either to reduce false positives or to exploit them in a useful <b>way.</b> <b>One</b> approach <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> a mechanism to carefully select the number of hash functions to use to generate the Bloom filter, The mechanism on average offers the minimum false positive occurrences depending on the traffic along the links. The other approach is a variation of the Bloom filter, the optihash, that can give better performance with respect to the Bloom filter at a cost of slightly more processing. The optihash is constructed with a family of functions that allows an optimisation which can be performed according to different metrics. Two general metrics are proposed in detail and some other, appJicationspeCific, are explored for in-packet forwarding techniques in different types of networks. The time complexity/false positive trade-off is thoroughly investigated and the evaluation of the optihasb {{as an alternative to the}} Bloom filter is performed for in-packet compact forwarding.

The purpose of this study to determine the influence of cassava waste steamed and supplementation MHA i n the ration to performance of local male sheep. This research held for 12 weeks starting on 11 th August – 2 nd November 2009 in a mini -farm Department of Animal Hu sbandry, Faculty of Agriculture, Sebelas Maret University located at the Jatikuwung village, Gondangrejo, Karanganyar District. Research materials include 12 male sheeps with an average weight 10, 44 ± 0, 875 kg. Experimental design used was Complete ly Randomized Design (CRD) with <b>one</b> <b>way</b> classification <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> three treatments and four replications, which each replication using a local male sheep. The feed used was forage, cassava was te and MHA with forage and cassava waste ratio 60 : 40. Treatment will include P 0 (king grass + without cassava waste steamed), P 1 (king grass + cassava waste steamed) and P 2 (king grass + cassava waste steamed +MHA). Observed variables included feed consump tion (DM), protein consumption, average daily gain, feed conve rsion, protein efficiency ration and feed cost per gain. The results showed that the average of three treatments at P 0, P 1 and P 2 for feed consumption (DM) was 1007, 52; 1170, 30; 1144, 90 (g/head/ day). Protein consumption was 144, 57; 167, 93; 158, 91 (g/head/day). Average daily gain was 50, 51; 57, 65 and 54, 59 (g/head/day). Feed conversion was 20, 47; 20, 51 and 21, 18. Protein efficiency ration was 0, 351; 0, 344; 0, 344 while the feed cost per gain was Rp. 15. 303. 29; Rp. 15, 425. 19; Rp. 1 6, 080. 27. Analysis of variance showed significantly different results for feed and protein consumption (P > 0. 05), and no significant different to the efficiency of protein ration and feed conversion, whereas covariance analysis showed no significant different results on the average daily gain (P< 0. 05). Conclusions can be taken in this study was cassava waste steamed and supplementation MHA i n the ration did not increase average daily gain and decrease of feed conversion, but increased feed consumption, protein consumption and demonstrate the efficiency of low-protein rations, as well as providing a feed cost per gain rate economical in steaming treatment without MHA supplementation.
