5|$|At 10:00, the Germans {{began their}} most {{successful}} assault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter,</b> attacking the southeastern end with infantry supported by newly arrived Tiger tanks. This assault {{pushed through the}} defenders' outer lines and threatened to isolate {{the bulk of the}} division from the river. Strong counterattacks from the mixed defenders and concentrated shellfire from south of the river eventually repelled the Germans.|$|E
5|$|In the {{traditional}} cottage garden, hedges served as fences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> {{to keep out}} marauding livestock and for privacy, along with other practical uses. Hawthorn leaves made a tasty snack or tea, while the flowers were used for making wine. The fast-growing Elderberry, in addition to creating a hedge, provided berries for food and wine, with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments. The wood had many uses, including toys, pegs, skewers, and fishing poles. Holly was another hedge plant, useful because it quickly spread and self-seeded. Privet was also a convenient and fast-growing hedge. Over time, more ornamental and less utilitarian plants became popular cottage garden hedges, including laurel, lilac, snowberry, japonica, and others.|$|E
5|$|Task Force Kean {{launched}} its attack on August 7, moving out from Masan, but Kean's offensive had collided {{in a meeting}} engagement with one being simultaneously delivered by the North Koreans. Heavy fighting continued {{in the area for}} three days. By August 9, Task Force Kean was poised to retake Chinju. The Americans initially advanced quickly though North Korean resistance was heavy. On August 10, the Marines picked up the advance. However, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was withdrawn from the force on August 12 to be redeployed elsewhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter.</b> Task Force Kean continued forward, capturing the area around Chondong-ni. Eighth Army requested several of its units to redeploy to Taegu to be used elsewhere on the front, particularly at the Naktong Bulge.|$|E

50|$|One {{proof of}} the theorem uses the {{properties}} of Minkowski sums. If K is a body of constant width w, then the Minkowski sum of K and its 180° rotation is a disk with radius w and <b>perimeter</b> 2πw. However, <b>the</b> Minkowski sum acts linearly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeters</b> of convex bodies, so <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of K must be half <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of this disk, which is πw as the theorem states.|$|R
5|$|The geology of the Riverina {{comprises}} several troughs and sedimentary basins. The western Riverina {{is presumed}} to be {{a continuation of the}} Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone while eastern sections are underlain by western portions of the Lachlan Fold Belt. There is potential for the Riverina to host several mineral deposit types including coal, petroleum, coal seam methane, gypsum, orogenic gold, Cobar style polymetallic systems, heavy mineral sands and possibly diamonds in these fold belt rocks and basins. Riverina soils are generally sandy along the river channels, with more saline grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of the floodplain. As the Murrumbidgee passes downstream, the water and soil become more saline.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{fighting}} {{continued in}} the area for three days. By 9 August, Task Force Kean was poised to retake Chinju. The task force, aided by air power, initially advanced quickly though North Korean resistance was heavy. On 10 August, the Marines picked up the advance, inadvertently encountering the North Korean 83rd Motorized Regiment of the 105th Armored Division, which was caught off-guard and attempted to withdraw. F4U Corsairs from the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing strafed the retreating column repeatedly, inflicting 200 casualties and destroying about 100 of the regiment's equipment vehicles, but 1st Provisional Marine Brigade forces were not able to follow up the attack, as they were redeployed elsewhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> on 12 August. Task Force Kean continued forward, supported by field artillery, capturing the area around Chondong-ni. At that time, Eighth Army requested several of its units to redeploy to Taegu to be used elsewhere on the front, particularly at the Naktong Bulge.|$|E
5|$|By 04:00 A Company {{was still}} heavily engaged and the Australians called in {{helicopter}} light-fire teams and C-47 Spooky gunships, which dropped flares continuously from 04:30 {{to illuminate the}} battlefield. By 05:00 the main attack was halted and the North Vietnamese began withdrawing, just as the Australians were beginning to run low on ammunition. During the lull A Company was resupplied by APC, while the Australians pushed an RCL team forward to provide additional support. At 05:15 the North Vietnamese attacked again, targeting the boundary between A and C Companies on {{the northern edge of}} the perimeter, only to be repulsed by mortar fire. Later a two-battalion attack on A, B and C Companies was also turned back. The Australians then counter-attacked with elements of A Company supported by APCs, regaining the lost 3 Platoon section post. Finally, after a six-hour battle the North Vietnamese broke contact at 06:30 and withdrew with their dead and wounded, fighting a series of rearguard actions to prevent follow-up. The Australians also began collecting their casualties for evacuation, while another resupply was completed with APCs. 1 RAR subsequently commenced a clearance of the area, with the four Australian rifle companies patrolling to a depth of , killing one North Vietnamese soldier and capturing another. Five Australians had been killed and 19 wounded, while two US artillerymen were also wounded during the fighting. Only 34 North Vietnamese bodies were counted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> at dawn, however intelligence later indicated that fewer than 100 of the 790 attacking troops had survived unwounded. Meanwhile, in an attempt to disrupt the North Vietnamese withdrawal, Keldie led a troop of cavalry from Coral, engaging a North Vietnamese battalion during a pursuit that lasted until 15:00.|$|E

25|$|Bait tactics {{exploited}} the US focus on body counts and its lavish use of firepower, including relatively ineffective Harassment and Interdiction (H) fire. One related method was {{to occupy a}} hamlet or deploy near it, digging into positions at the treeline <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> of the hamlet for attack or defense. ARVN or US forces would often counterattack by unleashing air and artillery strikes on the community, causing destruction to the persons and property of the civilians {{they were supposed to}} be protecting. The damage done, and protected by their dug-in positions, VC and PAVN fighters melted away at their earliest convenience, later repeating the cycle elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} North Korean armor {{came down the}} trail {{from the north and}} shot up the {{artillery}} positions, enemy infantry closed on the 555th Artillery emplacements and fired on the men with small arms and automatic weapons. Three of the 105mm howitzers managed to continue firing for several hours after daybreak, perhaps until 0900. Then the North Koreans overran the 555th positions. The 90th Field Artillery Battalion suffered almost as great a calamity. Early in the pre-dawn attack, the North Koreans scored direct hits on two 155mm howitzers and several ammunition trucks of A Battery. Only by fighting resolutely as infantrymen, manning the machine guns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> and occupying foxholes as riflemen, were the battalion troops able to repel the North Korean attack.|$|E
25|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>perimeter</b> track, {{visitors}} {{will find a}} grassed area, overlooking the sea, which was the original site of a Ngai Tai pa (see Maori Pa). This grassed area has a deep ditch whose internal bank would have once been much higher and topped with a strong palisade of posts. Ō-Manawatere is a relatively small pā. Maori were building pa (earthwork forts) throughout N.Z. starting from around the 16th century. In total they built about 7,000 mainly in the North Island. Most pa were not permanently lived in, but were built close to kainga (villages) and were designed as safe places in case of attack. The depressions inside the pā are pits, once roofed over and used for storing Kūmara tubers, but now largely infilled but still visible.|$|E
