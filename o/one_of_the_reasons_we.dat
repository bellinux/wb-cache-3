500|$|Fairport Convention {{had been}} invited to Bob Dylan's London music {{publishers}} to hear then-unreleased tracks from The Basement Tapes sessions. The band's bassist, Ashley Hutchings, said [...] "We loved it all. We would have covered all the songs if we could." [...] In the event, versions of [...] "Percy's Song", [...] "Million Dollar Bash" [...] and [...] "If You Gotta Go, Go Now" [...] (retitled [...] "Si Tu Dois Partir") were used on the album. The French lyrics for the latter were created during the interval of a performance at the Middle Earth Club. According to guitarist Simon Nicol: [...] "I think the boredom factor was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> came up with this wacky idea. Three or four punters joined us in the dressing room; they were either French visitors or students of French working in London, and happened to be there that night." [...] "Percy's Song" [...] and [...] "Million Dollar Bash" [...] had never been released before.|$|E

Stories appeared on television news outlets such as CNN, general news magazines such as USA Today, and gay culture magazines such as Out. The modern Katherine [...] "Kate" [...] Kane made her first comic book appearance in issue #7 of the maxi-series 52 (2006), where Kane is revealed to have been romantically involved with Renee Montoya, a former Gotham City Police detective (who later takes up the mantle of the Question after the original hero dies). When questioned about the editorial decision to make Batwoman a gay character in an interview with Wizard Entertainment, DC Comics Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Dan DiDio stated [...] "It was from conversations we’ve had for expanding the DC Universe, for looking at levels of diversity. We wanted to have a cast that is much more reflective of today’s society and even today’s fanbase. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> made her gay is that, again when you have the Batman Family—a series of characters that aren’t super-powered and inhabit the same circle and the same city—you really want to have a point of difference. It was really important to me to make sure every character felt unique." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} {{after the first}} day's shooting, Corbijn told the band about Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia), hardy and twisted plants in the deserts of the American Southwest, and he {{suggested}} their use on the sleeve. Bono was pleased to discover the religious significance of the plant's etymology; according to Mormon legend, early settlers named the plant after the Old Testament prophet Joshua, as the tree's stretching branches reminded them of Joshua raising his hands in prayer. The following day, Bono declared that the album should be titled The Joshua Tree. That morning, while driving on Route 190 near Darwin, they spotted a lone-standing tree in the desert. Corbijn had been {{hoping to find a}} single tree, as he thought it would result in better photographs than if he shot the band amongst a group of trees. They stopped the bus and photographed with the lone plant for about 20 minutes, something the Edge called [...] "fairly spontaneous". Despite shooting in the desert, the group dealt with cold weather during parts of the trip. Bono explained, [...] "it was freezing and we had to take our coats off so it would at least look like a desert. That's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> look so grim." [...] Regarding the serious tone of the images, Corbijn said, [...] "I guess people felt they took themselves too seriously. It was definitely the most serious, I think, that you can photograph a band. You couldn't go any further down that line unless you start photographing graves." ...|$|E

[...] Both lungs together have the same amount of surface area as half of a tennis court. Disease such as, emphysema, tuberculosis, can reduce the amount of surface area and elasticity of the lungs. Another big factor in the elasticity of the lungs is smoking because of the residue left behind in the lungs from the smoking. The elasticity of the lungs can be trained to expand further.|$|E
