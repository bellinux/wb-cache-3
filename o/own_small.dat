The company, through the Society of Friends, also had its <b>own</b> <b>small</b> {{sanatorium}} and convalescent home on Ivythorn Hill overlooking the town. In 1931, the chalet-style building was leased to the Youth Hostel Association and became the first youth hostel in Somerset. It is still used for this purpose.|$|E

40|$|Women <b>owned</b> <b>small</b> {{enterprises}} contribute {{greatly to}} job creation {{and growth of}} economies of different countries. However, they face several constraints including lack of credit. Despite of the large volume of literature on women <b>owned</b> <b>small</b> enterprises; little consideration has been addressed in assessing contribution of credit on their performance. The objective of this study therefore was to assess contribution of credit on performance of women <b>owned</b> <b>small</b> enterprises with special emphasis on Opportunity International (OI). The study {{was carried out in}} Moshi Municipality where a case study design was selected purposively. Fifty (50) main respondents were selected randomly from the group of women who had received credit from OI while 10 key informants were selected purposively. Data for the study were collected using questionnaires, interviews and documentary reviews. Performance of women <b>owned</b> <b>small</b> enterprises was measured using effectiveness, efficient, productivity and profitability. It was concluded that all the five types of women <b>owned</b> <b>small</b> enterprises were effective but only food business was efficient. Rates of productivity for women <b>owned</b> <b>small</b> enterprises with the exception of mobile banking were high. In terms of profitability, only food businesses, retail shops, and selling second hand clothes were profitable. Performance of women <b>owned</b> <b>small</b> enterprises was influenced by: level of education possessed by women entrepreneurs; use of credit from OI; size of households; and number of children in the households...|$|R

5|$|The {{case had}} all the {{elements}} to ignite a fervent popular interest: the wicked squire and the poor girl, the iconic murder scene, the supernatural element of the stepmother's prophetic dreams, the detective work by Ayres and Lea (who later became detective Pharos Lee in stage versions of the events), and Corder's new life which {{was the result of}} a lonely hearts advertisement. As a consequence, the case created its <b>own</b> <b>small</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|There are tragic {{consequences}} one snowy {{night when}} the Castillo brothers' car veers {{off the road and}} into a tree. Cesar, {{in the back seat of}} the vehicle, is barely hurt, but Nestor, having driven the car, is killed. The life of Cesar, shattered, is never the same. To honor his brother's memory, Cesar opens his <b>own</b> <b>small</b> club, which is well received. Delores pays him a visit and asks him to sing Nestor's song for her.|$|E
5|$|British rule {{came at a}} {{price for}} many {{ordinary}} {{people as well as}} traders. The Shetlanders' nautical skills were sought by the Royal Navy: some 3,000 served during the Napoleonic Wars from 1800 to 1815 and press gangs were rife. During this period 120 men were taken from Fetlar alone and only 20 of them returned home. By the late 19th century 90% of all Shetland was owned by just 32 people, and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8,000 Shetlanders emigrated. With the passing of the Crofters' Act in 1886 the Liberal prime minister William Gladstone emancipated crofters from the rule of the landlords. The Act enabled those who had effectively been landowners' serfs to become owner-occupiers of their <b>own</b> <b>small</b> farms.|$|E

5|$|Fame {{does not}} last, however. Nestor {{is not as}} ambitious as his brother and desires {{nothing more than to}} own his <b>own</b> <b>small</b> club. He is in love with Delores, but lacks the passion he felt for his beloved Maria back home. Cesar, meantime, {{suppresses}} his true feelings, that a woman like Delores would actually be perfect for him. Cesar eventually reveals to Nestor that Maria left him for a Cuban mobster in exchange for cancelling a contract hit against Nestor.|$|E
5|$|Scattered evidence, {{including}} the records in Irish annals {{and the images}} of warriors like those depicted on the Pictish stone slabs at Aberlemno, Forfarshire and Hilton of Cadboll in Easter Ross, suggest that in Northern Britain, as in Anglo-Saxon England, society was dominated by a military aristocracy, whose status was dependent in a large part on their ability and willingness to fight. Below {{the level of the}} aristocracy it is assumed that there were non-noble freemen, working their <b>own</b> <b>small</b> farms or holding lands as free tenants. There are no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but codes in Ireland and Wales indicate that freemen had the right to bear arms, represent themselves in law and to receive compensation for murdered kinsmen.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{studied for}} bachelor's and master's degrees in music in Chicago {{before moving to}} New York City in 1946. He played with leading bebop musicians and formed his <b>own</b> <b>small</b> bands, which soon {{displayed}} some of his early interests – contrapuntal interaction of instruments, harmonic flexibility, and rhythmic complexity. His quintet in 1949 recorded the first free group improvisations. Tristano's innovations continued in 1951, with the first overdubbed, improvised jazz recordings, and two years later, when he recorded an atonal improvised solo piano piece {{that was based on}} the development of motifs rather than on harmonies. He developed further via polyrhythms and chromaticism into the 1960s, but was infrequently recorded.|$|E

5|$|Although {{women were}} on a lower social tier than men (according to Confucian ethics), they enjoyed many social and legal {{privileges}} and wielded considerable power {{at home and in}} their <b>own</b> <b>small</b> businesses. As Song society became more and more prosperous and parents on the bride's side of the family provided larger dowries for her marriage, women naturally gained many new legal rights in ownership of property. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without brothers, or a surviving mother without sons, could inherit one-half of her father's share of undivided family property. There were many notable and well-educated women, and it was a common practice for women to educate their sons during their earliest youth. The mother of the scientist, general, diplomat, and statesman Shen Kuo taught him essentials of military strategy. There were also exceptional women writers and poets, such as Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), who became famous even in her lifetime.|$|E
5|$|From the start, one of {{the main}} efforts of the Confederate Navy was to counter the {{blockade}} of its ports by the Union Navy. Mallory believed that by attacking the merchant shipping that carried trade to Northern ports he could force his Union counterpart, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, to divert his <b>own</b> <b>small</b> fleet to defend against the raiders. In {{the early days of the}} war, the Confederacy tried to enlist the services of private shipowners in the service by offering letters of marque and reprisal. Issuance of the letters was not in the purview of the Navy Department, but Mallory was aware of them and saw them as part of his plan. For several reasons, the privateers did not have the success that was hoped for. Although they ventured out throughout the war, they had only fleeting success, and that had ceased by the end of the first year.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox afflicted {{the islands}} in the 17th and 18th centuries, but as {{vaccines}} became common after 1760 the population increased {{to a maximum of}} 31,670 in 1861. However, British rule came at price for many ordinary people as well as traders. The Shetlanders' nautical skills were sought by the Royal Navy. Some 3,000 served during the Napoleonic wars from 1800 to 1815 and press gangs were rife. During this period 120 men were taken from Fetlar alone, and only 20 of them returned home.

The Act enabled those who had effectively been landowners' serfs to become owner-occupiers of their <b>own</b> <b>small</b> farms. By this time fishermen from Holland, who had traditionally gathered each year off the coast of Shetland to fish for herring, triggered an industry in the islands that boomed from around 1880 until the 1920s when stocks of the fish began to dwindle. The production peaked in 1905 at more than a million barrels, of which 708,000 were exported.|$|E

5|$|With even a {{few hundred}} missiles, the Soviets could afford to target every US bomber base. With no warning system in place, a sneak attack could destroy a {{significant}} amount of the US bomber fleet on the ground. The US would still have the airborne alert force and its <b>own</b> <b>small</b> ICBM fleet, but the USSR would have its entire bomber fleet and any missiles they did not launch, leaving them with a massive strategic advantage. To ensure this could not happen, the Report called for the installation of active defenses at SAC bases, Hercules in the short term and an ABM for the 1959 period, along with new early warning radars for ballistic missiles to allow alert aircraft to get away before the missiles hit. Even Zeus would come too late to cover this period, and some consideration was given to an adapted Hercules or a land based version of the Navy's RIM-8 Talos as an interim ABM.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00, {{just before}} dawn, Spragg took {{command of the}} trench in the {{southern}} sector of No.3 Post, opposite where the Turks appeared to be gathering their forces to assault the post. He successfully deployed his men {{so that when the}} attack began, it was met and broken up by the New Zealanders' small arms fire. But by 03:30 the post was under sustained Turkish rifle and grenade attack and the relieving 2nd Squadron was still held up on a ridge to the south of the post. Between them and No.3 Post was a strong Turkish force which had dug in and were in communication with the Turkish attackers in the gully {{to the north of the}} post. However, the 2nd Squadron could now bring their <b>own</b> <b>small</b> arms fire onto the Turks attacking No.3 Post, making them keep their heads down. At daylight Elmslie led a troop in an attack which captured a Turkish trench to the left of the post. At 06:30 communications were re-established with No.3 Post by using signal flags, and Allied artillery were able to bring harassing fire onto the Turkish communications trenches. But by now the defenders were running short of supplies, especially ammunition, and no one could be spared to look after the wounded, who had to see to themselves.|$|E
