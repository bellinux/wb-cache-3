50|$|<b>Overcast</b> <b>stitches</b> may be reversible, as {{when they}} are used to join {{together}} crochet block pieces of afghan blankets. There are several different kinds of <b>overcast</b> <b>stitches.</b> A straight <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> is used for finishing edges in eyelets and cutwork fabric. A blanket stitch, used to finish edges of wool blankets, is another common <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In embroidery, an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> is {{a raised}} line stitch used on even-weave fabrics. It is {{commonly}} used for outlining designs. There are two methods of creating an embroidered <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch.</b> In one method, a line is stitched to create padding, then another thread covers the padding stitches in small stitches {{at right angles to}} the padding stitches. The other method is called detached <b>overcast</b> <b>stitching,</b> and involves two alternating padding stitches that pick up the fabric, followed by <b>overcast</b> <b>stitches</b> that cover the padding stitches without picking up the fabric.|$|R

5000|$|The hand <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> {{involves}} small diagonal stitches evenly spaced out enclosing {{the fabric}} raw edge.To create an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> by sewing machine, {{we can use}} an overcast foot, though a regular foot also can be used. The overcast foot has an edge guide which helps the fabric to feed evenly along the edge and a bar in the middle that controls the stitch and makes it lay nice and flat.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} styles of hems of varying complexities. The most common hem folds up a cut edge, folds it up again, and then sew it down. The style of hemming thus completely encloses the cut edge in cloth, so that it cannot unravel. Other hem styles use fewer folds. One of the simplest hems encloses the edge of cloth with a stitch without any folds at all, using a method called an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch,</b> although an <b>overcast</b> <b>stitch</b> {{may be used to}} finish a folded [...] "plain hem" [...] as well.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The major {{purposes}} of the research were {{to determine whether there}} were significant differences in breaking strength and elongation of the following types of seams in a polyester double-knit fabric: 1. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with threads of (a) mercerized cotton, (b) core-spun polyester/cotton, and (c) bonded nylon monocord. 2. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with (a) a narrow zigzag stitch, (b) a lockstitch made while stretching the fabric, and (c) an elastic straight <b>stitch.</b> 3. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> (a) parallel to the wales and (b) parallel to the courses. 4. <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with settings of (a) 9 stitches per inch, (b) 12 stitches per inch, and (c) 15 stitches per inch. Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun thread produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed with polyester/cotton core-spun thread also tended to exhibit greater seam breaking strength and elongation than those seamed with bonded nylon monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than either of the other <b>stitch</b> types. Most <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean seam breaking strength and elongation than comparable <b>seams</b> <b>stitched</b> with the zigzag stitch, <b>Stitch</b> length affected <b>seam</b> breaking strength and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in seam breaking strength and elongation. With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater breaking strength and elongation. Seams parallel to the courses were related to greater seam breaking strength and elongation than seams parallel to the wales...|$|R

40|$|Mining Couture' {{emerges from}} Barber Swindells' (Claire Barber and Steve Swindells collaboration) {{commission}} at the Leicester County Council Snibston Discovery Museum, UK, {{as part of}} the Transform regeneration programme. Throughout the commission Barber Swindells worked across the Snibston site where links to other collections were established including those at the National Coalmining Museum in Wakefield. By juxtaposing the fabrics and material processes of coal-mining and fashion, and their respective site-specific and non-site specific natures, the project reveals the rich collisions between contrary worlds. This is further explored by situating functionally ambiguous and ephemeral artefacts within the hard and utilitarian landscape of industrial production. The arrangement, moreover, provided the context for reframing metaphorical relationships between coal-mining and fashion; between the macro-scale of the geological seam, managed and exploited for its material resources (through engineering operations) and the micro-scale of the <b>stitched</b> <b>seam,</b> whose tightness, looseness, slackness (or frayed condition) affords varied natures of the fashioned garment. The outcome of this archive-driven process resulted in an inflatable sculpture based on a Snibston ventilation fan (made by an inflatable âbouncy castleâ business - KLC Castles), adaptions of an original âPit Brow Lassâ work-wear and an artistâs book Mining Couture, Black Dog, London, [paperback ISBN 9781907317927; 143 pages]...|$|R
