5|$|Hastert {{suffers from}} {{diabetes}} and requires daily insulin injections. Because of his condition, he sometimes walked with protective coverings <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> to avoid foot problems.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{days before}} the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, while {{training}} in Debre Zeit, Abebe began to feel pain. He {{was brought to the}} hospital and diagnosed with acute appendicitis, and had an appendectomy on September 16. Back <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> in a few days, Abebe left the hospital within a week.|$|E
5|$|Petey Williams, who was {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, defended the TNA X Division Championship against A.J. Styles in the following bout. Williams retained the championship in the match by jumping off of the top rope and landing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> with Styles' head between his legs, connecting with the Canadian Destroyer. Williams followed by pinning Styles to win the encounter.|$|E
50|$|Curry again {{underwent}} surgery <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> in May 2008 {{and missed the}} team's first mandatory minicamp on June 3-5.|$|R
2500|$|... 8 July 1979: A British {{soldier was}} killed in an IRA bomb attack <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> patrol in Crossmaglen, County Armagh.|$|R
50|$|Hoogs had his leg amputated in 1968, after {{developing}} a malignant growth <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> The cancer claimed {{his life in}} 1978.|$|R
5|$|The 1931 {{season was}} Hornsby's last as a {{full-time}} player. Boils <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> bothered him during {{the start of the}} 1932 season, and he did not play his first game until May29. Hornsby played right field from May29 to June10, appeared in two games as a pinch hitter, played third base from July14 through July18, and played one last game as a Cub when he pinch-hit on July31.|$|E
5|$|The pilot lay flat on {{the lower}} wing, as planned, to reduce {{aerodynamic}} drag. As a glide ended, the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through {{an opening in the}} wing and land <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> with his arms wrapped over the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.|$|E
5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded {{a little}} by two other ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by his rivals against stronger opposition. He weighs 200 pounds, is tremendously fast, and a hardy, defensive player. On attack {{he is able}} to pick the forward pass out of the air on the full run, and, running with a high-knee action quite like that of the redoubtable Ted Coy, if he cannot get by his man, runs him down and goes on over him, still <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
50|$|That evening, {{the nurse}} comes by to check <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> {{and have it}} treatedâ€”the first of such a series of twice-daily visits. Only some days later does <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> become any better.|$|R
60|$|He shook {{himself and}} glided {{back to the}} hut. Just as {{he was at the}} window he felt a touch <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R
60|$|Tristan {{suddenly}} trod <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> {{as a sign}} of silence, as a step {{descended the}} stairs, and Sir Eustace stood before them.|$|R
5|$|Considerably {{shorter than}} the average footballer at 5ft 7in, Gibbs made up for his {{physical}} disadvantage with positional play, determination, accurate tackling, and staying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> Although a defender, his lack of goals (7 in 491 appearances) and reluctance to get forward were often remarked upon. Gibbs refuted the suggestion that he didn't attack enough, while former managers Roeder and Taylor both considered Gibbs to be an excellent crosser of the ball when he did venture forward. He scored his first professional goal during his 59th game. By comparison, Gibbs' long-term successor at right-back, Lloyd Doyley, scored his first professional goal on his 269th appearance.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{graduated}} from Harvard Law School in 1896 {{at the age}} of 24. He returned to Albany to live with his mother and aunt, and started work for the law firm in which an uncle, Matthew Hale, was a partner. Hale's unexpected death a few months later obliged Hand to move to a new firm, but by 1899, he had become a partner. He had difficulty attracting his own clients, however, and found the work trivial and dull. Much of his time was spent researching and writing briefs, with few opportunities for the appellate work he preferred. His early courtroom appearances, when they came, were frequently difficult, sapping his fragile self-confidence. He began to fear that he lacked the ability to think <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> in court.|$|E
5|$|Just a {{week after}} {{defeating}} Williams, a rematch was announced between Dyer and Holland. The fight venue was Rushcutters Bay Stadium in Sydney and both fighters turned out for a training exhibition in the build-up to the contest. The contest, held on 5 June 1915, was watched by a crowd of 2,000 spectators. The fight went the full distance and in the closing rounds Holland, realising that his only chance of victory was a knockout, attacked Dyer ferociously, staggering the Welshman in the 19th. Despite the late assault, Dyer stayed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and was announced the winner by the referee.|$|E
50|$|Bodacious died in 2000 when a cut <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> {{caused a}} bone infection. The {{medication}} used to counteract it caused his kidneys to fail.|$|R
50|$|Sandy takes Robert's body to a lake. As Sandy {{throws the}} {{weighted}} body overboard, a rope catches <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> and he {{falls into the}} lake and dies.|$|R
50|$|Tancredo later {{claimed that}} {{a police officer}} accidentally broke Tancredo's middle toe by stomping <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> as the officer {{attempted}} to escort the speaker through a crowd of protesters.|$|R
5|$|Larry Purvis (Leland Orser) {{is a test}} subject who is kidnapped as an {{incubator}} for the facehuggers. After he is impregnated and rescued, Call {{offers to}} bring him along so he can be frozen and the Alien embryo surgically extracted later. On the Betty, the survivors are ambushed and held at gunpoint by Dr. Wren when Purvis goes into convulsions. He staggers over to Wren, who shoots him. Purvis stays <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and overpowers Wren, pulling the scientist's head to his chest. The Alien erupts through Purvis' rib cage and Wren's head, killing them both.|$|E
5|$|Moe's idea {{involved}} {{setting his}} bar on fire, which {{he ends up}} doing by accident as he realizes Renee has left. Meanwhile, Homer escapes jail by attacking Hans Moleman, who was delivering books to the inmates. He enters the burning bar to confront Moe, and the two start fighting. They are both soon rendered unconscious from smoke inhalation, but Barney appears and rescues them. The bar is completely destroyed, and during their reconciliation Homer promises to help Moe get back <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> In the final scene, Homer has allowed Moe to relocate his bar to the Simpsons' home.|$|E
5|$|Setting {{up her own}} {{publishing}} house Marsden House, Karen is relying on useless Ramona as personal assistant. Adam is determined to take things one step further with Tina so they can move in with one another, though she doesn't want to rush things and especially not with David now living with Adam and Matthew following his divorce from Robyn. Pete has landed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> as a chauffeur, and Jenny is finding herself seeing a lot less of her husband. Matthew's relationship with Olivia is taken to the next level, to the shock of Karen and Adam.|$|E
50|$|Lynch broke <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> playing rugby aged {{sixteen and}} was then {{diagnosed}} with a spinal tumour. The tumour was removed but the cast was placed too tightly <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> and caused tissue damage, and his left leg had to be amputated below the knee.|$|R
50|$|Following an {{operation}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> Somerset cricketer Ian Botham mistakenly {{walked into a}} children's ward at Musgrove Park. He gives this as his inspiration for raising millions of pounds for leukaemia charities.|$|R
50|$|When {{someone once}} {{inadvertently}} sat down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> {{although it was}} quite painful, he allowed the person {{to sit there and}} said nothing. This was one of the ways he worked <b>on</b> perfecting <b>his</b> tolerance.|$|R
5|$|Starting {{with a case}} of {{shingles}} in February 1981, Bobbi Campbell {{suffered a}} succession of unusual illnesses, including leukopenia later that summer. After hiking the Pinnacles National Monument with his boyfriend in September that year, he noticed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), then {{thought of as a}} rare cancer of elderly Jewish men but with alarming numbers of cases appearing in California and New York and now known to be closely associated with AIDS. He was formally diagnosed as having KS by dermatologist Marcus Conant on October 8, 1981. This would become Conant's first diagnosis of a patient with what would become known as AIDS; Campbell brought Conant a rose every year to commemorate the anniversary of his diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{person was}} first whipped, or beaten, with virgis sanguinis ("blood-colored rods", probably), {{and his head}} was clad/covered in a bag made of a wolf's hide. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> were placed clogs, or wooden shoes, and he was then put into the poena cullei, a sack made of ox-leather. Placed along with him into the sack was also an {{assortment}} of live animals, arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent, a cock, a monkey and a dog. The sack was put on a cart, and the cart driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea. Then, the sack with its inhabitants was thrown into the water.|$|E
5|$|Louisville {{took over}} on offense needing {{to get a}} {{touchdown}} to regain a lead before the waning clock finally ran out of time. After the Tech kickoff and a touchback, the Cardinals took over at their 20-yard line. Michael Bush ran for 10yards and a first down, and Hunter Cantwell scrambled for six more on a rushing play. Facing third down and needing four yards, Cantwell dropped back to pass for the first down. As the pass soared through the air, Tech defender James Anderson jumped and caught the ball, intercepting it. Still <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> Anderson quickly rushed the other way and, unimpeded, ran 39yards {{into the end zone}} for a Virginia Tech touchdown. The score and extra point energized Virginia Tech's offense and defense and gave the Hokies an 11-point leadâ€”35â€“24â€”with 4:45 remaining in the game.|$|E
5000|$|The nursery rhyme {{was very}} popular before the twentieth century, and was sung {{every day by}} William Ewart Gladstone to his {{children}} as they had [...] "rides <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> slung over <b>his</b> knee".|$|R
6000|$|BURKE--[To Anna, with a wink.] You'll not be lonesome long. I'll see to that, {{with the}} help of God. 'Tis himself here will be having a {{grandchild}} to ride <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> I'm telling you! ...|$|R
60|$|The sturdy {{man with}} the fair shaggy locks was Leif, the son of Eric the Red of Iceland. The boy with the silken curls, who rode <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> so joyously, was his son Olaf.|$|R
5|$|On 14 February in Vikersund, Prevc won {{the event}} despite sliding upon landing (he {{remained}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> nevertheless), which rarely happens in ski jumping. By winning the second event in Almaty on 28 February, Prevc secured his first World Cup title, six events {{before the end}} of the season. At the end of the season, Prevc broke several statistical records. He won the highest number of points, victories, and podium finishes in a single season (2303 points, 15 victories and 22 podiums in total, the previous records being 2083 points, 13 victories, and 20 podiums by Gregor Schlierenzauer from the 2008/09 season). Other records include the point difference between the first and the second in the overall standings (813), the best average of points per event (79.4), and the highest number of points in the Four Hills Tournament (1139.4). By winning the ski flying title, Prevc became the first ski jumper to win the title for three years in a row.|$|E
5|$|Once there, {{they are}} {{introduced}} to and begin {{to stay at the}} guesthouse of Kodandaram, an avid hunter, the neighbor and friend of Diganth's grandfather. Kodandaram, now handicapped from a hunting accident and confined to a wheelchair, lives with his wife Padma, daughter-in-law Sowmya, and daughters Radha and Pavani. Sowmya is widowed and teaches the village children; Radha, a student of Ayurveda, practices it alongside looking over the family's farming land; and Pavani is a student doing her pre-university course. Ganesh, a foodie, is fascinated with learning of Kodandaram's hunting spoils and persuades him to join them in hunting the very wild boar that left his legs crippled two years ago. At the forest, Kodandaram accidentally shoots Diganth in the chest, but is saved by a gong he had worn around his neck. They embark on another and final venture to kill the boar. As the boar approaches a rifle-wielding and wheelchair-bound Kodandaram, he gets up <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> as an impulse and refuses to shoot it, thankful for bringing him back to his feet again, and calls it an incarnation of varaha.|$|E
5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E
