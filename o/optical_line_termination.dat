50|$|The passive {{optical network}} (PON) uses tree-like network {{topology}}. Due to the topology of PON, the transmission modes for downstream (that is, from <b>optical</b> <b>line</b> <b>termination,</b> (OLT) to optical network unit (ONU)) and upstream (that is, from ONU to OLT) are different. For the downstream transmission, the OLT broadcasts optical signal to all the ONUs in continuous mode (CM), that is, the downstream channel always has optical data signal. One given ONU can find which frame in the CM stream is for it by reading the header of the frame. However, in the upstream channel, ONUs can not transmit optical data signal in CM. It is because that all the signals transmitted from the ONUs converge (with attenuation) into one fiber by the power splitter (serving as power coupler), and overlap among themselves if CM is used. To solve this problem, burst mode (BM) transmission is adopted for upstream channel. The given ONU only transmits optical packet when it is allocated a time slot {{and it needs to}} transmit, and all the ONUs share the upstream channel in the time division multiple access (TDMA) mode. The phases of the BM optical packets received by the OLT are different from packet to packet, since the ONUs are not synchronized to transmit optical packet in the same phase, and the distance between OLT and given ONU are random. In order to compensate the phase variation from packet to packet, burst mode clock and data recovery (BM-CDR) is required. Such circuit can generate local clock with the frequency and phase same as the individual received optical packet in a short locking time, for example within 40 ns. Such generated local clock can in turn perform correct data decision. Above all, the clock and data recovery can be performed correctly after a short locking time.|$|E

40|$|Time {{division}} {{multiple access}} (TDMA) multiplexing of ATM cells from thousands of residential customers toward the common feeder of a Passive Optical Network (SuperPON) tree obviates {{the need for an}} equal number of <b>optical</b> <b>line</b> <b>terminations</b> (OLT's). All upstream transmissions converge by means of the passive splitters/combiners to just one OLT unit which serves all by time sharing. The ability to reach such a high splitting ratio became possible by the development of bursty mode optical amplifiers (OA's). In addition, OA's make possible a 100 -km-long feeder which can bypass the local exchange into the first core switch, bringing further savings to both initial and running costs. These techniques allow SuperPON's to lower the access cost per customer, holding for the promise of ushering into domestic local loops the photonics revolution which has already transformed the transmission plant. These savings, however, can only be realized under the assumption that the system can accept high loading before exceeding the limits of quality of service (QoS) requirements and without distorting the egress traffic in a way that jeopardizes the statistical estimates on which ATM connection acceptance was based. Solutions to the problem of traffic arbitration, respecting the idiosyncrasies of each traffic class and suitable for fast implementation, are offered in this work...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOptical access {{technologies}} allow {{service providers}} to propose high bandwidth services {{in both directions}} (upstream and downstream) and thus to develop values added services. Passive Optical Network (PON) technologies offer, in the upstream, a controlled access to a shared media. Dedicated control mechanisms to the upstream channel have been proposed by ITU-T for Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (G-PON) and 10 Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (XG-PON 1). Such mechanisms rely on Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) procedures that manage bandwidth allocation according to customers requirements. This paper focuses on comparing two such DBA algorithms: Status Reporting (SR) in which the customer explicitly reports its backlog, and Non Status Reporting (NSR) in which the <b>Optical</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Termination</b> (OLT) infers customers' requirements by assessing how previously allocated resources were used.

The daily usage patterns and the ever-growing bandwidth demand in access require a transport {{technology that is}} dynamically operated and {{that is based on}} wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). FlexPON is designed to meet those requirements: it combines a reconfigurable WDM layer with 2 ̆ 2 on-demand 2 ̆ 2 time division multiple access (TDMA) and wavelength-agnostic optical networking units (ONUs).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to provide applicability of the Access Node Control Mechanism to broadband access based on Passive Optical Networks (PONs).

The Access Node Control Mechanism is also extended for interaction between components of the Access Node Complex (OLT and ONT). The Access Node Control Mechanism will ensure that the transmission of information between the NAS and Access Node Complex (ANX) and between the OLT and ONT within an ANX does not need to go through distinct element managers but rather uses direct device-to-device communication and stays on net.

40|$|The copy {{of record}} is {{available}} at IET Digital Library: [URL] Copyright IET [Full text {{of this paper is}} not available in the UHRA]The Gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON) has become an attractive and promising solution for the broadband access network. In this paper a novel dynamic bandwidth assignment protocol is proposed to both facilitate the efficient sharing of the upstream channel resource and support differentiated services over GPON. A new concept for the optical network unit bandwidth reporting procedure is developed instead of the conventional reporting of current queue status. The development of a balance transferring enables a bandwidth register and transfer mechanism in which the reported but bandwidth-unassigned requirements from previous allocations can be tracked and manipulated at the <b>optical</b> <b>line</b> <b>termination.</b> Dynamic bandwidth compensation is achieved through the balance transferring mechanism. The combination of the new reporting procedure and the balance transferring mechanism is incorporated into a prioritised resource allocation to accommodate differentiated services.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for understanding competition and industry structure {{in the context of}} Fiber to the Home (FTTH). We present engineering cost models, which indicate that FTTH is a decreasing cost industry, thereby making facilities based competition an unlikely outcome. Non-facilities based competition (or service level competition) in FTTH can happen in data-link layer (or transport) services via unbundled dark fiber (i. e. unbundled network elements) and in higher layer (voice, video and data) services via logical layer unbundling (or open access). FTTH architectures differ in {{the extent to which they}} support unbundling and therefore the extent of non-facilities based competition in FTTH depends on the architecture of the shared network over which multiple service providers offer service. Among the four different FTTH architectures considered, the curbside single-wavelength Passive Optical Network architecture (PON) (that has isolated pole-mounted splitters) has the most economical fiber plant but permits unbundling only at the logical layer. Physical plant unbundling is made possible in PONs by establishing Optimal Fiber Aggregation Points (OFAPs) that aggregate multiple splitters (and hence multiple distribution fibers or homes). Unbundling is achieved at the cost of longer distribution loop lengths (vis-à-vis a curbside PON). OFAP architectures further lead to higher utilization of splitter and <b>Optical</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Termination</b> (OLT) ports in markets that have less than 100 % penetration, lowers NPV Capital Costs and provides the service provider with a real option to (i) defer investment in OLT ports (ii) deploy multiple data-link layer technologies and (iii) effectively phase in new technologies- under both monopoly and competition...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors present the latest {{results of the}} MUSE project with respect to highbandwidth optical access. The project {{partners}} represented by the authors have developed three different optical access solutions during the project period. First, a hierarchical coarse wavelength division multiplex (CWDM) based ring network, which not only provides high-bandwidth FttX connectivity, but also acts as integrating feeder network for other First Mile Access technologies like those described thereafter. The system, comprising a 10 km feeder area ring (FAR) carrying CWDM signals and a bandwidth-sharing distribution area ring (DAR) is able to provide protected connectivity to about 1800 end-users. Second, an analogue very high bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) over optics system, which transmits VDSL signals over an optical carrier by means of sub-carrier multiplexing. Transmission of DSL signals over optical fibre is a potential method for extending the range of high bandwidth DSL signals, such as VDSL, far beyond that possible in copper. The VDSL over optics (VDSLoO) system is capable of carrying multiple channels between <b>Optical</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Termination</b> (OLT) and Optical network Unit (ONU). Third, a system concept for Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), {{which is based on}} a Radio over Fibre (RoF) system using the Optical Frequency Multiplication (OFM) method.

40|$|The Broadband {{photonics}} (BBP) project {{under the}} Freeband consortium of projects investigated {{the design of}} a dynamically reconfigurable photonic access network. Access networks form a key link in ensuring optimal bandwidth to the end user without which any improvements deeper in the network in the aggregation or core segments are mitigated. Optical fiber deployment in the access are a natural choice as the bandwidth de- mands increase and Passive Optical Networks (PONs) form a preferred way of im- plementing fiber deployments. PONs have a logical Point to Multi-Point (P 2 MP) topology where in the downstream, the <b>Optical</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Termination</b> (OLT) broad- casts to all Optical Network Units (ONUs) while in the upstream, it is a many-to- one transmission and is contention based. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) ac- cess is one way of arbitration and in this thesis a qualitative analysis and comparison of the leading TDM based PON standards- EPON and GPON is presented. In traditional PONs, the average bandwidth available per user depends on the num- ber of ONUs supported by a single OLT. Typically the OLT-ONU association is fixed. The BBP network concept extends the view of a fiber plant deployment to a stack of logical PONs where multiple wavelength pairs are used to support a number of "logical" PONs. In this network, a headend based OLT transmits the down- stream data by modulating a C-Band, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDM) laser. In addition it transmits the light of a Continuous Wave (CW) DWDM laser, also in the C-Band, which is modulated with data by a Reflective Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (RSOA) in an ONU and used for upstream communication. The ONUs are thus wavelength agnostic. The OLT-ONU association is thus dynamic and depends on the wavelength pair added/dropped towards the ONU. The bandwidth availability to an end user can be optimised on an inter-PON basis. The research work focuses on the techniques to realise the bandwidth optimisation using Linear Programming techniques and de- scribes the service delivery architecture that can be realised to ensure an optical ser- vice delivery to the end user using conventional protocols of operation.
