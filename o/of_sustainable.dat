5|$|In ecology, {{sustainability}} (from sustain and ability) is {{the property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples <b>of</b> <b>sustainable</b> biological systems. In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture. Sustainability science is the study <b>of</b> <b>sustainable</b> development and environmental science.|$|E

5|$|Passing {{north of}} Rodrigues Island on March30, Hudah {{produced}} moderate winds, though effects to infrastructure and crops {{on the island}} were minimal. During {{the night of the}} following day, Hudah passed near the Saint Brandon archipelago. A weather station on the island maintained by the Maritius Meteorological Services reported a minimum pressure of roughly 996mbar (hPa; 29.42inHg) and a maximum sustained wind measurement of 70km/h (45mph). During the night of April1, the cyclone passed approximately 35km (20mi) south of Tromelin Island, producing strong winds. A Météo-France station on the isle recorded sustained winds of 125km/h (80mph) and a gust of 180km/h (110mph). A minimum pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg) was also recorded. Due to a lack <b>of</b> <b>sustainable</b> infrastructure on the latter two islands, damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Sustainable use of {{materials}} has targeted {{the idea of}} dematerialization, converting the linear path {{of materials}} (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by product stewardship and {{the increasing use of}} material flow analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use <b>of</b> <b>sustainable</b> biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} an {{important}} need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological imperatives of development in the context of tourism enterprises, there is the key question of implementation and how the idea <b>of</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourism enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E
