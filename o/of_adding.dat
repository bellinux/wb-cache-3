5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> weight to the ship.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, {{two years before}} US13 had been {{completed}} as a four-lane divided highway from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the divided highway south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or Delmar (US13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred {{due to lack of}} funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state. Instead <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> divided highway in southern Delaware, DSHD needed to resolve the problem of the deterioration of 15- to 25-year-old concrete roads, such as those along the DuPont Highway. The department planned to address the issue by patching the concrete surface as needed, adding concrete shoulders, and applying a layer of bituminous concrete, more commonly known as asphalt concrete or blacktop, over the entire width of concrete to provide a wearing surface.|$|E

30|$|For the {{regression}} containing only red AOC wines, {{the addition of}} SO 2 for Demeter wines has {{a positive effect on}} price that just outweighs the negative base effect <b>of</b> <b>added</b> SO 2. Consumers of Demeter and Biodyvin wines likely differ in their valuation <b>of</b> <b>added</b> SO 2. Lastly, the interaction between added SO 2 and intended cellaring length is statistically significant and positive in {{the regression}}s containing all non-AOC wines and only red AOC wines. 8 The AOC and Non-AOC columns of Table  6 show the intended cellaring lengths at which the effect <b>of</b> <b>added</b> SO 2 becomes positive. Notably, the cellaring length at which the value <b>of</b> <b>added</b> SO 2 becomes positive is relatively high for rosé and white AOC wines certified by Biodyvin. For Biodyvin wines, there is a large negative effect <b>of</b> <b>added</b> SO 2 (Table  9). Additionally, the marginal effect of an extra year of cellaring time is small for these wines, while it is larger for red AOC wines. With a small marginal effect, it takes more years for the value <b>of</b> <b>added</b> SO 2 to become positive (Table  6).|$|R
40|$|Viewed {{from the}} {{technical}} angle, labour and energy {{may be considered}} the basic resources for production. Methods to compute the requirement of energy and labour for the production processes from raw material to the product at the farm gate are discussed. It is shown that limited amounts <b>of</b> <b>added</b> energy and labour are required to achieve the maximum possible production per hectare. The form of the functions that relate the requirement for these resources {{with the level of}} production is considered in two limiting situations. These concern the minimum amount <b>of</b> <b>added</b> labour that is required when energy is abundantly available and the minimum amount <b>of</b> <b>added</b> energy that is required when labour is abundantly available. By means of these functions and the added energy and added labour used in the actual farm situation, iso-yield functions are constructed. These functions identify the possibilities for substitution of energy and labour during the production process at various yield levels. The shape of the expansion paths indicate {{that there may be a}} considerable range of production situations where the yield per unit <b>of</b> <b>added</b> energy, the yield per unit <b>of</b> <b>added</b> labour and the yield per unit of surface increase with increasing use <b>of</b> <b>added</b> labour and energy per hectare, whereas the added energy use per unit <b>of</b> <b>added</b> labour decreases at the same time.

40|$|Aim of the study: The aim of {{this thesis}} is to, from a {{theoretical}} and empirical point of view, critically analyze the Swedish recommendations used by the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency, {{when it comes to}} the use <b>of</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>added</b> life years in economic evaluations of health care. Introduction: One much-debated subject is the cost <b>of</b> <b>added</b> life years. Costs <b>of</b> <b>added</b> life years refer to the consumption subtracted by the production during the extra years that an individual lives due to a lifesaving intervention or drug. Discussion: If following a societal perspective in health economic evaluations all costs and benefits should be included, together with costs <b>of</b> <b>added</b> life years. Thereafter, the additional principles should be implemented in the decision together with ethical viewpoints. Conclusions: Many theoretical arguments exist for the inclusion <b>of</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>added</b> life years if following a societal perspective. The current estimates for these costs need to be updated and re-estimated. The labor market structure and consumption of pharmaceuticals has changed since the numbers were calculated and uncertainty should be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Consumption <b>of</b> <b>added</b> sugars in Canada {{is often}} {{reported}} {{to be higher than}} data suggest. Both popular and scientific articles often incorrectly report unadjusted national food supply (availability) data as actual consumption data. Additionally, when describing Canadian eating habits, US data is often cited. This does not provide an accurate reflection of Canadian consumption patterns, as Canadian intakes of many foods and beverages containing added sugars are substantially below US levels (1). Misinformation about added sugars consumption may be linked to complications associated with their estimation. Such difficulties include estimating waste adjustment factors to determine apparent consumption from food availability data; missing availability data for some sources <b>of</b> <b>added</b> sugars (notably corn sweeteners); and the lack of a comprehensive database <b>of</b> <b>added</b> sugars content in foods. In this article, the available literature and various reports are used to provide the best estimates <b>of</b> <b>added</b> sugars consumption in Canada.

This added executive boxes, office space and hospitality suites. A further series of developments {{was started in}} the early 1990s to increase capacity to over 50,000. Murray commissioned architect Gareth Hutchison {{to find a way}} <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> a third tier to the Main Stand. This was a highly complex process, as the Main Stand facade had become a listed building and Murray wanted the existing structure to remain open during construction. The contractors removed the original roof and added a temporary cover while the work carried on above. The Club Deck, which cost approximately £20 million, was opened with a league match against Dundee United in December 1991. The redevelopment of the Main Stand was partially financed by a Football Trust grant of £2 million and a debenture issue that raised £8.5 million. Ordinary fans bought debentures for between £1,000 and £1,650 each, which guaranteed the right to buy season tickets for at least 30 years, along with some other minor benefits.|$|E
5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> to the word of God and noted {{that there is no}} law forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by denying that the water of baptism can have the power to wash away sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be a pledge or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is a pledge to live without sin, noting that such a pledge brings back the hypocrisy of legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were no women at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on original sin, Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12–14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E
5|$|In January 1867, Congressman Stevens {{introduced}} legislation {{to dissolve the}} Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under martial law. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion of the process <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to {{a modified version of}} the amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.|$|E

Notter convinced Amtrak to agree to a 20-year lease for part of the station at $45,000 annually, thus giving the group a stronger negotiating point. After eighteen months of negotiations, Union Station Associates purchased the building on July 24, 1975, effectively saving the station. The group paid only the cost of the underlying land, $11,400 – the same figure Scheetz initially offered two years before.|$|E
