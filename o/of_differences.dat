5|$|Bellona {{opened fire}} on Corageux while Brilliant engaged Maliceuse and Hermione. Through {{skillful}} sailing, Logie {{was able to keep}} both French frigates at bay and unable to assist Courageux, which surrendered to Bellona after ninety minutes of fighting. At 7.30 a.m. Maliceuse and Hermione made sail and retreated, with Brilliant too damaged to give chase. British losses in the battle numbered six killed and 28 wounded on Bellona and five killed and 16 wounded on Brilliant. On the French side, losses on Courageux alone were 240 killed and 110 wounded. Historian William Laird Clowes has suggested that the much higher French casualty rate was the result <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> in tactics, with the French gun crews trained to fire at the masts and rigging of an enemy ship in order to disable them ahead of a boarding attempt. By contrast, British crews were trained to fire into the hulls of enemy ships.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended {{to be in charge of}} the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> in production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E

5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus quagga by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described on the basis <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. Some authors have described the quagga {{as a kind of}} wild horse rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has been pointed out that early morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E

This program was instantly rejected by many landowners, and the negotiations were ended through a decision taken by Heliade Rădulescu, when it was again decided that the ultimate resolution was a prerogative of the future Assembly. The failure to address this most significant of the problems faced by Wallachians contributed to weakening support for the revolutionary cause.|$|E

The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage.

The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> {{in the degree of}} financial integration among the country groups analyzed.

The central problems are to determine which groups contain a linking system <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> sets, and how large such a system can be. All previous results are constructive, and are restricted to 2 -groups. We make a connection to Kerdock sets which leads to large linking systems <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> sets in elementary abelian $ 2 $-groups. We use an elementary projection argument to show that neither the McFarland/Dillon nor the Spence construction <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> sets can give rise to a linking system <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> sets in non-$ 2 $-groups. We give a new construction for linking systems <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> sets in 2 -groups, taking advantage of a previously unrecognized connection with group difference matrices. This construction simplifies and extends prior results, producing larger linking systems than before in certain 2 -groups, new linking systems in other 2 -groups for which no system was previously known, and the first known examples in nonabelian groups.
