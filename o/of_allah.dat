5|$|In April 1969 or February 1970, the High Prosecutor's {{office in}} Medan filed charges against Jassin, {{charging}} him with blasphemy {{after he was}} unwilling to divulge Kipandjikusmin's true name. At trial, Jassin argued that, as the story {{was a product of}} the author's imagination, it should not be considered an insult to Islam; he also cited physical descriptions <b>of</b> <b>Allah</b> from the Quran and Sufi literature, as well as the writer's Christian influences. A witness for the prosecution, noted ulama and writer Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah (Hamka), testified that a depiction <b>of</b> <b>Allah</b> wearing glasses implied that Allah was imperfect, as opposed to the personifications cited by Jassin, which were based on man's love for Allah. Hamka later stated that nobody had been able to incite hatred against Muhammad like Kipandjikusmin since the Crusades. Jassin was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Malaysia in 2007 outlawed {{usage of the}} term Allah in any other but Muslim contexts, but the Malayan High Court in 2009 revoked the law, ruling that it was unconstitutional. While Allah had been used for the Christian God in Malay {{for more than four}} centuries, the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage <b>of</b> <b>Allah</b> by the Roman Catholic newspaper The Herald. The government appealed the court ruling, and the High Court suspended implementation of its verdict until the appeal was heard. In October 2013, the court ruled in favor of the government's ban. In early 2014, the Malaysian government confiscated more than 300 bibles for using the word to refer to the Christian God in Peninsular Malaysia. However, the use <b>of</b> <b>Allah</b> is not prohibited in the two Malaysian state of Sabah and Sarawak. The main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long-established and local Alkitab (Bibles) have been widely distributed freely in East Malaysia without restrictions for years. Both states also do not have similar Islamic state laws as those in West Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|Kwee Tek Hoay {{received}} numerous {{letters from}} fans <b>of</b> <b>Allah</b> jang Palsoe, spurring {{him to continue}} writing. Considering the play too difficult for native troupes to stage, when one such troupe, the Union Dalia Opera, requested permission to perform it, Kwee Tek Hoay instead wrote a new story for them. This later became his best-selling novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang). Another of Kwee Tek Hoay's stage dramas, Korbannja Kong-Ek, {{was inspired by a}} friend, who wrote him a letter asking for another comforting and educational play after reading Allah jang Palsoe.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and {{the other}} prophets of Islam, bored of living in jannah (heaven) and weary of singing the praises <b>of</b> <b>Allah,</b> request {{permission}} to return to Earth. Disappointed by the prophets' request, Allah calls on Muhammad {{to explain why he}} wishes to return, as Allah had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{reaction}} {{ranged from}} those believing in literal creation from the Quran to many educated Muslims who subscribed to {{a version of}} theistic or guided evolution in which the Quran reinforced rather than contradicted mainstream science. This occurred relatively early, as medieval madrasahs taught the ideas of Al-Jahiz, a Muslim scholar from the 9th century, who proposed concepts similar to natural selection. However, acceptance of evolution remains low in the Muslim world, as prominent figures reject evolution's underpinning philosophy of materialism as unsound to human origins and a denial <b>of</b> <b>Allah.</b> Further objections by Muslim authors and writers largely reflect those put forward in the Western world.|$|E

5|$|Abu Qatada Ansari, a {{companion}} of Muhammad, who accompanied Khalid from Medina was so shocked at Malik's murder by Khalid that he immediately returned to Medina, and told Abu Bakr that {{he refused to}} serve under a commander who had killed a Muslim. The death of Malik and Khalid's taking of his wife Layla created controversy. Some officers of his army—including Abu Qatadah—believed that Khalid killed Malik to take his wife. After the pressure exerted by Umar—Khalid's cousin and one of Caliph Abu Bakr's main advisors—Abu Bakr called Khalid back to Medina to explain himself. Although Khalid had declared Malik an apostate, in Medina, ‘Umar told Khâlid: “You enemy <b>of</b> <b>Allâh!</b> You killed a Muslim man and then leap upon his wife. By Allâh, I will stone you". Some have argued that Umar later dismissed him from army service over this.|$|E
5|$|Filming for Never Say Never Again {{began on}} 27 September 1982 on the French Riviera {{for two months}} before moving to Nassau, the Bahamas in mid-November where filming took place at Clifton Pier, which {{was also one of}} the {{locations}} used in Thunderball. The Spanish city of Almería was also used as a location. Largo's Palmyran fortress was actually historic Fort Carré in Antibes. Largo's ship, the Flying Saucer, was portrayed by the yacht Kingdom 5KR, then owned by Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi and called the Nabila. Principal photography finished at Elstree Studios where interior shots were filmed. Elstree also housed the Tears <b>of</b> <b>Allah</b> underwater cavern, which took three months to construct. Most of the filming was completed in the spring of 1983, although there was some additional shooting during the summer of 1983.|$|E
5|$|Gradually {{there were}} {{increased}} number of laws regulating Zoroastrian behavior, limiting their ability to participate in society, and made life difficult for the Zoroastrians {{in the hope that}} they would convert to Islam. Over time, persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and widespread, and the number of believers decreased significantly. Many converted, some superficially, to escape the systematic abuse and discrimination by the law of the land. Others accepted Islam because their employment in industrial and artisan work would, according to Zoroastrian dogma, make them impure as their work involved defiling fire. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenants to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names <b>of</b> <b>Allah</b> and Iblis.|$|E

5|$|In 1933 Selznick {{returned}} to MGM, {{this time as}} a vice-president in charge of his own production unit. During his two years with the studio he produced elaborate versions of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina and Charles Dickens' David Copperfield and A Tale of Two Cities. In 1935, he left MGM to form his own production company, Selznick International Pictures, where he produced adaptations of Robert Smythe Hichens' The Garden <b>of</b> <b>Allah</b> (1936), Frances Hodgson Burnett's Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936), Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), and Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938). Selznick also became {{a pioneer in the}} use of Technicolor with the first and last of these films and also with his productions of A Star is Born and Nothing Sacred (both 1937). In 1939 Selznick brought Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman to the United States to star in Intermezzo and the following year he brought Alfred Hitchcock over from England to direct Rebecca. Also in 1939, Selznick produced his epic version of Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind, which became the most financially successful film of all time.|$|E
