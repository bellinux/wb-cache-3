5|$|Starfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, other starfish species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls and sea otters. Their first {{lines of}} defence are the {{saponins}} present in their body walls, which have unpleasant flavours. Some starfish such as Astropecten polyacanthus also include powerful toxins such as tetrodotoxin among their chemical armoury, and the slime star can <b>ooze</b> <b>out</b> {{large quantities of}} repellent mucus. They also have body armour {{in the form of}} hard plates and spines. The crown-of-thorns starfish is particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily defended by sharp spines, laced with toxins and sometimes with bright warning colours. Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily plating their extremities.|$|E
5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to <b>ooze</b> <b>out,</b> which further enhances {{the taste of the}} tea. The strips of tea can then be formed into other shapes, such as being rolled into spirals, kneaded and rolled into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also be pressed into bricks through the use of heavy stones or presses.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{an ensemble}} {{of family and}} friends of Gwen and Rhys previously unseen in the series. William Thomas and Sharon Morgan were cast as Gwen's parents Geraint and Mary Cooper. Davies re-introduced the characters during the fourth series of the show, considering Thomas and Morgan to be [...] "two fine Welsh actors". Thomas had previously appeared as two different characters in the 1988 Doctor Who serial Remembrance of the Daleks and the 2005 Doctor Who episode [...] "Boom Town". Upon appearing in [...] "Something Borrowed" [...] he became the first actor to have appeared in all three of the classic series, new series and Torchwood. Nerys Hughes played Rhys' mother Brenda Williams, in addition to a duplicate form of the alien Nostrovite. Like Thomas she had previously appeared in a Doctor Who serial (the 1982 story Kinda). Hughes enjoyed getting to play a [...] "monster" [...] {{for the first time in}} her career which involved having [...] "fangs and claws and red eyes" [...] and being wired up so [...] "all this black blood can <b>ooze</b> <b>out</b> when I get shot". Despite the funny aspect of the script Hughes took the role seriously stating that [...] "everyone plays it for real" [...] and that [...] "you can't camp it up". She believed that as an actor [...] "you've got to believe what you're doing".|$|E

2500|$|Reviews of Brothers in Arms {{from the}} UK music press were {{generally}} negative. In a scathing review for NME, Mat Snow said, [...] "Dire Straits are so tasteful {{as to be}} entirely flavourless, so laid back as to bore me horizontal". He continued, [...] "So do you seriously {{want to hear about}} the further adventures of Mark Knopfler's mawkish self-pity, his lugubriously mannered appropriation of rockin' Americana, his thumpingly crass attempts at wit? Can anybody really be moved, stimulated or entertained by the tritest would-be melodies in history, the last word in tranquilising chord changes, the most cloying lonesome playing and ultimate in transparently fake troubador sentiment ever to <b>ooze</b> <b>out</b> of a million-dollar recording studio?" [...] Eleanor Levy of Record Mirror was similarly dismissive, succinctly stating, [...] "West Coast guitars reeking of mega bucks and sell out stadium concerts throughout the globe. Laid back melodies. Dire Straits – summed up... This is like any other Dire Straits album quarried out of the tottering edifice of MOR rock." [...] The reviews from the UK's other two music papers were less harsh, with Jack Barron of Sounds feeling that [...] "it's only a halfway decent album because it has only halfway decent songs... Knopfler has distilled his sonic essence, via blues, to appeal to billboard romantics with cinemascope insecurities. And he can pull it off well... but not often enough here." [...] Melody Makers Barry McIlheney observed that Knopfler had recently explored different creative directions with his work on movie soundtracks and on Bob Dylan's Infidels, and bemoaned that [...] "unfortunately for the rest of us, this admirable spirit of adventure fails to materialise when it comes to Brothers in Arms. Instead it sounds just a bit too like the last Dire Straits album, which sounded not unlike the last one before that, which sounded suspiciously like the beginning of a hugely successful and very lucrative plan to take over the world known as AOR... the old rockschool restraints and the undeniably attractive smell of the winning formula seem to block out any such experimental work and what you end up with is something very like the same old story." ...|$|E
