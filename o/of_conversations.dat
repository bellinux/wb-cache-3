40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{we present}} a {{computational}} approach to support content creation by recording and reusing the conversational contents as reusable nuggets. We introduce the concept <b>of</b> the <b>conversation</b> quantization- a technique for approximating a continuous flow <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> by a series <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> quanta that correspond to the points in a discourse. We describe the creation <b>of</b> contents using <b>conversation</b> quanta. To realize the concept <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> quanta, we attempt to manually extract conversation quanta from the videos of some meetings and create the conversational contents. As a result, we have confirmed that conversation quanta can be reused as conversational contents such as conversational agents and presentation contents. Further, we have obtained valuable insights into the nature <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> quanta. ...|$|R

5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E
5|$|In November 1940 Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to meet Ribbentrop and Adolf Hitler. In January 1941, the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden visited Turkey in {{an attempt}} to get the Turks to enter the war on the Allies' side. Though the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise, and in a series <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviet Union would soon be faced with an Anglo-Turkish {{invasion}} of the Crimea. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it would appear that in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.|$|E
5|$|Lad: A Dog was {{published}} by Dutton in April 1919, {{a year after the}} real-life Lad's death. Terhune continued receiving royalties for the novel up through his own death. His wife, Anice Terhune, ceased receiving the royalties after she surrendered the rights to them, along with those of Bruce and His Dog in exchange for E.P. Dutton agreeing to publish and perpetually print her work Across the Line, a supposed set <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> she had with her late husband. With this agreement, Dutton became sole owners of the copyright to Lad: A Dog. Macrae later decided that the agreement was not completely fair to Anice and modified it to provide her a payment of $100 a month {{for the rest of her}} life, likely exceeding the profits they earned on the novels as the years passed.|$|E

5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs <b>of</b> <b>conversations</b> or content that has been added automatically.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a {{computational}} approach to understanding and augmenting the conversational knowledge process that is a collective activity for knowledge creation, management, and application, where conversational communications are used as a primary means of interaction among participating agents. The key idea is conversation quantization, a technique of approximating a continuous flow <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> by a series <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> quanta that represent points <b>of</b> the discourse. <b>Conversation</b> quantization enables to implement a rather robust conversation system by basing it on a large amount <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> quanta collected from the real world. We make clear the nature <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> quanta by extracting them from practical situations by hand. Based on the preliminary experiments, {{we present a}} method for automatic extraction of the first approximation <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> quanta. To support the conversational knowledge process, we have developed the Sustainable Knowledge Globe (SKG) that can manage conversation quanta by switching an overlooking sphere view and a conversational agent in an immersive view. We discuss effectiveness of SKG based on an experiment...|$|R

This thesis examines the principles <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b> and analyzes eight advertisements in English and German to show a universality of the maxims between the languages. Furthennore, I explore the gap between the semantics (what is actually said) and pragmatics (what is inferred by the viewer) of advertising that is bridged by one of the maxims. My findings report that a universality of the Maxims <b>of</b> <b>Conversation</b> exists among languages, {{and that there is a}} problem between semantics and pragmatics, which rests primarily on the Maxim of Quantity...|$|R
