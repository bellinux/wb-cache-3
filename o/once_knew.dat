5|$|The episode's story {{focuses on}} married couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). In late 2004, on the island, they debate whether to defect to the rival faction of {{survivors}} led by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). Intercut throughout the episode, {{a series of}} off-island scenes show Sun about to give birth and Jin experiencing a series of difficulties {{in his efforts to}} reach the hospital with a gift of a stuffed panda. The ending shows that Jin's and Sun's scenes do not focus on the same birth; Jin's scenes are flashbacks to events before the plane crash, while Sun's are flashforwards to sometime after she escapes the island. A subplot follows Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) on board the Kahana, where they learn more about the freighter's mission and find somebody they <b>once</b> <b>knew.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lindwall had no {{intentions}} to retire. He continued onto the early 1955 {{tour of the}} West Indies, the first by an Australian team to the Caribbean. Lindwall was determined to enjoy himself, having recovered from his recent illness. By day, he and Miller battled with the three W's but at night they socialised. However, Lindwall needed respite and dietary discipline in order to completely ward off his hepatitis. He {{was no longer the}} reveller that Miller <b>once</b> <b>knew.</b> After Australia had made 9/515, Lindwall took a match total of 6/124, as the hosts were forced to follow on in the First Test at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica. Australia went on to win by nine wickets. The team's travelled to Queen's Park in Trinidad for the Second Test, where the West Indies batted first and made 382. This time Lindwall bowled a long spell of 24.5 overs, and eventually prized out six of the West Indians for the cost of 95 runs. The culmination of this was a spell of 4/16. Australia replied with 9/600, with Lindwall contributing an unbeaten 37 with the bat. Lindwall's match soured in the second innings when he broke down with an achilles tendon problem as the match ended in a draw. Lindwall recovered {{for the start of the}} Third Test at Bourda in Georgetown, Guyana. Lindwall had a quiet time in a spin dominated game, taking two wickets in an eight-wicket Australian victory. Australia won the toss and batted in the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados. Australia had already reached 6/439 when Lindwall came to the crease. In a highly aggressive innings, he reached his fifty in 69 minutes and was unbeaten on 80 at stumps. The next morning, he went on the make his second Test century, scoring 118 with two sixes and 16 fours. It was his second century at Test level, eight years after his first, but showed the same counter-attacking aggression. Lindwall had another quiet match with two wickets in another high scoring draw with both teams amassing more than 500 in the first innings. Lindwall finished the series with four wickets in the Fifth Test in Jamaica as Australia completed a 3–0 series win with another innings triumph. In a high scoring series, Lindwall had taken 20 wicket at 31.85 while also scoring 187 runs at 37.40, a strong all round performance.|$|E

As Parker's management career began to take off, Marie became more of a housewife and mother, although she would occasionally travel with him to various parts of the country.

500|$|The film is loosely {{connected}} to Cat People (1942) {{by the appearance}} of Tom Conway as Dr. Louis Judd, who had roles in both films. Judd recounts to a poet that he <b>once</b> <b>knew</b> a mysterious woman who was in fact a [...] "raving lunatic" [...] (referencing Irena Dubrovna, the protagonist of Cat People). In memos and early drafts of the script, Conway's character was referred to as [...] "Mr. Siegfried"; film scholars believe that the character's name was changed to provide continuity between the two films and to capitalize on Cat Peoples success. The Judd character, however, had died in Cat People, calling into question the relation of the two fictional narratives. Val Lewton historian Edmund Bansak notes that the films are also linked thematically through a preoccupation with nihilism.|$|E

500|$|RZA's {{production}} on Wu-Tang Clan's debut album {{had a profound}} and significant influence on subsequent hip hop producers. The distinctive sound of Enter the Wu-Tang has been credited with creating a blueprint for hardcore hip hop in the mid-1990s. Blackfilm.com asserts that Enter the Wu-Tangs production formula [...] "transformed the sound of underground rap into mainstream formula, and virtually {{changed the face of}} contemporary music as popsters <b>once</b> <b>knew</b> it." [...] Many successful rap producers have admitted to the influence of RZA's beats on their own production efforts. 9th Wonder, a producer and former member of Little Brother, is one of many whose vocal sampling styles are inspired by RZA. The album's reliance on soul music samples was novel at the time, but 21st-century producers such as The Alchemist, Kanye West, and Just Blaze now rely on this technique. According to Allmusic, the {{production on}} two Mobb Deep albums, The Infamous and Hell on Earth (1996), are [...] "indebted" [...] to RZA's early production with Wu-Tang Clan.|$|E

500|$|The {{libretto}} {{has been}} praised by several biographers and historians. One said that [...] "The dialogue contains many an authentic Gilbertian touch." [...] Another found it [...] "a gay, sparkling libretto". Sidney Dark and Rowland Gray wrote that [...] "the book of Thespis is genuine Gilbert, the Gilbert whom nowadays {{all the world}} loves.... Thespis once more emphasizes the fact that Gilbert's artistry was hardly affected {{with the passing of}} the years. Many of its songs might well have appeared in the later operas." [...] They point out Mercury's [...] "I'm the celestial drudge", which anticipates Giuseppe's [...] "Rising early in the morning" [...] in The Gondoliers, and find the [...] "real brand of Gilbertian topsy-turvydom" [...] in the song about the former head of a railway company, [...] "I <b>once</b> <b>knew</b> a chap who discharged a function". Isaac Goldberg thought that [...] "Thespis looks forward far more often than it glances backward: [...] "It forecasts the characteristic methods, and now and then a character, of the later series. Its dialogue is comical, and, if anything, somewhat above the heads of the Gaiety audiences of 1871." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Crowther places Trial by Jury at {{the centre}} of Gilbert's {{development}} as a librettist. [...] He notes that in some of Gilbert's early libretti, such as Topsyturveydom (1874), the songs simply emphasise the dialogue. [...] In others, such as Thespis (1871), some songs are relatively disconnected from both the story and characterisation, such as [...] "I <b>once</b> <b>knew</b> a chap" [...] or [...] "Little maid of Arcadee", which simply convey a moral lesson. [...] In Trial by Jury, however, each song carries the plot forward and adds depth to the characters. [...] In addition, unlike some of Gilbert's more fantastical early plots, [...] "Aside from the ending, nothing essentially improbable happens." [...] Gänzl agrees, writing that [...] "Gilbert's libretto was superior to any of his previous efforts. [...] It was concise, modern and satirical without being impossibly whimsical. [...] Having no spoken dialogue it was perforce tightly constructed and allowed of no interpolation or alteration." [...] Sullivan's development as a comic opera writer, too, would mature with Trial by Jury. [...] Except for incidental music for productions of Shakespeare, he had not written any music for the stage since Thespis. [...] Gänzl wrote that Trial by Jury [...] "brought Sullivan firmly and finally {{into the world of}} the musical" [...] stage and confirmed, after his previous success with Cox and Box and Thespis, that [...] "Sullivan was a composer of light lyric and comic music who could rival Offenbach, Lecocq and any English musician alive." ...|$|E

500|$|Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan {{rated the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] and applauded {{the return of}} Duchovny, writing, [...] "welcome back, [...] you {{magnificent}} bastard." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a mixed review of the episode. On one hand, he praised {{the feel of the}} episode, writing, [...] "in many ways, this was an episode that brought back the intensity, magic, and the power of The X-Files that I have been missing throughout this most mundane of seasons." [...] In this manner, Kessenich felt that Doggett became [...] "part of The X-Files for the first time." [...] However, Kessenich also felt that the plot involving Mulder's terminal brain disease was a mis-step, noting that Mulder would have never kept something so serious and personal from Scully. He wrote, [...] "a year ago, Mulder was not dying [...] what we <b>once</b> <b>knew</b> as truth has suddenly been replaced with a lie." [...] George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Contra Costa Times called the entry [...] "one of the season's more engaging episodes" [...] and wrote positively of the [...] "intriguing possibilities" [...] that it set up for the final part of the season. They were also positive about the manner in which Doggett and Mulder were able to connect in [...] "some mystical way". However, Avalos and Liedtke were critical of the episode's placement, noting that it would have worked better had it been the [...] "fourth or fifth episode of the season", as opposed to the eighth. Furthermore, they negatively wrote about the revelation that Mulder was suffering from a terminal brain disease, calling it a [...] "monumental story" [...] curve that did not bother [...] "to connect all the dots behind" [...] it.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, the Smallville {{series was}} {{continued}} through the comic book medium, with Smallville: Season 11. Written by Bryan Q. Miller, who also wrote for the television series, the first issue details Lex changing the LuthorCorp name to LexCorp, due to his memory loss in the series finale. Tess Mercer's death is ruled a suicide, and Lex sells the ownership rights to the Daily Planet. He also questions why he would befriend the [...] "unsophisticated" [...] Clark Kent, after reading some newspaper clippings. He immediately harbors distrust with [...] "Superman", after the latter reveals himself to the world. In addition, there are remnants of memories left for Lex to continue his hatred towards the superhero but {{have no knowledge of}} Superman's secret identity. Lex later discovers that he <b>once</b> <b>knew</b> who Superman is and determined to remember. This leads to a proposal with General Sam Lane to create a joint venture between LexCorp and the Pentagon for the company's project, [...] "Guardian Defense Platforms", which involves monitoring the world's metahuman and extraterrestrial communities. In the second issue, Lex takes steps to regain his lost memories, having his assistant Otis Berg research the neurotoxin Tess used on him, eventually he discovers that the toxin has caused Lex's brain to operate at a higher percentage than normal, increasing his overall intelligence. In addition, Otis discovers that the toxin not only erased Lex's memories and enhanced his intelligence, but also caused him to mentally bond with Tess's consciousness when she poisoned him. Clark and Oliver eventually discover what happened to Tess, and extracts her consciousness from Lex and uploaded it into the Watchtower's computer until they can clone her a new body. It is also revealed that Lex was friends with Bruce Wayne, the secret identity of Batman, since childhood, but lost touch after the murder of Bruce's parents. Years later, Bruce is secretly aware that Lex is now corrupt.|$|E
