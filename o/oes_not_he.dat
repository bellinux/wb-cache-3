In his 20's, he founded and co-published Competition Press, a weekly magazine devoted to car-racing that eventually became Autoweek; he also briefly edited Motor Life magazine. In 1960 he left reporting and moved to New York for the advertising industry, becoming copywriter and creative executive {{for a series of}} agencies such as J. Walter Thompson, Young & Rubicam and BBD & <b>O.</b> <b>Not</b> surprisingly, <b>he</b> specialised in advertising copy for the motor trade, an area of booming competition in the car-obsessed economy of Sixties America. He became creative director of the Fletcher-Richards Agency and an expert on all things automobile. He moved to Hollywood in his 40's to try his hand at screenwriting; his first film was Roger Corman's Jackson County Jail and his last was Dead Silence, a TV-movie starring James Garner. He died in his home in Los Angeles of cancer in 1999, at the age of 69.|$|R
