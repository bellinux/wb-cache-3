5|$|The band applied {{microphone}} placement techniques {{similar to}} those which many orchestras used. The recording process was a deliberate exaggeration of the techniques used by the Beatles in the early 1960s, with a four-track representation of the devices. The guitars can be heard separately <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> channels—electric bass on the left channel, rhythm guitar on the right—drums and vocals are mixed {{in the middle of}} the stereo mix. The mixing of the production also used more modern techniques such as overdubbing, a technique used by studios to add a supplementary recorded sound to the material. The band also used a technique known as doubling, where the vocal line used is sung twice.|$|E
5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
5|$|When {{the rest}} of the office is told of Phyllis' injury, they take this as {{confirmation}} that the Cafe Disco is a bad idea and reprimand Michael for what happened to Phyllis. Disappointed and angry, Michael instructs Erin (Ellie Kemper) to close up the Cafe Disco. Kelly (Mindy Kaling) comes down with her and the two start dancing after Erin turns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stereo.</b> This catches the eye of two male employees from Vance Refrigeration, and soon Cafe Disco is full of both Dunder Mifflin employees and non-employees, much to Michael's delight. Oscar (Oscar Nunez) is mildly baffled that Erin actually invited one of her friends to come, as opposed to being ashamed of the office. Kelly and Andy (Ed Helms) get into a competitive dance-off with each other, and Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) makes out in the corner with his girlfriend Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt).|$|E

25|$|Alex {{is convicted}} of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison (Pete visiting one day {{informed}} him that Georgie has {{been killed in a}} botched robbery). Two years into his term, he has obtained a job in one of the prison chapels playing religious music <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> to accompany the Sunday religious services. The chaplain mistakes Alex's Bible studies for stirrings of faith; in reality, Alex is only reading Scripture for the violent passages. After his fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he is chosen to undergo an experimental behaviour-modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique in exchange for having the remainder of his sentence commuted. The technique is a form of aversion therapy, in which Alex is injected with nausea-inducing drugs while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to become severely ill at the mere thought of violence. As an unintended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, renders Alex unable to enjoy his beloved classical music as before.|$|E
25|$|The Eagle Premier was {{launched}} in January 1988, with the first production models rolling {{off the assembly line}} on September 28, 1987. Although the car is sometimes referred to as a Renault Premier, this car was never marketed anywhere in the world as a Renault. Pre-production prototypes left the factory with Renault emblems on its grille and wheel covers. but Eagle nameplates on its trunk lid, and the Eagle division had to indicate this difference in its dealer information brochures and videos. Prior to its January 1988 launch, all pre-production cars had the Renault emblem removed from the grille and steering column horn hub pad. Depending on which stereo system was ordered, one would find either a Renault or Eagle emblem in the car through 1989 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stereo.</b> It was to have been the first bodystyle in a series of three, along with a four-door wagon and a two-door coupe. After Chrysler purchased Renault's stake (46%) in AMC and all other outstanding stock (54%), the wagon and coupe body styles were cancelled as was a planned Premier DL model featuring a five-speed manual gearbox.|$|E
500|$|While in the studio, Timbaland played <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> {{plenty of}} songs by American singer and {{musician}} Prince {{for them to}} listen to. Early in their sessions, they reportedly were [...] "fooling around" [...] and [...] "freestyling". One night, Danja was playing a guitar riff and {{caught the attention of}} Timberlake, who then started humming to the melody and later sung the lyrics. Timbaland, who was at their side, added drums onto the progressing sound. After an hour, with no lyrics written on paper, Timberlake recorded in the vocal booth a song that would become [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". Timberlake, having been teased by Timbaland, said to the latter: [...] "Let's do something we would never do. Let's go far left and just see what happens." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{finds out}} that Brian has a new girlfriend. Brian later (reluctantly) allows Stewie to meet his new girlfriend, Jillian. Stewie discovers she is a dumb blonde, and mocks Brian. Jillian visits the house, where Peter and Chris take an instant liking to her while Lois and Stewie find her stupidity amusing. The next day, Brian goes out with Jillian, where he meets her equally unintelligent friends. [...] Stewie tells Brian that the {{relationship}} will not succeed. Brian visits Jillian's apartment to end the relationship (with Stewie waiting in his car), but he is distracted by her naked body when she answers the door and he has sex with her instead. Stewie apparently anticipated this when he returns three hours later, turns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stereo,</b> plays his mix tape, and starts singing {{to the tune of}} Gary Numan's [...] "Cars": [...] "Brian had sex/With a really dumb girl/Now he's taking his friend Stewie/To get some ice cream/In his car." [...] After Brian turns off the stereo, Stewie responds [...] "Oh, you're a poor sport.".|$|E
2500|$|Two tracks, [...] "Love Me Do" [...] and [...] "P.S. I Love You", {{were only}} mixed for mono for the single's release and no stereo {{versions}} were ever made, so, for the stereo {{version of the}} album, during the mixing sessions on 25 February 1963, George Martin created [...] "mock stereo" [...] versions by emphasizing low frequencies {{on one side and}} high frequencies on the other. These versions would continue to be made available via compilation albums (such as A Collection of Beatles Oldies and 1962–1966), and on Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs' half-speed mastered vinyl releases (catalog number MFSL-1-101) sourced from EMI's original stereo master tapes, until the Beatles' catalogue was standardized and issued on compact disc in 1987, starting with the first four UK albums being issued in their mono versions. However, when Capitol Records issued the second volume of American Beatles albums on compact disc (The Capitol Albums, Volume 2) in 2006, the same mock stereo versions that appeared on The Early Beatles were included. [...] When the entire catalogue was remastered for release in 2009, the mono mixes were chosen for inclusion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> re-issues, and appear on all releases since, including newer compilations and variations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} many times during sessions for the White Album. During the 18 July 1968 sessions, the Beatles recorded {{a version of}} the song lasting 27 minutes and 11 seconds, although this version is rather slow and hypnotic, differing greatly from the volume and rawness of the album version. Another recording from the same day, originally 12 minutes long, was edited down to 4:37 for Anthology 3. On 9 September, 18 takes of approximately five minutes each were recorded, and the last one is featured on the original LP. After the 18th take, Ringo Starr flung his drum sticks across the studio and screamed, [...] "I got blisters on my fingers!" [...] Starr's shout was included <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> mix of the song. At around 3:40, the song almost fades out, then quickly fades back in with three cymbal crashes and Ringo's scream (some sources erroneously credit the [...] "blisters" [...] line to Lennon; in fact, Lennon can be heard asking [...] "How's that?" [...] before Ringo's outburst). The mono version (originally on LP only) ends on the first fadeout without Starr's outburst. The mono version was not initially available in the US as mono albums had already been phased out there. The mono version was later released in the American version of the Rarities album. In 2009, it was made available on the CD mono re-issue of the White Album as part of the Beatles in Mono CD box set.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} issued in both mono and <b>stereo</b> versions, though <b>the</b> <b>stereo</b> version essentially had <b>the</b> mono version <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right channel {{with a separate}} solo trumpet track <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left.
