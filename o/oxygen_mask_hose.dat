50|$|Most {{commercial}} aircraft that operate at high flight altitudes are pressurized at a maximum cabin altitude of approximately 8,000 feet. On most pressurized aircraft, if cabin pressurization is lost when the cabin altitude is above 14,000 feet, compartments containing the <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> will open automatically, either above or {{in front of}} the passenger and crew seats, and the <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> will drop down {{in front of the}} passenger. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> may also drop on extremely rough landings or during severe turbulence if the <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> panel becomes loose. Rows of seats typically have an extra mask (i.e. 3 seats, 4 masks), in case someone has an infant in their lap, or someone in the aisle needs to grab one.|$|R
30|$|Introduction Oxygen {{therapy is}} one of the most popular {{treatments}} in the ICU. We typically use <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> to give <b>oxygen</b> to patients who breathe spontaneously. However, ordinary <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> have a risk of CO 2 rebreathing—especially at lower flow rates (less than 5  l/min).|$|R
50|$|An <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> {{provides}} {{a method to}} transfer breathing oxygen gas from a storage tank to the lungs. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> may cover the nose and mouth (oral nasal mask) or the entire face (full-face mask). They may be made of plastic, silicone, or rubber.|$|R
50|$|Medical <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> {{are held}} in place by medical {{personnel}} or the user by hand, or they may be fitted with a lightweight elastic headband so the mask can be removed quickly. Full-face masks are secured by several straps. Tightly fitting <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> are secured at four points by two head straps. Aviators’ masks are often equipped with “quick don” harnesses that allow those in pressurized aircraft to rapidly don the masks in emergencies. Military aviators’ <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> are secured to flight helmets with quick-release systems.|$|R
50|$|Most {{commercial}} aircraft are fitted with <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> for use when cabin pressurization fails. In general, {{commercial aircraft}} are pressurized {{so that the}} cabin air is at a pressure equivalent {{to no more than}} 8,000 ft altitude (usually somewhat lower altitude), where one can breathe normally without an <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask.</b> If the <b>oxygen</b> pressure in the cabin drops below a safe level, risking hypoxia, compartments containing the <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> will open automatically, either above or in front of the passenger and crew seats, and in the lavatories.|$|R
50|$|In jet fighter aircraft, {{the small}} size of the cockpit means that any {{decompression}} will be very rapid and would not allow the pilot time to put on an <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask.</b> Therefore, fighter jet pilots and aircrew are required to wear <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> at all times.|$|R

The <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> design revised in the study showed a 27 % design improvement effect on average in terms of fit evaluated by the VFA method. Additionally, the present study evaluated the revised <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> prototypes with 88 KAF pilots to experimentally verify the design improvement effect in terms of discomfort, pressure, and suitability for military equipment (slippage and stability in flight-like situations). The discomfort of the revised mask was 33 ~ 56 % lower on average than the existing <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask.</b> In terms of the pressure, the revised mask showed 11 ~ 33 % of improvement on average compared to the existing mask. Furthermore, on high gravity situation, the slippage distance of the revised mask was 24 % shorter on average than the existing mask.

50|$|Hoses or tubing connect an <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> to the <b>oxygen</b> supply. Hoses {{are larger}} in {{diameter}} than tubing and can allow greater oxygen flow. When a hose is used {{it may have}} a ribbed or corrugated design to allow bending of the hose while preventing twisting and cutting off the oxygen flow. The quantity of oxygen delivered from the storage tank to the <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> is controlled by a valve called a regulator. Some types of <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> have a breathing bag made of plastic or rubber attached to the <b>mask</b> or <b>oxygen</b> supply <b>hose</b> to store a supply of oxygen to allow deep breathing without waste of oxygen with use of simple fixed flow regulators.|$|R
50|$|Project breathe is an {{initiative}} created by Invisible Fence Inc. {{to save lives}} of pets involved with house fires. An estimated 40,000 to 150,000 pets die each year in fires, mostly due to smoke inhalation. Invisible Fence started the <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Mask</b> Donation Program to provide <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> kits to Fire Departments and first responders. Without these masks, treatment is administered through a human <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> which {{is known to be}} inefficient for an animal to effectively be treated. The masks make rescues easier for the pets and firefighters. The mask is designed to fit comfortably around the animal’s muzzle, allowing firefighters to administer a more accurate and efficient amount of oxygen to the animal.|$|R
5000|$|Filtered <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> {{have the}} ability to prevent exhaled, {{potentially}} infectious particles from being released into the surrounding environment. These masks are normally of a closed design such that leaks are minimized and breathing of room air is controlled through a series of one-way valves. Filtration of exhaled breaths is accomplished either by placing a filter on the exhalation port, or through an integral filter {{that is part of the}} mask itself. These masks first became popular in the Toronto (Canada) healthcare community during the 2003 SARS Crisis. SARS was identified as being respiratory based and it was determined that conventional oxygen therapy devices were not designed for the containment of exhaled particles. [...] Common practices of having suspected patients wear a surgical mask was confounded by the use of standard oxygen therapy equipment. In 2003, the HiOx80 <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> was released for sale. The HiOx80 mask is a closed design mask that allows a filter to be placed on the exhalation port. Several new designs have emerged in the global healthcare community for the containment and filtration of potentially infectious particles. Other designs include the ISO- <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask,</b> the Flo2Max <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask,</b> and the O-Mask. The use of <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> that are capable of filtering exhaled particles is gradually becoming a recommended practice for pandemic preparation in many jurisdictions.|$|R
50|$|If a {{pressurized}} aircraft {{suffers a}} pressurization failure above 10,000 feet (~3,000 meters), then {{it could be}} deemed as an emergency. Should this situation occur, the aircraft should begin an emergency descent and <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> should be activated for all occupants. In the majority of passenger aircraft, the passengers' <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> are activated automatically if the cabin pressure falls below the atmospheric pressure equivalent of 14,000 feet (~4,500 meters).|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{dissertation}} we investigated {{the effect of}} in-flight <b>oxygen</b> <b>masks</b> on the noses of Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) F- 16 pilots. We explained {{the use of an}} in-flight <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> by RNLAF F- 16 pilots, and presented the medical complaints associated with its usage and related to the nose. The pathophysiology and prevention of similar symptoms observed in athletes were discussed to help explain the pathophysiology of the oxygen mask-induced symptoms. In {{a review of the literature}} the pathophysiology of the adaptive response of the nasal bone to the exerted contact pressure and friction by the <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> was discussed. The adaptive response of the nasal bone consists of forming new bone. Via mechanotransduction a biochemical response is mounted by the nasal bone. Intermittent dynamic mechanical loading with recovery periods generates a much stronger bone formation response than one continuous loading period. An analysis of the fit of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> demonstrated that a suboptimal fit of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> was regarded as a potential contributing factor to inflicting the symptoms of the nose. A 3 D analysis of the fit of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> allowed us to evaluate how closely the <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> fit the face. As the main finding we observed that there was space for movement in the nasal area. In-flight displacement may result in exertion of excessive pressure and friction on the nose. The findings of a cross-sectional questionnaire among the RNLAF F- 16 pilots and a prospective post-flight pain score study were presented. It allowed us to make an inventory of the symptoms and revealed which conditions worsened and lessened the symptoms according to the pilots. We objectified the latter findings by prospectively collecting pain scores after each flight for several months in a row both in The Netherlands and in operational theater. The conditions that were reported to worsen the symptoms correlated to certain types of missions that received high pain scores. In a pilot it was evaluated how much pressure the <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> exerted during static conditions. The pressure was measured on the nose and chin when the <b>oxygen</b> <b>mask</b> and the helmet were donned. The baseline exerted pressure was compared to the exerted pressure while the pilot made protocolized head movements. In a subsequent study, the effect of dynamic conditions on the exerted contact pressure on the nose were obtained in the human centrifuge. The pressure changes on the nose were higher than on the chin. Another main finding was that shear stress and friction were present: during the acceleration phase the mask moved. This chapter demonstrated that pressure and friction are exerted chronically. To conclude, the main conclusions of the thesis and strategies for future preventive measures were discussed...|$|R
