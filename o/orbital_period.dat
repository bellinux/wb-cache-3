5|$|For {{a stable}} orbit the ratio between the moon's <b>orbital</b> <b>period</b> Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an <b>orbital</b> <b>period</b> less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star.

40|$|Many Kepler multiplanet {{systems have}} planet pairs near low-order, mean-motion resonances.

40|$|Orbital cycles with 100 kyr and/or 41 kyr periods, {{detected}} in some sedimentary normalized remanence (relative paleointensity) records by power spectral analysis or wavelet analysis, {{have been attributed}} either to orbital forcing of the geodynamo, or to lithologic contamination. In this study, local wavelet power spectra (LWPS) with significance tests have been calculated for seven relative paleointensity (RPI) records from {{different regions of the}} world. The results indicate that <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> (100 kyr and/or 41 kyr) are significant in some RPI records during certain time intervals, and are not significant in others. Time intervals where <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> are significant are not consistent among the RPI records, implying that <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> in these RPI records may not have a common origin such as orbital forcing on the geodynamo. Cross-wavelet power spectra (|XWT|) and squared wavelet coherence (WTC) between RPI records and orbital parameters further indicate that common power exists at <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> but is not significantly coherent, and exhibits variable phase relationships, implying that <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> in RPI records are not caused directly by orbital forcing. Similar analyses for RPI records and benthic oxygen isotope records from the same sites show significant coherence and constant in-phase relationships during time intervals where <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> were significant in the RPI records, indicating that <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> in the RPI records are most likely due to climatic ‘contamination’. Although common power exists at <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> for RPI records and their normalizers with significant coherence during certain time intervals, phase relationships imply that ‘contamination’ (at <b>orbital</b> <b>periods)</b> is not directly due to the normalizers. <b>Orbital</b> <b>periods</b> are also significant in the NRM intensity records, and ‘contamination’ in RPI records can be attributed to incomplete normalization of the NRM records. Further tests indicate that ‘contamination’ is apparently not directly related to physical properties such as density or carbonate content, or to the grain size proxy ?ARM/?. However, WTC between RPI records and the grain size proxy ARM/IRM implies that ARM/IRM does reflect the ‘contamination’ in some RPI records. It appears that <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> were introduced into the NRM records (and have not been normalized when calculating RPI records) through magnetite grain size variations reflected in the ARM/IRM grain size proxy. The orbital power in ARM/IRM for some North Atlantic sites is probably derived from bottom-current velocity variations that are orbitally modulated and are related to the vigor of thermohaline circulation and the production of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). In the case of ODP Site 983, the orbital power in RPI appears to exhibit a shift from 41 -kyr to 100 -kyr period at the mid-Pleistocene climate transition (? 750 ka), reinforcing the climatic origin of these <b>orbital</b> <b>periods.</b> RPI records from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and RPI records with <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> eliminated by band-pass filters, are highly comparable with each other in the time domain, and are coherent and in-phase in time-frequency space, especially at non-orbital periods, indicating that ‘contamination’, although present (at <b>orbital</b> <b>periods)</b> is not debilitating to these RPI records as a global signal that is primarily of geomagnetic origin...|$|R

5|$|When {{the mean}} <b>orbital</b> <b>period</b> of an {{asteroid}} is an integer {{fraction of the}} <b>orbital</b> <b>period</b> of Jupiter, a mean-motion resonance with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new orbital elements.

5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their <b>orbital</b> <b>period.</b> Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the <b>orbital</b> <b>period.</b> Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a method for estimating the <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> of dwarf novae from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) colors in quiescence using an artificial neural network. For typical objects below the period gap with sufficient photometric accuracy, {{we were able to}} estimate the <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> with an accuracy to a 1 sigma error of 22 %. The error of estimation is worse for systems with longer <b>orbital</b> <b>periods.</b> We have also developed a neural-network-based method for categorical classification. This method has proven to be efficient in classifying objects into three categories (WZ Sge type, SU UMa type and SS Cyg/Z Cam type) and works for very faint objects to a limit of g= 21. Using this method, we have investigated the distribution of the <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> of dwarf novae from a modern transient survey (Catalina Real-Time Survey). Using Bayesian analysis developed by Uemura et al. (2010, arXiv: 1003. 0945), we have found that the present sample tends to give a flatter distribution toward the shortest period and a shorter estimate of the period minimum, which may have resulted from the uncertainties in the neural network analysis and photometric errors. We also provide estimated <b>orbital</b> <b>periods,</b> estimated classifications and supplementary information on known dwarf novae with quiescent SDSS photometry.

40|$|We {{show that}} black-hole High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) with O- or B-type donor stars and {{relatively}} short <b>orbital</b> <b>periods,</b> of order one week to several months may survive spiral in, to then form Wolf-Rayet (WR) X-ray binaries with <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> of order {{a day to}} a few days; while in systems where the compact star is a neutron star, HMXBs with these <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> never survive spiral-in. We therefore predict that WR X-ray binaries can only harbor black holes. The reason why black-hole HMXBs with these <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> may survive spiral in is: {{the combination of a}} radiative envelope of the donor star, and a high mass of the compact star. In this case, when the donor begins to overflow its Roche lobe, the systems are able to spiral in slowly with stable Roche-lobe overflow, as is shown by the system SS 433. In this case the transferred mass is ejected from the vicinity of the compact star (so-called "isotropic re-emission" mass loss mode, or "SS 433 -like mass loss"), leading to gradual spiral-in. If the mass ratio of donor and black hole is > 3. 5, these systems will go into CE evolution and are less likely to survive. If they survive, they produce WR X-ray binaries with <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> of a few hours to one day. Several of the well-known WR+O binaries in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, with <b>orbital</b> <b>periods</b> in the range between a week and several months, are expected to evolve into close WR-Black-Hole binaries,which may later produce close double black holes. The galactic formation rate of double black holes resulting from such systems is still uncertain, as it depends on several poorly known factors in this evolutionary picture. It might possibly be as high as ∼ 10 ^- 5 per year. Comment: MNRAS in pres...|$|R
