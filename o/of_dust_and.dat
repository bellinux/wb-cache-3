5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> gas orbiting the star, {{which was the first}} debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|However, that meaning {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the process of accretion forming the planets. In this context, accretion refers to the process of cooled, solidified grains <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> ice orbiting the protostar in the protoplanetary disk, colliding and sticking together and gradually growing, up to and including the high-energy collisions between sizable planetesimals.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{scattering}} properties <b>of</b> nonspherical <b>dust</b> aerosol, a new method is developed for retrieving dust aerosol optical depths of dusty clouds. The dusty clouds {{are defined as}} the hybrid system <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> plume <b>and</b> cloud. The new method is based on transmittance measurements from surface-based instruments multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFRSR) and cloud parameters from lidar measurements. It uses the difference <b>of</b> absorption between <b>dust</b> aerosols <b>and</b> water droplets for distinguishing and estimating the optical properties <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> <b>and</b> clouds, respectively. This new retrieval method is not sensitive to the retrieval error of cloud properties and the maximum absolute deviations <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> aerosol <b>and</b> total optical depths for thin dusty cloud retrieval algorithm are only 0. 056 and 0. 1, respectively, for given possible uncertainties. The retrieval error for thick dusty cloud mainly depends on lidar-based total dusty cloud properties...|$|R

5|$|The Deccan Traps {{could have}} caused {{extinction}} through several mechanisms, including the release <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.|$|E

As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some crying out for a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> gas. Usually this {{occurs when a}} molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E

5|$|Taken together, {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the impactor was large enough to create a 120-mile peak ring, to melt, shock and eject granite from many miles within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted over years to decades. This global dispersal <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> sulfates would {{have led to a}} sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the food chain. The researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life.|$|E
5|$|The current {{standard}} {{theory for}} Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen {{into and out}} of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of angular momentum when compared to the planets. However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} is fundamental {{to our understanding of}} the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E

5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E
5|$|The {{emission}} <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> particles {{could have}} covered {{the entire surface}} of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would {{have led to a}} sudden greenhouse effect. Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E
5|$|The streams <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> gas each {{form their}} own {{distinct}} tail, pointing in slightly different directions. The tail of dust is {{left behind in the}} comet's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail called the type II or dust tail. At the same time, the ion or type I tail, made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun because this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is dust, following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. On occasions - such as when the Earth passes through a comet's orbital plane, a tail pointing in the opposite direction to the ion and dust tails called the antitail may be seen.|$|E

25|$|Mars' {{atmosphere}} is so thin and wispy that solar heating <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> {{ice in the}} atmosphere - not heating of the atmospheric gases - is more important in driving weather. Small, suspended particles <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> water ice - aerosols - intercept 20–30% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols have a huge influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations every couple of months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how dust and ice vary with height above the surface.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Owing to the {{extensive}} use of artificial turfs worldwide, {{over the past ten}} years there has been much discussion about the possible health and environmental problems originating from Styrene-Butadiene Recycled rubber (SBRr). Materials and methods. In this paper the authors performed a Tier- 2 environmental-sanitary risk analysis on five artificial turf sports fields located in the city of Turin (Italy) with the aid of RISC 4 software. Two receptors (adult player and child player) and three routes of exposure (direct contact with crumb rubber, contact with rainwater soaking the rubber mat, inhalation <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> <b>and</b> gases from the artificial turf fields) were considered in the conceptual model. Results and discussion. For all the fields and for all the routes, the cumulative carcinogenic risk proved to be lower than 10 - 6 and the cumulative non-carcinogenic risk lower than 1. The outdoor inhalation <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> <b>and</b> gases was the main route of exposure for both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic substances. The results given by the inhalation pathway were compared with those of a risk assessment carried out on a citizen breathing gases <b>and</b> <b>dusts</b> from traffic emissions every day in Turin. Conclusions. For both classes of substances and for both receptors, the inhalation <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>dusts</b> <b>and</b> gases from vehicular traffic gave risk values of one order of magnitude higher than those due to playing soccer on an artificial fiel...|$|R

25|$|As armies became {{trained and}} adopted set {{formation}}s, each regiment's {{ability to keep}} its formation was potentially critical to its, and therefore its army's, success.

40|$|The trends <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days <b>of</b> the {{selected}} 11 meteorological stations from their established year to 2000 {{as well as}} their correlations with temperature, precipitation and wind are revealed. The number <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days <b>of</b> the Capital Circle of China is distinctly variable in space and time. The numbers <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days <b>of</b> the western area are far more than those of the eastern area. The interannual variability <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days is remarkable. The number <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days <b>of</b> the following 7 stations, Erlianhaote, Abaga, Xilinhaote, Fengning, Zhangjiakou, Huailai and Beijing, declined along the past decades, but those of the other four stations had no significant upward or downward trends. There is a marked seasonally of the number <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days, <b>and</b> the maximum was in April. The correlation between number <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days <b>and</b> number of days of mean wind velocity > 5 m/s, which is critical wind velocity to entrain sand into the air, was strongest among the three climatic factors. There were significant positive correlations between the number <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days <b>and</b> number of days of mean wind velocity > 5 m/s in 6 stations. The second strongest climatic factor correlated with the number <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days is temperature. There are significant negative correlations between the number <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days <b>and</b> mean annual temperature, mean winter temperature, mean spring temperature in 3 or 4 stations. The correlation between the number <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days <b>and</b> precipitation is weakest. Only one station, Zhurihe, shows significant negative correlation between the number <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days <b>and</b> spring rainfall. There are 4 stations whose numbers <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storm days don't significantly correlate with the climate. In the end, the spatial-temporal variability <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> storms <b>and</b> its relation with climate in the Capital Circle of China were discussed thoroughly...|$|R

Control of exposure to microbiological hazards <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> in woodworking is not easy. In fact, various types of wood are commonly used and they generate complex mixtures <b>of</b> <b>dusts</b> <b>and</b> {{biological agents}} with various health risks.
