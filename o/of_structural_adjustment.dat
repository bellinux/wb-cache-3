25|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{policies}} on poor countries {{has been one}} of the most significant criticisms of the World Bank. The 1979 energy crisis plunged many countries into economic crisis. The World Bank responded with structural adjustment loans, which distributed aid to struggling countries while enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and fiscal imbalance. Some of these policies included encouraging production, investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real exchange rates and altering the distribution of government resources. Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, economic growth regressed and inflation worsened. The alleviation of poverty was not a goal <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> loans, and the circumstances of the poor often worsened, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted.|$|E
25|$|The early 1980s saw {{the country}} facing a {{difficult}} period <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> caused by declining demand for its traditional products, deteriorating economic performance, and neglected structural reform. Consequently, the 1980–82 recession shook Belgium to the core—unemployment mounted, social welfare costs increased, personal debt soared, the government deficit climbed to 13% of GDP, {{and the national}} debt, although mostly held domestically, mushroomed.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{international}} organizations began {{to admit that}} structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world's poor. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans, allowing for social spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises. In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted as an extension <b>of</b> <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities. Neither approach has addressed the inherent flaws within the global economy that contribute to economic and social inequities within developing countries.|$|E

This empirical study reviews micro level changes occurring in the rural marketing systems as a result of macro economic policy, by specifically investigating the changes of agricultural produce marketing within a rural economy resulting from the introduction <b>of</b> the economic <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> programme. Efficient supply of agricultural inputs and easy market access are important components of the economic development process. The <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> programme removed the responsibility of agricultural produce marketing from state owned enterprises to individual producers and organisations. There is therefore need to investigate how individual agricultural producers and enterprises are adjusting to these changes...|$|R
