50|$|Particulate {{matter is}} {{recycled}} by biodiversity inhabiting the detritus in soils, water columns, and along particle surfaces (including 'aeolian dust'). Ecologists may refer to ecological recycling, <b>organic</b> <b>recycling,</b> biocycling, cycling, biogeochemical recycling, natural recycling, or just recycling {{in reference to}} the work of nature. Whereas the global biogeochemical cycles describe the natural movement and exchange of every kind of particulate matter through the living and non-living components of the Earth, nutrient cycling refers to the biodiversity within community food web systems that loop organic nutrients or water supplies back into production. The difference is a matter of scale and compartmentalization with nutrient cycles feeding into global biogeochemical cycles. Solar energy flows through ecosystems along unidirectional and noncyclic pathways, whereas the movement of mineral nutrients is cyclic. Mineral cycles include carbon cycle, sulfur cycle, nitrogen cycle, water cycle, phosphorus cycle, oxygen cycle, among others that continually recycle along with other mineral nutrients into productive ecological nutrition. Global biogeochemical cycles are the sum product of localized ecological recycling regulated by the action of food webs moving particulate matter from one living generation onto the next. Earths ecosystems have recycled mineral nutrients sustainably for billions of years.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{need for}} <b>organic</b> <b>recycling</b> is {{justified}} {{in the case}} of poultry waste because after ensuring hygienization there is a chance of obtaining a compost with substantial fertilizer value. <b>Organic</b> <b>recycling</b> of slaughter waste has its justification in sustainable development and retardation of resources. In the research being described, composting of hydrated poultry slaughterhouse waste with maize straw was carried out. Combinations with fodder yeast and postcellulose lime were also introduced in order to modify chemical and physicochemical properties of the mixtures. The experiment was carried out within 110 days in 1. 2 × 1. 0 × 0. 8 m laboratory reactors. Temperature of the biomass was recorded during composting, and the biomass was actively aerated through a perforated bottom. Composting of substrates selected in such a way caused losses of some elements in gaseous form, an increase in concentration of other elements, and changes in relationships between elements. The ability to select substrates influences compost quality. This ability is determined by chemical indicators. Among other things, compost evaluation based on carbon to nitrogen ratio shows the intensity of the composting process and possible nitrogen losses. The addition of slaughter waste to maize straw reduced the content of individual fractions of carbon in the composts, whereas the addition of postcellulose lime intensified that process. The addition of fodder yeast significantly increased the phosphorus content in the compost. Since iron compounds were used in the processing of poultry carcasses, composts that were based on this material had an elevated iron content. The applied postcellulose lime significantly increased the copper, zinc, chromium, nickel, and lead contents. Proper selection of substrates for composting of hydrated poultry slaughterhouse waste allows to obtain a compost with chemical properties that create favorable conditions for natural application of that compost. Addition of large quantities of postcellulose lime to the composting process leads to obtaining an organic-mineral substratum for cultivation or to obtaining an agent that improves soil properties...|$|E

40|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>recycling</b> of waste, {{taking into}} account {{sanitary}} safety, should be a fundamental method for recovering the nutrients present in the waste for plants and organic matter. It also refers to by-products of animal origin, which are not intended for consumption by humans. In the present research, composting of hydrated poultry slaughterhouse waste with maize straw was carried out. A combination with fodder yeast and post-cellulose lime was also introduced, which modified chemical and physico-chemical properties of the mixtures. The experiment {{was carried out by}} recording the biomass temperature for 110 days in 1. 2 × 1. 0 × 0. 8 m reactors with perforated bottoms enabling active aeration. The following parameters were taken into consideration in the composted material: carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, respiratory activity, microorganisms, fractions of compost obtained after washing on sieves. Small amounts of fodder yeast favoured the development of microorganisms and caused a sanitary risk in the final product. At the initial stage, the temperature of raw compost in that object was several degrees lower than {{in the case of the}} composted mass without yeast addition. The addition of post-cellulose lime at ratios 6. 5 : 1 : 6. 5 (maize straw: poultry slaughterhouse waste: post-cellulose lime) caused a change in the time of microbiological activity, and led to its inhibition in the final process. In comparison to objects with poultry waste, the highest degree of hygienization was found in the compost with post-cellulose lime (with pH close to neutral).

40|$|Belemnites are {{particularly}} common in Australian Early Cretaceous sequences but have attracted little contemporary examination. They offer potential for biostratigraphic zonation, as evaluated {{in the study}} presented here, based on an examination of very extensive collections that have accumulated in museum and university collections over more than a century. Most of these are from the Great Artesian Basin of eastern Australia and the Carnarvon Basin of Western Australia but small collections from the Maryborough Basin (coastal Queensland) and the Money Shoals Basin (Northern Territory) are {{also included in the}} study. Systematic revision has identified distinctive taxa of the Austral Family Dimitobelidae, and has determined their stratigraphic ranges. Contrary to the existing literature, the Aptian Stage is characterized by just two species: robust Peratobelus oxys Tenison-Woods characterized by an unusually large phragmocone, previously described under the name P. selheimi Tenison-Woods, and gracile P. bauhinianus Skwarko. Albian taxa include long-ranging Dimitobelus diptychus McCoy and D. stimulus Whitehouse but also the short-ranging D. plautus sp. nov. (early Albian), and D. liversidgei Etheridge (late Albian). Dimitobelus hendersoni sp. nov. is recognized from the Albian of Western Australia but its precise range is not known. A distinctive new, diminutive, Cenomanian belemnite genus Microbelus gen. nov. is established with two component species, M. haigi sp. nov. and M. tumidus sp. nov., based on collections from the West Australian Carnarvon Basin. Many of the belemnite guards have retained pristine biogenic calcite, free from diagenetic overprint, as demonstrated by the luminescence properties of polished thin sections examined by electron microprobe imaging and by analysis for trace element contents by inductively coupled plasma technology. Belemnite guards arranged in stratigraphic sequence for the eastern Australian Great Artesian Basin and from drill core from the Carnarvon Basin have been analysed for Sr-isotope contents. Strontium isotopic curves for these two sequences have been used for timescale resolution of the Australian Early Cretaceous System, by comparison with the global curve established from a range of northern hemisphere studies. The evaluation indicates that some adjustment to biostratigraphic zonations applied in Australia for timescale purposes, particularly that related to dinoflagellates, requires adjustment. Substantial paraconformities are indicated for both documented successions, embracing the Aptian-Albian boundary interval. Oxygen and carbon isotopic analysis has been applied to the same sample set examined for strontium contents, with the objective of illuminating the palaeoenvironmental context of Australian shallow marine environments of Early Cretaceous (Aptian-Cenomanian) age. The data indicate that oxygen and carbon isotopic systematics of epeiric association were perturbed by partial isolation from the global ocean. Isotope signatures for the sequence of the Great Artesian Basin reflect a combination of local scale influences, including dilution by riverine runoff, exchange with volcaniclastic sediment, unusual temperature regimes that applied in very extensive, shallow epicontinental water bodies and the peculiarities of <b>organic</b> <b>recycling</b> in such an environment. Oxygen-isotope values obtained from the Carnarvon Basin, representing an open-ocean continental margin sediment system, indicate southern hemisphere midlatitude late Aptian sea surface temperatures, that differ little from those which presently apply. A warming trend is apparent for the Albian-Cenomanian interval, representing greenhouse climatic conditions. Carbon-isotope values through the same interval show a complementary negative trend in b 13 C, attributed to C 02 enhancement in the atmosphere that accompanied global warming. Short period temperature excursions of as much as 5 °C are identified in the record, suggesting that climatic shifts of similar scale to those which characterised the Pleistocene Epoch also applied in the mid Cretaceous. Relative to values of b 13 Ccarb available from other studies of Albian - Cenomanian biogenic carbonate, those obtained from the Carnarvon Basin are unusually low, suggesting that low productivity characterised the water body in which its sedimentary succession accumulated through this time interval. The carbon-isotope record is incomplete for the intervals that should register oceanic anoxic episodes la (early Aptian), Ib (Aptian-Albian boundary interval) and Id (latest Albian). OAE Ib is expressed by a positive b 13 Ccarb excursion across the euxinic interval of the Toolebuc Formation in the Great Artesian Basin succession and a correlative positive excursion is apparent for the succession of the Carnarvon Basin. It is dated as early late Albian, - l 05 Ma, but its global significance is open to question. A matching negative excursion in b 13 Corg across the Toolebuc interval of the Great Artesian Basin is attributed to the influence of organic matter of continental provenance...|$|E
