5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often {{cooperated with}} Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They were initially on good terms, and al-Qassam's various official appointments required the mufti's prior consent. He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, {{in which one}} source claims al-Qassam's men were active. The two fell out in the mid-1930s, perhaps due to al-Qassam's independent line <b>of</b> <b>activism.</b> In 1933, al-Qassam sent an emissary to al-Husseini, requesting the latter's participation in a revolt against the British.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how social media influence collective {{action in the}} context <b>of</b> digital <b>activism.</b> This is achieved by using the concept of media affordance as a theoretical lens and applying it to the collective purposes of network building and synthesis, as suggested by mobilization theory. Employing latent class logit regression, we tested the proposed hypotheses {{based on data from}} 384 digital activism events in 100 countries, classifying success in digital activism as either partial or complete success. The results show that when the purpose <b>of</b> digital <b>activism</b> is network building, media with greater affordances for promoting environmental shaping were positively related to the success <b>of</b> digital <b>activism.</b> Conversely, when the purpose <b>of</b> digital <b>activism</b> is synthesis, media with greater affordances for promoting contagion were positively related to the success <b>of</b> digital <b>activism...</b>|$|R
