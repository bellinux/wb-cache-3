5|$|News {{sources have}} {{referred}} to the George Washington Memorial Bridge as a suicide bridge and, in December 2006, six emergency phones and 18 signs were installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{to encourage people to}} seek help instead of jumping. In late 2006 a group of community activists and political leaders living near the bridge created the Fremont Individuals and Employees Nonprofit to Decrease Suicides (FRIENDS), their primary focus being the installation of a suicide barrier <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

Louisville Fire & Rescue chief Greg Frederick decided that firefighters {{were not to be}} sent onto the bridge; a boat from the Harrods Creek Fire Department was used to put out the fire, as Louisville's fire boat did not have a hose that could reach the blaze <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> {{had become a}} serious problem. A 1978 study revealed that although the bridge could handle a peak 1,600 vehicles passing over the bridge per hour, excess traffic pushing it towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour could potentially cause gridlock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a high priority. A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a cable stayed superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project {{to be approved by}} mid-April 1983.|$|E
5|$|Construction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> piers {{began in}} 1929, with {{construction}} of the bridge following shortly afterwards in 1931, with its dedication held on February 22, 1932, George Washington's 200th birthday. It opened to traffic the same day.|$|E

5|$|London Bridge was {{the only}} {{physical}} connection between the City and {{the south side of}} the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> which acted as a firebreak.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{reports have}} been written about the high {{incidence}} of suicide <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> many of them using the bridge as a case study in fields ranging from suicide prevention to the effects of prehospital care on trauma victims.|$|E

5000|$|... "Descending geese of the koto bridges") parodies Wild Geese Descending on a Sandbank ( [...] ), which {{traditionally}} {{depicts a}} flock of geese descends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> banks of the Xiang River. The title poses translation difficulties. Common translations include Descending Geese of <b>the</b> Koto <b>Bridges</b> and Descending Geese of <b>the</b> Koto <b>Bridges,</b> suggesting geese landing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> of <b>the</b> koto. A more word-for-word translation as The Koto Bridges' Descending Geese reveals ambuiguity in the original title: it may also refer to geese landing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridges,</b> or to <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> representing <b>the</b> geese themselves.|$|R

5|$|On December 17, 2010, PennDOT's District 4 downposted the bridge's {{weight limit}} to four tons due to {{deterioration}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> PennDOT will also front $350,000$500,000 to replace 70 planks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> which will then restore the weight back to seven tons. Signage has already adjusted for the demotion by both PennDOT and Sullivan County. Replacement began on April 18, 2011 of 64 stringer beams and on May 25, {{the project was}} completed, {{less than a month}} ahead of schedule. The seven-ton weight limit was also restored {{as a result of the}} completed construction. The cost of the project totaled out to $493,000 (2011USD).|$|E

5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes {{closure of the}} bridge for a few hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic toll collection system was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.|$|E

5|$|The bridge cost £1.5 million, {{as part of}} a wider {{road system}} costing £3.5 million. Construction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> took 2 years and 5 months. It was officially opened by Governor Charles Gairdner on 13 November 1959. He {{unveiled}} a plaque <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> together with Premier Sir David Brand, Commissioner of Main Roads J. Digby Leach and Works Minister Wild. Gairdner was also the first person to drive across the new bridge. It was hoped at this stage that the debt raised to pay for the bridge would be repaid by the Government within 12 months.|$|E

5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To make it look like it was raining during the scenes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E
5|$|With {{the closure}} of the rail terminus, Vauxhall Bridge's main source of revenue was {{visitors}} to the Vauxhall Gardens pleasure park. In addition to people visiting the Gardens themselves, Vauxhall Gardens were used as a launch point for hot air balloon flights, and large crowds would gather <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and surrounding streets to watch the flights. A large crowd also assembled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in September 1844 to watch Mister Barry, a clown from Astley's Amphitheatre, sail from Vauxhall Bridge to Westminster Bridge in a washtub towed by geese.|$|E
5|$|A local landmark, the Fremont Troll—a large cement {{sculpture}} of a troll clutching a real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge's north end in 1990. Up to half of the $40,000 cost for the artwork was donated from Seattle's Neighborhood Matching Fund, a local program {{to raise money for}} community projects. The sculpture was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction and large floodlights were installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> to discourage further damage.|$|E
