Enrichment cultures utilizing capsaicin were successfully initiated using Capsicum-derived plant material or leaves of tomato (a related Solanaceae) as inocula. No <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inoculum</b> examined yielded positive enrichments. Of 25 isolates obtained from enrichments: all utilized 8 -methylnonanoic acid; nine were found capable of degrading capsaicin as sole carbon and energy source; 11 were found capable of utilizing vanillylamine; but only two strains could use either of these latter two compounds as sole nitrogen source. Phylogenetic analysis of capsaicin degraders revealed them to be strains of Variovorax and Ralstonia, whereas the vanillylamine degraders were strains of Pseudomonas and Variovorax. Neither of the two strains isolated from one enrichment culture originally inoculated with dried pepper fruit was capable of using capsaicin as sole carbon and nitrogen source. However, good growth was achieved under such conditions when the two isolates, a strain of Variovorax paradoxus that degraded capsaicin when provided with ammonium, and a vanillylamine degrading strain of Pseudomonas putida, were cultured together. A cross-feeding of capsaicin-derived carbon and nitrogen between members of pepper-associated consortia is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Early {{colonization}} of crop roots by arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is considered beneficial but its importance likely {{depends on the}} possible stresses faced by the host plant. Manganese toxicity is one such stress that AM can alleviate. Colonization initiated by extraradical mycelium (ERM) is faster than <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inoculum.</b> No-till creates the possibility of encouraging inoculation via this source. At seeding time the ERM available for colonizing plants under no-till would have developed in association with previous crops or those weeds that germinated after the first autumn rain. However, the long, hot and dry summer under Mediterranean conditions might reduce {{the effectiveness of the}} ERM to colonize the new crop. The hypothesis that an intact ERM developed by weeds can affect the earlier AM {{colonization of}} wheat and alleviate Mn toxicity was tested in a pot experiment. Two mycotrophic (Ornithopus compressus L., Lolium rigidum Gaudin), and one non-mycotrophic (Silene galica L) weed species were grown for 7 weeks before being controlled with Glyphosate (the ERM remaining intact) or by mechanical disturbance (which also disrupted the ERM). Wheat was then planted and allowed to grow for 21 days. AM colonization, plant dry weight and shoot nutrient content were evaluated for both weeds and wheat. When an intact mycelium was present at the seeding of wheat (treatments with Ornithopus compressus and Lolium rigidum controlled by Glyphosate) there was a threefold increase in the AM colonization rate and growth of the crop compared with results for all the other treatments. The enhanced growth of wheat was associated with an alleviation of Mn toxicity, consistent with the hypothesis. However, {{there was a significant difference}} of the wheat growth after Ornithopus and Lolium (1. 9 times), suggesting functional diversity within mycotrophic weeds and crops...|$|E

The aim {{of this research was}} to detect <b>other</b> possible <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>inoculum</b> throughout the different nursery stages by classical and molecular techniques (nested-PCR and multiplex nested-PCR). Results revealed the presence of the I. liriodendri and/or I. macrodidyma complex in grapevine rootstock and scion cuttings, cutting tools, water from hydration tanks, well water, callusing medium, one indoor air sample and soils collected from mother fields and nurseries. “ Cylindrocarpon ” pauciseptatum was only detected in the callusing medium, nursery soils, rooted-graftlings and on the root pruning machine. Forty four isolates obtained from soils (mother fields and nurseries) and rooted graftlings (six grapevine cultivar/rootstock combinations) were sequenced for part of histone H 3 gene to resolve the species.

Progression of Phomopsis infection throughout both growing seasons showed that the severity of disease on stems, pod, and seeds was greater in the continuous soybean, less in the corn-soybean, and least in the continuous corn rotations. No relationship between seed-borne inoculum and disease severity was detected in either growing season, thus providing circumstantial evidence that soil-borne inoculum was the major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>inoculum</b> for the disease. Pattern of infection on plants and relationships between lodging and pod infection further substantiated this conclusion. Differences in soil potassium levels between the fields did not influence seed infection by Phomopsis in either growing season;In a 1980 field experiment, in which Phomopsis-free and artificially inoculated viable infected and nonviable infested seed were planted in the continuous soybean and continuous corn fields, disease progression was similar for all seed treatments in the continuous soybean field, but more disease developed in the continuous corn field in plots containing viable infected seed.

In general, moderate temperature, high relative humidity, and heavy dew during the growing season favors the development of this disease.
