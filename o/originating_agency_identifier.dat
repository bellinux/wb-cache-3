50|$|The <b>originating</b> <b>agency</b> {{must ensure}} that {{complete}} identifying personal particulars of the person, in respect of whom the LOC is to be opened, are clearly mentioned in the prescribed proforma. The LOC will not be opened for less than three identity parameters other than name of the subject.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{agencies}} submit SRS data {{in written}} documents that must then be hand {{entered into a}} computer system for statistical analysis. NIBRS data are submitted electronically {{in the form of}} ASCII text files. These files are then processed without the need for a person to input the data (except at the <b>originating</b> <b>agency's</b> initial filing of the report into their computer system).|$|R
50|$|Authorized local, state, tribal, {{and federal}} {{agencies}} can update NCIS Index data via the NCIC front end, or by electronic batch files. In addition, the NICS Section receives calls, often in emergency situations, from mental health care providers, police departments, and family members requesting placement of individuals into the NICS Index. Documentation justifying entry into the NICS Index must be available to <b>originating</b> <b>agencies.</b>|$|R
50|$|An LOC {{is valid}} {{for a period}} of one year. However, in case the <b>originating</b> <b>agency</b> wants to extend the {{validity}} beyond one year it can ask for the extension before the expiry of the one year period. If no request is made for the extension of the LOC within the stipulated period of one year, the Immigration Officer concerned is authorized to suspend the LOC.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) is {{the central}} police {{database}} where Canada's law enforcement agencies can access information {{on a number of}} matters. It is Canada's only national law enforcement networking computer system ensuring officers all across the country can access the same information. There are approximately 3 million files generated each year and {{is the responsibility of the}} <b>originating</b> <b>agency</b> to ensure the data integrity of each file.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) {{represents one of the}} largest reorganizations of government agencies and operations in recent history.

GAO was asked to identify opportunities for DHS to improve its management integration. ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{records at}} NARA {{are in the}} public domain, as works of the federal {{government}} are excluded from copyright protection. However, records from other sources may still be protected by copyright or donor agreements. Executive Order 13526 directs <b>originating</b> <b>agencies</b> to declassify documents if possible before shipment to NARA for long-term storage, but NARA also stores some classified documents until they can be declassified. Its Information Security Oversight Office monitors and sets policy for the U.S. government's security classification system.|$|R
50|$|Records are {{transferred}} to WNRC {{when they are}} no longer needed by the respective agencies, including the records of the Federal Courts in Columbia and the Armed Forces. Those records remain at the WNRC until acceptance as permanent records in the repository, or else they are destroyed and recycled. The records are tracked individually in a database from the time they arrive at the WNRC. While court records are freely available to the public, the majority of records is controlled by their respective <b>originating</b> <b>agency,</b> and all records are subject to the access restrictions specific to that agency.|$|R
5000|$|ISE-SAR Functional Standard: The {{application}} of the most current version of the ISE-SAR FS, which reinforces constitutional standards, including the protection of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment and limitations {{on the use of}} certain factors—including race, ethnicity, national origin, or religious affiliation—in the gathering, collecting, storing, and sharing of information about individuals. The standard also includes reliability indicators, included as a result of input from privacy advocates. The functional standard, through the use of Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD), allows the <b>originating</b> <b>agency</b> to include or not include fields that contain personal information based upon the agency’s rules and policies.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn 2006, a Data Exchange Model for Archiving (MEDONA) was {{developed}} by the French Directorate of Archives (Ministry of Culture and Communication) and the Directorate-General for the modernization of the State (Ministry for Economic Affairs, Finance and Industry). The Model is currently being standardized by a working group of the French Association of Standardization including archivists of public archival agencies, storage services providers, software editors and IT consultants. MEDONA provides a model for the various specific transactions, which occur between the archival agencies and its partners (<b>originating</b> <b>agencies,</b> access requesters, other archival agencies, control authorities), i. e. : transfer; delivery; modification notification; destruction notification; restitution. Each transaction is modeled as a scenario for exchange of messages. These messages are formally defined as XML schemas...|$|R

50|$|Executive Order 13526 {{establishes}} the mechanisms for most declassifications, within the laws passed by Congress. The <b>originating</b> <b>agency</b> assigns a declassification date, by default 10 years. After 25 years declassification review is automatic, with nine narrow exceptions that allow information {{to continue to}} be classified. At 50 years there are two exceptions, and classifications beyond 75 years require special permission. Because of changes in policy and circumstances, agencies are expected to actively review documents that have been classified for fewer than 25 years. They must also respond to Mandatory Declassification Review and Freedom of Information Act requests. The National Archives and Records Administration houses the National Declassification Center to coordinate reviews and Information Security Oversight Office to promulgate rules and enforce quality measures across all agencies. NARA reviews documents on behalf of defunct agencies and permanently stores declassified documents for public inspection. The Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel has representatives from several agencies.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{is one of}} several that report the results of a study carried out by the EQL during 1975. This investigation was directed at definition of and support for a geothermal resource demonstration program to be conducted at the Salton Sea KGRA: The <b>originating</b> <b>agency</b> was NSF/RANN, but in January of 1975 the responsibility for the project was transferred to ERDA. It was anticipated that the results of the research would be continuously fed in to the demonstration program, which was originally anticipated to be initiated during the period of this present grant. However, the demonstration program was not initiated during that time. Those programs are now getting underway, and it is hoped that these results may be useful to ERDA and the contractors in arriving at a program of research. A summary of results in each of the several research areas is given in the following paragraphs, in order that the reader can place the present report in context...|$|R

40|$|POLICY [REVISED] [REVISED] The Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS) {{will allow}} a {{licensed}} foster family home or a foster family home with an application pending to transfer their current license or application {{to a different}} licensing agency. If a foster family home license transfer is requested, the receiving agency must complete a new Foster Family/Adoptive Home Preparation Assessment Summary (home study). The remainder of the licensing file must be copied and sent by the <b>originating</b> <b>agency</b> to the new agency. It is best practice to send the old home study with the file so the new licensing agency has all historical information on the family. The new licensing worker 1 {{will be required to}} complete a new home study. Note: For purposes of this policy, the “licensing file ” is defined as those documents which are required by Indiana code to license a resource home. See separate polices, 12. 3 Initial Licensing Packet and 12. 11 Resource Family Preparation Assessment. A foster family home license can only be transferred if the home is in good standing with the agency (i. e. no corrective or disciplinary action) unless prior approval is granted by the Central Office Licensing Unit...|$|R

40|$|Heat stress {{has been}} a longstanding hazard for workers across many industries. Climate change creates new {{environmental}} issues for the workplace. Cal/OSHA is preparing a draft standard to minimize heat-related illness and injury among indoor workers. Indoor heat stress could lead to morbidity and mortality of workers {{as well as economic}} burdens and impacted productivity to industries. The goal of this research was to identify the existing literature (standards/guidelines and research articles) and discuss if there were sufficient research data available to implement an indoor workplace heat stress prevention standard in California. Existing national and local enforceable standards and recommended guidelines have been collected. Each standard/guideline was evaluated with the metrics of the <b>originating</b> <b>agency,</b> workplace coverage (indoor/outdoor), year established, measurements, and control methods. A comprehensive search of Pubmed and SciFinder databases was conducted for evidence of measurements and control methods to identify, classify, and evaluate them. In conclusion, a Cal/OSHA standard is feasible because the scientific database is adequate. Weather it is practical depends on cost, ease of field management, stake-holder buy-in, and factors outside of the scientific arena. An indoor heat standard should cover all indoor workplaces. American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) provided the most accurate and precise measurement method, however, required a Wet Bulb Globe Temperature device and several steps to make determination. The control hierarchy with an emphasize on engineering controls should be implemented at all hot workplace. Administrative controls, such as training, work-rest schedule, hydration, and acclimatization, are bottom lines if engineering controls are not feasible. Cooling vest is effective in preventing heat accumulation, however, may not fit other personal protective equipment. Future studies should focus on effectiveness evaluation of existing standards, cost-benefit of measurement and control methods and identification of impacted industries...|$|R

However, {{questions have been raised}} {{about the extent to which}} SBA has used its lender risk rating system to improve its oversight of lenders. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to examine (1) how SBA's risk rating system compares with those used by federal financial regulators and lenders and the system's usefulness for predicting lender performance and (2) how SBA uses the lender risk rating system in its lender oversight activities. To meet these objectives, GAO reviewed SBA documents; interviewed officials from three federal financial regulators and 10 large SBA lenders; analyzed SBA loan data; and interviewed SBA officials. ...|$|R
40|$|The Center for Progres­sive Reform {{undertook}} {{an empirical}} {{study of the}} Office of Information of Regulatory Affairs, the White House office that reviews every significant regulation issue by Executive Branch agencies. The study assembled an unprecedented portrait of its behav­ior during the decade from October 16, 2001, when notices of meetings with outside parties were first available on the Internet, until June 1, 2011. OIRA conducted 6, 194 separate reviews of regulatory submissions, holding 1, 080 meetings that involved 5, 759 ap­pearances by outside par­ticipants. Both the final report and the database we assembled {{are available on the}} CPR website, at pro­gressivereform. org. OIRA has adopted perhaps the most extreme open-door policy in Washington with respect to rulemaking proposals, agreeing to meet with anyone who asks for such an audience, whether or not the <b>originating</b> <b>agency</b> has officially submitted the matter for review. Equal access to OIRA does not produce balanced participation. Over the last decade, 65 {{percent of the people who}} met with OIRA represented industry interests — about five times the number appearing on behalf of public interest groups. President Obama’s OIRA did only somewhat better than President George W. Bush’s, with a 62 percent industry participation rate to Bush’s 68 percent, and a 16 percent public interest group participation level to Bush’s 10 percent. Even under this ostensibly transformative president, who pledged to rid his administration of the undue influence of well-heeled lobbyists and conduct government in the open, industry visits outnumbered public interest visits by a ratio of almost four to one. OIRA’s early interference in the formulation of regulatory policy is especially troubling. Forty-three percent of these meetings took place before the agency’s proposal was even released to the public. The percentage of meetings that occurred at this pre-proposal stage has actually been greater during the Obama administration (47 percent) than it was during the Bush II administration (39 percent). Early interference frustrates transparency and maintenance of a level playing field because the public sees the agency’s proposal only after it has been reshaped by lobbyists and OIRA economists. It also exposes agencies to White House political pressure before they have even had the opportunity to seek public comment on more stringent proposals...|$|R

In 1960, the National Committee for Space Research (NCSR) was formed by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The committee was formed to increase research activities across the academic communities in Israel. While at the time establishing a space program was not particularly one of its goals, during the '60s through the late '70s, the committee developed the infrastructure needed {{for research and development}} in space exploration and sciences.

40|$|Abstract. We {{look at a}} game theoretic {{scenario}} in which an industrial firm has the option of voluntarily controlling the pollutants it <b>originates.</b> A regulating <b>agency</b> sets the tax rate on corporate profits {{as well as a}} Pigouvian pollution tax: preset percentages of projected cleanup cost which must be covered by the firm. The regulator spends tax revenue to cover the remaining percentage of cleanup costs, and also has the option of subsidizing additional pollution prevention measures. We describe and illustrate the pure and mixed Nash equilibria arising in several variations of the game. We identify situations with multiple simultaneous equilibria, and classify those for which the mixed strategy prevents more pollution than either pure strategy...|$|R
