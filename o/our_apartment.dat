500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} {{a photograph of}} Dylan with Suze Rotolo. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by CBS staff photographer Don Hunstein {{at the corner of}} Jones Street and West 4th Street in the West Village, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. <b>Our</b> <b>apartment</b> was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat." [...] In her memoir, A Freewheelin' Time, Rotolo analyzed the significance of the cover art: ...|$|E
500|$|Secrets reveal {{themselves}} steadily {{throughout the}} episode. Xander fears that his future marriage will turn {{him into an}} argumentative drunk like his father. He attempts to avoid his fears through the song [...] "I'll Never Tell", singing [...] "'coz there's nothing to tell", after summoning Sweet to Sunnydale to show him that he and Anya will be happy. Amid the various annoyances Xander and Anya express through this song, some verses are clear-sighted observations of behavior, such as Anya's accusation that Xander—once in love with Buffy—uses Buffy as a mother figure to hide behind. Anya also avoids the truth by burying herself in wedding plans without thinking critically about what being married will entail; instead she considers Xander an accessory to her desired lifestyle. Of all the characters, Anya is the most preoccupied with the style of singing and songs, demanding to know if Spike sang [...] "a breakaway pop hit, or a book number", and asking Dawn if the pterodactyl she facetiously says {{she gave birth to}} also broke into song. Anya and Xander's duet is the only song in the episode to address the audience directly. During the long single-shot scene when she and Xander talk over each other insisting to Giles that evil must be at play, Anya refers to the audience, saying [...] "It was like we were being watched... Like there was a wall missing ... in <b>our</b> <b>apartment...</b> Like there were only three walls and not a fourth wall." [...] Albright asserts that Anya's constant preoccupation with her and others' performances indicates that she has serious doubts about her future supporting role as Xander's wife.|$|E

50|$|The {{goal is to}} have {{wireless}} access throughout the City- in schools, homes, and businesses and on the street. Because technology hasn’t advanced too far past the wireless routers we all use in <b>our</b> <b>apartments,</b> the wireless network will consist of maybe a thousand points of connectivity to blanket the city.|$|R

60|$|Before {{he could}} answer Oros {{appeared}} from round the rock, and, bowing {{with more than}} his usual humility to Leo, said that the Hesea desired our presence at a service in the Sanctuary.

60|$|The banker's dinner-party over, we {{returned}} to <b>our</b> <b>apartments,</b> having dropped Major Pendennis at his lodgings, and there, as the custom is amongst most friendly married couples, talked over {{the company and the}} dinner. I thought my wife would naturally have liked Sir Barnes Newcome, who was very attentive to her, took her to dinner as the bride, and talked ceaselessly to her during the whole entertainment.|$|R
6000|$|On Sunday, the twenty-fifth of November, after a {{delightful}} dinner with Augustus Thomas {{in his home}} at New Rochelle, Zulime and I returned to <b>our</b> <b>apartment</b> in happiest humor, to be met by a telegram which went to my heart like the thrust of a bayonet. It was from my father. [...] "Your mother is very low. Come at once." ...|$|E
60|$|Slowly we rode {{back down}} the valley, entranced, almost oppressed, by the incommunicable splendor of forested hills and sunset sky. It was {{with a sense of}} actual relief that we reëntered <b>our</b> <b>apartment.</b> Our eyes ached with the effort to seize and retain the {{radiance}} without, and our minds, gorged with magnificence, were grateful for the subdued light, the ugly furniture, the dingy walls of our commonplace little hotel.|$|E

"Presently we were hungry, and we {{went from}} <b>our</b> <b>apartment,</b> going by a strange passage with a moving floor, until {{we came to the}} great breakfast-room--there was a {{fountain}} and music.

5000|$|Let us all {{together}} switch {{off the light}} in <b>our</b> <b>apartments</b> for several minutes on October 16 evening, and put burning candles on the windows.

60|$|In Bachelors' Hall, as we styled <b>our</b> <b>apartments,</b> {{we had an}} inveterate {{habit of}} {{practical}} joking, which, however interesting and agreeable it might be at most times, was in some circumstances rather inconvenient. To guard against it at such times {{we were in the}} habit of retiring to our respective dens and barricading the doors, the locks being sometimes incapable of standing the strain brought to bear on them.|$|R
6000|$|At this moment, {{however, the}} gong for {{dressing}} sounded, {{and we went}} to <b>our</b> several <b>apartments,</b> after this emotional specimen of [...] "Evenings at Home." ...|$|R
60|$|Donning my trappings {{and weapons}} I hastened to the sheds, and soon had out both my machine and Kantos Kan's. Making his fast behind mine I started my engine, and {{skimming}} {{over the edge}} of the roof I dove down into the streets of the city far below the plane usually occupied by the air patrol. In less than a minute I was settling safely upon the roof of <b>our</b> <b>apartment</b> beside the astonished Kantos Kan.|$|E
60|$|We {{decided to}} break up our little home, and while I went to Mexico, Zulime planned to visit Chicago and await my return. I was loth to {{dismantle}} <b>our</b> <b>apartment,</b> and when at the station I said good-by to my little daughter and her mother, I was almost persuaded that nothing was worth the pain of parting from that small shining face and those seeking, clinging hands. She had grown deep into my heart during those winter months.|$|E

5000|$|Alexandra Feodorovna {{wrote in}} her memoirs of her first years in Russia, [...] "We both were truly happy only when we found {{ourselves}} alone in <b>our</b> <b>apartments,</b> with me sitting on his knees while he was loving and tender". Nicholas nicknamed his wife [...] "Mouffy". For eight years, {{during the reign of}} Tsar Alexander I, the couple lived quietly. Tsar Alexander I had no surviving children and his heir, Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, renounced his succession rights in 1822, making Nicholas heir to the throne.|$|R
60|$|Without {{effort at}} {{concealment}} I hastened to {{the vicinity of}} our quarters, where I felt sure I should find Kantos Kan. As I neared the building I became more careful, as I judged, and rightly, that the place would be guarded. Several men in civilian metal loitered near the front entrance and in the rear were others. My only means of reaching, unseen, the upper story where <b>our</b> <b>apartments</b> were situated was through an adjoining building, and after considerable maneuvering I managed to attain {{the roof of a}} shop several doors away.|$|R

[...] "I want {{to put you in}} touch with the situation, as I may need your help to-night. Let me show you the evolution of this case so far as I have been able to follow it.

60|$|I made no hesitation, but {{told him}} I would do it. I made some {{ceremony}} in letting him {{understand that it}} was wholly on his account; and that, seeing I could not prevail on him, I would show my respect to him by my concern for his son. He sent the next day for his son; and in about twenty days {{he came back with}} the messenger, bringing six or seven horses, loaded with very rich furs, which, in the whole, amounted to a very great value. His servants brought the horses into the town, but left the young lord at a distance till night, when he came incognito into <b>our</b> <b>apartment,</b> and his father presented him to me; and, in short, we concerted the manner of our travelling, and everything proper for the journey.|$|E
60|$|At Paris, {{just after}} dark one gusty {{evening in the}} autumn of 18-, I was enjoying the twofold luxury of {{meditation}} and a meerschaum, in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or book-closet, au troisiême, No. 33, Rue Dunôt, Faubourg St. Germain. For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogêt. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of <b>our</b> <b>apartment</b> was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G--, the Prefect of the Parisian police.|$|E
60|$|For I've {{forgot to}} inform you that my master was very intimat in this house; and that we were now comfortably settled at the Hotel Mirabew (pronounced Marobo in French), in the Rew delly Pay, at Paris. We had our cab, and two riding horses; our banker's book, and a {{thousand}} pound for a balantz at Lafitt's; our club {{at the corner of the}} Rew Gramong; our share in a box at the oppras; <b>our</b> <b>apartments,</b> spacious and elygant; our swarries at court; our dinners at his excellency Lord Bobtail's and elsewhere. Thanks to poar Dawkins's five thousand pound, we were as complete gentlemen as any in Paris.|$|R
60|$|When the {{carriage}} stopped, {{the three women}} sprang out at once, and how they all got through the door, I cannot tell. There was such a tremendous ring at {{the gate of the}} court that the old concierge, who opened it by pulling a wire in his little den somewhere in the rear, must have been dreadfully startled in his sleep. We rushed through the court and up the stairs past <b>our</b> <b>apartments</b> to Pomona's room; and there in the open doorway stood Jonas, his coat off, his sandy hair in wild confusion, his face radiant, and in his hands Little Kensington in her nightgown.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{the king}} said, [...] "since the {{audience}} is over, and none other comes before us with petitions, we will retire to <b>our</b> private <b>apartments,</b> and there my brother Alfred will present you to the fair Elswitha, his wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'On {{the morning}} of the day on which we arrived my uncle went abroad, and did not return for some hours. Meantime I had no other {{amusement}} than to listen to the tumult of noises which succeeded each other, or reigned in confusion together during the whole morning. Paris I had thought the most noisy capital in the world, but Paris seemed midnight silence compared to London. Cannon thundered near and at a distance--drums, trumpets, and military music of every kind, rolled, flourished, and pierced the clouds, almost without intermission. To fill up the concert, bells pealed incessantly from a hundred steeples. The acclamations of an immense multitude were heard from time to time, like the roaring of a mighty ocean, and all this without my being able to glean the least idea of what was going on, for the windows of <b>our</b> <b>apartment</b> looked upon a waste backyard, which seemed totally deserted. My curiosity became extreme, for I was satisfied, at length, that it must be some festival of the highest order which called forth these incessant sounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Viscount de Florac {{called to}} dine with us. The Colonel {{said he did}} not care about going out: and so the Viscount and I went together. Trois Freres Provencaux--he ordered the dinner and of course I paid. Then we went to a little theatre, and he took me behind the scenes--such a queer place! We went to the loge of Mademoiselle Fine who acted the part of 'Le petit Tambour,' in which she sings a famous song with a drum. He asked her and several {{literary}} fellows to supper at the Cafe Anglais. And I came home ever so late, and lost twenty napoleons at a game called bouillotte. It was all the change out of a twenty-pound note which dear old Binnie gave me before we set out, with a quotation out of Horace, you know, about Neque tu choreas sperne puer. O me! how guilty I felt as I walked home at ever so much o'clock to the Hotel de la Terrasse, and sneaked into <b>our</b> <b>apartment!</b> But the Colonel was sound asleep. His dear old boots stood sentries at his bedroom door, and I slunk into mine as silently as I could.|$|E
60|$|Besides my old Ohio-time friend Moncure D. Conway, {{who paid}} us a visit, {{and in his}} {{immediate}} relations with literary Boston seemed to bring the mountain to Mahomet, I saw no one else more literary than Henry Ward Beecher. He was passing through Venice {{on his way to}} those efforts in England in behalf of the Union which had a certain great effect at the time; and in the tiny parlor of <b>our</b> <b>apartment</b> on the Grand Canal, I can still see him sitting athletic, almost pugilistic, of presence, with his strong face, but kind, framed in long hair that swept above his massive forehead, and fell to the level of his humorously smiling mouth. His eyes quaintly gleamed at the things we told him of our life in the strange place; but he only partly relaxed from his strenuous pose, and the hands that lay upon his knees were clinched. Afterwards, as he passed our balcony in a gondola, he lifted the brave red fez he was wearing (many people wore the fez for one caprice or another) and saluted our eagle and us: we were often on the balcony behind the shield to attest the authenticity of the American eagle.|$|E
6000|$|On Monday (30th May), {{though it}} began with heavy rain, we set early about our {{preparations}} for departure, [...] . and, at about three, we left the Hotel des Colonies. It is a very comfortable hotel, though expensive. The Restaurant connected with it occupies the enclosed court-yard and the arcades around it; {{and it was a}} good amusement to look down from the surrounding gallery, communicating with <b>our</b> <b>apartments,</b> and see the fashion and manner of French eating, all the time going forward. In sunny weather a great awning is spread over the whole court, across from the upper stories of the house. There is a grass-plat in the middle, and a very spacious and airy dining-saloon is thus formed.|$|R
60|$|I stopped her. We {{had reached}} the fourth floor, where <b>our</b> <b>apartments</b> were. With {{the key in the}} lock I turned and faced her for a moment. She was as tall as I, and a certain grace of {{carriage}} which she had always possessed, and which had grown with her years, redeemed her completely from the gaucherie of her uncomfortable age. Her features had gained in strength, and lost nothing in delicacy. She wore even her simple clothes with the nameless grace which must surely have come to her from inheritance. I spoke to her then seriously. Yet if I had tried I could not have kept the kindness from my tone.|$|R
60|$|It was my mother's custom {{to receive}} all pilgrim wayfarers and beggars in this {{courtyard}} at noontide twice in {{each week to}} bestow upon them food and alms. Rarely was she, herself, present at that alms-giving; more rarely still was I. It was Fra Gervasio who discharged the office of almoner on the Countess of Mondolfo's behalf. Occasionally the whines and snarls of the motley crowd that gathered there--for they were not infrequently quarrelsome--reached us in the maschio tower where we had <b>our</b> <b>apartments.</b> But {{on the day of}} which I speak I chanced to stand in the pillared gallery above the courtyard, watching the heaving, surging human mass below, for the concourse was greater than usual.|$|R
