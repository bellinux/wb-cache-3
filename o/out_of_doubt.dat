40|$|Object loss, {{along with}} trauma, are {{concepts}} dear {{to us as}} psychoanalysts. My own work with these topics, and my experience of great losses early in life, make me something of an expert, but I rarely find myself {{in the literature on}} the subject. This reaction has given me cause for the reflections that are the subject of this essay. A previous reflection called “The Babel of Trauma, ” in which I examined the current literature on the subject, ended up in the proverbial drawer, forgotten, partly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doubts</b> that my criticism of well-established theories could be justified. Recently, however, I was encouraged to re-examine my response the theories of trauma in general and object loss specifically. I had the unforgettable experience of recounting the losses I suffered during World War II in an address to a large audience at the International Psychoanalytical Association Congress in Berlin, where I was accorded the warmest reception imaginable. My story told of hardships during World War II as my family and I tried to evade deportation and death, followed by the gradual loss of everything and everyone I knew. I told of the massive struggle for me, born in Germany, to reconnect, after years of analysis...|$|R

It might mean that the School had won easily--they had looked like making a big score when he had left the ground--in which case public opinion would be more lenient towards him.

40|$|Existing pharmaceuticalisation {{research}} {{denotes the}} salience of expectations in novel medicines and in the medical contexts through which these may be accessed. Specific processes of expectation such as hope and trust, alongside their shaping of patients' lifeworlds around pharmaceutical use, remain neglected however. Considering data from in-depth interviews and observations involving thirteen patients with advanced-stage cancer diagnoses who were or had recently been involved in clinical trials, we develop an interpretative phenomenological analysis {{of the influence of}} hope and trust upon the accessing of novel medicines through trials, illuminating the depth and texture of pharmaceuticalisation at the micro-level. Trust in clinicians and hope in trial medicines, for self and future patients, were important in the reconfiguring of patients' horizon of possibilities when accessing new medicines. Interwoven processes of trust and hope, embedded within heightened vulnerability, sustained the bracketing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>doubts</b> regarding medicines, trials and professionals. The need to maintain hopes, and trusting relations with professionals who facilitated these hopes, generated meaning and momentum of medicines use which inhibited disengagement from trials. Findings indicate the taken-for-granted, as well as more reflexive, pursuit of solutions through medicines, which in this case-study enabled the generation of evidence through trial involvement. Analyses of micro-level dynamics within both downstream-consumption and upstream-substantiation of pharmaceutical solutions assist more nuanced accounts of interests, agency and expectations within pharmaceuticalisatio...|$|R
60|$|It is {{unnecessary}} {{to dwell on}} the surprise with which all present, or the delight with which Bluewater and Wycherly heard this extraordinary announcement. A cry escaped Mildred, who threw herself on Mrs. Dutton's neck, entwining it with her arms, convulsively, as if refusing to permit the tie that had so long bound them together, to be thus rudely torn asunder. But half an hour of weeping, and of the tenderest consolations, calmed the poor girl a little, and she was able to listen to the explanations. These were exceedingly simple, and so clear, as, in connection with the other evidence, to put the facts <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all <b>doubt.</b>|$|R

Arjoun shrinks from fighting because friends and relatives are engaged on both sides, and he dreads hell if he kills one of them.

6000|$|The contradiction, as {{it seems}} to us, {{resolves}} itself into an essential, easily apprehensible, if mystical, unity.
