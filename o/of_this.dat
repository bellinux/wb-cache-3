The misery of man appears like childish petulance, when we explore the steady and prodigal provision that has been made for his support and delight on this green ball which floats him through the heavens. What angels invented these splendid ornaments, these rich conveniences, <b>this</b> ocean <b>of</b> air above, <b>this</b> ocean <b>of</b> water beneath, <b>this</b> firmament <b>of</b> earth between? <b>this</b> zodiac <b>of</b> lights, <b>this</b> tent <b>of</b> dropping clouds, <b>this</b> striped coat <b>of</b> climates, <b>this</b> fourfold year?
