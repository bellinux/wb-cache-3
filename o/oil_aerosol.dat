40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Crankcase ventilation contributes significantly to diesel engine particulate emissions. Future regulations will not only limit the mass of particulate matter, but also the number of particles. Controlling the source of crankcase emissions is critical to meeting the perennial legislation. Deficiency {{in the understanding of}} crankcase emissions generation and the contribution of lubricating oil has been addressed in detail by the experimental study presented in this thesis. A plethora of high speed laser optical diagnostics techniques have been employed to deduce the main mechanisms of crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> generation. Novel images have captured oil atomisation and passive oil distribution around the crankcase of an optically accessed, motored, four cylinder, off highway, heavy duty, diesel engine. Rayleigh type ligament breakup of oil films present on the surface of dynamic components, most notably the crankshaft, camshaft and valve rockers generated oil drops below 10 micrometers. Data illustrated not only crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> generation at source, but it has provided valuable information on methods to control <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> generation and improve oil circuit efficiency. The feasibility of utilising computational fluid dynamics to predict crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> generation has been successfully assessed using the experimental data. Particle sampling has characterised the crankcase emissions from both a fired and motored diesel engine crankcase. The evolution of submicron crankcase particles down to 5 nm has been recorded from both engines, including the isolated contribution of engine oil, at a wide range of engine test points. Results have provided constructive insight into the generation and control of this complex emission. The main mechanism of crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> generation was found to be crankshaft oil atomisation. This atomisation process has been analysed in detail, involving high speed imaging of primary and satellite drop generation and high speed digital particle image velocity of the crankshaft air flow. A promising mechanism of regulating and controlling crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> emissions at source has been studied experimentally...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-three new filter samples, {{including}} three different medium types, {{were tested in}} a small scale test-rig using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). The filtration efficiencies for ultrafine particles (UFPs) and particles of the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) were determined. The filters were of class F 5 -F 9 according to the European filter standard, which roughly corresponds to MERV 9 -MERV 15 according to the US-standard. The filters were challenged by the indoor aerosol prevailing in the laboratory. Additional tests were made using an <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol.</b> With the indoor aerosol, charged synthetic filters showed substantially higher MPPS efficiencies than glass fiber and uncharged synthetic filters of the same class did. With the <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol,</b> the different filter media types, belonging to the same filter class, showed similar efficiencies.

DEHP has been used for many years to generate a polydisperse aerosol test atmosphere in testing and to determine facial leakage in individual respirator wearers by quantifying aerosol leakage by light scattering photometry.

Exposure to various compounds produced {{a range of}} intensities for locomotory behavior in snakes. Essential oils comprised of 10 g liter - 1 solutions of cedarwood, cinnamon, sage, juniper berry, lavender and rosemary each were potent snake irritants. Brown treesnakes exposed to a 2 -s burst of aerosol of these oils exhibited prolonged, violent undirected locomotory behavior. In contrast, exposure to a 10 g liter- 1 concentration of ginger <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> caused snakes to locomote, but in a deliberate, directed manner.

40|$|Abstract Previous {{studies using}} {{particle}} image velocimetry (PIV) and laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) {{have raised the}} question of how these measurements should be compared. This study reports on the difference between Favre-averaged and Reynolds-averaged velocity statistics for a turbulent burner using PIV and LDA for unconditional and conditional velocity measurements. The experimental characterization of flow fields of premixed and stratified methane/air flames is carried out under globally turbulent lean conditions (global equivalence ratio at 0. 75), over a range of stratifications and swirl numbers. Unconditioned velocity data was acquired using aluminium oxide to seed the flow field. Conditioned measurements were performed using vegetable <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> as seed, which burns through the flame front, thus allowing only the non-reacting flow velocities to be obtained. A critical comparison of unconditioned velocity profiles measured using both PIV and LDA, including axial, radial, and tangential components is made against conditioned and reconstructed mean velocities at different cross-sections of the flame. The comparison reveals how the differences between the Favre-averaged (unconditioned) and the Reynolds-averaged (conditioned) velocity measurements in the flame brush region can be accounted for using the mean progress of reaction, and highlights the limits of the accuracy and agreement between PIV and LDA measurements.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Nov. 14, 2014 - Nov. 14, 2016 Solvent free microwave extraction (SFME) has been demonstrated to be feasible in extraction of essential oils from botanical materials. The benefits are no need for any solvent aside from the water naturally in the botanical material and {{a significant reduction in}} environmental impact for large scale production processes. However, the aerosol formed by the microwave energy applied to the plant material is inefficiently collected with common condensers. Air coming from the open ends of extraction systems creates the boundary layer effects for the condenser, which makes essential oil collecting inefficient. To solve this problem, the development of a direct contact condenser is in development for the collection step. My research is to model the collision between the aerosol particles and the liquid droplets from the spray nozzles in the direct contact condenser. The goal in this project is to improve the collection efficiency by increasing adequate collision between the two sorts of droplets. Through the use of the model program developed, the collection efficiency of direct contact condenser will be improved to increase production oil. Based on our computation, a bigger oil droplet leads to a greater captured fraction of <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol,</b> while the bigger water droplet decreases the captured fraction with fixed volume flow rate of water. Meanwhile, an easy way to collect more mint oil is to employ a lot of sprays to increase the rows of water droplets.

Aerosol weights were recorded before and after spraying to determine dis­charge rates. Knockdown and mortality number were observed and compared to MS standard aerosol which contain 0. 07 % prallethrin and 0. 05 % d-phenothrin as positive control and aerosol contain 40 % kerosene and 60 % LPG was used as negative control.

40|$|A phenomenological {{study of}} the {{characteristics}} of a two-phase, oil and air mixture was undertaken in a combustion engine crankcase model at speeds of up to 6000 rpm. The idealized model comprised production components and tolerances. Nonintrusive measurement techniques, such as PIV and PDA and high-speed photography, were applied to the {{study of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> and liquid films. Agitated oil pools and impingement on the crankcase surfaces contributed to the aeration of oil in the sump due to windage effects. A mean, wakelike, flow pattern was observed that lagged the crankshaft rotation. Harmonic frequencies were recorded that could be identified with the passage of the position of the maximum crank profile radii and a delay time related to the involute-shaped cord and droplet trajectories induced by drag forces. Highly unsteady flow conditions were measured close to the chamber walls. Three classical breakup modes were identified over three speed ranges. Sheet, ligament, and droplet breakup were observed in the ranges of idle to 1800, 4200, and 6000 rpm. Classification of the particle size distribution for the break-up modes was carried out using the PDA technique. Droplet diameter and velocity data varied in the ranges of 2 μm (dmin) to 130 μm (dmax) and 0 − 40 ms− 1 at 6000 rpm. The ratio of the droplet diameter, dmin;max to a characteristic diameter D at which the oil was observed to break away was compared to the disk Bond number, BoD. For the largest measured droplets, the ratio was approximated by dmax/D = 1. 30 BoD− 0. 33. The disk Bond number was 2. 21, while the empirical constant was in the range of 1. 82 − 2. 39.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increased}} concern of impact to human health from exposure to lubricants and organophosphates (OPs) for workers in the aviation industry. In spite of this concern, neither methods for assessing such exposure nor relevant exposure data for air concentrations of OPs could be found in the scientific literature. This revealed a need for development of such methods and work task related exposure measurements of OPs in the aviation industry in general. The four papers presented in this thesis describe development of sampling methodology and their use in the aviation industry for assessment of OPs in occupational air. Paper I describes the method development needed for air sampling of OPs originating from lubricants such as hydraulic and turbine oils. Combinations of adsorbents, filters and extraction/desorption solvents were evaluated with respect to air sampling and analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of six OPs* in presence of lubricants. The combination of Chromosorb 106 and 37 mm filter cassette with glass fiber filter and dichloromethane (DCM) as extraction/desorption solvent and tri-n-amyl phosphate (TnAP) as volumetric internal standard, was demonstrated to be well suited for sampling of airborne OPs originating from hydraulic and turbine oils. While conventional pumped air sampling with a sampling train is documented in Paper I, Paper II describes development and evaluation of a semi-automatic sampler tailored for collecting volatile organic compounds, including certain OPs. This “incident sampler” is based on a pre-activated sampling unit that is stored at the work place of interest and a final simple activation performed by the worker that is subjected to the exposure. Intoxication of workers due to incidental chemical exposure has shown to be of high relevance. For instance, pilot incapacitation is the ultimate safety threat and consequently underlines the importance of revealing possible unknown contaminants in their working atmosphere. For that reason, the availability of an incident sampler in environments with risk of sudden chemical exposure is presented as an important tool to reveal possible contaminants from incidental air contamination. Ten such samplers were therefore installed in aircrafts within a 12 month period (Paper IV). However, neither of these aircrafts experienced such contamination incidents during this period, and the samplers were thus never activated during such incidents. Paper III presents air measurements during loader and technician work operations. In total, 228 and 182 OPs and oil aerosol/vapor samples from technician and loader work tasks during work on 42 and 21 aircrafts, respectively, were collected in pairs. Additionally, 75 combined VOC/OP/oil and 40 combined OP/oil samples were collected from aircraft cargo rooms and from jet engine tail pipes during loading work operations, respectively, while 16 samples were collected during provoked situations related to technician work. VOCs and the butyl phosphates TnBP and DBPP were identified in most of the samples, most probably due to their frequent use and greater volatility than TCP. The highest TnBP exposure was during pressure drop in the wheel wells in one of the airplane models (maximum 9 mg/m 3), and the butyl phosphates were also found to be present at background concentrations of 1 - 30 μg/m 3. The potential for higher exposure levels during worst case situations was also investigated, for instance by exposure provocations and direct measurements close to the exposure sources such as jet engine tail pipes where maximum <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> and TCP levels were 240 and 30 mg/m 3, respectively. Measurements of contaminants in cabin air are presented in Paper IV. A set of tailored sampling methods were applied, including development of new long-term sample methods based on deposition to a wipe surface area and an activated charcoal cloth installed on walls inside the airplane. In total, 167 pumped within-day OP/VOC samples and 108 longterm samples were collected in cabin and cockpit air from 40 unique aircrafts during 47 commercial flights. Total-VOC was measured using sampling with thermal desorption tubes, and was determined in all 71 such samples (min-max 0. 20 - 2. 7 mg/m 3). For pumped within-day air sampling, TnBP levels were highest in model A airplanes and were detected in all airplane flights (n= 76, min-max 0. 02 - 4. 1 μg/m 3), while TCP was detected only on samples collected from four flights in model C airplanes (min-max The four papers presented in this thesis thus encompass new air sampling methodologies and their application for characterization of OP contamination levels in the aviation industry, in addition to determination of <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> and tVOC. This has resulted in collection of nearly 900 samples during general work tasks for technician and loaders, and in cockpit and cabin air during commercial flights, which is a substantial contribution to the knowledge of occupational exposure to OPs in this industry...|$|E

40|$|Goix, p paranthoen, p trinite, mFlamelet {{structures}} {{and the evolution}} of flame brush thickness of H 2 -air V-shaped flames are studied by laser tomography. The flames have a lean equivalence ratio of φ = 0. 2. The flow velocity is 5 m/s and the turbulence intensity at the flame holder generated by a grid varies from 3. 5 % to 5 %. The flames are within the wrinkled laminar flame regime. A sheet of pulsed laser light (Ruby rod) of 75 × 80 mm illuminates an <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> seeded in the H 2 -air flow, and the instantaneous flame structures are obtained when the oil droplets evaporate on passage through the flame front. The flames are imaged onto a CCD camera. The camera is interfaced with a matrix memory of 512 × 512 pixels with a dynamic range of 256 gray scales, and the tomographic records are analyzed by a digital image processing technique. The gray level corresponding to the flame front is determined by a filtering and thresholding operation. The first and second moments and correlations of flame front positions are deduced from the measurement of 240 instantaneous, statistically independent flames. The results show that the turbulence characteristics and equivalence ratio have an important effect on the shape and the dynamics of the flame. In particular, the growth of turbulence flame brush, δT, is linear for a distance that can be correlated with the Lagrangian time scale of the turbulence. Furthermore, the slope of this evolution is proportional to the turbulence intensity at the flame holder. The linear growth is consistent with results observed by others for wrinkled laminar flames. The changes in the local flame surface area with downstream distance are estimated by the length of the flamelet segment within a vertical window of 10 pixels. The flame area increases are found to be accompanied by increases in the mean flame angle as shown by the width of the burned zone. These results confirm that the wrinkled laminar flame model is valid for the flames studied here. The flame front fluctuation results are interpreted using a Lagrangian diffusion model developed by Karlovitz. From this model, the value of the rms displacement of a flame element is calculated based on the approach flow turbulence characteristics (in comparison with the propagation speed of the flame fronts). Model predictions and experimental results are in good agreement. This indicates that the concept of a diffusion process for describing flame movement is important for study of premixed turbulent flame propagation...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical EngineeringSteven J. EckelsByron W. JonesPoor {{air quality}} in {{commercial}} aircraft cabins {{can be caused}} by volatile organophosphorus (OP) compounds emitted from the jet engine bleed air system during smoke/fume incidents. Tri-cresyl phosphate (TCP), a common anti-wear additive in turbine engine oils, is an important component in today’s global aircraft operations. However, exposure to TCP increases risks of certain adverse health effects. This research analyzed used aircraft cabin air filters for jet engine oil contaminants and designed a jet engine bleed air simulator (BAS) to replicate smoke/fume incidents caused by pyrolysis of jet engine oil. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and neutron activation analysis (NAA) were used for elemental analysis of filters, and gas chromatography interfaced with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to analyze used filters to determine TCP isomers. The filter analysis study involved 110 used and 74 incident filters. Clean air filter samples exposed to different bleed air conditions simulating cabin air contamination incidents were also analyzed by FESEM/EDS, NAA, and GC/MS. Experiments were conducted on a BAS at various bleed air conditions typical of an operating jet engine so that the effects of temperature and pressure variations on jet engine <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> formation could be determined. The GC/MS analysis of both used and incident filters characterized tri-m-cresyl phosphate (TmCP) and tri-p-cresyl phosphate (TpCP) by a base peak of an m/z = 368, with corresponding retention times of 21. 9 and 23. 4 minutes. The hydrocarbons in jet oil were characterized in the filters by a base peak pattern of an m/z = 85, 113. Using retention times and hydrocarbon thermal conductivity peak (TCP) pattern obtained from jet engine oil standards, five out of 110 used filters tested had oil markers. Meanwhile 22 out of 74 incident filters tested positive for oil fingerprints. Probit analysis of jet engine oil aerosols obtained from BAS tests by optical particle counter (OPC) revealed lognormal distributions with the mean (range) of geometric mass mean diameter (GMMD) = 0. 41 (0. 39, 0. 45) [mu]m and geometric standard deviation (GSD), [sigma][subscript]g = 1. 92 (1. 87, 1. 98). FESEM/EDS and NAA techniques found a wide range of elements on filters, and further investigations of used filters are recommended using these techniques. The protocols for air and filter sampling and GC/MS analysis used in this study will increase the options available for detecting jet engine oil on cabin air filters.

These biological effects are assessed here as increases in cellular damage or expressed irritation (i. e., cellular toxic effects) from cells exposed to chamber air relative to cells exposed to clean air. The exposure systems permit virtually gas-only- or PM-only-exposures from the same air stream containing both gases and PM in equilibria, i. e., there are no extractive operations prior to cell exposure. Our simple experiments {{in this part of the}} study were designed to eliminate many competing atmospheric processes to reduce ambiguity in our results. Simple volatile and semi-volatile organic gases that have inherent cellular toxic properties were tested individually for biological effect in the dark (at constant humidity). Airborne mixtures were then created with each compound to which we added PM that has no inherent cellular toxic properties for another cellular exposure. Acrolein and p-tolualdehyde were used as model VOCs and mineral <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol</b> (MOA) was selected as a surrogate for organic-containing PM. MOA is appropriately complex in composition to represent ambient PM, and exhibits no inherent cellular toxic effects and thus did not contribute any biological detrimental effects on its own. Chemical measurements, combined with the responses of our biological exposures, clearly demonstrate that gas-phase pollutants can modify the composition of PM (and its resulting detrimental effects on lung cells). We observed that, even if the gas-phase pollutants are not considered likely to partition to the condensed phase, the VOC-modified-PM showed significantly more damage and inflammation to lung cells than did the original PM. Because gases and PM are transported and deposited differently within the atmosphere and the lungs, these results have significant consequences for a wide range of people. For example, current US policies for research and regulation of PM do not recognize this "effect modification" phenomena (NAS, 2004). These results present an unambiguous demonstration that – even in these simple mixtures – physical and thermal interactions alone can cause a modification of the distribution of species among the phases of airborne pollution mixtures that can result in a non-toxic phase becoming toxic due to atmospheric thermal processes only. Subsequent work (described in companion papers) extends the simple results reported here to systems with photochemical transformations of complex urban mixtures and to systems with diesel exhaust produced by different fuels...|$|E

A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of paniculate elemental data allows the estimation of mass contributions for five fine mass panicle source classes (soil, motor vehicle, coal related, <b>oil</b> and salt <b>aerosols),</b> and six coarse panicle source classes (soil, motor vehicle, refuse incineration, residual oil, salt and sulfate aerosols). Also derived are the elemental characteristics of those source aerosols and {{their contributions to the}} total recorded elemental concentrations (i. e. an elemental mass balance). These are estimated by applying a new approach to apportioning mass among various PCA source components: the calculation of Absolute Principal Component Scores, and the subsequent regression of daily mass and elemental concentrations on these scores...|$|R
40|$|Plateau-Rayleigh Instability (PRI) is {{the well}} known {{phenomena}} of {{the breakup of}} a liquid column or cylinder. Such a process is integral to the operation {{of a range of}} natural and anthropogenic systems, such as gas-liquid and liquid-liquid separators, fuel cells, the accumulation of dewdrops on spider webs, and many more. Volume Of Fluid (VOF) methods, such as available in OpenFOAM, should be able to accurately resolve PRI in such systems. One such system, in which PRI is integral, is the filtration of <b>oil</b> or water <b>aerosol</b> mists using fibrous filters. In many cases, entrainment (or carryover) of liquid from fibers occurs. The mechanisms behind such entrainment are poorly understood. This work will validate the OpenFOAM VOF against classical PRI theory, both with and without a secondary fluid phase flowing through the system (e. g. air). Furthermore, the work will utilise the validated two-phase VOF solver to examine the phenomena of liquid reentrainment from mist filters...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the second}} study in a three-part study {{designed}} to demonstrate dynamic entanglements among gaseous organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), and their subsequent potential biological effects. We study these entanglements in increasingly complex VOC and PM mixtures in urban-like conditions in a large outdoor chamber, both {{in the dark and}} in sunlight. To the traditional chemical and physical characterizations of gas and PM, we added new measurements of gas-only- and PM-only-biological effects, using cultured human lung cells as model living receptors. These biological effects are assessed here as increases in cellular damage or expressed irritation (i. e., cellular toxic effects) from cells exposed to chamber air relative to cells exposed to clean air. Our exposure systems permit side-by-side, gas-only- and PM-only-exposures from the same air stream containing both gases and PM in equilibria, i. e., there are no extractive operations prior to cell exposure for either gases or PM. In Part 1 (Ebersviller et al., 2012 a), we demonstrated the existence of PM "effect modification" (NAS, 2004) for the case of a single gas-phase toxicant and an inherently non-toxic PM (mineral <b>oil</b> <b>aerosol,</b> MOA). That is, {{in the presence of the}} single gas-phase toxicant in the dark, the initially non-toxic PM became toxic to lung cells in the PM-only-biological exposure system. In this Part 2 study, we used sunlit-reactive systems to create a large variety of gas-phase toxicants from a complex mixture of oxides of nitrogen and 54 VOCs representative of those measured in US city air. In these mostly day-long experiments, we have designated the period in the dark just after injection (but before sunrise) as the "Fresh" condition and the period in the dark after sunset as the "Aged" condition. These two conditions were used to expose cells and to collect chemical characterization samples. We used the same inherently non-toxic PM from the Part 1 study as the target PM for "effect modification". Fortunately, in the absence of "seed particles", the complex highly-reactive VOC system used does not create any secondary aerosol in situ. All PM present in these tests were, therefore, introduced by injection of MOA to serve as PM-to-be-modified by the gaseous environment. PM addition was only done during dark periods, either before or after the daylight period. The purpose of this design is to test if a non-toxic PM becomes toxic in initially unreacted ("Fresh"), or in reacted ("Aged") complex VOC conditions. To have a complete design, we also tested the effects of clean air and the same VOC conditions, but without introducing any PM. Thus, there were six exposure treatment conditions that were evaluated with the side-by-side, gas-only- and PM-only-effects exposure systems; five separate chamber experiments were performed: two with clean air and three with the complex VOC/NOx mixture. For all of these experiments and exposures, chemical composition data and matching biological effects results for two end-points were compared. Chemical measurements demonstrate the temporal evolution of oxidized species, with a corresponding increase in toxicity observed from exposed cells. The largest increase in gas-phase toxicity was observed in the two "Aged" VOC exposures. The largest increase in particle-phase toxicity was observed in the "Aged" VOC exposure with the addition of PM after sunset. These results are a clear demonstration that the findings from Part 1 can be extended to the complex urban oxidized environment. This further demonstrates that the atmosphere itself cannot be ignored as a source of toxic species when establishing the risks associated with exposure to PM. Because gases and PM are transported and deposited differently within the atmosphere and lungs, these results have significant consequences. In the next (and final) part of the study, testing is further applied to systems with real diesel exhaust, including primary PM from a vehicle operated with different types of diesel fuel...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work is to compare two biomass-to-oil processes: fast pyrolysis and direct liquefaction, using the same biomass (beech sawdust). Fast pyrolysis is conducted in a cyclone reactor (wall temperature between 870 and 1040 K) and direct liquefaction in a 150 -mL-autoclave reactor (bulk temperature between 420 and 600 K). Three fractions of pyro-oil are obtained from fast pyrolysis (heavy oil, light <b>oil,</b> and <b>aerosol),</b> whereas two fractions of liq-oil (heavy oil and water-solubleorganics) are obtained from direct liquefaction. The comparison of both processes {{is based on the}} product yields and theircharacterization (ultimate analysis for solid and oils, oil−water content, gas and oil molecular composition, 1 H NMR for oils). For both processes, there is an optimal temperature at which the oil yield is maximum. Up to 62. 6 wt % of pyro-oil are obtained at 970 K with the cyclone reactor (with 25. 7 wt % of gas and 11. 7 wt % of solid), whereas 47. 0 wt % of liq-oil was obtained at 573 K with the batch-reactor (completed by 5. 5 wt % of gas and 17. 8 wt % of solid). Water content mainly explains the differences (mass yield and oxygen content) between oils from fast pyrolysis and direct liquefaction. Nevertheless, there are also some differences in organic composition: levoglucosane is a main component in pyro-oil, whereas levulinic acid is a main component in liq-oil. Finally, gas formed during direct liquefaction is mainly composed of CO 2 (more than 99 wt %), whereas gas from fast pyrolysis is a mixture of CO, CO 2, H 2, CH 4, and light hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization mass {{spectrometry}} {{has been used}} to measure the evolution of chemical composition for two distinct organic aerosol types as they are passed through a thermodenuder at different temperatures. The two organic aerosol types considered are primary lubricating <b>oil</b> (LO) <b>aerosol</b> and secondary aerosol from the alpha-pinene + O 3 reaction (alphaP). The evolution of the VUV mass spectra for the two aerosol types with temperature are observed to differ dramatically. For LO particles, the spectra exhibit distinct changes with temperature in which the lower m/z peaks, corresponding to compounds with higher vapor pressures, disappear more rapidly than the high m/z peaks. In contrast, the alphaP aerosol spectrum is essentially unchanged by temperature even though the particles experience significant mass loss due to evaporation. The variations in the LO spectra are found to be quantitatively in agreement with expectations from absorptive partitioning theory whereas the alphaP spectra suggest that the evaporation of alphaP derived aerosol appears to not be governed by partitioning theory. We postulate that this difference arises from the alphaP particles existing as in a glassy state instead of having the expected liquid-like behavior. To reconcile these observations with decades of aerosol growth measurements, which indicate that OA formation is described by equilibrium partitioning, we present a conceptual model wherein the secondary OA is formed and then rapidly converted from an absorbing form to a non-absorbing form. The results suggest that although OA growth may be describable by equilibrium partitioning theory, the properties of organic aerosol once formed may differ significantly from the properties determined in the equilibrium framework...|$|R
40|$|Sampling and {{analysis}} methods for {{the measurement of}} the personal workplace exposure concentration of gas <b>oil</b> vapors and <b>aerosols</b> were studied. Two sampling methods for the total concentration of gas oil atmospheres and aerosol-vapor partitioning were investigated in a laboratory set-up, i. e., a filter and XAD adsorbent cartridge operated in series (BIA-method) and a virtual-impactor combined with filter-XAD cartridges (VI-method). The BIA method allowed for sampling and measuring the total concentration of the gas oil atmospheres for concentrations > 0. 5 mg/cu m for 8 -hr sampling. When using the VI-method, losses between 15 and 30 % were encountered when measuring the total concentration. Evaporation effects caused a shift of the aerosol-vapor partitioning towards the vapor phase in the BIA sampling system. In the VI-method the aerosol-vapor fraction was nearly independent of the thermodynamic conditions and the sampling time. However, the partitioning coefficient can be influenced by small aerosol particles with diameters smaller than the critical cutoff diameter; this aerosol fraction is falsely counted as vapor phase...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The bioefficacy of Piper aduncum L. {{essential}} <b>oil</b> {{formulated in}} <b>aerosol</b> cans was evaluated against Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in a simulated room. The aerosol spray test {{was based on}} the Malaysian test standard for aerosol (MS 1221 : 1991 UDC 632. 982. 2 modified from WHO 2009 methodology) and examined the knockdown effect within 20 minutes of exposure. Mortality rate after 24 hour of holding period was also determined. A commercial aerosol spray (0. 09 % prallethrin 0. 05 % d-phenothrin) was also tested as a comparison. Our results showed that the knockdown effect of the commercial aerosol spray and P. aduncum essential oil spray (8 % and 10 % concentrations) was significantly higher in Ae. albopictus adult females, when compared with that of Ae. aegypti adult females (P< 0. 05). There was a significant difference in knockdown between commercial aerosol spray and essential oil spray for both Aedes spp. (P< 0. 05). The essential oil induced significantly higher mortality in Ae. aegypti (80 %) than in Ae. albopictus (71. 6 %) (P< 0. 05). The commercial aerosol spray caused 97. 7 % and 86. 5 % mortality against Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus respectively (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Concentrations of {{atmospheric}} PM 10 and chemical components (including twenty-one elements, nine ions, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC)) were measured at five sites in a heavily industrial region of Shenzhen, China in 2005. Results showed that PM 10, concentrations exhibited the highest values at 264 mu g/m(3) {{at the site}} near a harbor with the influence of harbor activities. Sulfur exhibited the highest concentrations (from 2419 to 3995 ng/m(3)) of all the studied elements, which {{may be related to}} the influence of coal used as fuel in this area for industrial plants. This was verified by the high mass percentages of SO 42 -, which accounted for 34. 3 %- 39. 7 % of the total ions. NO 3 -/SO 42 - ratios varied from 0. 64 - 0. 71, which implies coal combustion was predominant compared with vehicle emission. The anion/cation ratios range was close to 0. 95, indicating anion deficiency in this region. The harbor site showed the highest OC and EC concentrations, with the influence of emission from vessels. Secondary organic carbon accounted for about 22. 6 %- 38. 7 % of OC, with the highest percentage occurring at the site adjacent to a coal-fired power plant and wood plant. The mass closure model performed well in this heavily industrial region, with significant correlation obtained between chemically determined and gravimetrically measured PM 10 mass. The main constituents of PM 10 were found to be organic materials (30. 9 %- 69. 5 %), followed by secondary inorganic aerosol (7. 9 %- 25. 0 %), crustal materials (6. 7 %- 13. 8 %), elemental carbon (3. 5 %- 10. 8 %), sea salt (2. 4 %- 6. 2 %) and trace elements (2. 0 %- 4. 9 %) in this heavily industrialized region.
