5|$|In {{the acute}} phase of an attack, {{administration}} <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> will quickly restore muscle strength and prevent complications. However, caution is advised {{as the total}} amount <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> in the body is not decreased, {{and it is possible}} for potassium levels to overshoot ("rebound hyperkalemia"); slow infusions <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> chloride are therefore recommended while other treatment is commenced.|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> exploit the high {{solubility in water}} <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> compounds, such as potassium soaps.

40|$|The line {{profiles}} of XP spectra of H 2 O/K/Ni(111) were investigated for K submonolayer coverages. The K 2 p spectra exhibit a strong alteration of lineshape with increasing water coverage. Without coadsorbed water a significant asymmetry was found which decreased rapidly and independently <b>of</b> the <b>potassium</b> precoverage with increasing water exposure up to ΘH 2 O = 0. 7. The asymmetry {{observed in the}} K 2 p spectra is assigned to a coupling <b>of</b> the <b>potassium</b> adatoms to the electronic structure of the nickel substrate. The coadsorption of water suppresses this mechanism via a loosening of the potassium-nickel coupling. Since the decrease of asymmetry is independent <b>of</b> the <b>potassium</b> coverage, it is concluded that this process is due to an adsorbate-substrate interaction between {{the water and the}} nickel substrate only. This contradicts models in which the coadsorption <b>of</b> water and <b>potassium</b> on metal substrates is manifested in hydration <b>of</b> the <b>potassium</b> adatoms. ...|$|R

5|$|Potassium ions are {{necessary}} for the function of all living cells. The transfer <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources <b>of</b> <b>potassium.</b> The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, with a shift <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> from outside to inside cells {{and an increase in}} potassium excretion by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> derangement, the acid-base balance is usually disturbed, with metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the neuromuscular junction less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles.|$|E

5|$|Sodium is reabsorbed to {{maintain}} extracellular volume, osmotic pressure, and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits; potassium is reabsorbed {{to maintain}} serum potassium concentration within narrow limits. Sodium pumps in the renal tubules operate to reabsorb sodium. Potassium must be conserved also, but, because the amount <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> {{in the blood}} plasma is very small and the pool <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> in the cells is about thirty times as large, the situation is not so critical for potassium. Since potassium is moved passively in counter flow to sodium {{in response to an}} apparent (but not actual) Donnan equilibrium, the urine can never sink below the concentration <b>of</b> <b>potassium</b> in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water {{at the end of the}} processing. Potassium is excreted twice and reabsorbed three times before the urine reaches the collecting tubules. At that point, urine usually has about the same potassium concentration as plasma. At the end of the processing, potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high.|$|E

40|$|Congenital long QT {{syndrome}} (LQTS) is subdivided {{according to}} the underlying gene defect. In LQTS 2, an aberrant HERG gene that encodes the potassium channel IKr leads to insufficient IKr activity and delayed repolarization, causing ECG abnormalities and torsades de pointes (TdP). Increasing serum potassium levels by potassium infusion normalizes the ECG in LQTS 2 because IKr activity varies with serum potassium levels. In an LQTS 2 patient who presented with TdP, we attempted to achieve a long-term (subacute) elevation <b>of</b> serum <b>potassium</b> by increased potassium intake and potassium-sparing drugs.

40|$|The binding <b>of</b> {{losartan}} <b>potassium,</b> an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, to {{bovine serum}} albumin was studied by equilibrium dialysis method (ED) in {{presence or absence}} of palmitic acid. The study was carried out using ranitidine and diazepam as site- 1 and site- 2 specific probe, respectively. Different analysis of binding of losartan to bovine serum albumin suggested two sets of association constants: high affinity association constant (k 1 = 11. 2 x 105 M- 1) with low capacity (n 1 = 2) and low affinity association (k 2 = 2. 63 x 105 M- 1) constant with high capacity (n 2 = 10) at pH 7. 4 and 27 °C. During concurrent administration of palmitic acid and losartan potassium in {{presence or absence of}} ranitidine or diazepam, it was that found that palmitic acid causes the release <b>of</b> losartan <b>potassium</b> from its binding site on BSA resulting reduced binding <b>of</b> losartan <b>potassium</b> to BSA.

40|$|When {{potassium}} (45. 4 mM) {{was applied}} to isolated taenia of guinea-pig caecum, the muscle developed a rapid phasic and sustained tonic tension during aerobic conditions bubbled with 95 % O 2 : 5 % CO 2. Under hypoxic conditions bubbled with 95 % N 2 : 5 % CO 2, the taenia lost its {{ability to respond to}} high potassium with sustained tonic contraction, although it still showed rapid phasic contraction. Raising the glucose concentration from 5. 5 to 55. 5 mM in the presence <b>of</b> high <b>potassium</b> during hypoxia caused development of a sustained contraction which was 50 % that of the muscle in aerobic conditions. In the presence <b>of</b> high <b>potassium,</b> the ATP content of the taenia decreased in hypoxia, but increased with increasing glucose concentration. When the taenia was exposed to hypoxic conditions, the amount of lactate released from the muscle increased. Raising the glucose concentration caused a further increase in lactate release in the presence <b>of</b> high <b>potassium</b> under hypoxia. Good correlations (gamma greater than 0. 9) were observed between tension development, the ATP content and lactate release of the taenia in the presence <b>of</b> high <b>potassium</b> under hypoxia when the glucose concentration was varied between 5. 5 and 55. 5 mM. The total calcium content was increased by the presence <b>of</b> high <b>potassium</b> under aerobic conditions and the increase was abolished when the muscle was exposed to hypoxic conditions. Under hypoxia the total calcium content was not increased by raising the glucose concentration in the presence <b>of</b> high <b>potassium.</b> The cellular calcium content of the taenia, determined by the lanthanum method, was increased in the presence <b>of</b> high <b>potassium</b> under aerobic and hypoxic conditions, but the content was smaller in hypoxic conditions than in aerobic conditions. Under hypoxic conditions, raising the glucose concentration in the presence <b>of</b> high <b>potassium</b> did not affect the cellular calcium content. These results suggest that under hypoxic conditions the potassium-induced sustained contraction of the taenia is increased by raising the glucose concentration owing to increased ATP production through the glycolytic pathway, but not through mechanisms increasing the intracellular Ca concentration...|$|R
