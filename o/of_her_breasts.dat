5|$|In 1953, editor Hugh Hefner began {{publishing}} Playboy and {{the magazine}} became popular {{because of its}} early Playmates, such as Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, and Anita Ekberg. Mansfield posed nude for the February 1955 issue of Playboy, modeling in pajamas raised so that the bottoms <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> showed. This increased the magazine's circulation and helped launch Mansfield's career. Beginning in February 1955, she formed a long-standing relationship with Playboy. Shortly afterward, she posed for the Playboy calendar, covering her breasts with her hands. Playboy featured Mansfield every February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.|$|E

25|$|On 5 June 2008, {{when former}} Spice Girls singer Mel B {{was on the}} programme, much to his enjoyment, she consensually let him fondle both <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> live on air, to which he gave a running {{commentary}} of the precise topography of each. It arose from his enquiry into whether her breasts had been surgically enhanced.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, Price {{underwent}} {{surgery in the}} United States {{to reduce the size}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breast</b> implants and also had rhinoplasty. However, she was not happy with the results <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breast</b> implants, so returned to Beverly Hills, California in July 2008 for corrective surgery. She returned to the United Kingdom with much smaller size 32C breasts.|$|R

25|$|Patterson {{died from}} 27 stab wounds {{to her chest}} and back. Her body was {{discovered}} naked from the waist down, with her skirt found in a nearby bedroom and her underwear around her ankles. Small pieces of yellow PVC tape were attached to her body and both <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> had been removed using a sharp knife. Her handbag and driver's licence were stolen during the attack. The murder weapon and Patterson's breasts have never been recovered.|$|E
25|$|Wright, {{who was one}} of Thomas' {{subordinates}} at the EEOC {{until he}} fired her, told Senate Judiciary Committee staff that Thomas had repeatedly made comments to her much like those he allegedly made to Hill, including pressuring her for dates, asking her the size <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts,</b> and frequently commenting on the anatomy of other women. Wright said that after she turned down Thomas for a date, Thomas began to express discontent with her work and eventually fired her. Thomas said that he fired Wright for poor performance and for using a homophobic epithet.|$|E
25|$|Consultation — The {{plastic surgeon}} evaluates the {{elasticity}} {{of the skin}} envelope of each breast, and determines the degree of breast ptosis present. The woman is informed of the alternative, surgical reduction techniques available for diminishing her oversized breasts; of the consequent surgical scars; of the possible loss of breast sensation; of the possible impairment of lactation capability; and of the possible impairment of breast-feeding functions. The woman is further informed of the possible medical complications, and is shown surgical photographic records of the average outcomes of breast-reduction surgery. The surgeon answers the woman's questions to assist her in establishing realistic expectations (self-image) about the breast-reduction outcome possible with a lipectomy procedure; and that, should lipectomy not satisfactorily reduce the volume <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts,</b> a secondary, surgical breast-reduction procedure can be performed later.|$|E

25|$|During the 16th century, women's fashions with exposed {{breasts were}} common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and {{emulated}} by all classes. Anne of Brittany {{has also been}} painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even Queen Mary II and Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England, were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect Inigo Jones designed a masque costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts.</b> During the fashions of the period 1795–1820, many women wore dresses that bared necks, bosoms and shoulders. Anne of Austria was known for wearing, along with female members of her court, very tight bodice and corsets that forced breasts together to make deeper cleavages, very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in entirety above the areola and pendants lying on the cleavage to highlight it.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} non-implant breast {{reconstruction}} is initiated at the concluding {{steps of the}} breast cancer surgery, wherein the oncological surgeon is joined by the reconstructive plastic surgeon, who immediately begins harvesting, refining, and seeding (injecting) fat grafts to the post-mastectomy recipient site. After that initial post-mastectomy fat-graft seeding in the operating room, the patient leaves hospital with a slight breast mound that has been seeded to become the foundation tissue matrix for the breast reconstruction. Then, after 3–5 weeks of continual external vacuum expansion of the breast mound (seeded recipient-site)to promote the histologic regeneration of the extant tissues (fat, glandular) via increased blood circulation to the mastectomy scar (suture site)the patient formally undergoes the first fat-grafting session for the reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts.</b> The external vacuum expansion of the breast mound created an adequate, vascularised, breast-tissue matrix to which the autologous fat is injected; and, per the patient, such reconstruction affords almost-normal sensation throughout the breast and the nipple-areola complex. Patient recovery from non-surgical fat graft breast reconstruction permits her to resume normal life activities at 3-days post-procedure.|$|E
500|$|Three posters {{released}} on the Internet that showed Harry accompanied by six classmates, including Hermione Granger, generated some controversy by the media.

500|$|Lord Robert {{has come}} so much into favour {{that he does}} {{whatever}} he likes with affairs and it is even said that her majesty visits him in his chamber day and night.

Matters have reached such a pass ... that ... it would ... be well to approach Lord Robert on your Majesty's behalf ... Your Majesty would do well to attract and confirm him in his friendship.|$|E
500|$|Pure Charts' Yohann Ruelle {{called the}} music video [...] "sexy", likening {{it to that}} of Rihanna's [...] "Pour It Up" [...] (2013) {{for the use of}} light outfits, pole dance {{sequences}} and the [...] "play of light, between mist and sensual neon". Alexandra Necula from InfoMusic echoed Ruelle's thought, further noting the use of water effects in both clips. An editor of Libertatea wrote, [...] "The singer appears little dressed, exposing her perfect body. One of the hottest scenes is where Inna appears with a blonde blouse that leaves a part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> in sight to incite the imagination of those who will see the video." ...|$|E
500|$|Berry {{portrayed the}} mutant superhero Storm {{in the film}} {{adaptation}} of the comic book series X-Men (2000) and its sequels, X2 (2003), [...] (2006) and [...] (2014). In 2001, Berry appeared in the film Swordfish, which featured her first topless scene. At first, she refused to be filmed topless in a sunbathing scene, but {{she changed her mind}} when Warner Brothers raised her fee substantially. The brief flash <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> added $500,000 to her fee. Berry considered these stories to be rumors and was quick to deny them. After turning down numerous roles that required nudity, she said she decided to make Swordfish because her then-husband, Eric Benét, supported her and encouraged her to take risks.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, the world's media {{were quick to}} condemn Mansfield's stunts. One {{editorial}} columnist wrote, [...] "We are amused when Miss Mansfield strains to pull in her stomach to fill out her bikini better; but we get angry when career-seeking women, shady ladies, and certain starlets and actresses...use every opportunity to display their anatomy unasked". By the late 1950s, Mansfield began to generate {{a great deal of}} negative publicity because of repeated exposure <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> in carefully staged public [...] "accidents". Richard Blackwell, her wardrobe designer (who also designed for Jane Russell, Dorothy Lamour, Peggy Lee and Nancy Reagan), dropped her from his client list because of those accidents. In April 1967, Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "She confuses publicity and notoriety with stardom and celebrity and the result is very distasteful to the public." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1670, Rosmadec {{approached}} Claude de Lannion {{again and}} requested him {{to break the}} statue into pieces. Lannion ordered this to be done. However, the workmen, for fear of the peasants and devotees, only mutilated one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> and one arm and again threw the statue into the same river. Soon after this, Claude de Lannion fell from his horse and died, which devotees considered as [...] "a judgement from heaven for his having consented to destroy the idol." [...] The statue remained in the river for 25 years until Bishop Rosmadec decided to root out paganism in his diocese and asked Pierre de Lannion, son of Claude de Lannion, to destroy the statue. As Pierre was an antiquarian, he pulled the statue up from the river in 1695 but did not destroy it. The events associated with the demolition and restoration became a local cause célèbre.|$|E

The concert's profits were donated to Young Survival Coalition, an organization aiding breast cancer in young women. In June 2009, she designed an item of clothing for H's [...] "Fashion Against AIDS" [...] campaign, which raises money for HIV/AIDS awareness projects. On February 26, 2017, she served as a co-chair alongside various celebrities such as Beyoncé, Lea Michele, Jim Carrey, Jared Leto, and Kevin Spacey for the 25th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party, a fundraiser for HIV/AIDS healthcare.|$|E

500|$|On May 7, 1972, Kemper {{was driving}} in Berkeley {{when he picked}} up two 18-year-old hitchhiking Fresno State students, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Mary Luchessa, on the pretext of taking them to Stanford University. After driving for an hour, he managed to reach a secluded wooded area near Alameda, which he was {{familiar}} with from {{his work at the}} Highway Department, without alerting his passengers that he had changed directions from where they wanted to go. Here he intended to rape them, but having learned from serial rapists in Atascadero that you should not leave witnesses, he instead handcuffed Pesce and locked Luchessa in the trunk, before stabbing and strangling Pesce to death and killing Luchessa in a similar manner. Kemper later confessed that while handcuffing Pesce he [...] "brushed the back of [...] hand against one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> and it embarrassed [...] " [...] before adding that [...] " [...] even said 'whoops, I'm sorry' or something like that" [...] after grazing her breast, despite murdering her merely minutes later.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1558 Robert and Amy Dudley {{were looking for a}} {{suitable}} residence of their own in order to settle in Norfolk; nothing came of this, however, before the death of Queen Mary I in November 1558. Upon the accession of Elizabeth I Robert Dudley became Master of the Horse and his place was now at court at almost constant attendance on the Queen. By April 1559 Queen Elizabeth seemed to be in love with Lord Robert, and several diplomats reported that some at court already speculated that the Queen would marry him, [...] "in case his wife should die", as Lady Dudley was very ill in one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts.</b> Very soon court observers noted that Elizabeth never let Robert Dudley from her side. He visited his wife at Throcking {{for a couple of days}} at Easter 1559, and Amy Dudley came to London in May 1559 for about a month. At this time, on 6June, the new Spanish ambassador de Quadra wrote that her health had improved, but that she was careful with her food. She also made a trip to Suffolk; by September she was residing in the house of Sir Richard Verney at Compton Verney in Warwickshire.|$|E
500|$|Bride of Frankenstein was {{subjected}} to censorship, both during production by the Hays office and following its release by local and national censorship boards. Joseph Breen, lead censor for the Hays office, objected to lines of dialogue in the originally submitted script in which Henry Frankenstein and his work were {{compared to that of}} God. He continued to object to such dialogue in revised scripts, and to a planned shot of the Monster rushing through a graveyard to a figure of a crucified Jesus and attempting to [...] "rescue" [...] the figure from the cross. Breen also objected to the number of murders, both seen and implied by the script and strongly advised Whale to reduce the number. The censor's office, upon reviewing the film in March 1935, required a number of cuts. Whale agreed to delete a sequence in which Dwight Frye's [...] "Nephew Glutz" [...] kills his uncle and blames the Monster, and shots of Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley in which Breen felt too much <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts</b> were visible. Curiously, despite his earlier objection, Breen offered no objection to the cruciform imagery throughout the film– including a scene with the Monster lashed Christ-like to a pole– nor to the presentation of Pretorius as a coded homosexual. Bride of Frankenstein was approved by the Production Code office on April 15, 1935.|$|E
50|$|CBFC was {{initially}} {{not happy with}} the lengthy sex scenes in Jism 2 and had declined to issue a certificate. It objected to several scenes, including the oil massage scene where Izna turns around and a prominent portion <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>breast</b> was visible.|$|R
