40|$|Modular <b>oscilloscopes</b> <b>and</b> digitizers, {{including}} those with embedded EPICS IOCs, provide powerful off-the-shelf solutions for accelerator controls and beamline data acquisition applications requiring fast sampling, high resolution and/or tight multi-channel synchronization. This presentation discusses features and capabilities of EPICS and non-EPICS LXI, VXI, PXI/cPCI <b>and</b> PCI <b>oscilloscopes</b> <b>and</b> digitizers as they specifically relate to accelerator and beamline applications. Modular <b>oscilloscopes</b> <b>and</b> digitizers with on-board DSP and FPGAs provide the advanced waveform acquisition and analysis capabilities of benchtop instruments with the size and channel-density advantages of modular instruments. Instruments with on-board processing, such as those from ZTEC Instruments, enable real-time waveform math and waveform parameter analysis. Advanced triggering and multiple acquisition modes are other features found on some of today’s advanced modular instruments. Furthermore, instruments with embedded EPICS IOCs save users {{the time and money}} of developing their own EPICS drivers and display panels...|$|R

50|$|Digital {{oscilloscopes}} can {{be classified}} into three primary categories: digital storage oscilloscopes, digital phosphor <b>oscilloscopes,</b> <b>and</b> digital sampling <b>oscilloscopes.</b> Newer variants include PC-based oscilloscopes (which attach to a PC for data processing and display) <b>and</b> mixed-signal <b>oscilloscopes</b> (which employ other functions in addition to voltage measurement).|$|R
50|$|A {{derivative}} of CRTs were storage tubes, {{which had the}} ability to retain information displayed on them, unlike standard CRTs which need to be refreshed periodically.
