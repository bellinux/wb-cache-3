60|$|After {{the battle}} {{the siege of}} Stirling was renewed; but owing to the gross {{incompetence}} of a French engineer, who had come over with Lord Drummond, the batteries were so badly placed that their fire was easily silenced by that of the castle guns. The prince, {{in spite of the}} advice of Lord George Murray and the <b>other</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities,</b> and listening only to his favourite councillors, Secretary Murray and Sir Thomas Sheridan, continued the siege, although on the 3Oth of January the Duke of Cumberland arrived in Edinburgh and took the command of the army.|$|E
60|$|This gentleman, {{whatever}} his nominal {{business in the}} world might be, was first and above all a cavaliere servente, and the cavaliere servente was the invention, it is said, of Genoese husbands who had not the leisure to attend their wives to the theater, the promenade, the card-table, the conversazione, and so installed their nearest idle friends permanently in the office. The arrangement was found so convenient that the cavaliere servente presently spread throughout Italy; no lady of fashion was thought properly appointed without one; and the office was now no longer reserved to bachelors; it {{was not at all}} good form for husband and wife to love each other, and the husband became the cavalier of some other lady, and the whole fine world was thus united, by a usage of which {{it is very hard to}} know just how far it was wicked and how far it was only foolish; perhaps it is safest to say that at the best it was apt to be somewhat of the one and always a great deal of the other. In the good society of that day, marriage meant a settlement in life for the girl who had escaped her sister's fate of a sometimes forced religious vocation. But it did not matter so much about the husband if the marriage contract stipulated that she should have her cavaliere servente, and, as sometimes happened, specified him by name. With her husband there was a union of fortunes, with the expectation of heirs; the companionship, the confidence, the faith, was with the cavalier; there could be no domesticity, no family life with either. The cavaliere servente went with his lady to church, where he dipped his finger in the holy-water and offered it her to moisten her own finger at; and he held her prayer-book for her when she rose from her knees and bowed to the high altar. In fact, his place seems to have been as fully acknowledged and honored, if not by the Church, then by all the <b>other</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities,</b> as that of the husband. Like other things, his relation to his lady was subject to complication and abuse; no doubt, ladies of fickle minds changed their cavaliers rather often; and in those days following the disorder of the French invasions, the relation suffered deplorable exaggerations and perversions. But when Giuseppe Parini so minutely and graphically depicted the day of a noble Lombard youth, the cavaliere servente was in his most prosperous and illustrious state; and some who have studied Italian social conditions in the past bid us not too virtuously condemn him, since, preposterous as he was, his existence was an amelioration of disorders at which we shall find it better not even to look askance.|$|E

40|$|Many generic {{drugs are}} now being {{prescribed}} and the trend is increasing. For example, in Austria, the number of all generics prescriptions {{has more than doubled}} from 11 % in 2000 to 23 % in 2010. However, many myths and questions about generic drugs remain and information may be difficult to come by. It is therefore not surprising, as we have discovered in recent years, that even physicians and pharmacists are not always fully up to date in their understanding of generic drugs. Some of their questions centre on issues such as: are generic drugs really as good as the original; are we really dealing with an adequately tested, high quality medicinal product. Today, generic drugs present an equally well-tolerated and efficacious alternative to established medicinal products, which contain well-known, rigorously tested active ingredients. An established originator product undergoes expensive and protracted development (up to 15 years) with inherently high preclinical and clinical research costs in order to be given market approval. The development of generic drugs, on the other hand, is relatively quick and inexpensive, which allows generic drugs to be sold at a distinctly cheaper price. This is due to the waiving of new preclinical and clinical studies, aside from some bioequivalence studies. Their lower price however should not be equated with ‘cheap quality’. In fact, generic medicines undergo the same strict scrutiny by the European or national medicines authorities as reference products. At AGES PharmMed, the Austrian <b>competent</b> <b>authority</b> for marketing authorisation of human medicinal products, generic drugs are subjected to detailed assessment, during which the safety profile and efficacy data of the active substances, as well as the proof of bioequivalence, are thoroughly examined. This is also the case for all <b>other</b> national <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> of the EU and EMA. The Austrian Federal Office for Safety in Healthcare issues a marketing authorisation only if all legal and scientific requirements are fulfilled. This marketing authorisation validates the safety, efficacy, and quality of a generic drug...|$|R

With the present amendment, a special chapter for all Tree Protection has been added to upgrade the quality of overall tree protection. The new amendment emphasizes that local level government sought to conduct tree censuses within their individual jurisdictions. Large, old or important trees should not be arbitrarily felled, transplanted, trimmed or otherwise damaged. In addition to maintaining sound growth environments, local governments ought to provide accurate information and launch a means of tracing and supervision. <b>Other</b> <b>competent</b> government <b>authorities</b> will develop and publish necessary technical and executive specifications.

40|$|At {{least since}} the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) first {{published}} its Forty Recommendations, financial institutions in FATF-compliant jurisdictions have been required to implement preventive measures that require FIs to identify customers, establish client profiles, monitor for unusual transactions, review those transactions {{to see if there}} was suspicion that they involved the proceeds of crime and, if so, report the transaction to the authorities in the form of a suspicious transaction report (STR). When these requirements were first established, neither financial institutions nor their supervisors/regulators had much experience as to what in a client 2 ̆ 7 s profile and the client 2 ̆ 7 s patterns of transactions might indicate money laundering. However, based on an expanding knowledge of how criminals tend to launder their money, over time financial institutions have developed increasingly effective detection and reporting systems. By studying known examples of laundering, the FATF, FATF-Style Regional Bodies, and national competent authorities (especially financial intelligence units) have identified patterns or indicators of possible money laundering, and made them available to financial institutions as money laundering typologies. In addition, there has been some feedback from financial intelligence units and <b>other</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> to financial institutions with respect to their anti-money laundering programs.

40|$|The {{consideration}} of cumulative effects in {{environmental impact assessment}} (EIA) has been required in the UK, though somewhat ambiguously, since the EC Directive (85 / 337 / EEC) was implemented in 1988. This paper describes {{the results of a}} review of cumulative effects considerations in 50 UK environmental impact statements (EISs) prepared for a variety of project types produced between 1989 and 2000. The results of the review suggest that cumulative effects are far from thoroughly addressed. Only 24 EISs (48 %) mentioned the term ‘cumulative effects/impacts ’ and only 9 EISs (18 %) provided a discussion, which were mostly qualitative. The problems in addressing these issues are explored, and the main findings include the various interpretations of the concept of cumulative effects and the varied treatment of cumulative effects issues. Where cumulative effects are considered in the scoping stage, this led to a further discussion or analysis of these effects. The research concludes that for a better {{consideration of}} cumulative effects, an effective driving force would be the local planning authority (and <b>other</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities)</b> requiring developers during the scoping process to address cumulative effects and so help meet the most recent strengthened legal requirements of the EC EIA Amendment Directive 97 / 11 /EC and UK Regulations.
