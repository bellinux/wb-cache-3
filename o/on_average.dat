40|$|Beef {{has lost}} {{considerable}} market share {{because it does}} not offer adequate value to consumers. An important component of value is quality problems related to pricing cattle <b>on</b> <b>averages.</b> This study summarizes results of industry surveys solicited to investigate this problem. A research agenda to resolve the problem is proposed. 1 Value-Based Pricing of Fed Cattle: Challenges and Research Agenda Beef’s share of total meat consumption declined precipitously over the last four decades (Purcell). Although much of this decline has been attributed to changes in relative prices (Schroeder, Mintert, and Brester), there is evidence, especially the past decade, that losses of market share are also related to problems with beef quality (Smith et al. 1992, 1995). Improving beef product quality relies critically upon the market relaying consumer demands to producers. Jones et al. concluded that wholesale beef value differentials were not fully reflected in live cattle prices, confirming what has been called pricing cattle <b>on</b> <b>averages.</b> Pricing cattle <b>on</b> <b>averages</b> inhibits communication of consumer demand to producers...|$|R

5|$|Assessments of {{the mating}} system {{of this species}} have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations. Populations in {{relatively}} intact bushland have high outcrossing rates, but those in more disturbed environments are both more inbred <b>on</b> <b>average,</b> and more variable. This {{has been attributed to}} a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an understorey, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon occasional visitors for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations <b>on</b> <b>average,</b> leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations; and the sporadic presence of pollinators leads to outcrossing variability.|$|E
