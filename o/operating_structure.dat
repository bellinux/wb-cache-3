Today, however, many of these companies are "engaging " with overseas joint-venture partners who demand more transparent <b>operating</b> <b>structures.</b> This requires that Chinese companies consider altering their corporate culture to conform with today's fast-paced business environment, which requires a flexible/transparent management approach to making decisions that are aligned with the company's business objectives.

Such collaboration models may enhance the outcomes of collaboration projects and simultaneously lower the potential of failure.|$|R

In a similar way, we may say that the operating area {{of a human being}} involves the decision of going to jog, requiring the person to wear a sport outfit and running shoes; on the other hand, the decision about pursuing higher education, starting a new venture, or practicing within an existing business, may be relegated within the higher control system.|$|E
