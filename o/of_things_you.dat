You can get it a second time in a way you never could have the first time around." [...] He also compared the film's structure to Citizen Kane (which also contained an interrogator and a subject who is telling a story) and the criminal caper The Anderson Tapes.|$|E

Get real, boys. That's football. Grow up." [...] He reserved special praise for his opponent Vieira however, saying {{a few days after}} the game: [...] "It was my job to try and stop him, but he definitely got the better of me that day. He's such a great player. He's so fit, and he dictates the pace of a game. There are a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can learn just by watching him." [...] Assessing his career in a column for the Telegraph, Owen wrote that winning the cup was [...] "...the best day of my career, the game I look back on more than any other and think it was the most exhilarating experience I ever had playing football." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{designing}} the game world, the team initially created a [...] "hybrid city", which producer Dan Houser describes as [...] "a post industrial Midwest slash east coast generic" [...] city. Upon developing within this game world, the team realised that basing the design {{on a real}} location meant [...] "you have a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can say about it". As a result, the team redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in Grand Theft Auto (1997), basing it loosely on New York City. The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing Brooklyn and Queens, a commercial centre resembling Manhattan, and suburbs similar to New Jersey. The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to [...] "start out feeling poor and work to being richer". Dan Houser describes Liberty City as a [...] "hybrid of a generic American city", including Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, New York, and Philadelphia. He felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously. Sam Houser cited films and shows like Heat (1995) and The Sopranos (1999–2007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game. He also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda series (1986–present) and the film Goodfellas (1990), describing Grand Theft Auto III as [...] "a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG". Dan Houser also cited The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario 64 as influences.|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with Billboard, Carey {{revealed}} that she wrote [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] while her husband, Nick Cannon, was hospitalized receiving medical treatment for mild kidney failure, saying [...] "There's a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can take from there that can keep you going in a tough situation." [...] Carey also added that the song was written around the time her friend, singer Whitney Houston, had died. [...] "'We were actually in the hospital together when we saw it on TV.' It was important for me to write something that would...help me get through the moment. That’s where ‘Stay triumphant, keep on living’ came from." [...] Carey also expressed why she chosen Ross and Mill, or any hip-hop artist in general on the track, claiming that they are [...] "different" [...] and how she is always experimenting on collaborations with varying and new artists. When asked why she chose not to release a lead single which was dance influenced, Carey explained how she felt regarding the current music scene; [...] "I think it would be incredible if we could bring back the days when R records didn't have to cross over but be massive hits on their own," [...] and that was the reason why {{she did not want to}} conform to what is currently on trend. Additionally, she felt that [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)", potentially, would be able to generate cross-appeal, and not only cater Mainstream Top 40. With specific emphasis on the dance music scene and its popularity, Carey stated that while she was pregnant, the vast majority of music that was being released was dance and electronic music, saying [...] "I was pregnant forever, and I was being tortured day and night by techno music. I was complaining to everyone who was listening. One time I made dinner for L.A. Reid, and we were both sitting there like 'What happened? It saddened Carey that R and hip-hop music was being [...] "bowled over" [...] by dance music, and therefore wanted to remain true to herself by making traditional R music: ...|$|E

2500|$|Since {{coming out}} as a lesbian, Bianca's romantic {{entanglements}} have consisted of sexual confusion, unrequited love, bad timing, and betrayal, including a short-lived romance with Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska) and an on-but-mostly-off-screen romantic relationship with Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson). The pairing of Reese and Bianca finally allowed the character to be scripted into an on-screen committed relationship. The show had been criticized {{in the past for}} not giving Bianca a full-fledged on-screen romance. When asked by The Advocate if she felt Bianca's pairing with Reese, especially by bringing on a recognized name (Braun), would make a difference, Riegel replied, [...] "I think {{there has to be a}} difference." [...] She responded to the criticism about Bianca's lack of onscreen intimacy with past romantic partners. [...] "I don’t know if the criticism is entirely warranted," [...] she said. [...] "I know I was glad that the show’s priority was in giving me good stories, and I thought that they did go further than anyone else had ever gone, so I always thought that they should be commended." [...] Riegel added, however, that she knows the lack of onscreen intimacy between Bianca and the character's past romantic love interests left fans and herself unsatisfied. [...] "She never really got to have the kind of relationship that she deserved," [...] stated Riegel. Riegel said of Bianca's return this time, [...] "you’ll see a couple <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> haven’t seen in a while".|$|E
