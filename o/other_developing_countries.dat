5|$|The Great Depression had a {{comparatively}} mild effect on Argentina, {{the unemployment rate}} never went above 10%, and the country largely recovered by 1935. However, the Depression permanently halted its economic expansion. Actually, much like <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> the economy was already in a downturn beginning in 1927, a result of declining prices.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{with other}} nations are {{generally}} positive. Shared democratic values ease relations with Western and European countries while similar economic concerns help in relations with <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Historical ties and cultural similarities {{also serve as a}} bridge in relations with Spain. Despite issues such as domestic abuse and war affecting overseas Filipino workers, relations with Middle Eastern countries are friendly as seen in the continuous employment of more than two million overseas Filipinos living there.|$|E
5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India as well as <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E

GDP growth in China outstrips all <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> with only India after 1990 coming close to China's experience. Scholars believe that high rates of investments, especially increases in capital invested per worker, have contributed to China's superior economic performance.

25|$|Many Muslim {{countries}} have developed similar rules about legal {{education and the}} legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate {{on whether or not}} <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> suffer a trend {{deterioration}} in their terms of trade in their exchange of manufactures with <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> In a contribution to this debate, this paper analyses trends in the prices of US imports and exports of manufactures in trade with <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> and - for comparative purposes - with <b>other</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> The results show a significant terms of trade deterioration for <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> over {{the first half of the}} 1980 s, with no significant change since then, while for <b>other</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> their manufactures terms of trade vis-`-vis the US was trendless in the 1981 - 85 period, with significant improvement since.

Free formula milk for 12 months was provided for infants.|$|E

25|$|Both Fonti and {{environmental}} group Legambiente claimed vessels {{were sent to}} Somalia and <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> such as Kenya and Zaire with toxic cargoes, which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land. Legambiente alleges that local rebel groups were given weapons in exchange for receiving the waste ships. Fonti claims that Italian TV journalist Ilaria Alpi and her cameraman Miran Hrovatin were murdered in 1994 in Somalia because they had seen toxic waste arrive in Bosaso, Somalia.|$|E
25|$|The 'Ndrangheta, a {{criminal}} organization from Calabria (Italy) {{has been involved}} in radioactive waste dumping since the 1980s. Ships with toxic and radioactive waste were sunk off the Italian coast. In addition, vessels were allegedly sent to Somalia and <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> with toxic waste, including radioactive waste cargoes, which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land. The introduction of more rigorous environmental legislation in the 1980s made illegal waste dumping a lucrative business for organized crime groups in Italy.|$|E

The country's economy, as in many <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> is heavily dependent on agriculture. Some of the agricultural produce include cotton, groundnuts (peanuts), sorghum, millet, wheat, gum arabic, sugarcane, cassava (tapioca), mangos, papaya, bananas, sweet potatoes, and sesame.|$|E

25|$|In {{its final}} years, ASOPA {{introduced}} training for secondary teachers and more specialised administration courses. In 1970 {{there was a}} major change of focus as, with Papua New Guinea independence looming, the Australian Government turned to ASOPA to make good a serious shortage of trained indigenous administrators. The School enrolled up to 60 Papua New Guineans in ten-month management training courses. At the same time, the training of Australians was phased out. In these later years, ASOPA's work became more international. Although Papua New Guinea remained strongly represented, increasing numbers of students came from <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> in the Pacific and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the World Food Program has {{reported}} malnutrition and food shortages, but not famine.

The flagship of the charity’s awareness campaign is International Widows Day, which takes place annually on 23 June, the anniversary of his mother’s widowhood. Following a sustained campaign, on 21 December 2010 the United Nations General Assembly formally recognised, by unanimous acclaim, 23 June as International Widows Day.|$|E
25|$|Measured for all households, U.S. income {{inequality}} {{is comparable to}} <b>other</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> before taxes and transfers, but is among the highest after taxes and transfers, meaning the U.S. shifts relatively less income from higher income households to lower income households.
