5|$|Following the 2006 {{decision}} {{to convert the}} Kolsås Line to metro standard, Akershus County Council announced they would order five units. In November 2006, the city government proposed that {{the maintenance of the}} new trains be privatized. This resulted in protests from the employees, who campaigned by refusing to work overtime. As a result, after a few weeks, the company lacked 57 trains to provide adequate service. The issue was solved when the socialist opposition parties along with the Liberal Party agreed to postpone the matter until after all the new trains were delivered in 2009. As part of the agreement, a new limited company, Oslo Vognselskap, wholly owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, would take ownership of all metro trains and trams used by the operating companies Oslo T-banedrift and Oslo Sporvognsdrift, the latter being the operator of the tramway. Responsibility for the debt accumulated for buying the trains is to be managed by Oslo Vognselskap, while <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> of the maintenance contracts was transferred to Oslo T-banedrift.|$|E

5|$|The long {{investigation}} {{time span}} was causing {{problems for the}} prosecutors as {{an increasing number of}} the counts were meeting their statutes of limitations. The police announced in September 1973 that they were working on indictments towards Tjøntveit and two of the creditors who placed their representatives on the board after the company was insolvent. The police investigation was concluded in May 1975. By then, the statutes of limitations for the accounting issues had passed, and the police focused on the more serious charge of debt manipulation. Tjøntveit and two board members were indicted in 1976. The managing committee for the winding-up released its report in November 1977; the report concluded that although the company's books showed assets of NOK8.6 million, in reality it only had fifty Norwegian krone. The committee further criticized the company for having too low a share capital, lack of qualified management and insufficient competence in <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> of large aircraft.|$|E

25|$|LLNL has a {{long history}} of {{developing}} computing software and systems. Initially, there was no commercially available software, and computer manufacturers considered it the customer’s responsibility to develop their own. Users of the early computers had to write not only the codes to solve their technical problems, but also the routines to run the machines themselves. Today, LLNL computer scientists focus on creating the highly complex physics models, visualization codes, and other unique applications tailored to specific research requirements. A great deal of software also has been written by LLNL personnel to optimize the <b>operation</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> of the computer systems, including operating system extensions such as CHAOS (Linux Clustering) and resource management packages such as SLURM. The Peloton procurements in late 2006 (Atlas and other computers) were the first in which a commercial resource management package, Moab, was used to manage the clusters.|$|E

To achieve this goal, we apply linear programming and simulation techniques and propose a system architecture. Linear programming and simulation are most frequently used techniques in management science field. We apply these techniques to obtain the best staffing level of network <b>operations</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> centers <b>and</b> verify the result. We also propose a system architecture that implements the linear programming model in the real situation and monitor the productivity of network <b>operations</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> centers. This research will help to increase the competitiveness of a telecommunication company {{as well as other}} organizations by reducing the operating expenditure in today’s fierce competitive environment...|$|R
