5|$|Nevadas {{construction}} was authorized by an Act of Congress on 4 March 1911. The contract went to Fore River Shipbuilding Company on 22 January 1912 {{for a total}} of $5,895,000 (not including the armor and armament), and the time of {{construction was}} originally to be 36 months. A secondary contract was signed on 31 July 1912 for $50,000 to cover the additional cost of a geared cruising unit on each propeller shaft; this also extended the planned construction time by five months. Her keel was laid down on 4 November 1912, and by 12 August 1914, the ship was 72.4% complete. Nevada was launched on 11 July 1914; she was sponsored by Miss Eleanor Anne Seibert, niece of Governor Tasker Oddie <b>of</b> <b>Nevada</b> and a descendant of the first Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin Stoddert. The launch was attended by several prominent members of the government, including Governor Oddie, Governor David I.

5|$|Apeomyoides is {{a member}} of the Eomyidae, a diverse rodent family that is now extinct. Eomyids first {{appeared}} in the Middle Eocene (~47 million years ago, mya) in North America, where they existed until the end of the Miocene (~5 mya). In Europe, they survived a little longer, until the end of the Pliocene (~2–3 mya). Apeomyoides is further part of a distinctive subgroup of eomyids known as the Apeomyinae. The first apeomyine to be discovered was Apeomys tuerkheimae, named in 1968 based on fossils from the Early Miocene of Germany, and later discoveries have expanded the range of Apeomys and similar taxa. In 1998, Oldřich Fejfar and colleagues reviewed Apeomys and identified a second, related genus Megapeomys, from the Early Miocene of Germany, the Czech Republic, and Japan. These scientists also named a new eomyid subfamily, Apeomyinae, to house Apeomys and Megapeomys. The Japanese Megapeomys was named as a separate species, Megapeomys repenningi, in 2011. Further apeomyines have been identified in North America: Megapeomys bobwilsoni from the Hemingfordian <b>of</b> <b>Nevada,</b> Apeomyoides savagei from the Barstovian <b>of</b> <b>Nevada,</b> Zophoapeomys indicum from the Late Oligocene of South Dakota, and a possible second species of Zophoapeomys from the Late Oligocene of Nebraska. Another North American eomyid, Arikareeomys skinneri, from the Arikareean of Nebraska, has also been reidentified as an apeomyine.|$|E

5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{a fossil}} rodent from the Miocene of the United States, the only {{species in the}} genus Apeomyoides. It is known from fragmentary jaws and {{isolated}} teeth from a site in the early Barstovian, around 15–16 million years ago, <b>of</b> <b>Nevada.</b> Together with other species from scattered localities in the United States, Japan, and Europe, Apeomyoides is classified in the subfamily Apeomyinae of the extinct rodent family Eomyidae. Apeomyines are a rare but widespread group {{that may have been}} adapted to a relatively dry habitat.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, {{approximately}} 12.7million {{people lived}} in the Colorado River basin. Phoenix in Arizona and Las Vegas in Nevada are the largest metropolitan areas in the watershed. Population densities are also high along the lower Colorado River below Davis Dam, which includes Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, and Yuma. Other significant population centers in the basin include Tucson, Arizona; St. George, Utah; and Grand Junction, Colorado. Colorado River basin states are among the fastest-growing in the U.S.; the population <b>of</b> <b>Nevada</b> alone increased by about 66percent between 1990 and 2000 as Arizona grew by some 40percent.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{indications}} otherwise, Mathias {{announced on}} September 27, 1985, {{that he would}} not seek a fourth term.

At the national level, Mathias' announcement came shortly after news that Republican Paul Laxalt <b>of</b> <b>Nevada</b> would be retiring as well. The departure of two Republican senators from swing or Democratic-leaning states was treated by Republican party leaders as a poor sign of the party's chances in the upcoming elections. Linda Chavez won the Republican primary for the Senate seat, and she lost the general election to Democrat Barbara Mikulski.|$|E
