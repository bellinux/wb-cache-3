This <b>obviously</b> <b>has</b> consequences for the accuracy of spatial derivatives of the velocity field, vorticity, and spatial correlation functions that are often derived from PIV velocity fields.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no natural}} {{candidate}} {{for what might}} cause {{what has been called}} dark energy but the current best guess is that it is the zero-point energy of the vacuum. One difficulty with this assumption is that the zero-point energy of the vacuum is absurdly large compared to the observed cosmological constant. In general relativity, mass and energy are equivalent; both produce a gravitational field and therefore the theorized vacuum energy of quantum field theory should have led the universe ripping itself to pieces. This <b>obviously</b> <b>has</b> not happened and this issue, called the cosmological constant problem, {{is one of the greatest}} unsolved mysteries in physics.|$|E
25|$|How the {{distinction}} between productive and unproductive labor is drawn <b>obviously</b> <b>has</b> a big mathematical effect on the estimated total profit rate on production, if unproductive labor costs are excluded from the total variable capital outlay, and included {{in the part of}} total net output which represents total surplus value produced. If the proportion of unproductive labor increases, paradoxically the total surplus value will then also increase, with the effect of raising the rate of profit. Prof. Moseley resolves this paradoxical effect by distinguishing between primary and secondary income distributions, and between gross and net surplus value. In his account, first the total net value-added is produced by the productive workers, and then the gross wages of the unproductive workers are deducted from the gross surplus value; in that interpretation, it follows that the larger the wage-bill of unproductive workers is, the lower the netted surplus value will be. Chris Harman noted large quantitative differences in the estimates of unproductive labor by different orthodox Marxists. Moseley's calculations and his definition of unproductive labor have been criticized by other Marxists. The main objections discussed are conceptual and empirical.|$|E

500|$|The film's overall {{structure}} {{was influenced by}} the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, [...] "We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling – like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes." [...] The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, [...] "He {{is a little bit of}} an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it <b>obviously</b> <b>has</b> echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain." ...|$|E

Clarkson wrote the treatment for the video herself in order to reflect the pain that she felt due to her parents' divorce. Nevertheless, Clarkson also allowed Perelman {{to take control of}} the production of the video. According to Perelman, he wanted to create a disconnection to show [...] "that this kind of dysfunctional family can exist anywhere." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Clarkson confessed that the video is sad, rationalizing, [...] "It's a sad song, so the video <b>obviously</b> <b>has</b> to follow that.

It's a difficult song. You need a really big voice to be able to perform that song. I was like, 'Whoa!' She <b>obviously</b> <b>has</b> an amazing voice, and I think it was a really interesting exercise for her and for me." [...] Guetta further explained that when he collaborates with artists, he likes to [...] "take them out of their boxes", and creating a dance record with Hudson was [...] "really exciting" [...] for him. On working with Hudson, he said, [...] "She is beautiful in every way: as a person, as a singer, as a human being. She delivered [...] like crazy."

500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode ranged from mixed to positive. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 6.8/10, stating that although it was [...] "perfectly serviceable, professionally produced television," [...] it was [...] "much like the last week {{with a little bit}} of been-there-done-that conspiracy stuff thrown on top of it," [...] and that the plot was [...] "almost boilerplate for this genre." [...] By this point in the series, the reviewer believed that [...] "the thing about Fringe that is holding it back is that you're always ahead of it. The show needs to change things up." [...] Bryant L. Griffin of Airlock Alpha, opined; [...] "Though not the show's best hour to date, 'Power Hungry' is still a solid entry. Good directing, writing, and outstanding production values are maintained as the series' norm." [...] In addition Griffin enjoyed Fischer's [...] "casual surrender", as [...] "in the past, those associated with 'the pattern' exhibited a fevered desire to avoid capture, going as far as committing suicide.

2500|$|Soils {{consist of}} a mixture of {{particles}} of different size, shape and mineralogy. Because {{the size of the}} particles <b>obviously</b> <b>has</b> a significant effect on the soil behavior, the grain size and grain size distribution are used to classify soils. The grain size distribution describes the relative proportions of particles of various sizes. The grain size is often visualized in a cumulative distribution graph which, for example, plots the percentage of particles finer than a given size as a function of size. The median grain size, , is the size for which 50% of the particle mass consists of finer particles. Soil behavior, especially the hydraulic conductivity, tends to be dominated by the smaller particles, hence, the term [...] "effective size", denoted by , is defined as the size for which 10% of the particle mass consists of finer particles.|$|E
2500|$|Disagreement {{with the}} verdict was heavily debated by the media, lawyers and psychologists, who put forth several {{theories}} for public dissatisfaction with the decision, ranging from wanting justice for Caylee, to the circumstantial evidence having been strong enough, to some blaming the media. UCLA forensic psychiatrist Dr. Carole Lieberman, said, [...] "The main reason that people are reacting so strongly is that the media convicted Casey before the jury decided on the verdict. The public has been whipped up into this frenzy wanting revenge for this poor little adorable child. And because of the desire for revenge, they've been whipped up into a lynch mob." [...] She added, [...] "Nobody likes a liar, and Anthony was a habitual liar. And nobody {{liked the fact that}} she was partying after Caylee's death.

According to Marks' interview with the New York Post, the issue stemmed from Manson's displeasure with the magazine's decision to renege on a promised cover story of the band for their January 1999 cover. According to Marks, the last-minute change was made because Manson's record wasn't [...] "performing." [...] The Post described the editor as [...] "bruised and battered."
