2500|$|Some simpler or cheaper oxygen-fuel {{regulators}} {{have only a}} single stage regulator, or only a single gauge. A single-stage regulator will tend to allow a reduction in outlet pressure as the cylinder is emptied, requiring manual readjustment. For low-volume users, this is an acceptable simplification. Welding regulators, unlike simpler LPG heating regulators, retain their <b>outlet</b> (<b>hose)</b> pressure gauge and do not rely on the calibration of the adjustment knob. The cheaper single-stage regulators may sometimes omit the cylinder contents gauge, or replace the accurate dial gauge with a cheaper and less precise [...] "rising button" [...] gauge.|$|E
50|$|Booster {{pumps are}} usually piston or plunger type compressors. A single-acting, {{single-stage}} booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed {{to withstand the}} operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and discharge hoses or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the inlet hose, through the inlet valve into {{the space between the}} cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the <b>outlet</b> <b>hose</b> is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the <b>outlet</b> <b>hose</b> is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalised, taking valve opening pressures into account.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the relationship between mitochondrial transport and neuronal function, it is critical to observe mitochondrial behavior in live cultured neurons for extended durations 1 - 3. This is now possible through the use of vital dyes and fluorescent proteins with which cytoskeletal components, organelles, and other structures in living cells can be labeled and then visualized via dynamic fluorescence microscopy. For example, in embryonic chicken sympathetic neurons, mitochondrial movement was characterized using the vital dye rhodamine 123 4. In another study, mitochondria were visualized in rat forebrain neurons by transfection of mitochondrially targeted eYFP 5. However, imaging of primary neurons over minutes, hours, or even days presents a number of issues. Foremost among these are: 1) maintenance of culture conditions such as temperature, humidity, and pH during long imaging sessions; 2) a strong, stable fluorescent signal to assure both the quality of acquired images and accurate measurement of signal intensity during image analysis; and 3) limiting exposure times during image acquisition to minimize photobleaching and avoid phototoxicity. Here, we describe a protocol that permits the observation, visualization, and analysis of mitochondrial movement in cultured hippocampal neurons with high temporal resolution and under optimal life support conditions. We have constructed an affordable stage-top incubator that provides good temperature regulation and atmospheric gas flow, and also limits the degree of media evaporation, assuring stable pH and osmolarity. This incubator is connected, via inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>hoses,</b> to a standard tissue culture incubator, which provides constant humidity level...|$|R
40|$|During autumn 2003, several {{thousand}} European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) began roosting on exposed I-beams {{in a newly}} constructed, decorative glass canopy that covered the passenger pick-up area at the terminal building for Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, Ohio. The use of lethal control or conventional dispersal techniques, such as pyrotechnics and fire hoses, were not feasible in the airport terminal area. The design and aesthetics of the structure precluded the use of netting and other exclusion materials. In January 2004, {{an attempt was made}} to disperse the birds using recorded predator and distress calls broadcast from speakers installed in the structure. This technique failed to disperse the birds. In February 2004, we developed a technique using compressed air to physically and audibly harass the birds. We used a trailer-mounted commercial air compressor producing 185 cubic feet per minute of air at 100 pounds per square inch pressure and a 20 -foot long, 1 -inch diameter PVC pipe attached to the <b>outlet</b> <b>hose.</b> One person slowly (3 ̆c 5 mph) drove a pick-up truck through the airport terminal at dusk while the second person sat on a bench in the truck bed and directed the compressed air from the pipe into the canopy to harass starlings attempting to enter the roost site. After 5 consecutive nights of compressed-air harassment, virtually no starlings attempted to roost in the canopy. Once familiar with the physical effects of the compressed air, the birds dispersed {{at the sound of the}} air. Only occasional harassment at dusk was needed through the remainder of the winter to keep the canopy free of starlings. Similar harassment with the compressor was conducted successfully in autumn 2004 with the addition of a modified leaf blower, wooden clappers, and laser. In conclusion, we found compressed air to be a safe, unobtrusive, and effective method for dispersing starlings from an urban roost site. This technique would likely be applicable for other urban-roosting species such as crows, house sparrows, and blackbirds...|$|E
50|$|Laying a firehose up a {{stairwell}} takes time, {{and this}} time is saved by having fixed <b>hose</b> <b>outlets</b> already in place. There is also a tendency for heavy wet hoses to slide downward when placed on an incline (such as the incline seen in a stairwell), whereas standpipes do not move. The use of standpipes keeps stairwells clear and is safer for exiting occupants.|$|R
40|$|The present {{experimental}} study {{is concerned with}} the design and testing of multilayers coil pump to obtain the pump performance under different design parameters. These include method of winding the hose around the drum in multi-layers, inlet and <b>outlet</b> position, <b>hose</b> inner diameter, drum diameter. For this purpose, a coil pump was designed, constructed and tested. The experimental results showed that the three layers coil pump has better performance than single and two layer pumps. In addition, improved pump performance is obtained when the pump inlet placed at the top end in the case of multi-layer pumps. Moreover, increase the coil hose inner diameter and/or drum outer diameter results in better coil pump performance...|$|R
50|$|The regular {{discharge}} {{time for a}} tanker of 8 - 9 m³ is about 15 minutes (or 7-10 minutes to unload a tanker of 4000 liters). The outlet is typically 4 to 6 inch cm in diameter. The {{discharge time}} depends on {{the thickness of the}} sludge, the size of the <b>outlet</b> valve and <b>hose,</b> the amount of garbage in the fecal sludge and how often the driver has to stop to clean the dump screen.|$|R
50|$|The D4 Premium also {{features}} a unique novel ring of blue LED's around the control dial that highlights visual suction speed according to motor speed. Lower models such as the D2 Storm, D2 Titan, and D2 Total only have a single LED next to the rotary power adjustment knob to indicate power on status. The D series features a mechanical piston bag full indicator next to the <b>hose</b> <b>outlet,</b> and 4 swivel castors on the underside for maximum movement in space restricted areas.|$|R
50|$|When {{standpipes}} {{are fixed}} into buildings, the pipe {{is in place}} permanently with an intake usually located near a road or driveway, so that a fire engine can supply water to the system. The standpipe extends into the building to supply fire fighting water to {{the interior of the}} structure via <b>hose</b> <b>outlets,</b> often located between each pair of floors in stairwells in high rise buildings. Dry standpipes are not filled with water until needed in fire fighting. Fire fighters often bring hoses in with them and attach them to standpipe outlets located along the pipe throughout the structure. This type of standpipe may also be installed horizontally on bridges.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design process}} and development approach for a method of maintaining sufficient quantities of water for research animals during a Shuttle mission of long duration. An inflight refill unit (IRU) consisting of two major subsystems, a fluid pumping unit (FPU) and a collapsible water reservoir (CWR), were developed. The FPU provides the system measurement and controls, pump, water lines, and plumbing necessary to collect water coming into the unit from the potable water system and pump it out into the RAHF drinking water tanks. The CWR is a Kevlar (TM) reinforced storage bladder connected to the FPU, which has a capacity of 6 liters in its expanded volume and functions to store the water collected from the potable water system, allowing for transport of the water back to the Spacelab where it is pumped into each of two research animal holding facilities. Additional components of the IRU system include the inlet and <b>outlet</b> fluid <b>hoses,</b> a power cable for providing 29 V direct current spacecraft electrical power to the pump within the FPU, a tether system for the unit when in use in Spacelab, and an adapter for mating the unit to the orbiter waste collection system in order to dump excess water after use in Spacelab...|$|R
50|$|By 1954, The McDonald brothers' stand was {{restaurant}} equipment manufacturer Prince Castle's biggest purchaser of milkshake blending machines. Prince Castle salesman Ray Kroc traveled to California to discover why {{the company had}} purchased almost {{a dozen of the}} units as opposed to the normal one or two found in most restaurants of the time. Enticed by the success of the McDonald's concept, Kroc signed a franchise agreement with the brothers and began opening McDonald's restaurants in Illinois. By 1961, Kroc had bought out the brothers and created what is now the modern McDonald's Corporation. One of the major parts of his business plan was to promote cleanliness of his restaurants to growing groups of Americans that had become aware of food safety issues. As part of his commitment to cleanliness, Kroc often took part in cleaning his own Des Plaines, Illinois <b>outlet</b> by <b>hosing</b> down the garbage cans and scraping gum off the cement. Another concept Kroc added was great swaths of glass which enabled the customer to view the food preparation, a practice still found in chains such as Krispy Kreme. A clean atmosphere was only part of Kroc's grander plan which separated McDonald's {{from the rest of the}} competition and attributes to their great success. Kroc envisioned making his restaurants appeal to suburban families.|$|R
50|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, the {{firefighting}} teams were initially overwhelmed by the firestorm. The winds were gusting at times in excess of 70 mi/h km/h, creating erratic and extreme fire behavior. Flames took out power lines to seventeen pumping stations in the Oakland water system. Outside fire teams faced various equipment compatibility issues such as hydrants having the wrong size <b>outlets</b> for the <b>hoses</b> used by neighboring counties. Oakland was also not {{able to communicate with}} many mutual aid resources due to antiquated equipment and lack of access to statewide radio frequencies brought on by the budget restrictions in the preceding years. In some areas, firefighters simply ran out of water, as there was no power to refill the emptied reservoirs. Additionally, many narrow, winding roads in the area were crowded with parked cars, including many in front of fire hydrants; this prevented fire trucks and ambulances from getting to certain areas and connecting fire hoses. The general situation was one of chaos and panic among residents in the area.|$|R
40|$|The Spacelab Life Sciences 2 (SLS- 2) mission became NASA's longest {{duration}} Shuttle mission, lasting fourteen days, when Columbia {{landed on}} 1 Nov. 1993. Located within the Spacelab were {{a total of}} 48 laboratory rats which were housed in two Research Animal Holding Facilities (RAHF's) developed by the Space Life Sciences Payloads Office (SLSPO) at Ames Research Center. In order to properly maintain {{the health and well-being}} of these important research animals, sufficient quantities of food and water had to be available for the duration of the mission. An inflight Refill Unit was developed by the SLSPO to replenish the animals' drinking water inflight using the Shuttle potable water system in the middeck galley as the source of additional water. The Inflight Refill Unit consists of two major subsystems, a Fluid Pumping Unit (FPU) and a Collapsible Water Reservoir (CWR). The FPU provides the system measurement and controls, pump, water lines, and plumbing necessary to collect water coming into the unit from the potable water system and pump it out and into the RAHF drinking water tanks. The CWR is a Kevlar(trademark) reinforced storage bladder, connected to the FPU, which has a capacity of 6 liters in its expanded volume and functions to store the water collected from the potable water system and allows for the transport of the water back to the Spacelab where it is pumped into each of two RAHFs. Additional components of the FPU system include the inlet and <b>outlet</b> fluid <b>hoses,</b> a power cable for providing 28 volt direct current spacecraft electrical power to the pump within the FPU, a tether system for the unit when in use in Spacelab, and an adapter for mating the unit to the orbiter waste collection system in order to dump excess water after use in Spacelab. This paper will present the design process and development approach for the lnflight Refill Unit, define some of the key design issues which had to be addressed, and summarize the inflight operational performance of the unit during the SLS- 2 mission...|$|R
