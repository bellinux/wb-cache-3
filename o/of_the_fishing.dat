5|$|Green Creek rises near Waller {{and heads}} roughly south to Rohrsburg {{and on to}} Orangeville, where it joins Fishing Creek. It drains the central part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fishing</b> Creek watershed. Little Fishing Creek starts just in Lycoming County near the Columbia County Line. It winds through rural areas before {{reaching}} Pennsylvania Route 42, which it runs parallel to {{for the remainder of}} its length. It drains the western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fishing</b> Creek watershed. Four covered bridges cross Little Fishing Creek; these are the Wanich Covered Bridge No. 69, the Sam Eckman Covered Bridge No. 92, the Jud Christie Covered Bridge No. 95, and the Creasyville Covered Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, amateur historians {{first began}} writing {{accounts}} of the events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fishing</b> Creek Confederacy. In January 1950, William M. Scnure mentioned the event {{at a meeting of}} the Northumberland County Historical Society, and the fort on North Mountain was said to exist in an article written by Myrtle Magargel in 1955. In 1958 the Fishing Creek Confederacy was mentioned in the History of Columbia County, Pennsylvania, which was intended to be used in schools in Columbia County. In the 1960s and 1970s local newspapers occasionally ran articles summarizing the Fishing Creek Confederacy. In 1998, the Bloomsburg Theater Ensemble compiled a book of Columbia County history based on letters to the editor, and several of these letters mentioned the Fishing Creek Confederacy. In 2012 Byron Heller wrote a piece of historical fiction called The Fishing Creek Confederacy, inspired by the events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fishing</b> Creek Confederacy. The confederacy has been the subject of satirical works.|$|E

5|$|Fishing {{and hunting}} are popular outdoor {{activities}} in South Dakota. Fishing contributes over $224million to South Dakota's economy, and hunting contributes over $303million. In 2007, over 275,000 hunting licences and 175,000 fishing licences {{were sold in}} the state; around half of the hunting licences and over two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> licences were purchased by South Dakotans. Popular species of game include pheasants, white-tailed deer, mule deer, and turkeys, as well as waterfowl such as Canada geese, snow geese, and mallards. Targets of anglers include walleye in the eastern glacial lakes and Missouri River reservoirs, Chinook salmon in Lake Oahe, and trout in the Black Hills.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 {{the soils}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fishing</b> Creek {{watershed}} {{were found to}} yield large quantities of farm crops. Potatoes yielded 100 to 200 bushels per acre, corn 70 to 90 bushels per acre, oats 40 bushels per acre, wheat 20 to 30 bushels per acre, and hay one to two tons per acre. J.H. Battle's 1887 History of Columbia and Montour Counties, Pennsylvania stated that the Fishing Creek valley was fertile.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{rejected a}} report prepared {{by an independent}} committee that called for a massive downsizing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> industry. The report by the Steering Committee for Fishing Industry Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was released by the province, and called for $450 million to be spent to achieve substantial cuts in the industry. At the time Minister Jackman dismissed the report almost immediately, saying the $450 million price tag was too expensive. Opposition parties and union leaders were {{highly critical of the}} government for dismissing the report, with NDP leader Lorraine Michael calling for Minister Jackman to resign.|$|E

5|$|On August 21, 1864, the {{soldiers}} began traveling up Fishing Creek. For the next week, they searched the northern portion of Columbia County for deserters and draft evaders. They {{were unable to}} find any, but on August 28 they arrested 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some were taken to Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fishing</b> Creek watershed. Unable to find any evidence of a conspiracy, they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864. The last of the prisoners were released from Fort Mifflin several months after their arrest.|$|E
5|$|Some {{stretches}} of Fishing Creek contain {{significant amounts of}} algae because of leaking septic systems in the watershed. The area around the tributary West Creek is the least habitable part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fishing</b> Creek area, according to a 2011 study. The water quality of Fishing Creek can vary. Its pH ranges from 4.9 to 8.5, while the concentration of dissolved oxygen ranges from 5 to 17.5mg per liter. The creek's average discharge is 615 cubic feet per second (17.4 m3/s); its watershed contains gravel, shale and various loams—in particular the Albrights soil series and the Leck Kill soil.|$|E
5|$|The CCF {{represented}} many {{agricultural areas}} in the Commons, and it proposed several measures to assure financial security for farmers. It proposed national growers' cooperatives for agricultural products which were exported. It proposed cash advances for farm-stored wheat, {{short and long term}} loans for farmers at low interest rates, and government support of prices, to assure the farmer a full income even in bad years. For the Atlantic fisherman, the CCF proposed cash advances at the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> season and government-owned depots which would sell fishing equipment and supplies to fishermen at much lower than market prices.|$|E

5|$|The pie {{originates}} {{from the}} fishing village of Mousehole in Cornwall. As with {{many parts of}} Cornish heritage, a legend has appeared about its origins. In this case, the pie is served to celebrate the bravery of Tom Bawcock, a local fisherman in the 16th century. The legend explains that one winter had been particularly stormy, meaning that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> boats {{had been able to}} leave the harbour. As Christmas approached, the villagers, who relied on fish as their primary source of food, were facing starvation.|$|E
5|$|To commemorate {{his status}} as founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> town Vågan (although {{it had been an}} {{important}} centre for at least a century), a huge statue of Eystein (Øysteinstatuen) by Arthur Gustavson was raised at Breidablikk in Vågan in 1935, after an idea of architect Harald Sund. At Hjerkinn in Dovre, a church dedicated to Eystein (Eysteinskyrkja) was constructed in 1969 according to a design by Magnus Poulsson, in commemoration of Eystein's construction of a sælehus or shelter near the village.|$|E

5|$|With {{the arrival}} of English {{soldiers}} by ship, and naval battles on the seas, areas used for salt water fishing became perilous, and lay dormant {{for much of the}} war. In addition, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels were converted into warships. Before the war, there was often talk about the excess of lobsters and cod off the shores of New England. This seemed to change during and after the war, due to the vast numbers of ships and artillery entering the ocean waters. Once lobster harvesting and cod fishing was reestablished, most fishermen found that the lobster and cod had migrated away from the shores.|$|E
5|$|St. John's {{is one of}} North America's oldest European settlements, with {{fishermen}} {{setting up}} seasonal camps in the early 16th century. Sebastian Cabot declares in a handwritten Latin text in his original 1545 map, that St. John's earned its name {{when he and his}} father, the Venetian explorer John Cabot became the first Europeans to sail into the harbour, in the morning of 24 June 1494 (against British and French historians stating 1497), the feast day of Saint John the Baptist. However, the locations of Cabot's landfalls are disputed. A series of expeditions to St. John's by Portuguese from the Azores took place in the early 16th century, and by 1540 French, Spanish and Portuguese ships crossed the Atlantic annually to fish the waters off the Avalon Peninsula. In the Basque Country, it is a common belief the name of St. John's was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St. John's is very similar to the Bay of Pasaia in the Basque Country, where one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> towns is called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in Basque, Donibane).|$|E

5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated on the first day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E
