Embedded {{in a process of}} critical self-reflection regarding epistemic habits, the article discusses disidentification (Butler 1993, Muñoz 1999), cruel optimism (Berlant 2011), and everyday utopianism (Cooper 2014) understood as examples of such habits. The article explores how feminisms, unfolding within academia, and thus institutionally embedded in the logics of global capitalism, neoliberalism and particular nation-state politics, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand,</b> are bound to a performance of cruel optimism, glossing over dilemmas and contradictions, and, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, perhaps enabled to enact messy kinds of everyday utopianism.

These issues are addressed as being interwoven with and mixed up in the epistemic practices that are produced by messy links with both feminist activist resistance and institutionalized and professionalized academic feminisms...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of the European securities market is <b>one</b> of <b>the</b> most important and ambitious steps of {{the making of a}} unified financial system, particularly since the achievement of the monetary union. The paper contributes to <b>the</b> debate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> integration and shows why the issue of costs and competition between different trading and post-trading systems is the key point of future integration. In particular, the analysis starts with the roadmap set by the European Commission and the evolution of the regulatory approach towards the {{integration of}} the trading and post-trading sectors. After the roadmap, in the paper we review the results of <b>the</b> research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main issues related to the integration of securities markets and we comment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> present situation, with particular references to the alliances and mergers between the main actors of the trading and post-trading business.
