25|$|Inuit {{actually}} {{consume more}} carbohydrates than most nutritionists have assumed. Because {{some of the}} meat the Inuit eat is raw and fresh, or freshly frozen, they can obtain more carbohydrates from their meat, as dietary glycogen, than Westerners can. The Inuit practice of preserving a whole seal or bird carcass under an intact whole skin with {{a thick layer of}} blubber also permits some proteins to ferment, or hydrolyze, into carbohydrates. Furthermore, the blubber, organs, muscle and skin of the marine mammals that Inuit eat have significant glycogen stores, which assist those animals when oxygen is depleted on prolonged dives. For instance, when blubber is analyzed by direct carbohydrate measurements, it has been shown to contain as much as 8—30% carbohydrates. While postmortem glycogen levels are often depleted through the onset of rigor mortis, marine mammals have a much delayed onset of rigor mortis, even in warm conditions, presumably due to the high content of <b>oxymyoglobin</b> in the muscle that may permit aerobic metabolism to continue slowly for some time after the death of the animal.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of O 2 -derived free radicals on <b>oxymyoglobin,</b> the myocardial intracellular protein involved in the storage and transport of O 2. The oxyradicals generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system decreased the concentration of <b>oxymyoglobin.</b> Based on the decreases in absorbance peaks at 581 nm and 415 nm it is estimated that out of a 10 nmol decrease in <b>oxymyoglobin,</b> 5 nmol appears to be oxidized to ferrimyoglobin (deoxygenation), while haem was removed from the other 5 nmol of haem protein. These processes were inhibited by both catalase alone and superoxide dismutase in combination with catalase, but not by either superoxide dismutase alone or deferoxamine. These results suggest that among H 2 O 2, OH. and O 2. -, only H 2 O 2 causes the removal of haem and the oxidation of <b>oxymyoglobin.</b> Furthermore, the oxyradicals also released 3 microM free iron from <b>oxymyoglobin,</b> which is at least 5 -fold less than the 15 nmol loss of <b>oxymyoglobin.</b> The loss of <b>oxymyoglobin</b> also preceded the release of free iron. These results indicate that <b>oxymyoglobin</b> oxidation and haem removal occur before the removal of free iron. Thus myoglobin appears to be highly susceptible to free radical attack, and this may represent yet another mechanism of free radical-mediated cellular injury...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oxymyoglobin</b> in aqueous {{extracts}} {{of fresh}} beef longissimus dorsi muscles was initially oxidised to metmyoglobin during heat treatments at {{temperatures in the}} range 50 - 70 degreesC. The metmyoglobin then underwent reduction to a red pigment that was shown spectrally to be identical to <b>oxymyoglobin.</b> The formation of <b>oxymyoglobin</b> involved a heat induced precipitate that when removed from the solution, allowed oxidation to metmyoglobin to occur. However, on re-addition of the precipitate further reduction to <b>oxymyoglobin</b> took place. Dialysis of the muscle extract prior to heating markedly inhibited the reduction but addition of NADH to the dialysate permitted further reduction. The precipitate plus NADH caused <b>oxymyoglobin</b> formation {{in the presence of}} metmyoglobin but neither the precipitate nor NADH alone induced this formation. It is concluded that the initial conversion of <b>oxymyoglobin</b> to metmyoglobin on heating fresh beef muscle extracts was reversible and that the reverse reaction depended on the presence of both NADH and a muscle protein...|$|E
40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} and myoglobin oxidation in muscle foods {{occur in}} a concurrent manner and each process appears to enhance the other. During oxidation of <b>oxymyoglobin,</b> both superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide are produced and further react with iron to produce hydroxyl radical. The hydroxyl radical {{has the ability to}} penetrate into the hydrophobic lipid region and hence facilitates lipid oxidation. The prooxidant effect of <b>oxymyoglobin</b> on lipid oxidation is concentrationdependent. At equimolar concentrations, <b>oxymyoglobin</b> shows higher prooxidative activity towards lipid than metmyoglobin. However, the catalytic activity of metmyoglobin is promoted by hydrogen peroxide. The reaction between hydrogen peroxide and metmyoglobin results in the formation of two active hypervalent myoglobin species, perferrylmyoglobin and ferrylmyoglobin, which are responsible for lipid oxidation. Additionally, lipid oxidation results {{in a wide range of}} aldehyde products, which are reported to induce the oxidation of <b>oxymyoglobin.</b> Metmyoglobin formation is generally greater in the presence of unsaturated aldehydes than their saturated counterparts of equivalent carbon chain length. In addition, increasing chain length of aldehydes, from hexenal through nonenal, results in the increased metmyoglobin formation. Moreover, aldehydes alter myoglobin redox stability by increasing <b>oxymyoglobin</b> oxidation, decreasing the metmyoglobin reduction via enzymatic process, and enhance the prooxidant activity of metmyoglobin. Therefore, the oxidation of both lipid and myoglobin directly affect the quality and acceptability of muscle foods and the lowering of such a phenomenon can enhance the shelf-life stability of those foods...|$|E

The reaction of ascorbate with ferryl- or met-myoglobin resulted in ascorbyl radical production. The {{interaction of}} ascorbate with <b>oxymyoglobin</b> proceeded with formation of ascorbyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and an overall oxidation of <b>oxymyoglobin</b> to metmyoglobin. The latter reaction proceeded via an oxoferryl complex intermediate - corresponding to ferrylmyoglobin and identified by {{treatment of the}} reaction mixture with Na 2 S. These observations are consistent with a concerted electron transfer mechanism, whereby the two electrons required for the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide are donated by ascorbic acid and the heme iron.

40|$|Studies of the {{intracellular}} role of myoglobin {{were carried}} out by recording spectrophotometric changes in acid metmyoglobin and <b>oxymyoglobin</b> during electron transport reactions with mitochondria prepared from pigeon heart muscle by the method of Chance and Hagihara. The absorption peak of metmyoglobin at 409 mµ disappeared when substrate was added to normal or antimycin-inhibited preparations, {{and was replaced by}} a new maximum at 423 to 424 mµ, identified as due to the oxidation to ferrylmyoglobin. Further investigation revealed that the oxidation of metmyoglobin took place with the simultaneous oxidation of reduced flavoprotein. Hydrogen peroxide, formed by the reaction of reduced flavoprotein with oxygen, was considered to be the probable intermediate for the oxidation of metmyoglobin in experiments in which catalase was added as a competitor for the oxidant. When DPNH was added to the reaction mixture, the reductant acted to resynthesize the ferri-derivative by reaction with ferrylmyoglobin. <b>Oxymyoglobin</b> could not be used in place of metmyoglobin in these systems.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present thesis was to obtain more fundamental understanding of the mechanisms for variations in colour and colour stability of fresh pork. The effects of breed and genotype, including Duroc, Hampshire (three RN alleles), Landrace and Yorkshire pigs, were studied. Furthermore, effects of strategic feeding with creatine, pre-slaughter treatment, slaughter procedure and carcass cooling on muscle metabolism and ultimate colour and colour stability were studied. It was concluded that the early progress in post mortem temperature and pH decline affect the colour of pork independent of whether this is triggered by variations in genotype, feed-induced changes, pre-slaughter stress or cooling rate. The level of <b>oxymyoglobin</b> was shown {{to be more important}} for the colour of pork during retail display, than the level of metmyoglobin. A high level of <b>oxymyoglobin</b> preserves high redness despite of oxidation to metmyoglobin. Ageing of pork for a week increased the ability of pork to stimulate oxygenation of deoxymyoglobin to <b>oxymyoglobin,</b> i. e. blooming, without compromising the colour stability during four days of subsequent retail display. Hence, ageing results in lighter, redder and more yellow pork colour. It was further concluded that genetics giving rise to variation in the colour of pork is related to differences in pigment content and in muscle metabolism. The latter influences the redox status of the muscle and the activity of oxygen-consuming and metmyoglobin-reducing enzymes and accordingly the relative proportion of the myoglobin species. The colour of pork from Landrace pigs was generally lighter, redder and more yellow than pork from Duroc pigs due to higher level of <b>oxymyoglobin</b> at the meat surface, i. e. more intense blooming. The colour of pork from Hampshire pigs was highly related to the RN genotype. Pork from carriers of the RN- allele was generally lighter, redder and more yellow than that from non-carriers of the RN- allele, and the rn* (V 199 I) allele tended to decrease redness and yellowness...|$|E

Raw patties were analyzed for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), <b>oxymyoglobin</b> concentration, objective color by Minolta colorimeter, and by a trained sensory panel for odor, color and percent discoloration. No differences (P > 0. 05) were observed between traditional and innovative style patties for TBARS, sensory odor or color, or <b>oxymyoglobin</b> concentration.

Changes in the percentages of <b>oxymyoglobin</b> and metmyoglobin during the reaction were analysed by means of isoelectric focusing on Ampholine gel plates. <b>Oxymyoglobin</b> was decreased in a first-order manner, with an accompanying increase in metmyoglobin, under the various conditions studied. The observed reaction rate constants obtained under these conditions were pH-dependent; however, they were also greatly affected by the presence of the enzymes. The pH-dependence of the overall reaction was explained by the acid-base three-state model of myoglobin proposed by Shikama & Sugawara [(1978) Eur. J. Biochem. 91, 407 - 413]. The reaction process of myoglobin autoxidation was explained by the model suggested by Winterbourn, McGrath & Carrell [(1976) Biochem.

The measurement of colour in the C. I. E. L*a*b* space and the determination of <b>oxymyoglobin,</b> deoxymyoglobin, and metmyoglobin were performed on VP and modified atmosphere-packed (70 % O 2 / 30 % CO 2 for 24 h) samples (n = 10). Results obtained were compared to two reference methods (colour measurement using a chromameter Minolta CR- 400 and spectrophotometric determination of different myoglobin redox forms in aqueous meat extracts) by F-test for precision and t-test for accuracy. Statistic significance level was established at 5 %. The two colour measurement methods presented the same precision, when considering VP samples only, and different accuracies, probably because of the different detectors and observation angles used by both devices. The two methods for determining the different myoglobin forms presented also the same precision but different accuracies, probably due to the fact that oxygenation is favoured during some steps of the reference method (e. g. extraction, filtration). In conclusion, the results for colour measurement obtained by both devices cannot be compared. It is necessary to compare both methods for determining <b>oxymyoglobin,</b> deoxymyoglobin, and metmyoglobin in complete anaerobic conditions in order to eliminate the oxygenation bias.

40|$|Myoglobin-mediated oxygen {{delivery}} to intracellular mitochondria is demonstrated in cardiac myocytes {{isolated from the}} hearts of mature rats. Myocytes are held at high ambient oxygen pressure, 40 - 340 torr (5 - 45 kPa); sarcoplasmic myoglobin is fully oxygenated. In this condition oxygen availability does not limit respiratory rate; myoglobin-facilitated diffusion contributes no additional oxygen flux and, since oxygen consumption is measured in steady states, the storage function of myoglobin vanishes. Carbon monoxide, introduced stepwise, displaces oxygen from intracellular <b>oxymyoglobin</b> without altering the optical spectrum of the largely oxidized intracellular mitochondria. A large part, about one-third, of the steady-state oxygen uptake is abolished by carbon monoxide blockade of myoglobin oxygenation. The myoglobin-dependent component of the oxygen uptake decreases linearly with decreasing fraction of intracellular <b>oxymyoglobin,</b> with a slope near unity. Studies using inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport indicate that myoglobin-delivered oxygen uptake depends on electron flow through the mitochondrial electron transport chain. We conclude that cardiac mitochondria accept two additive simultaneous flows of oxygen: a flow of dissolved oxygen to cytochrome oxidase and a flow of myoglobin-bound oxygen to a mitochondrial terminus.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we use ab initio {{molecular}} dynamics simulations to analyze the structure and dynamics of the oxygen ligand in models of the <b>oxymyoglobin</b> active site and its cobalt-substituted analog. Our calculations are performed for iron-porphyrin and cobalt-porphyrin complexes with imidazole and oxygen as axial ligands, and we investigate {{the effect of the}} distal histidine in the structure and dynamics of the metal-oxygen unit (MeO 2, Me=Fe, Co). We find that the interaction between the distal histidine and the oxygen ligand is stronger for the cobalt complex than for the iron one, consistent with the superoxide ion character of the bound O 2. The dynamics of the O 2 ligand can be described as oscillations of the O-O axis projection on the porphyrin plane within a porphyrin quadrant combined with frequent jumps from one quadrant to another. However, the ligand motion is significantly faster for CoO 2 compared to FeO 2. As a result, the iron complex shows localized ligand sites, whereas for cobalt several configurations are possible. This gives support to the highly dynamic motion of the oxygen ligand found in several experiments on cobalt <b>oxymyoglobin</b> and model complexes and underlines the higher mobility of the CoO 2 fragment compared to FeO 2...|$|E
40|$|This thesis reports two {{separate}} kinetic studies on hemoproteins: the first, the oxidation of whale myoglobin, and the second, ligand binding and subunit aggregation kinetics of lamprey hemoglobin. ^ The oxidation kinetics of sperm whale skeletal muscle <b>oxymyoglobin</b> by excess nitrite were studied. The oxidation curve showed an induction period {{prior to a}} rapid first order decay. The induction period varied inversely with {{the square of the}} nitrite concentration, whereas the rate of the first order decay was proportional to the nitrite concentration, but neither rate was affected by <b>oxymyoglobin</b> or metmyoglobin in the presence of excess nitrite. Various anions, such as cyanide, thiocyanate, azide and iodide, and some amino acids, such as tyrosine, tryptophan and cysteine, have inhibitory effects whereas other amino acids, such as histidine, methionine, threonine, and serine, have promotive effects on the rate of metmyoglobin formation. Intermediates were detected {{during the course of the}} oxidation. The extinction coefficients of one of the intermediates were estimated. The oxidation of deoxymyoglobin by excess nitrite showed a slower first order decay without the induction period and was not affected by dilute cyanide. The oxidation by nitrite of carboxymyoglobin, human oxyhemoglobin and its (beta) -chains, as well as Glycera monomeric oxyhemoglobin were studied for comparison with <b>oxymyoglobin.</b> The reaction of <b>oxymyoglobin</b> and nitrite is very complicated. The chain heterogeneity and subunit-subsunit interactions as well as dissociation of the tetramer cannot be the major causes of the sigmoidal nitrite oxidation kinetics. ^ The kinetics of CO binding by the hemoglobin of the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, have been followed in absorbance and light-scattering stopped-flow devices as well as by flash-photolysis. Lamprey hemoglobin is largely associated in the liganded form into monomers and is associated in the non-liganded form to dimers, and, at high concentration, tetramers. In order to describe the kinetics of ligand-binding, a kinetic scheme was proposed (M. E. Andersen and Q. H. Gibson, J. Biol. Chem. (1971) 246, 4790) which involved the 5 forms of the protein in ligand-binding and in protein association-dissociation reactions. These latter processes occur on the same time scale as the ligand-binding reactions. Rate constants for all reactions were obtained by Andersen and Gibson by fitting the extensive data obtained from the kinetic traces for absorbance changes. In the present study, these measurements were repeated, and good agreement with the absorbance changes were found. In addition, the light-scattering changes which occurred following a sudden drop in pH (pH 8. 8 to 5. 6) showed second-order kinetics with an association rate constant about one-tenth of that deduced by Andersen and Gibson from their curve-fitting operations. Other reactions associated with changes in protein aggregation show similar discrepancies and point to the utility of being able to make both light-scattering and absorbance change measurements in dissecting a complex ligand-binding mechanism. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{increased}} {{attention has been}} focused on the reduced forms of coenzyme Q as antioxidant compounds inhibiting lipid peroxidation in model systems and in biological membranes, but in spite of extensive experimental evidences the molecular mechanisms responsible for the antioxidant activity of ubiquinones are still debated. Ferrylmyoglobin and/or its free radical form are regarded as powerful oxidizing agents capable of promoting oxidation of essential cellular constituents, particularly cell membranes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ubiquinol on the formation and survival of ferryl species of myoglobin and on metmyoglobin itself. The addition of a threefold molar excess of hydrogen peroxide to a solution of metmyoglobin induces the rapid formation of a compound with the spectral characteristics of ferrylmyoglobin. The reaction is complete within 4 min, producing up to 76 % of ferrylmyoglobin, which remains stable for at least 30 min. The addition of ubiquinol- 1 to the same solution provokes a rapid and progressive reduction of ferrylmyoglobin to metmyoglobin and <b>oxymyoglobin.</b> Ubiquinol- 1, furthermore, is also capable of protecting metmyoglobin against oxidation when added in the solution before hydrogen peroxide. Ubiquinol- 1, indeed, is effective at both limiting the maximal ferrylmyoglobin level attained (59 % inhibition) and accomplishing complete removal of the ferryl form (in about 15 min).
