5|$|The Shuttle–Mir Program was a {{collaborative}} space program between Russia and the United States, which involved American Space Shuttles visiting the Russian space station Mir, Russian cosmonauts flying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle,</b> and an American astronaut flying aboard a Soyuz spacecraft {{to engage in}} long-duration expeditions aboard Mir.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E

25|$|In 2000-2001, for {{economic}} reasons, {{all of the}} intermediate 81-714 carriages stopped operating and the system currently has only 13 81-717 two-carriage trains running, (12 on the main line, one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> service).|$|E
25|$|A shuttle {{operated}} on the section from Hainault to Woodford after a train of 1960 Stock was modified {{to test the}} automatic train operation system to be used on the Victoria line.

25|$|Holle assumes {{control of}} the ship and executes the head mutineer, but keeps Wilson alive because she needs his {{piloting}} skills to land on Earth III, a cold tidally locked planet with dense air, a dynamic atmosphere and a red dwarf sun that fortunately appears a familiar white to the human eye. Since the remaining shuttle cannot seat all the passengers, Holle encourages the passengers to reproduce copiously: since children weigh little, many will fit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle,</b> thus increasing genetic diversity. She sends three adults to accompany them: Wilson, Helen Gray and the Illegal Jeb. Helen and Jeb, whose children are not allowed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> due to genetic proximity, resentfully board. Wilson sets them down safely on a lake and they prepare to settle on their new world. The remaining crew on the Ark plan to conduct a survey of the planetary system and beyond until they die.|$|E

25|$|Onizuka was {{selected}} for the astronaut program in January 1978, and completed one year of evaluation and training in August 1979. Later, {{he worked in the}} experimentation team, Orbiter test team, and launch support crew at Kennedy Space Center for the STS-1 and STS-2. At NASA, he worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) test and revision software team.|$|E
25|$|The {{subject of}} missing or damaged thermal tiles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> fleet only {{became an issue}} {{following}} the loss of Columbia in 2003, as it broke up on re-entry. In fact, Shuttles had previously come back missing as many as 20 tiles without any problem. STS-1 and STS-41 had all flown with missing thermal tiles from the orbital maneuvering system pods (visible to the crew).|$|E
25|$|The crew {{then got}} to work with Ferguson and Hurley using the shuttle arm to take its OBSS from the station's Canadarm2 {{operated}} by Garan and Furukawa. The station arm had plucked the OBSS from its stowage position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> cargo bay sill. The handoff was to prepare to use the boom for any shuttle heat shield late inspections if required. Magnus worked with TV setup and Walheim transferred spacewalk gear.|$|E
50|$|After {{reaching}} orbit, Atlantis' crew began {{procedures to}} open <b>the</b> <b>shuttle’s</b> payload bay doors {{and set up}} computers and other equipment. They also powered up <b>the</b> <b>shuttle's</b> robotic arm to check its operation. Photos taken during the robotic arm checkout showed a 4-inch by 6-inch corner area of insulation blanket <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle's</b> port orbital maneuvering system (OMS) pod pulled away from an adjacent row of heat-shield tiles.|$|R

25|$|On January 28, 1986, McAuliffe boarded Challenger {{with the}} other six crew members of STS-51-L. Just 73 seconds into its flight at an {{altitude}} of 48,000 feet, the shuttle broke apart, resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members. According to NASA, it was {{in part because of the}} excitement over her presence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> that the accident had such a significant effect on the nation. Many schoolchildren were viewing the launch live, and media coverage of the accident was extensive.|$|E
25|$|Airborne gamma-ray {{spectrometry}} is now {{the accepted}} leading technique for uranium prospecting with worldwide applications for geological mapping, mineral exploration & environmental monitoring. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry used specifically for uranium measurement and prospecting must account {{for a number of}} factors like the distance between the source and the detector and the scattering of radiation through the minerals, surrounding earth and even in the air. In Australia, a Weathering Intensity Index has been developed to help prospectors based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation and airborne gamma-ray spectrometry images.|$|E
25|$|When the Chatsworth {{extension}} of the Metro Orange Line opened on June 30, 2012, several NABI 45-foot Compo buses were assigned for the Metro Orange Line weekday peak period shuttle between Chatsworth station and Warner Center. The 45-foot Compo buses are only assigned to run <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle</b> trips. These buses are painted in the Metro Local scheme. Additionally, these buses {{are similar to the}} buses used in the Metro Silver Line in terms of length and interior design (except Silver Line buses are painted in a distinctive silver color scheme branding the Metro Silver Line).|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} was performed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second Space <b>Shuttle</b> flight to verify data from arc-heated wind-tunnel tests {{indicating that the}} thermal protection tiles used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle's</b> surface are noncatalytic to the recombination of dissociated air. The experiment indicates that the tiles are indeed noncatalytic, and explains the lower than expected temperatures observed in <b>the</b> first two <b>Shuttle</b> flights. <b>The</b> data are reasonably well predicted with computations, using a chemically reactive boundary-layer code. The experimental setup and the computational analysis are described...|$|R

25|$|While {{the system}} was {{developed}} within the original cost and time estimates given to President Richard M. Nixon in 1971, the operational costs, flight rate, payload capacity, and reliability {{by the time of}} the February 2003 Columbia accident proved to be much worse than originally anticipated. A year before STS-1's April 1981 launch, The Washington Monthly accurately forecast many of the Shuttle's issues, including an overambitious launch schedule and the consequently higher-than-expected marginal cost per flight; the risks of depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shuttle</b> for all payloads, civilian and military; the lack of a survivable abort scenario if a Solid Rocket Booster were to fail; and the fragility of the Shuttle's thermal protection system.|$|E
25|$|As {{the shuttle}} program {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly. Christa McAuliffe {{was chosen as the}} first Teacher in Space in July 1985 from 11,400 applicants. 1,700 applied for the Journalist in Space program. An Artist in Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe's flight two to three civilians a year would fly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shuttle.</b> After McAuliffe was killed in the Challenger disaster in January 1986, the programs were canceled. McAuliffe's backup, Barbara Morgan, eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on STS-118 as a mission specialist. A second journalist-in-space program, in which NASA green-lighted Miles O'Brien to fly on the space shuttle, was scheduled to be announced in 2003. That program was canceled {{in the wake of the}} Columbia disaster on STS-107 and subsequent emphasis on finishing the International Space Station before retiring the space shuttle.|$|E
