40|$|Background: We {{have shown}} earlier that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) {{administered}} by <b>oxygen</b> <b>hood</b> reduces pulmonary hypertension in an animal model (J Perinatol 2002; 22 : 50 - 6). Our objective {{in this study}} was to determine feasibility of iNO by <b>oxygen</b> <b>hood</b> in neonates with elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients (A-aDO 2). Methods/Principal Findings: Masked randomized controlled pilot trial. Inclusion criteria were: gestation$ 34 weeks, age, 7 days, with post-ductal arterial line, and A-aDO 2 400 – 600. Infants were randomized to study gas (iNO 20 ppm or equivalent O 2 flow) for 1 hr which was then weaned over the next 4 hours. Primary outcome was PaO 2 one hour postrandomization. Four infants each were randomized to iNO or O 2 (controls). Two of the four infants given iNO had an increase in PaO 2 of. 100 torr, while oxygenation was unchanged in the controls. Methemoglobinemia and other adverse effects were not noted in any infant. Environmental levels of NO and NO 2 were minimal (, 1 ppm) at. 0. 3 m from the hood.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a new method for controlling and administering olfactory stimuli [...] -namely, the hood system. The hood system involves a stream of vaporized odor (at known concentrations) mixed with odorless air and pumped (at a constant flow rate) into an <b>oxygen</b> therapy <b>hood.</b> It is designed to be used with odorants in solution, such as essential oils, as the olfactory stimulus. The use of <b>oxygen</b> therapy <b>hoods</b> allows for the precise control of a constant concentration of odorized air over time, while allowing subjects to breathe normally. The hood system provides a natural administration of olfactory stimuli and the exact determination of the stimulus concentration. The use of this system will allow experimental conditions to be completely defined and results and replication studies to be accurately interpreted. The hood system is portable, cost effective, and constructed from readily available components. It is proposed that the hood system could be adopted to suit a wide range of olfactory research, particularly that in which the effects of chronic exposure to olfactory stimuli on cognition are examined...|$|R

40|$|The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has {{endorsed}} Critical Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) screening using pulse oximetry nationwide, but, however, acknowledges that altitude may impact failure rates and alternative algorithms {{may be required}} at high altitudes. We therefore evaluated a modified screening protocol {{at an altitude of}} 6200 feet with the hypothesis that modifications could decrease failure rates. We evaluated 2001 well, newborn infants ≥ 35 weeks gestation using a modified protocol, which included a lower saturation cutoff for the first screen (85 % instead of the AAP recommended 90 %) and an <b>oxygen</b> <b>hood</b> intervention between the first two screens. Using our modified screening algorithm, we found a 0. 3 % failure rate, which was similar to the 0. 2 % sea-level rate and statistically different from the 1. 1 % rate identified in a recent study at similar altitude. Had the AAP protocol been used, the failure rate would have increased to 0. 8 %, which is similar to prior reports near this altitude. Echocardiograms were performed on failing newborns with no CCHD identified. A Birth Defects Registry Database review demonstrated one newborn with CCHD was missed after meeting AAP passing criteria. Overall, this study demonstrates that an alternative algorithm can be implemented at moderate altitude with decreased failure rate and comparable false negative rate...|$|E

Effect {{of oxygen}} flow on {{inspired}} oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} concentrations and patient comfort in the AmronTM <b>oxygen</b> <b>hood.</b> SPUMS J. 2004; 34 : 68 - 74.) The AmronTM Oxygen Treatment Hood was tested {{to determine the effect}} of altering oxygen flow on conditions within the hood. Inspired oxygen percentage, and inspired and end tidal carbon dioxide pressures were measured as fresh oxygen flow was reduced. Temperature within the hood was also measured. Discomfort was scored by the subjects for noise, temperature and respiratory effort. Inspired oxygen percentage was well maintained at flows of greater than 20 l. min- 1. As oxygen flows fell, inspired carbon dioxide pressure increased, although there was little clinically relevant change until flows were reduced below 30 l. min- 1. End tidal carbon dioxide did not change significantly. Temperature was higher at low flows, but did not fall significantly further with flows above 20 l. min- 1. Patient discomfort scores did not change significantly, but there was a positive correlation between flow and noise, and a negative correlation between both temperature and respiratory effort and flow. We conclude that, with healthy volunteers at one atmosphere absolute ambient pressure, an oxygen flow of 30 l. min- 1 into the AmronTM Oxygen Treatment Hood provides adequate inspired oxygen concentration, with minimal rebreathing of carbon dioxide, and maintains acceptable conditions of noise and temperature...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{mortality}} in India accounts for 50 &#x 0025; of infant mortality, which {{has declined to}} 84 / 1000 live births. There is no prenatal care for over 50 &#x 0025; of pregnant women, and over 80 &#x 0025; deliver at home in unsafe and unsanitary conditions. Those women who do deliver in health facilities are unable to receive intensive neonatal care when necessary. Level I and Level II neonatal care is unavailable in most health facilities in India, and in most developing countries. There is a need in India for Level III care units also. The establishment of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in India and developing countries would require space and location, finances, equipment, staff, protocols of care, and infection control measures. Neonatal mortality could be reduced by initially adding NICUs at a few key hospitals. The recommendation is for 30 NICU beds per million population. Each bed would require 50 square feet per cradle and proper climate control. Funds {{would have to be}} diverted from adult care. The largest expenses would be in equipment purchase, maintenance, and repair. Trained technicians would be required to operate and monitor the sophisticated ventilators and incubators. The nurse-patient ratio should be 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 for other infants. Training mothers to work in the NICUs would help ease the problems of trained nursing staff shortages. Protocols need not be highly technical; they could include the substitution of radiant warmers and room heaters for expensive incubators, the provision of breast milk, and the reduction of invasive procedures such as venipuncture and intubation. Nocosomial infections should be reduced by vacuum cleaning and wet mopping with a disinfectant twice a day, changing disinfectants periodically, maintaining mops to avoid infection, decontamination of linen, daily changing of tubing, and cleaning and sterilizing <b>oxygen</b> <b>hoods</b> and resuscitation equipment, and maintaining an iatrogenic infection record book, which could be used to study the infection patterns and to apply the appropriate antibiotics...|$|R
50|$|The {{fish kill}} {{may also be}} part of a natural 50-year cycle of oxygen levels in the canal, which has merely been {{influenced}} (but not controlled) by anthropogenic activity. Natural causes of hypoxia in Hood Canal include the timing of freshwater inflows, water layer stratification resulting from seasonal changes in surface temperature, and climate change. The oxygen level may also be partially due to a change in wind direction. The prevailing north wind generally pushes oxygenated water into the oxygen-depleted area. A sustained south wind will cut off this source of oxygen. Coastal upwelling from the Strait of Juan de Fuca bring in a surplus of nutrients into the Puget Sound, but fail to circulate <b>oxygen</b> through <b>Hood</b> Canal.

Five-day-old male neonate born to non-consanguineous {{parents by}} normal vaginal delivery {{was presented with}} deformity of lip, face and eyelid on the right side, and cyanosis. The cyanosis had improved soon after endotracheal intubation. Examination revealed deformity of upper lip, upper jaw and lower eyelid of right eye; this type of craniofacial cleft is called as Tessier type 3 (Fig. 1). There was associated bilateral choanal atresia.

40|$|AIM—To {{investigate}} the longitudinal changes of interstitial and airways disease in resolving chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD).  METHODS—Thirty three infants were studied between 35  and 40  weeks of postconceptional age, {{and then at}} three monthly intervals throughout their first year. Measurements of mean arterial oxygen saturation (MSaO 2) and its variability (δMSaO 2) were recorded. PaCO 2 and PaO 2 were determined while the infants breathed steady state 50 % <b>oxygen</b> via a <b>hood.</b> From these, the alveolar arterial difference (A-a)  Do 250 was calculated. Airway disease was assessed by the measurement of partial forced expiratory flow volume curves (PEFC) to give V̇max Frc.  RESULTS—The cohort mean +/- 95 % confidence intervals measured between 35  and 40  weeks were for MSaO 2 (89 · 25 +/- 1 · 87 %, range 75 - 96 · 5 %) and δMSaO 2 (4 · 79 +/- 0 · 8 %, range 0 · 16 - 9 · 64 %), PaCO 2 (5 · 89 +/- 0 · 56 kpa, range 4 · 2 - 10 · 11 kpa), (A-a)  Do 250 (22 · 7 +/- 2 · 56 kpa, range 6 · 67 - 31 · 4 kpa) and V̇maxFrc (41 · 5 +/- 8 · 65 mls/second, range 8 · 5 - 103 · 7 ml/second). The most significant improvement in all measurements occurred within {{the first three months}} (P =  0 · 05). An MSaO 2 of less than 90 % in room air at 1  year of age was predicted between 35  and 40  weeks postconceptional age by an (A-a)  Do 250 of greater than 29  kpa, with a sensitivity of 0 · 85 and a specificity of 0 · 88, and a PaCO 2 greater than 7  kpa predicted a specificity of 0 · 78 and a sensitivity of 0 · 88. Predictions were strengthened by combining the above criteria and these then gave a sensitivity and specificity of 1.  CONCLUSION—Measurements of (A-a)  Do 250 and PaCO 2 taken between 35  and 40  weeks can be used to assess the degree of pulmonary dysfunction at 1  year. Quantification of the severity of CLD {{could be used as a}} measurable end point for early neonatal intervention studies.    Keywords: chronic lung disease of prematurity; lung growth; infant pulmonary function...|$|R
