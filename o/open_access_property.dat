The Government of Indonesia has released regulations and applied projects to manage coral reefs since 1978. Programs and actions to help coral reefs management have been carried out by national and international NGOs since early 1990 s. Unfortunately, destructive fishing practices were still continued and have increased since economic crisis in 1997. The aims of this paper are to describe the reasons of destructive fishing practices and to analysis the implementation of better fishing methods. The study shows that the lack of integrated programs among government agencies has led to the <b>open</b> <b>access</b> <b>property</b> right of coral reefs. The improvement of coral reefs uses can be implemented if de facto open access of property right of coral reefs is changed to the more responsible and acceptable common property right. The fishermen and fish traders, coral collectors and coral traders, and tourism operators in certain coral reefs area can be integrated in one institution to share the use rights and responsibilities of coral reefs. This strategy must be followed by redefinition of working mechanisms among institutions involved in coral reefs management...|$|E

40|$|We {{provide a}} dynamic model of natural {{resource}} management where the optimal institutional structure that governs resource use changes with resource depletion. Copeland and Taylor (2009) analyze how {{characteristics of a}} natural resource determine whether its steady-state management regime is <b>open</b> <b>access,</b> communal <b>property,</b> or private property. We extend this and other studies of endogenous institutions to analyze how and when resource governance may change in transition to the steady state, {{taking into account the}} fixed costs of institutional change and the variable costs of enforcement and governance. Assuming that governance cost is increasing in the difference between open-access and the actual harvest, we show that <b>open</b> <b>access</b> can be optimal if the resource is abundant relative to its demand and/or if governance costs are high. Once <b>open</b> <b>access</b> is rendered inefficient due to increased resource scarcity, further depletion warrants institutional change.

Section 1 of Volume I {{focuses on the}} history of copyright, with Tyler Ochoa and Mark Rose providing an example of the prevailing interpretation of the history and articles by Thomas Nachbar and by William Treanor and Paul Schwartz offering fresh takes on the early English and American experiences. Section 2 focuses on copyright’s philosophical foundations, framed by the work of Justin Hughes and followed by revisionist perspectives on Lockean and Hegelian theory offered by Seana Shiffrin and Jeanne Schroeder. Section 3 focuses on democratic theories, presented through the work of Neil Netanel and a critique of Netanel authored by Shyamkrishna Balganesh. Volume II examines the economics of copyright. Section 1 of Volume 2 covers public goods economics, monopoly theory, and price discrimination, introducing the concepts through the work of Terry Fisher before turning to Michael Meurer’s and Christopher Yoo’s critiques and extensions of the conventional wisdom. Section 2 focuses on transaction cost economics, beginning with Wendy Gordon’s classic article on fair use, followed by Robert Merges’s celebrated study of how holders of intellectual property rights can contract into liability rules, Abraham Bell and Gideon Parchomovsky’s analysis of the forces that can drive a legal regime from <b>open</b> <b>access</b> <b>property</b> to private property and vice versa, and Clarisa Long’s discussion of the way that intellectual property can minimize information costs. Section 3 explores the political economy of copyright, including Jessica Litman’s analysis of the political dynamics surrounding the Copyright Act of 1976, Thomas Nachbar’s review of Noah Webster’s campaign to establish copyright in the colonies and the early United States, and Robert Merges’s survey considering theories of political economy that go beyond simple rent seeking...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{show that}} the {{commonly}} observed decline in primary (natural resource using) sector output and employment shares, often termed structural change, can be explained as an endogenous response {{to the presence of}} nature’s constraint. Structural change takes place even if consumer preferences are homothetic, and technological progress does not discriminate against the primary sector. Under certain conditions, structural change allows an open economy to grow with natural resource sustainability. Sustained and environmentally sustainable economic growth is possible even if the natural resource is exploited under <b>open</b> <b>access.</b> Well-defined <b>property</b> rights are neither necessary, nor sufficient for sustainable growth. We show that there is no unique relationship between natural resource endowment and the rate of economic growth over the long run.

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{property}} rights has undergone fundamental change recently {{as a result of}} the commodification of natural resources such as water and biota. All property rights result in the conferral of three qualities or capacities, namely a management power, and ability to receive income or benefits, and an ability to sell or alienate the interest. However the transition from <b>open</b> <b>access</b> to <b>property</b> rights for natural resources has drawn attention to just how we define whether “particular rights ” are in fact property rights. Property in the more familiar sense of land and buildings conveys a tenor of regularity, constancy, and fixity – this is not so with the new forms of property which are inherently sui generis.

40|$|The {{standard}} {{view that}} the absence of property rights is inefficient contradicts the Coasean proposition that the relative efficiency of different institutions depends on their ability to economize on transaction costs. Moreover, the comparative theory of <b>open</b> <b>access</b> and private <b>property</b> institutions fails to recognize the intermediate institution of common property, finesses dynamic optimization, and provides an incomplete account of governance. We provide a comparative statics framework for alternative modes of resource management, albeit one that allows for dynamic optimization, and show that <b>open</b> <b>access</b> can be efficient under conditions of low population pressure. We show that the intensification of production with population pressure in Hawaii co- evolved with specialization and increased governance, in accordance with the efficiency theory.

40|$|Expansion {{of human}} populations and {{activities}} has caused increased conflicts between wildlife and humans. As a result, {{the distinction between}} resource and pest species has become blurry. We propose an economically-based classification of species based on a multi-use bioeconomic model. The classification of the steady state population of a species is shown to depend on both species' density and economic factors. We extend earlier work on multi-use(resource-pest) species by applying the theoretical model to a developing country context where property rights to wildlife are imperfectly enforced, so that second-best trade measures are often applied {{by the international community}} to promote conservation. Upon calibrating the model using data for the African elephant, we derive three further results. First, when comparing the optimal stock of a multi-use species to the <b>open</b> <b>access</b> stock, we find that the ranking in terms of abundance is ambiguous. Second, and consistent with existing literature on resource management in a second-best world, our case study supports the idea that trade bans have ambiguous effectson wildlife abundance. Third, due to a bifurcation effect characterizing the multi-use model's solution, strategic and temporary subsidizing by the North may enable them to free ride on conservation efforts of the South henceforth.

An answer to this problem is provided by the Web, which is in fact academia's rich new frontier, providing many excellent opportunities for publication in journals of the highest standards of peer review, with the additional advantage of being referenced by Google (Wise, 2005).

Also {{available}} from the publisher at: [URL] <b>Open</b> <b>access.</b> Adsorption <b>properties</b> of silica gel have been attributed to the surface hydroxyl groups of silica gel. Some hydroxyl groups are free standing and called free silanol groups. Some are hydrogen bonded to neighbouring silanol groups. Christy has shown that a high silanol number and a balanced concentration proportionality between these two different types of hydroxyl groups is necessary for effective adsorption of water molecules. Thermal treatment of silica gel samples alters the proportions of these groups and the above fact was investigated by using thermally treated silica gel samples. Two silica gel samples of varying surface areas and silanol numbers were dried under vacuum at 200 oC and their adsorption characteristics were followed by using NIR spectroscopy. Then the samples were subjected to heating at 350, 450, 600 degrees to cause changes in the concentrations of the surface silanol groups and their surface and adsorption characteristics were followed. The results clearly indicate that the heating process both remove free and hydrogen bonded silanol groups and alter the ratio between the two. Furthermore, the heating causes reduction in silanol umber and upsets the balance in the proportionality of the silanol groups for effective adsorption of water molecules...|$|R
40|$|The general {{distinctions between}} <b>open</b> <b>access,</b> state <b>{{property}},</b> common proerty and private property are now well {{established in the}} academic literature. When applied to African rangelands, however, common property admits {{a wide variety of}} resource management regimes. To formulate effective policies it is necessary to understand the structure and operations of particular regimes. In this paper we discuss three examples of common property regimes, two from the southern African nation of Lesotho and one from the west African nation of Senegal, to illustrate some of the key characteristics of common property regimes. In particular, {{it is important to understand}} the structure of governance, the types of institutions that govern behavior, and the compatibility between governance, institutions and individual incentives. A common property regime can only be effective if its institutionsare compatible with the structure of governance. The extent of its effectiveness also depends upon the incentives and expectations of individuals expected to enforce the rules of the institutions or comply with their terms. At present, most African governments lack the organizational capacity and political will necessary to implement state property regimes, official regulations on resource use, or individual property rights for rangelands resources. In many cases it is more appropriate for governments to define and enforce group rights to particular resources, then help to establish conditions in which internal group dynamics yield efficient resource management outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{renewable}} resources in a tractable model of endogenous growth driven by horizontal and vertical innovation. The model is tractable in that it yields a complete, analytical characterization of the path of utility and the associated welfare level. This property is exploited to compare two cases of renewable resource management: <b>open</b> <b>access</b> and full <b>property</b> rights. The first case involves a common property problem in which agents ignore the long-term resource viability; the second fully internalizes {{the dynamics of the}} resource stock. Analysis shows that if the natural regeneration rate of the renewable resource is too low, the tragedy of the commons occurs. If, instead, the natural regeneration rate is sufficiently high, the steady-state growth rate of the economy is identical across the two management regimes. The reason is because there is no scale effect; that is, the steady-state growth rate of the economy does not depend on the labor or the resource endowment. However, the development path on which the economy transits from the developing stage (no R&D activity) to the developed stage (positive R&D activity) depends on the resource management regime. In particular, a developing economy under full property rights will cross its development threshold prior to one under <b>open</b> <b>access.</b> This threshold depends {{on the size of the}} manufacturing firms.

40|$|The {{theory that}} land holding is inexorably {{evolving}} from common to private or state tenure is challenged by {{facts on the}} ground that this paper will examine. ‘Tenure’ is interpreted both in terms of formal law and informal practices. While the association between privatization and land fragmentation is clear, property theory has influenced privatization so the process cannot be used to validate the evolutionary model of transitions from <b>open</b> <b>access</b> to common <b>property</b> to private property. Although in many settings common and state property has given way to privatization, in other cases private or state property has reverted to common holdings. A dynamic tenure model would demonstrate the conditions under which tenure transitions occur between common, private and state property, as the balance between transaction and exclusion costs shifts, or when the boundaries of tenure forms weaken to allow <b>open</b> <b>access</b> to occur. Examining three scenes of tenure transitions involving Kenyan pastoralists (Laikipia County, the Rift Valley, Narok County and Kajiado County), this paper examines cases in which transaction and exclusion dynamics – which are metaphors for the institutional effects of social and territorial relations- lead to changing land-use practices and tenure transitions. In semi-arid pastoral regions, we find more fluid systems of tenure than the inexorable spread of privatization through formalized land rights and increasing land fragmentation would have suggested should occur in the 21 st century...|$|R

But the traditional organization of scholarly publication runs against {{the objective of}} allowing the entire annual set of 2. 5 million papers to be freely accessed. Thanks to recent academic initiatives, new models of scientific publication have emerged that offer direct <b>open</b> <b>access</b> to journals. They have gained support from various research agencies. This "gold" model for journals should be explored in every discipline, particularly in the Humanities, where {{large amounts of money}} are used to support publication. However, it will be a slow process. Open archives (the "green road") represent the most efficient way of providing full <b>open</b> <b>access</b> through authors' self-deposits. New open archive services are under continuous development and will enhance research for the reader {{as well as for the}} author (Shadbolt, Brody, Carr, & Harnad, 2006). Already the researcher has the choice of depositing in institutional, disciplinary, or thematic repositories, all of which are being interconnected. Conforming to mandates issued from institutions and research agencies, the deposit has to provide the final version of the accepted paper. Access to the deposited article can at that time be set immediately as <b>open</b> <b>access,</b> or it can be set as closed access during any embargo period (6 to 12 months, maximum), with only its metadata freely accessible web-wide until the embargo period is over. During any embargo period, however, a powerful new feature of most repositories (namely, the "Email Eprint Request" button) makes it possible for individual users to semi-automatically and almost-instantaneously request an individual copy of the article by email, for individual use [...] just as users had requested reprints by mail in paper days. A final caveat: authors are encouraged to fix their own copyright statements before signing any transfer to the publisher. This can be easily done when sending the final version of a paper to the publisher, either by including a license such as the Creative Commons (2007) or by depositing a copy of the paper in an open archive repository, which establishes a similar license. As more and more authors take such action, research agencies will be encouraged to explicitly support better copyright policies and invite publishers to rephrase their own licenses 2.
