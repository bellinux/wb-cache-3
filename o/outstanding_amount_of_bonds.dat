This was done through two channels: first, an appropriate exchange policy ensured an adequate tradable supply <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> priced near par (at the expense <b>of</b> premium <b>bonds,</b> which some classes of investors avoid). Second, debt exchanges increased the <b>outstanding</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> strippable <b>bonds</b> that were critical in supporting bond dealer stripping and reconstitution operations in the new strips market (see Díaz et al. 2006 for details).|$|R

The possibility of obtaining biologically active cellulosic material by sorption of procaine hydrochloride and gentamicin sulphate on CMC was investigated in this paper. The sorption of therapeutics on CMC samples with different degree of substitution was carried out in water solutions of anesthetic and antibiotic, while the desorption was done in 0. 95 % NaCl solution. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonded</b> and released therapeutics was determined by UV spe-ctrophotometry. It was found that degree of substitution of car-boxymethylcellulose and concentration of chemotherapeutic water solution have significant influence on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonded</b> anesthetic and antibiotic. The maximum <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonded</b> chemotherapeutic was 72. 15 mg of procaine hydrochloride and 165. 49 mg of gentamicin sulphate per gram CMC.

This paper {{investigates the}} effect of the CBN {{abrasive}} types, sizes, concentration, <b>bond</b> <b>amount,</b> and porosity <b>of</b> a vitrified-bonded CBN wheel on grinding ratio, grinding forces, and surface roughness of grinding hardened steels. The experiment results showed that during grinding hardened steels the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> with increase <b>of</b> the depth of cut increased, which makes the wheel to have a better bonding strength to get a better grinding ratio and surface roughness of the workpiece. The grinding forces produced increased with the increase of the depth of cut. In addition, too much porosity of a vitrified CBN wheel will cause the low bond strength, leading the wheel to wear rapidly. Hence, to obtain a higher grinding ratio and better surface roughness of the workpiece during the grinding hardened steels should select relatively a higher <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>bond,</b> a lower porosity, and a higher grit strength and concentration, but the grinding forces produced were relative higher...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the influence of the}} immobilization techniques of fumarase on its immobilization yield and on its catalytic activity, it was covalently bonded to the surface of polymers (consisting of suitably functionalized ethylene–vinyl alcohol copolymers and functionalized poly(acrylamides), and physically entrapped into cross-linked poly(acrylamide) gels. The kinetic parameters of the hydration reaction of fumarate to l-malate were obtained by determining the UV absorbance variation of the fumarate double bond at 290 nm. When the enzyme is covalently bonded, both activity and stability of the enzymatic preparations are low; however, when fumarase is bonded to ethylene–vinyl alcohol copolymers by less denaturating and more spacing coupling agents (as glutaraldehyde), a better residual enzyme activity was obtained, and it was seen that this latter depended on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonded</b> enzyme.
