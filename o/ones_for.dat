5|$|At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gielgud {{did much}} to reclaim his {{position}} as a leading Shakespearean. His cold, unsympathetic Angelo in Peter Brook's production of Measure for Measure (1950) showed the public a new, naturalistic manner in his playing. He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's Macbeth in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for the star and worse <b>ones</b> <b>for</b> the director.|$|E

5|$|The {{document}} {{proposed to}} avoid exporting money, and to include high tariffs on {{the import of}} luxury goods. This is often seen as a contradiction of The Representation of the Hacendados, but each request different things.

As secretary, Moreno reduced the tariffs on national exports, but kept high <b>ones</b> <b>for</b> imports.|$|E

Hume, the tug Pelican in 1883, the schooner Berwick in 1887, the steamer Thistle in 1888, and replacement craft in subsequent years. Returning ships brought goods for Hume's general store.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest {{for two to three}} weeks after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker <b>ones</b> <b>for</b> food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|Despite finding like-minded {{students}} in Vienna, the city's climate took {{a toll on}} Andrić's health. He contracted tuberculosis and became seriously ill, then asked to leave Vienna on medical grounds and continue his studies elsewhere, though Hawkesworth believes he may actually have been {{taking part in a}} protest of South Slav students that were boycotting German-speaking universities and transferring to Slavic <b>ones.</b> <b>For</b> a time, Andrić had considered transferring to a school in Russia but ultimately decided to complete his fourth semester at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He transferred in early 1914, and continued to publish translations, poems and reviews.|$|E
5|$|Dwindling party {{membership}} created {{many problems}} for Quisling, especially financial <b>ones.</b> <b>For</b> {{years he had}} been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one Frans Hals painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the Great Depression, even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped. His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned constitutional reform of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.|$|E

5|$|Naming {{groups of}} organisms {{in a way}} that is clear and widely agreed is important, as some {{disputes}} in paleontology have been based just on misunderstandings over names. Linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known <b>ones.</b> <b>For</b> example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. genus or family or order; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi broke 22 {{official}} {{world records}} on distances between 1500 m and 20km; a record in running. He also set several more unofficial <b>ones</b> <b>for</b> {{a total of}} 58. His indoor world records were all unofficial as the IAAF did not ratify indoor records until the 1980s. Nurmi's record for most Olympic gold medals was matched by gymnast Larisa Latynina in 1964, swimmer Mark Spitz in 1972 and fellow track and field athlete Carl Lewis in 1996, and broken by swimmer Michael Phelps in 2008. Nurmi's record for most medals in the Olympic Games stood until Edoardo Mangiarotti won his 13th medal in fencing in 1960.

The grass men were famous for their horses.|$|R
