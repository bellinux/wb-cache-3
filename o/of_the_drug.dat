5|$|Although most methamphetamine users {{lived in}} Asia {{in the early}} 2000s, the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> {{increased}} dramatically {{in other parts of}} the world in that decade.

The condition is expensive to treat and has strained public health resources, prompting concerns among dental authorities in several countries about the burden of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{withdrawal}} {{effects are}} evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of {{symptoms such as}} anxiety may simply indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, in the absence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug,</b> the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug.</b> Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.|$|E

5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug,</b> which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E
