50|$|The <b>olive-backed</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus hodgsoni) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird of the pipit (Anthus) genus, which breeds across South, north Central and East Asia, {{as well as in}} {{the northeast}} of European Russia. It is a long-distance migrant moving in winter to southern Asia and Indonesia. Sometimes it is also called Indian pipit or Hodgson's pipit, as well as tree pipit owing to its resemblance with the tree pipit. However, its back is more olive-toned and less streaked than that species, and its head pattern is different with a better-marked supercilium.|$|E
5000|$|Ranks below species receive three-part names, {{conventionally}} {{written in}} italics like {{the names of}} species. There are {{significant differences between the}} ICZN and the ICN. In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the <b>olive-backed</b> <b>pipit</b> is Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii. In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a [...] "connecting term" [...] (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is Cyclamen hederifolium f. albiflorum.|$|E
50|$|The pipits {{are active}} {{terrestrial}} birds that usually {{spend most of}} their time on the ground. They will fly in order to display during breeding, while migrating and dispersing, and also when flushed by danger. A few species make use of trees, perching in them and flying to them when disturbed. Low shrubs, rocks and termite nests may also be used as vantage points. Like their relatives the wagtails, pipits engage in tail-wagging. The way in which a pipit does this can provide clues to its identity in otherwise similar looking species. Upland pipits, for example, flick their tails quite quickly, as opposed to <b>olive-backed</b> <b>pipits</b> which wag their tails more gently. In general pipits move their tails quite slowly. The buff-bellied pipit wags its tail both up and down and from side to side. The exact function of tail-wagging is unclear; in the related wagtails it is thought to be a signal to predators of vigilance.|$|R
50|$|It is a brood parasite, laying its eggs in {{the nests}} of other birds. The nests of Phylloscopus warblers such as the Arctic warbler, eastern crowned warbler, willow warbler and {{chiffchaff}} are commonly used. Other hosts include the <b>olive-backed</b> <b>pipit</b> and Asian stubtail. The eggs are smooth, slightly glossy and vary in colour, sometimes mimicking those of the host species. They are incubated for about 12 days. The young cuckoo is born naked and has an orange gape with black patches. Within a few days it pushes the eggs or young of the host out of the nest. Older nestlings have blackish feathers with white fringes; the belly is dark brown with white bands. The young birds fledge after around 17-19 days.|$|E

5000|$|The {{second part}} of a {{binomial}} may be a noun in the genitive (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed {{in a number of}} ways in Latin, depending on the declension of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are -ii or -i in the singular and -orum in the plural, and for feminine nouns -ae in the singular and -arum in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsonii, the shrub Magnolia hodgsonii, or the <b>olive-backed</b> <b>pipit</b> Anthus hodgsoni. The meaning is [...] "of the person named", so that Magnolia hodgsonii means [...] "Hodgson's magnolia". The -ii or -i endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, hodgsonae would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example Anthus hodgsoni was named by Charles Wallace Richmond, in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with Latimeria chalumnae, meaning [...] "of the Chalumna River". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium Escherichia coli, where coli means [...] "of the colon". This formation is common in parasites, as in Xenos vesparum, where vesparum means [...] "of the wasps", since Xenos vesparum is a parasite of wasps.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} is {{a summary of}} the annual report of the Dutch rarities committee (CDNA) for 2012. In 2012, two new taxa were added to the Dutch list: Sooty Tern Onychoprion fuscatus and North Caspian Stonechat Saxicola maurus hemprichii. Other remarkable records were the second Steppe Grey Shrike Lanius lahtora pallidirostris, the second and third Eastern Black Redstart Phoenicurus ochruros phoenicuroides, the third Bufflehead Bucephala albeola and the fifth Bonaparte's Gull Chroicocephalus Philadelphia. High numbers were recorded for River Warbler Locustella fluviatilis (7 records), Radde's Warbler Phylloscopus schwarzt (8 records), Buff-breasted Sandpiper Calidris subruficollis (11 records) and <b>Olive-backed</b> <b>Pipit</b> Anthus hodgsoni (18 records). All records of the latter species are from October and were part of the largest influx of this species in North-Western Europe ever recorded. Following recent advances in identifying flight calls from this species, the number of accepted records has grown since the publication of the annual report and may still grow. Out of a total of 511 species now on the Dutch list, 207 species (41 %) are regarded as vagrants, with less than two records per year during the last 30 years. All records and their documentation can now be accessed through a new website: www. dutchavifauna. nl...|$|E
