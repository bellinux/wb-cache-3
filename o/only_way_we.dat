500|$|By late August 2015, {{it became}} a strong {{possibility}} that a new NBL Canada team would be created in Halifax for the 2015–16 season. A new ownership group, led by former Rainmen advisor and CEO of Corporate Research Associates in Don Mills, soon confirmed that the defunct team's reincarnation would compete for the next season. Mills expected a group of 25 shareholders to help start up the organization, many of whom personally paid for the Rainmen's flights and hotels in the last season. He chose to not include Levingston in the ownership group but allowed him to assume the position as the team's general manager. Mills said, [...] "There {{would not be a}} new team in Halifax without Andre.

[...] The council are proposing to stop the allocation of housing benefit to rented properties in Jaywick by 2017, to discourage rental in poor quality buildings. Former council leader Neil Stock has called Jaywick [...] "an embarrassment to the whole country", blaming planning regulations he believes are draconian. Stock reported around 30 to 40 absentee landlords were renting poor quality accommodation to tenants on benefits without requiring any deposit, adding that [...] "the state is subsidising squalor." [...] Carswell has been critical of the government's response to Jaywick, noting that although the area contained large numbers of unemployed, these were often people who were unable to find work both due to disabilities or a lack of available jobs. He believes the [...] "downward spiral will continue" [...] unless existing planning laws are relaxed and the area has economic investment.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of this investigation, GM {{announced}} that it would offer any new GM car in exchange to any Volt owner who has concerns while the federal investigation was taking place. In December 2011, the company said that if necessary they were prepared to recall all the vehicles and repair them upon determination of the cause of the fires, and also announced they would buy back the car if the owner was too afraid of the potential for a fire. GM's CEO also said that {{it may be necessary to}} redesign or make changes to the battery pack depending on the recommendations from federal officials. As of December 1, 33 Volt owners in the U.S. and 3 in Canada had requested a loaner car. As of December 5, General Motors reported that a couple dozen Volt owners had requested the carmaker to buy back their cars, and the company had already agreed to repurchase about a dozen. Before the carmaker agrees to buy back each vehicle, other options are explored as GM primarily wants to provide loaner cars, but [...] "if the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> can make them happy is to repurchase it, then we will," [...] a GM spokesman said. General Motors explained that the buy back price includes the Volt purchase price, plus taxes and fees, less a usage fee based on how many miles the car has been run. As of January 5, 2012, GM reported that around 250 Volt owners had requested either a loaner vehicle or a potential buyback.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{problem was}} that he claimed (or seemed to claim) that AI {{would never be able}} to capture the human ability to {{understand}} context, situation or purpose in the form of rules. But (as Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell would later explain), an argument of this form can not be won: just because one can not imagine formal rules that govern human intelligence and expertise, this does not mean that no such rules exist. They quote Alan Turing's answer to all arguments similar to Dreyfus':"we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'"Dreyfus did not anticipate that AI researchers would realize their mistake and begin to work towards new solutions, moving away from the symbolic methods that Dreyfus criticized. In 1965, he did not imagine that such programs would one day be created, so he claimed AI was impossible. In 1965, AI researchers did not imagine that such programs were necessary, so they claimed AI was almost complete. Both were wrong.|$|E
2500|$|For Leibniz, [...] "God is an {{absolutely}} perfect being." [...] He describes this perfection later in section VI as the simplest form of {{something with the}} most substantial outcome (VI). Along these lines, he declares that every type of perfection [...] "pertains to him (God) in the highest degree" [...] (I). Even though his types of perfections are not specifically drawn out, Leibniz highlights the one thing that, to him, does certify imperfections and proves that God is perfect: [...] "that one acts imperfectly if he acts with less perfection than he is capable of", and since God is a perfect being, he cannot act imperfectly (III). Because God cannot act imperfectly, the decisions he makes pertaining to the world must be perfect. Leibniz also comforts readers, stating that because he has done everything to the most perfect degree; those who love him cannot be injured. However, to love God is a subject of difficulty as Leibniz believes that we are [...] "not disposed to wish for that which God desires" [...] {{because we have the}} ability to alter our disposition (IV). In accordance with this, many act as rebels, but Leibniz says that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> can truly love God is by being content [...] "with all that comes to us according to his will" [...] (IV).|$|E

Lead track [...] "Dogshit" [...] was released as a single in 1988 under the name [...] "Censor"; the name change was made by the band when it was decided that the single would not sell well with its original name. The single [...] "Testure", which denounced the testing of animals for research purposes, reached No.19 on Billboards Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1989. According to Ogre, [...] "Testure" [...] was intended to be accessible in the hope of spreading their [...] "anti-vivisectionist" [...] message.
