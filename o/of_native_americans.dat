50|$|In direct {{opposition}} to Western anthropology, {{the knowledge base}} <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> studies is endogenous, or emerging from within the indigenous communities.

5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E

5|$|The Little Butte Creek {{area was}} {{originally}} settled by the Takelma, {{and possibly the}} Shasta tribe <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the Eagle Point region in 1852. Little Butte Creek was named by the early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Big Butte Creek. Due to conflicts with the Rogue River Indians, Major J. A. Lupton gathered 35men from Jacksonville on October 8, 1855, and attacked the Native Americans {{near the mouth of}} Little Butte Creek, killing about 30 of them. Lupton was also killed, and eleven of his men were injured. On December 24 of the same year, Captain Miles Alcorn discovered and attacked a Native American camp on the north fork, killing eight. On Christmas the following day, another band <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were attacked near Little Butte Creek's mouth; some fled, while the rest were either captured or killed.|$|E

Concerns about occasional mistreatment <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> remains are not unfounded: in a Minnesota excavation 1971, White and <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> remains were treated differently; remains of White people were reburied, while remains <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> people were placed in cardboard boxes {{and placed in a}} natural history museum.
