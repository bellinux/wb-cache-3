There are <b>over</b> <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> rows of tiny teeth in each jaw, arranged in straight lines in the upper jaw and diagonal lines in the lower jaw; each tooth has a pointed central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly small.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before it}} becomes a red giant, the {{luminosity}} of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is <b>over</b> <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> times larger than today {{and a couple of}} thousand times more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass.|$|E
5|$|From the 1990s onwards, {{track and}} field became {{increasingly}} more professional and international, as the IAAF gained <b>over</b> <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition {{with the introduction of}} prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League—an annual series of major {{track and field}} meetings in Europe—provided a higher level of economic incentive {{in the form of a}} US$1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative IAAF Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East—the first ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings.|$|E

5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{was lost}} in 1878 during {{maneuvers}} shortly after her commissioning, when a pair of small sailing boats crossed the bows of Grosser Kurfürst and König Wilhelm, which caused both ships to undertake emergency maneuvers. In the confusion, König Wilhelm collided with Grosser Kurfürst, causing the latter to sink. <b>Over</b> <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> men {{were killed in the}} sinking, which resulted in tremendous political infighting in the Navy and the eventual forced retirement of Admiral Reinhold von Werner. Both Preussen and Friedrich der Grosse served in the fleet until the 1890s, when they were relegated to secondary duties, including serving as harbor ships, and later as coal hulks. The ships were eventually scrapped following the end of World War I, in 1919 and 1920, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 the Malvern Hills District Council {{appointed}} a Malvern Spa Water Strategy Working Group. Independently, in June 1996, sculptor Rose Garrard proposed to the MHDC {{the creation of}} a sculpture trail by nationally known sculptors, placed at forgotten springs around the town centre. The council began with the installation of new water features as part of its plan to beautify the town centre. In 1997 the District Council implemented a Spring Water Arts Project to map water sources around the hills. Garrard undertook a two-month artist's residency and collaborated with the public, who provided locations of <b>over</b> <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> water sources. Garrard was commissioned to create the drinking spout, Malvhina, which was unveiled on 4 September 1998.|$|E
5|$|The oldest extant blast {{furnaces}} were built during the Han Dynasty of China in the 1st century AD. However, cast iron farm tools and weapons were widespread in China by the 5th century BC, while 3rd century BC iron smelters employed an average workforce of <b>over</b> <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> men. These early furnaces had clay walls and used phosphorus-containing minerals as a flux. The {{effectiveness of the}} Chinese blast furnace was enhanced during this period by the engineer Du Shi (c.31AD), who applied the power of waterwheels to piston-bellows in forging cast iron.|$|E
40|$|Established in October 2003 in {{the frames}} of the Comenius 3 {{action of the}} Socrates program of the European Commission, the European Network “Hands-on Science” {{developed}} since then a vast range of activities towards a better Science Education in European Schools. Our main goal is the promotion and development of Science Education and scientific literacy in Europe. We aim to generalise innovate and improve Science & Technology teaching at basic vocational training and secondary schools by hands-on experimental practice in the classroom. Bringing hands-on active learning of Science into the classroom and into the soul and spirit of the school. The network, established now as an International Association, enrols as institutional or individual members, <b>over</b> <b>two</b> <b>hundreds</b> schools, several universities, national and international associations, governmental bodies, science centres and museums, NGO’s and companies of practically all countries of the European Union and {{from all over the}} world...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} {{a friend of}} mine, buying a couple of cheeses at Liverpool. Splendid cheeses they were, ripe and mellow, and with a <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> horse-power scent about them {{that might have been}} warranted to carry three miles, and knock a man <b>over</b> at <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> yards. I was in Liverpool at the time, and my friend said that if I didn’t mind he would get me to take them back with me to London, as he should not be coming up {{for a day or two}} himself, and he did not think the cheeses ought to be kept much longer.|$|R
50|$|At Little Kimble on {{the east}} side of the church are {{indications}} of the site of a Roman villa.

5|$|Tourism {{has been}} a more {{successful}} industry in the area. For <b>over</b> <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> years visitors have been drawn by the lake and mountain scenery of the Lake District, and many have {{made their way to}} the top of Helvellyn. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are possible so that it may be approached from all directions. The view from the top is one of the most extensive over the Lake District, and on a clear day the view can also stretch from Scotland to Wales.|$|E
5|$|After Human Entertainment {{went out}} of {{business}} in 2000, Sunsoft became the sole owner of the Clock Tower intellectual property.

The game was first shown at E3 in May 2002, where a non-playable demo was on show at the Capcom booth. In November, Capcom announced the game would be released in Japan on December 12.|$|E
5|$|Aside from control interfaces, {{the bridge}} set was {{populated}} with monitors looping animations. Each oval monitor was a rear-projection screen on which super 8mm and 16mm film sequences looped for each special effect. The production acquired 42 films {{for this purpose}} from an Arlington, Virginia-based company, Stowmar Enterprises. Stowmar's footage was exhausted {{only a few weeks}} into filming, and it became clear that new monitor films would be needed faster than an outside supplier could deliver them. Cole, Minor, and another production designer, Rick Sternbach, worked together with Povill to devise faster ways of shooting new footage. Cole and Povill rented an oscilloscope for a day and filmed its distortions. Other loops came from Long Beach Hospital, the University of California at San Diego, and experimental computer labs in New Mexico. In all, <b>over</b> <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> pieces of monitor footage were created and catalogued into a seven-page listing.|$|E
50|$|An {{example is}} the equity premium puzzle, which relates {{to the fact that}} <b>over</b> the last <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> years, the risk premium of stocks over bonds has been around 5.5%, much larger than {{expected}} from theory. The equity premium puzzle was first documented by Mehra and Prescot (1985).|$|R
