2500|$|In 2003, American {{launched}} the largest fund raising campaign in its history. The program, ANewAU, has {{a goal of}} raising $200 million. As of October 2009, the university had raised $189.6 million. When the campaign is completed, the university's website stated that it would [...] "help {{to attract and retain}} the finest faculty, increase scholarship support, create and endow research and policy centers, ensure state-of-the-art resources in all <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> and colleges, expand global programs, and secure the long-term financial health of the university by boosting the endowment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rickover {{believed}} that U.S. standards of education were unacceptably low. His first book centered on education was {{a collection of}} essays calling for improved standards of education, particularly in math and science, entitled Education and Freedom (1959). In it, he stated that, [...] "education is the most important problem facing the United States today" [...] and [...] "only the massive upgrading of the scholastic standards <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> will guarantee the future prosperity and freedom of the Republic." [...] A second book, Swiss Schools and Ours (1962) was a scathing comparison of the educational systems of Switzerland and America. He argued that the higher standards of Swiss schools, including a longer school day and year, combined with an approach stressing student choice and academic specialization produced superior results.|$|E

5000|$|One {{learning}} {{model for}} all : every member <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>school</b> community experiences the same learning model, maximizing {{an environment of}} mutual academic support. Thus all members <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>school</b> community work in diverse, collaborative groups on hands-on projects; put another way, the model for adult learning and student learning mirror each other.|$|R

6000|$|... [Later--1882. Esthetes in many <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> are now {{beginning}} to teach the pupils to broaden the 'a,' and to say [...] "don't you," [...] in the elegant foreign way.] ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{no sooner}} {{heard of this}} idea than I became impassioned {{to put it into}} practice. I have {{therefore}} prepared, or am preparing, a film, especially designed for the elementary classes <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> to narrate the story of the discovery of America.|$|E
60|$|This, however, {{is not an}} evil {{produced}} by the denial of children's rights, nor is it inherent {{in the nature of}} schools. I mention it only because it would be folly to call for a reform <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> without taking account of the corrupt resistance which awaits the reformer.|$|E
50|$|I pledge my {{loyalty to}} the ideals of Girls Catholic Central.I pledge to be a zealous Christian.To be {{faithful}} to God, to my country and to my school.I pledge to be diligent and studious.To have the best interest <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>school</b> at heart.To cooperate with faculty and students in all activities.Finally, I pledge {{to be true to}} our PatronessMary Queen and Model <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>school.</b>|$|R

6000|$|I am not {{acquainted with}} Sir Josiah Mason's {{reasons for the}} action which he has taken; but if, as I {{apprehend}} is the case, he refers to the ordinary classical course <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> and universities {{by the name of}} [...] "mere literary instruction and education," [...] I venture to offer sundry reasons of my own in support of that action.|$|E
60|$|Your {{not being}} {{in favor of it}} results from your belief that the lay element that would be useful to the Academy does not at present exist in this country; but you think, if it did exist, and if it could be made to grow out <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> and {{universities}} by art teaching, it might, with advantage to the Academy and to artists, be introduced into the Academy?--Yes.|$|E
60|$|I {{have only}} to express, in conclusion, my regret {{that it has been}} {{impossible}} to finish the work within the limits first proposed. Having, of late, found my designs always requiring enlargement in process of execution, I will take care, in future, to set no limits whatsoever to any good intentions. In the present instance I trust the reader will pardon me, as the later efforts <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> of art have necessarily introduced many new topics of discussion.|$|E

Now {{the modern state}} doesn't mean {{to go back to}} darkness again--and so it's got to keep its light burning." [...] I went on to attack the present organisation <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> and universities, which seemed elaborately designed to turn the well-behaved, uncritical, and uncreative men of each generation into the authoritative leaders of the next, and I suggested remedies upon lines that I have already indicated in the earlier chapters of this story....|$|E
60|$|If I am {{justified}} in my {{conception of the}} ideal of a liberal education; and if what I have said about the existing educational institutions {{of the country is}} also true, {{it is clear that the}} two have no sort of relation to one another; that the best <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> and the most complete of our university trainings give but a narrow, one-sided, and essentially illiberal education--while the worst give what is really next to no education at all. The South London Working-Men's College could not copy any of these institutions if it would. I am bold enough to express the conviction that it ought not if it could.|$|E
60|$|And {{now let me}} recapitulate {{these demands}} I have made upon the process of schooling--this process of {{teaching}} that begins in the nursery and ends {{about the age of}} sixteen or seventeen. I have asked that it should involve a practical mastery of three or four languages, including the mother tongue, and that perhaps four or five other additional languages shall have been studied, so to speak, in skeleton. I have added mathematics carried much higher and farther than most <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> do to-day. I have demanded a sound knowledge of universal history, a knowledge of general physical and general biological science, and I have thrown in, with scarcely a word of apology, a good training of the eyes and hands in drawing and manual work.|$|E

I {{believe the}} reader will now see, that in these mosaics, which the {{careless}} traveller is {{in the habit of}} passing by with contempt, there is a depth of feeling and of meaning greater than in most of the best sketches from nature of modern times; and, without entering into any question whether these conventional representations are as good as, under the required limitations, it was possible to render them, they are at all events good enough completely to illustrate that mode of symbolical expression which appeals altogether to thought, and in no wise trusts to realization. And little as, in the present state <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools,</b> such an assertion is likely to be believed, the fact is that this kind of expression is the only one allowable in noble art.|$|E
6000|$|One great good arises {{even from}} {{the first step in}} figure drawing, that it gets the student quit at once of the notion of formal symmetry. If you learn only to draw a leaf well, you are taught in some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> to turn it the other way, {{opposite}} to itself; and the two leaves set opposite ways are called [...] "a design:" [...] and thus it is supposed possible to produce ornamentation, though you have no more brains than a looking-glass or a kaleidoscope has. But if you once learn to draw the human figure, you will find that knocking two men's heads together does not necessarily constitute a good design; nay, that it makes a very bad design, or no design at all; and you will see at once that to arrange a group of two or more figures, you must, though perhaps it may be desirable to balance, or oppose them, at the same time vary their attitudes, and make one, not the reverse of the other, but the companion of the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "He has unluckily mistaken a foundation-stone for a ruin! Such {{errors are}} not unfrequent with the ardent and ingenious. That men WILL have tails, I make no doubt; {{but that they}} HAVE ever reached this point of perfection, I do most solemnly deny. There are many premonitory {{symptoms}} of their approaching this condition; the current opinions of the day, the dress, habits, fashions, and philosophy of the species, encourage the belief; but hitherto you have never reached the enviable distinction. As to traditions, even your own are all in favor of our theory. Thus, for instance, you have a tradition that the earth was once peopled by giants. Now, this is owing {{to the fact that}} men were formerly more under the influence of matter, and less under that of mind than to day. You admit that you diminish in size, and improve in moral attainments; all of which goes to establish the truth of the monikin philosophy. You begin to lay less stress on physical, and more on moral excellences; and, in short, many things show that the time for the final liberation and grand development of your brains, is not far distant. This much I very gladly concede; for, while the dogmas <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> are not to be disregarded, I very cheerfully admit that you are our fellow-creatures, though in a more infant and less improved condition of society." ...|$|E

60|$|Whatever {{inadequacy}} or error {{there may}} be, throughout, in materials or modes of demonstration, I {{have no doubt}} of the truth and necessity of the main result; and though the reader may, perhaps, find me frequently hereafter showing other and better grounds for what is here affirmed, yet the point and bearing of the book, its determined depreciation of Claude, Salvator, Gaspar, and Canaletto, and its equally determined support of Turner as {{the greatest of all}} landscape painters, and of Turner's recent works as his finest, are good and right; and if the prevalence throughout of attack and eulogium be found irksome or offensive, let it be remembered that my object thus far has not been either the establishment or the teaching of any principles of art, but the vindication, most necessary to the prosperity of our present schools, of the uncomprehended rank of their greatest artist, and the diminution, equally necessary as I think to the prosperity <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools,</b> of the unadvised admiration of the landscape of the seventeenth century. For I believe it to be almost impossible to state in terms sufficiently serious and severe the depth and extent of the evil which has resulted (and that not in art alone, but in all other matters with which the contemplative faculties are concerned) from the works of those elder men. On the continent all landscape art has been utterly annihilated by them, and with it all sense of the power of nature. We in England have only done better because our artists have had strength of mind enough to form a school withdrawn from their influence.|$|E
60|$|The usual {{answer is}} that we must educate our masters: that is, ourselves. We must teach {{citizenship}} and political science at school. But must we? There is no must about it, the hard fact being that we must not teach political science or citizenship at school. The schoolmaster who attempted it would soon find himself penniless in the streets without pupils, if not in the dock pleading to a pompously worded indictment for sedition against the exploiters. Our schools teach the morality of feudalism corrupted by commercialism, and hold up the military conqueror, the robber baron, and the profiteer, as models of the illustrious and the successful. In vain do the prophets who see through this imposture preach and teach a better gospel: the individuals whom they convert are doomed to pass away in a few years; and the new generations are dragged back in the schools to the morality of the fifteenth century, and think themselves Liberal when they are defending the ideas of Henry VII, and gentlemanly when they are opposing to them the ideas of Richard III. Thus the educated man is a greater nuisance than the uneducated one: indeed it is the inefficiency and sham of the educational side <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> (to which, except under compulsion, children would not be sent by their parents at all {{if they did not}} act as prisons in which the immature are kept from worrying the mature) that save us from being dashed on the rocks of false doctrine instead of drifting down the midstream of mere ignorance. There is no way out through the schoolmaster.|$|E
6000|$|... 245. Finally, I hope {{to direct}} {{some of the}} {{antiquarian}} energy often to be found remaining, even when love of the picturesque has passed away, to encourage the accurate delineation and engraving of historical monuments, as a direct function <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>schools</b> of art. All that I have generally to suggest on this matter has been already stated with sufficient clearness {{in the first of}} my inaugural lectures at Oxford: and my forthcoming 'Elements of Drawing'[BN] will contain all the directions I can give in writing as to methods of work for such purpose. The publication of these has been hindered, for at least a year, by the abuses introduced by the modern cheap modes of printing engravings. I find the men won't use any ink but what pleases them; nor print but with what pressure pleases them; and if I can get the foreman to attend to the business, and choose the ink right, the men change it the moment he leaves the room, and threaten to throw up the job when they are detected. All this, I have long known well, is a matter of course, in the outcome of modern principles of trade; but it has rendered it hitherto impossible for me to produce illustrations, which have been ready, as far as my work or that of my own assistants is concerned, {{for a year and a}} half. Any one interested in hearing of our progress--or arrest, may write to my Turner copyist, Mr. Ward:[BO] and, in the meantime, they can help my designs for art education best by making these Turner copies more generally known; and by determining, when they travel, to spend what sums they have at their disposal, not in fady photography, but in the encouragement of any good water-color and pencil draughtsmen whom they find employed in the galleries of Europe.|$|E

Sachin said he had simply spoken up in favour of protesting against the potential war: [...] "The majority <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>school</b> does not have democratic rights."
