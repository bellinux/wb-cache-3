5|$|The {{birth of}} the Smithsonian Institution {{can be traced to}} the {{acceptance}} of James Smithson's legacy, willed to the United States in 1826. Smithson died in 1829, and in 1836, President Andrew Jackson informed Congress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift,</b> which it accepted. In 1838, Smithson's legacy, which totaled more than $500,000, was delivered to the United States Mint and entered the Treasury. After eight years, in 1846, the Smithsonian Institution was established.|$|E
25|$|Maimonides, both in his {{commentary}} to the Mishna (Chullin Ch. 9 and 10) {{and in his}} Mishna Torah compilation was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{opinion that}} <b>the</b> giving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> was completely mandatory outside Israel. Nachmanides opined that any leniency applied to giving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> outside <b>the</b> land would lead to forgetting entirely about the practice. He therefore stated that regardless <b>of</b> whether <b>the</b> obligation is direct from the Torah (min haTorah) or Rabbinical (midirabanan) <b>the</b> <b>gifts</b> are to be given outside the land.|$|R

5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift,</b> Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni {{thought it would be}} a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages the town, {{which was}} now known as Manceastre (later to become Manchester), grew and prospered, and trading vessels plied along the river. The hamlet of Kersal, which now forms part of the City of Salford, was gifted to the Cluniac Priory of Lenton, near Nottingham, in 1142. The most {{important}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> was the fishing rights on the River Irwell, {{and even in the}} 18th century, the salmon rights on the rivers of Lancashire were let every year for many hundreds of pounds.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier Vita, or Life, of Æthelthryth, which resembles the Vitae of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely. The work may have helped {{to increase the number of}} pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King Æthelred II (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift.</b> The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the Liber would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation. The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the Liber.|$|E

5|$|Saint Catherine's Monastery still {{maintains}} {{the importance of}} a letter, handwritten in 1844 with an original signature of Tischendorf confirming that he borrowed those leaves. However, recently published documents, including a deed of gift dated 11 September 1868 and signed by Archbishop Kallistratos and the monks of the monastery, indicate that the manuscript was acquired entirely legitimately. This deed, which agrees with a report by Kurt Aland on the matter, has now been published. Unfortunately this development is not widely known in the English-speaking world, as only German- and Russian-language media reported on it in 2009. Doubts as to the legality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> arose because when Tischendorf originally removed the manuscript from Saint Catherine's Monastery in September 1859, the monastery was without an archbishop, so that even though the intention to present the manuscript to the Tsar had been expressed, no legal gift could be made at the time. Resolution of the matter was delayed through the turbulent reign of Archbishop Cyril (consecrated 7 December 1859, deposed 24 August 1866), and the situation only formalised after the restoration of peace.|$|E
5|$|The Hoysala kings used Tiruvannamalai {{as their}} capital {{beginning}} in 1328. There are 48 inscriptions from the Sangama Dynasty (1336–1485), two inscriptions from Saluva Dynasty, and 55 inscriptions from Tuluva Dynasty (1491–1570) of the Vijayanagara Empire, reflecting {{gifts to the}} temple from their rulers. There are also inscriptions from the rule of Krishnadeva Raya (1509–1529), the most powerful Vijayanagara king, indicating further patronage. Most of the Vijayanagara inscriptions were written in Tamil, with some in Kannada and Sanskrit. The inscriptions in the temple from the Vijayanagara kings indicate emphasis on administrative matters and local concerns, which contrasts the inscriptions of the same rulers in other temples like Tirupathi. The majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> related inscriptions are for land endowments, followed by goods, cash endowments, cows and oil for lighting lamps. The town of Tiruvannamalai was at a strategic crossroads during the Vijayanagara Empire, connecting sacred centers of pilgrimage and military routes. There are inscriptions that show the area as an urban center before the precolonial period, with the city developing around the temple, similar to the Nayak ruled cities like Madurai.|$|E
5|$|The {{kings and}} queens regnant of England and the kings of France were the only Christian rulers who claimed the divine gift (divinitus) to cure by {{touching}} or stroking the diseased. This special aptitude {{was thought to be}} evidence of God's high esteem of the two monarchies, though they never agreed upon whose predecessors the ability was first conferred. In England, Saint Edward the Confessor (r. 1042–1066) was said to be the first monarch to possess the healing power of the royal touch. The French, who normally traced the origins of their monarchs' divine gift back to Philip I (r. 1059–1108) or even Robert II (r. 987–1031), denied that Saint Edward used the royal touch. They insisted that the first English monarch to claim the ability was Henry I (r. 1100–1135), and that his touching was a politically influenced imitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> granted exclusively to French monarchs.|$|E

5|$|The manor of St Catherine {{belonged to}} Prior Cantlow of Bath Abbey in medieval times. It takes {{its name from}} the Church of St Catherine beside the manor house. When the house was not {{occupied}} by the monks it was leased. In 1536 the lease was to Thomas Llewellyn who remained as the tenant after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Henry VIII granted the manor to his tailor, John Malte, in 1546. Part of the condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> was that he adopt the kings illegitimate daughter Ethelreda Malte. Ethelreda inherited the house and married John Harington. After Ethelreda's death in 1551 Harrington married again. His son from this marriage was another John Harington who grew up and became a courtier of Elizabeth I and invented the first flush toilet. He {{spent most of his time}} at his principle seat at nearby Kelston and, in 1591, sold St Catherine's Court to John Blanchard. His son William Blanchard, remodelled the house. His initials appear in the plasterwork frieze of a bedroom. The Blanchard family lived at the court for several generations. In 1610 the porch was added and a terraced garden laid out. The house passed by marriage to the Parry family but was not maintained and the fabric of the building was declining by the 18th century, when half of the building was used by a tenant farmer.|$|E
5|$|The present masonry {{and towers}} {{date back to}} the 9th century CE, as seen from an {{inscription}} in the structure made by Chola kings who ruled at that time. Further inscriptions indicate that before the 9th century, Tiruvannamalai was under the Pallava Kings, who ruled from Kanchipuram. The 7th century Nayanar saints Sambandar and Appar wrote of the temple in their poetic work, Tevaram. Sekkizhar, the author of the Periyapuranam wrote that both Appar and Sambandar worshiped Annamalaiyar in the temple. The Chola Kings ruled over the region for more than four centuries, from 850 CE to 1280 CE, and were temple patrons. The inscriptions from the Chola king record various gifts like land, sheep, cow and oil to the temple commemorating various victories of the dynasty. The Hoysala kings used Tiruvannamalai as their capital beginning in 1328 CE. There are 48 inscriptions from the Sangama Dynasty (1336–1485 CE), 2 inscriptions from Saluva Dynasty, and 55 inscriptions from Tuluva Dynasty (1491–1570 CE) of the Vijayanagara Empire, reflecting gifts to the temple from their rulers. There are also inscriptions from the rule of Krishnadeva Raya (1509–1529 CE), the most powerful Vijayanagara king, indicating further patronage.

50|$|From these scriptural passages, Christians {{understand}} <b>the</b> spiritual <b>gifts</b> to be enablements or capacities {{that are}} divinely bestowed upon individuals.

There is diversity in their distribution—an individual will not possess all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gifts.</b> <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spiritual <b>gifts</b> is to edify (build up), exhort (encourage), and comfort the church.|$|R

25|$|Alms are {{the fruits}} of a moral notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> and of fortune on the one hand, and {{of a notion of}} sacrifice, on the other.

This is the ancient morality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift,</b> which has become a principle of justice.
