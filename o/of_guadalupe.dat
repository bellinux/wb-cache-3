5|$|After {{a series}} of United States victories, the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> Hidalgo ended the two-year war.

5|$|California has {{experienced}} less possessory land claim litigation than other states. This is primarily {{the result of}} the Land Claims Act of 1851 (following the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> Hidalgo) that required all claims deriving from the Spanish and Mexican governments to be filed within two years. Three U.S. Supreme Court decisions and one Ninth Circuit ruling have held that the Land Claims Act applied to aboriginal title, and thus extinguished all aboriginal title in the state (as no tribes filed claims under the Act). Two Deputy Attorneys General of California have advocated this view.|$|E

5|$|The area {{now called}} Four Corners was {{initially}} American Indian land and {{beginning in the}} 16th century it was claimed by Spain as part of New Spain. After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, the area was governed by Mexico until being ceded to the United States by the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> Hidalgo in 1848 following the United States' victory in the Mexican–American War.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} included lands {{south of}} the Gila River and west of the Rio Grande which the U.S. acquired {{so that it could}} construct a transcontinental railroad along a deep southern route, which the Southern Pacific Railroad later completed in 1881/1883.

The plaintiffs, members of the Karuk and Peh-tsick tribes, alleged both that the dams would violate their aboriginal title rights and their rights under the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> Hidalgo. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that both rights (if they existed) were extinguished by the 1851 statute.

5|$|The Southern Pacific Railroad from Los Angeles reached Yuma, Arizona, in 1877, Tucson in March 1880, El Paso in May 1881, {{and thus}} {{completed}} the second transcontinental railroad in December 1881. The portion in Arizona was originally {{largely in the}} Gadsden Purchase but the western part was later rerouted north of the Gila River to serve the city of Phoenix. The portion in New Mexico runs largely through the territory that had been disputed between Mexico and the United States after the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> Hidalgo had gone into effect, and before {{the time of the}} Gadsden Purchase. The Santa Fe Railroad Company also completed a railroad across Northern Arizona, via Prescott, Winslow, Flagstaff and Kingman in August 1883.|$|E

5|$|Davis, an {{advocate}} of a southern transcontinental route, persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate James Gadsden to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad. Gadsden was also charged with re-negotiating {{the provisions of the}} Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Guadalupe</b> Hidalgo which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory. Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna in December 1853, purchasing a large swath of land to America's southwest. Negotiations were nearly derailed by William Walker's unauthorized expedition into Mexico, and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts. Congress reduced the Gadsden Purchase to the region now comprising southern Arizona and part of southern New Mexico; the price was cut from $15million to $10million. Congress also included a protection clause for a private citizen, Albert G. Sloo, whose interests were threatened by the purchase. Pierce opposed the use of the federal government to prop up private industry and did not endorse {{the final version of the}} treaty, which was ratified nonetheless. The acquisition brought the contiguous United States to its present-day boundaries, excepting later minor adjustments.|$|E
