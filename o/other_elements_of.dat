5|$|The Last of Us {{features}} an original score, composed by musician Gustavo Santaolalla. Known for his minimalist approach to composing, Santaolalla was contacted early in development. Naughty Dog took a similar minimalist approach to <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the game, including the action, sound design and art design. The sound department began working {{early on the}} sound of the Infected, in order to achieve the best work possible. A similar direction was taken by the art department, whose designs influenced <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> development. Naughty Dog overhauled their game engine for some elements, particularly lighting and animations.|$|E

5|$|Predynastic Egypt {{originally}} {{consisted of}} small, independent villages. Because many deities in later times were {{strongly tied to}} particular towns and regions, many scholars {{have suggested that the}} pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states, spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities. But others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were, like <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> Egyptian culture, present all across the country despite the political divisions within it.|$|E

5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, the {{elements}} {{characteristic of the}} style include: the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. <b>Other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.|$|E
5|$|In Australian {{service the}} A-4Gs formed {{part of the}} air group of the {{aircraft}} carrier , and were primarily used to provide air defence for the fleet. They took part in exercises throughout the Pacific region and also supported the training of RAN warships as well as <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the Australian military. The Skyhawks did not see combat, and a planned deployment {{of some of their}} pilots to fight in the Vietnam War was cancelled before it took place. Ten A-4Gs were destroyed as a result of equipment failures and non-combat crashes during the type's service with the Navy, causing the deaths of two pilots.|$|E

5|$|Major General George B. McClellan, {{commanding}} the Army of the Potomac, determined {{to take the}} Confederate capital of Richmond via the Virginia Peninsula. This unexpected move would, in theory, allow McClellan's army to move quickly up the peninsula rather than fighting through Northern Virginia. During March 1862, the Army of the Potomac was gradually transferred by water to Fortress Monroe {{at the end of}} the Virginia Peninsula. On March 10, 1862, the 22nd left their winter camp and were shipped to Fortress Monroe. By April 4, the regiment began to advance, along with many <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the Army of the Potomac, up the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The operation's codename, Ring, {{referred}} to the encirclement of the towns of Getashen and Martunashen by the Soviet MVD and armed forces. A date in late April was chosen for the commencement of the operation, which called for Soviet troops to surround the towns and search the villages for both illegally procured weapons and Armenian guerrilla fighters. Reacting to the growing violence, Gorbachev had also assigned units of the Soviet 4th Army's predominantly Azerbaijani 23rd Motorized Rifle Division, stationed along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, {{to serve as a}} buffer force. The 23rd Division and <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the Fourth Army were selected along with the Azerbaijani OMON to take part in Ring.|$|E

Similarly, certain schists on Baranof Island are believed to have been contiguous with the Leech River Schists (Leech River Complex) on Vancouver Island around 50 Ma, and subsequently transported northward with <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the Chugach-Prince William terrane.|$|E
50|$|One may {{distinguish}} singularly, multiply and infinitely non-Archimedean times. In a singularly non-archimedean time, we {{can choose}} (albeit arbitrarily) {{a single moment}} T infinitely in the future (and/or the past, mutatis mutandis), such that every other moment infinitely in the future (past) is finitely in the future or past of T. In a multiply non-Archimedean time, there exists a finite set of moments S (where the cardinality of S is greater than two) such that each member of S, T, is infinitely in the future or past <b>of</b> every <b>other</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> S, and there exists an infinity of moments finitely {{in the future of}} T, and every instant that is not an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> S is finitely in the future or past <b>of</b> one <b>element</b> <b>of</b> S, and infinitely in the future or past <b>of</b> every <b>other</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> S.

5|$|White Zombie is {{considered}} to be the first feature length zombie film and has been described as the archetype and model of all zombie movies. Not many early horror films followed White Zombies Haitian origins style. Other horror films from the 1930s borrowed themes from White Zombie, such as people returning from the dead and <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> zombie mythology. These films include: The Ghost Breakers (1940), King of the Zombies (1941), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and The Plague of the Zombies (1966). These films all contain elements from White Zombie including the blank-eyed stares, the voodoo drums, and zombies performing manual labor.|$|E
5|$|Arkwright's {{innovations}} {{were not}} confined to developing workers' settlements; he also had patents on many technologies used for water-powered spinning. They were so successful that rival industrialists risked legal action by copying his designs. His patents expired in 1785, and by 1788 over 200Arkwright type mills had been founded in Britain. New Lanark in Scotland– also a World Heritage Site– was directly influenced by Richard Arkwright and the developments in the Derwent Valley; Lanark {{was identified as a}} potential site for a mill on a visit by David Dale and Arkwright in 1784. Dale later established four mills at Lanark; they were structurally similar to Arkwright's Masson Mill and {{at least two of the}} mills used technology developed in the Derwent Valley, although the factory system was different from that used in the Derwent Valley. New Lanark was acquired by Robert Owen in 1799 who developed paternalism further than had been done in the Derwent Valley, experimenting with education for young and old and social control. Saltaire– another World Heritage Site– was founded in 1853 and featured worker's housing and facilities, as well as <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the factory system developed by Arkwright.|$|E
5|$|As a {{character}} introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long's weapon, {{a pair of}} nunchaku with mounted blades, were selected before <b>other</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the character. One of several weapons initially considered for the character Hwang early in development, {{they were designed to}} be unique amongst the other weapons in the game. Li Long's design and concept were built to revolve around them, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him, and then animated by a motion designer using motion capture to create his in-game movements. During development, many ideas were considered for Li Long's appearance, including several younger drafts. Another idea considered was for him to fight using kung fu, instead of solely with his nunchaku.|$|E
