I stuck the stump <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> into the snow, but the warm blood melted the snow. I figured I was dying. When they rescued me, my arm had a cake of bloody ice frozen around it, sealing the wound. If it had been summer, I’d [...] dead." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{put my hand}} to my sword, but Checco caught hold <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> I {{recovered}} {{myself at}} once.|$|E
500|$|... "My {{motivations for}} self-harming were diverse, but {{included}} examining the interior <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> for hydraulic lines. This may sound strange." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ask your}} pardon, Sir Leicester," [...] says the trooper, [...] "but would you accept <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> to raise you up? You would lie easier, Sir Leicester, {{if you would}} allow me to move you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{motives for}} self-harm {{do not fit}} into medicalised models of {{behaviour}} and may seem incomprehensible to others, as demonstrated by this quotation:"My motivations for self-harming were diverse, but included examining the interior <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> for hydraulic lines. This may sound strange." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I don't {{want you}} to knock my books out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> again," [...] went on William Philander, drawing himself up disdainfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{took another}} mouthful o' beer, {{and then he}} took 'old <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> 'Bill,' he ses, very earnest, 'I {{want you to do}} me a favour.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think, sir, if {{your mother}} heard you, and saw Miss Lambert, she would relent," [...] said the doctor. Who was my mother to hold me in bondage; to claim a right of misery over me; and to take this angel out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It were wiser methinks," [...] quoth {{the enemy}} {{with a slight}} tone of mockery in his cheerful voice, [...] "it were wiser to accept the help <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> They are strong, firm and not cramped. Try them, mejuffrouw, you will have no cause to regret it." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was when}} I reached the level <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heart {{that the first}} {{blurring}} and dizzying <b>of</b> <b>my</b> consciousness' occurred. For fear that I should lose consciousness, I willed to hold the death I had gained, and shifted my concentration to my fingers. My brain cleared again, and the death <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> to the shoulders was most rapidly accomplished.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{allow you}} to call me Isabel!" [...] she retorted, {{struggling}} to free herself from his hold. [...] "Let go <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> You hurt me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must excuse me, madam," [...] he said; [...] "I {{have not}} yet the free use <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> and could not acquit myself {{properly}} in a minuet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suit me all right," [...] Granet agreed. [...] "I'd {{meant to}} lay up because <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> but it's better this morning. We'll start early and get back for the papers." ...|$|E
60|$|Holding her, therefore, {{within the}} shelter <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> where in her heedless innocence she had flung herself, and by very {{instinct}} stroking {{with one hand}} her little brown head to soothe her fears, I became truculent {{for the first time}} in my new-found manhood, and boldly challenged her pursuer.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{had treated}} you so unkindly! Ah, my {{guardian}} angel, my {{light in the}} darkness, how I hate myself for giving you pain! Tell me, sweet, did you wish {{me to come back}} and live with you again?" [...] She made no reply. Then, running my fingers down her arm, I took her hand in mine. It was hot, like the hand of one in a fever. I raised it to my lips and then attempted to draw her to me, but she slipped down and out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> to <b>my</b> feet. I felt her there, on her knees, with head bowed low. Stooping and putting <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> round her body, I drew her up and held her against my breast, and felt her heart throbbing wildly. With many endearing words I begged her to speak to me; but her only reply was: [...] "Come--come," [...] as she slipped again out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and, holding <b>my</b> hand in hers, guided me through the bushes.|$|R
6000|$|CLEOPATRA. Yes: {{the sacred}} white cat: {{is it not}} dreadful? I brought him here to {{sacrifice}} him to the Sphinx; but when {{we got a little}} way from the city a black cat called him, and he jumped out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and ran away to it. Do you think that the black cat can have been my great-great-great-grandmother? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-morning, sair," [...] he said, {{bringing}} in, {{in addition}} to the customary herb-breakfast, an ill-cooked rabbit. Montgomery followed him. His roving eye caught the position <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> and he smiled askew.|$|E
60|$|Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> Putting on a mask {{of black}} silk, and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I {{suffered}} him to hurry me to my palazzo.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me for an explanation. I pointed to the dark object {{by the side of}} the creek. She gave a violent start. Then she screamed and caught hold <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
6000|$|To this {{replied the}} stern Athenian prince, [...] And sourly smiled: In owning your offence [...] You judge yourself; and I but keep record [...] In place of law, while you {{pronounce}} the word. [...] Take your desert, the death you have decreed; [...] I seal your doom, and ratify the deed: [...] By Mars, the patron <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> you die! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{hesitated a}} moment, then obeyed him, and took Bianca on the withers in front <b>of</b> me, <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> about her to support her.|$|R
60|$|P.S. - I have a {{different}} version <b>of</b> <b>my</b> grandfather's <b>arms</b> - or <b>my</b> father had if I could find it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let go <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> Porter," [...] and Merwell {{tried to}} pull himself free, but in vain. Dave's eyes were blazing like two stars and seemed to look the tall youth through and through.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was waiting}} for him--And, oh joy! it was the [...] "Repeater" [...] himself, smugly complacent with {{knowledge}} of past success. I dropped the rifle negligently across the hollow <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> {{and went down to}} him.|$|E
60|$|The two {{men came}} close to where I was crouching. Indeed Lowell's foot came within a few inches <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> {{and for an instant}} I did not see how I could avoid being discovered. Then they passed on.|$|E
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 Oh no, that glass door is opening and {{here come the}} murderers. Although people such as this have only chopped off a few <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> I still {{considered}} them murderers. For, at one time, I stood proud with the rest <b>of</b> <b>my</b> family in this field. That was before the murderers came and carried off their bodies. 2 ̆...|$|R
60|$|How {{my heart}} beat when {{for the first}} time in eight days I had full command <b>of</b> <b>my</b> limbs, and wriggled myself out into the clear air! It seemed as if every {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> or legs caused so much noise that the few who remained in the lodges must be alarmed, and that I moved at even less than a snail's pace, when every muscle was being strained in the effort to advance rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Still Life is {{the fourth}} studio album by Swedish heavy metal band Opeth. The album was {{produced}} and engineered by Opeth alongside Fredrik Nordström, and released on 18 October 1999 through Peaceville Records. It was the first Opeth album to be released through Peaceville, following their departure from Candlelight and Century Black after the release <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Arms,</b> Your Hearse, and the first album to feature Martin Mendez.|$|R
6000|$|I sped to yon heath that is {{lonely and}} bare, [...] For each nerve was unquiet, each pulse in alarm; [...] And I hurl'd the mock-lance thro' the objectless air, [...] And in open-eyed dream proved the {{strength}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, it's you, Miss May! Now isn't {{that good}} luck, my turnin' up {{just in the}} nick o' time to see you home? Here, catch hold <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> The wind's fit to tear the lamp-posts up by the roots." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{inserted}} a steel cast {{of his hand}} in a tree trunk: Continuerà a crescere tranne che in quel punto ("It Will Continue to Grow Except at that Point"). He immersed in a stream a tub of cement with the dimensions of his body on which {{he had left the}} imprints of his hands, feet and face: La mia altezza, la lunghezza delle mie braccia, il mio spessore in un ruscello ("My Height, the Length <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Arms,</b> <b>My</b> Breadth in a Stream").|$|R
60|$|I screamed. I {{could not}} help it, enfeebled as I was. But my spirit being stouter than my flesh, I still refused to answer. Not indeed, until they had given the rope eight turns, not until it had sliced through my muscles and crushed the bone <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> so that to this day it remains of little use to me, did they conquer me. I had reached the limit of endurance.|$|R
60|$|I thanked him, but {{assured him}} that I could get along very nicely without {{assistance}} except {{in the matter of}} preparing food, and so he promised to send women to me for this purpose and also for the care <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ammunition, which he said would be necessary. I suggested that they might also bring some of the sleeping silks and furs which belonged to me as spoils of combat, for the nights were cold and I had none <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own.|$|R
