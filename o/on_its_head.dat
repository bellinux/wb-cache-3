5|$|P. m. hepaticus, {{described}} by Sidney Dillon Ripley in 1948, breeds from northeast Assam to northwest Burma. It {{is similar to}} P. m. saturatus, but redder <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head</b> and upperparts.|$|E
5|$|B. i. coromandus {{differs from}} the {{nominate}} subspecies in breeding plumage, when the buff colour <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head</b> extends to the cheeks and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and tarsus are longer on average than in B. i. ibis. B. i. seychellarum is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white cheeks and throat, like B. i. ibis, but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with B. i. coromandus. Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since the masked shrike has white <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head</b> and a dark rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E

5|$|The Western Ganga {{style of}} {{architecture}} {{was influenced by}} the Pallava and Badami Chalukya architectural features, in addition to indigenous Jain features. The Ganga pillars with a conventional lion at the base and a circular shaft of the pillar <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head,</b> the stepped Vimana of the shrine with horizontal mouldings and square pillars were features inherited from the Pallavas. These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates, the Banas and Nolambas.|$|E
5|$|Besides English {{translation}} and localization, the international version of Kingdom Hearts II {{differs from the}} original Japanese version {{in the content of}} gameplay and several scenes. The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head,</b> which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, Daisy Duck pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Moelis {{announced}} that he was leaving the company, and shortly thereafter founded a new business, Moelis & Company. As he had when joining UBS, Moelis took a large team of senior UBS investment bankers. Moelis's departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the bank's balance sheet to pursue large transactions, particularly leveraged buyouts. The bank's apparent conservatism would be turned <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head</b> when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees. After Moelis, other notable departures included investment banking co-head Jeff McDermott in early 2007 and, as the financial crisis set in, other high-profile bankers such as Oliver Sarkozy in early 2008 and Ben Lorello in 2009.|$|E

50|$|The iDog {{reacts to}} music from an {{external}} source, {{such as an}} external speaker or through a direct connection to a music source such as an MP3 player. It features seven flashing LED lights <b>on</b> <b>its</b> face and {{has the ability to}} 'dance' to the beat of the music by intermittently wiggling its ears and shaking <b>its</b> <b>head.</b> It also has a number of switches <b>on</b> <b>its</b> nose, <b>head</b> and tail which allow it to react to user input. It has various emotions (which change based on user interaction) that provide different color patterns <b>on</b> <b>its</b> LED lights.|$|R
50|$|The iTurtle is {{a turtle}} {{version of the}} iDog. It also comes with a plug cable (3.5 mm) with 2 touch sensors <b>on</b> <b>its</b> tail and <b>head.</b> It moves <b>its</b> shell up and down, shakes <b>its</b> <b>head</b> side to side, and taps its foot. Has the same things as others except his moods are modified.|$|R
5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is {{positively correlated with}} money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. A slowdown in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity theory <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head,</b> Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E
5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first {{indication}} that surprises were on the way. Although clearly an arthropod that walked on the sea-floor, Marella {{was very different from}} the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) in the structure of its legs and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head,</b> which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has also provided the earliest clear evidence of molting.|$|E
5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head</b> and back {{when confronted by}} a predator, and moves its head up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when a predator is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E
50|$|Hook Island Sea Monster, While on a {{boat trip}} {{with his family in}} the summer of 1964, Robert Le Serrec saw a {{creature}} in the Australian waters that appeared monster like in size. Described as being around 80 feet in length, with serpent-like features and eyes <b>on</b> top of <b>its</b> <b>head,</b> the creature quickly became known as the Hook Island monster.Many theories have debunked the photograph as being either fake or staged, but the myth lives on. It is also known as the tadpole creature. It resembles a giant tadpole, has a gaping mouth with small teeth and eyes placed <b>on</b> top of <b>its</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R

25|$|According to the FCI breed standard, {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of its appearance is its hairlessness. The dog may have short hair <b>on</b> top of <b>its</b> <b>head,</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> feet, and <b>on</b> the tip of its tail. In Peru, breeders tend to prefer completely hairless dogs. The full-coated variety is disqualified from conformation showing.|$|R
5|$|The Cape sparrow or mossie (Passer melanurus) is a bird of the sparrow family Passeridae {{found in}} {{southern}} Africa. A medium-sized sparrow at , it has distinctive plumage, including large pale head stripes in both sexes. Its plumage is mostly coloured grey, brown, and chestnut, {{and the male}} has some bold black and white markings <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head</b> and neck. The species inhabits semi-arid savannah, cultivated areas, and towns, and ranges from the central coast of Angola to eastern South Africa and Swaziland. Three subspecies are distinguished {{in different parts of}} its range.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler {{has mostly}} black, gray, and white plumage, which is soft, lacking gloss. With its {{striping}} {{and the small}} yellow spot between its eye and bill, it is a distinctive bird. The sexes differ slightly, both having gray upperparts with black streaks, and white underparts with black streaks on the flanks. The adult male is striped with a black on the crown, throat, and below the eye, and has white around its chin and above its eye. The adult female has more dingy plumage <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head,</b> with a white throat and dark gray cheeks. The most similar birds to the black-throated gray warbler are the black-and-white and blackpoll warblers, which although marked in black have entirely different plumage patterns.|$|E
5|$|The brolga is a common, gregarious wetland {{bird species}} of {{tropical}} and south-eastern Australia and New Guinea. It is a tall, upright bird {{with a small}} head, long beak, slender neck and long legs. The plumage is mainly grey, with black wing tips, and it has an orange-red band of colour <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head.</b> It {{is well known for}} its intricate mating dance. The nest is built of sticks on an island in marshland and usually two eggs are laid. Incubation takes 32 days and the newly hatched young are precocial. The adult diet is mostly plant matter, but invertebrates and small vertebrates are also eaten.|$|E

50|$|The {{solitary tinamou}} {{is a large}} {{brownish}} tinamou heavily barred with black. Its neck, breast, and flanks are grey, and its belly is white. It has a dark brown crown and a white throat <b>on</b> <b>its</b> yellowish <b>head</b> and neck, which contrasts with a distinctive buff line {{on the side of}} the neck. It averages 45 cm in length.|$|R
5|$|The {{functions}} of the frills and three distinctive facial horns <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head</b> have long inspired debate. Traditionally, these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent theories, noting the presence of {{blood vessels in the}} skull bones of ceratopsids, find it more probable that these features were primarily used in identification, courtship and dominance displays, much like the antlers and horns of modern reindeer, mountain goats, or rhinoceros beetles. The theory would find additional support if Torosaurus was found to be the mature form of Triceratops, as this would mean the frill also developed holes (fenestrae) as individuals reached maturity, rendering the structure more useful for display than defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} (Galeocerdo cuvier) {{is known to}} prey on the bowmouth guitarfish. The ray is {{protected}} by the thorns <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head</b> and back, and it may ram perceived threats. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms Carpobothrium rhinei, Dollfusiella michiae, Nybelinia southwelli, Stoibocephalum arafurense, and Tylocephalum carnpanulatum, the leech Pontobdella macrothela, the trematode Melogonimus rhodanometra, the monogeneans Branchotenthes robinoverstreeti and Monocotyle ancylostomae, and the copepods Nesippus vespa, Pandarus cranchii, and P. smithii. There is a record of a bowmouth guitarfish being cleaned by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus).|$|E
5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head</b> showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River {{to take it to the}} sea, but the river flooded, and the casketâ€”radiating lightâ€”went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it out of the water and returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E

Its habitat is similar to that of the Australasian grebe.|$|R
5|$|The power {{contest between}} the allied Military Committee and the Regionalists against the National Command was fought out {{within the party}} {{structure}}. However, the Military Committee and the Regionalists managed to turn the party structure <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head.</b> At the 2nd Regional Congress (held in March 1965), {{it was decided to}} endorse the principle that the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command would be the ex officio head of state, and the Regional Command acquired the power to appoint the prime minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff, and the top military commanders. This change curtailed the powers of the National Command, who thenceforth had very little say in Syrian internal affairs. In response, at the 8th National Congress (April 1965) Aflaq had originally planned to launch an attack on the Military Committee and the Regionalists, but was persuaded not to by fellow National Command members â€“ most notably by a Lebanese member, Jibran Majdalani, and a Saudi member, Ali Ghannam â€“ because it could lead to the removal of the party's civilian leadership, as had occurred in the Iraqi Regional Branch. Because of this decision, Aflaq was voted from office as Secretary General, to be succeeded by fellow National Command member Munif al-Razzaz. Razzaz was a Syrian-born Jordanian who was not rooted enough in party politics to solve the crisis, even if under his command several joint meetings of the National and Regional Commands took place. Not longer after Aflaq's loss of office, Hafiz, the Secretary of the Regional Command, changed his allegiance to support the National Command. While Hafiz was the de jure leader of Syria (he held the offices of Regional Command secretary, Chairman of the Presidential Council, prime minister and commander-in-chief), it was Jadid, the Assistant Secretary General of the Regional Command, who was the de facto leader of Syria.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>head</b> and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E
