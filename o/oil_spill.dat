5|$|June 30, 2010– Tropical Storm Alex {{passes through}} the area {{affected}} by the Deepwater Horizon <b>oil</b> <b>spill,</b> causing tarballs from the spill as large as apples to wash onshore portions of the panhandle from high storm tides created by the storm.|$|E
5|$|Most of the three-mile (5km) {{stretch of}} river that had {{previously}} been closed was reopened without restriction, although a patrol remained in place to enforce a safety zone. The river restrictions delayed one outgoing vessel and two incoming ones. There was also a minor <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> originating from equipment at the refinery's unoccupied and rarely used dock.|$|E
40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>spills</b> lead to {{pollution}} {{of water and}} land in the surrounding environment. The health and the farmland of the people living around {{the area of the}} spills are also adversely affected. Numerous laws are usually in place {{to deal with the issue}} of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> but often times some of these laws are not totally enforced or the institutions set up to deal with the <b>spills</b> are inefficient. <b>Oil</b> <b>spills</b> cannot be left unabated. The problem of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> have to be dealt with in order to avoid the devastating effects of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> on the environment. In a place like the Niger-Delta in Nigeria where <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> are rampant, an effective means of curbing the menace have to be thought out to deal with <b>spills.</b> <b>Oil</b> theft, pipeline vandalism and sabotage are the order of the day and thus, <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> are a recurring decimal in the Niger-Delta. The question then is can the polluter-pays principle play a role in the prevention and control of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> especially in Nigeria? This article seeks to answer this question by examining whether the Polluter Pays Principle, an international environmental law principle, can act as a deterrent to <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> especially deliberate <b>oil</b> <b>spills.</b> This paper examines the tenets of the polluter-pays principle, the deterrence theory, challenges militating against the prevention and control of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> in Nigeria and then relevant recommendations and conclusion as regards the role of the polluter-pays principle in preventing and controlling <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> are put forward.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} a Fairclough-inspired analysis of environmental narrative disclosures of Royal/Dutch Shell <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> in Nigeria. Our {{focus is on}} the construction of meaning of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> as presented in corporate narrative disclosures. As well as serving to illustrate a Fairclough-inspired discourse analysis, the analysis is a critical attempt to explore the mobilisation of externalities such as <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> into corporate accountability frameworks discourse. Findings of this paper indicate that Shell mobilises externalities into its accountability frameworks, controls the 2 ̆ 7 official 2 ̆ 7 discourse and attempts to determine the nature of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> and, in doing so discursively creates the boundary for <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> which are accountable and those which are 2 ̆ 7 external 2 ̆ 7 to the organization...|$|R
50|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} authority governing <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> in the United States is the Federal government. The federal government has jurisdiction over oil responses and <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> that occur {{in state and federal}} navigable waters alike.|$|R
5|$|Three cruise ships, Carnival Pride, Carnival Destiny, and Grandeur of the Seas had {{to alter}} their courses due to the {{presence}} of Bonnie. Due to the threat of a tropical storm, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal {{declared a state of emergency}} on July22. Along the Gulf Coast, concerns arose regarding the potential effects of the storm on the BP <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> earlier in the year. Due to risk of intoxicated storm surge, authorities prepared for possible evacuations of low-lying areas along coastlines. On July23, Admiral Thad Allen ordered the <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> site to be evacuated, as Bonnie posed a safety threat to nearly 2,000 people in that area. The ships and vessels in the area began preparation for evacuation on July24. Closer to shore, approximately 1,300 fishing boats laying boom had to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|Following the April 2010 {{destruction}} of the Deepwater Horizon while drilling the Macondo well, and the resulting <b>oil</b> <b>spill,</b> all appraisal activities at 33 wells under exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, including Tiber, were placed on hold. At least two rigs that might otherwise {{have been used for}} developing Tiber are also in use on the relief wells for the ruptured well.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} {{in deep water}} occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, but also from oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in the Deepwater Horizon <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{potential}} of using log-cumulants for discrimina-tion between mineral <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> and other low backscatter ocean features in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is investigated here. Radarsat- 2 fine quad-polarization data containing experi-mental <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> {{as well as}} simulated biogenic slicks and a natural phenomenon are analyzed. For this data set, the combined information of matrix log-cumulants of first and second order is found to clearly discriminate {{the majority of the}} mineral <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> from the simulated biogenic slicks and the natural phenomenon. These preliminary findings suggest that the proposed method has a potential application in classification of low backscatter ocean features of unknown origin.

5|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>spills</b> are {{recorded}} both {{in case of}} maritime routes and pipeline routes to the main refineries. <b>Oil</b> <b>spills,</b> amounting {{to as much as}} 7.56 billion liters of oil entering the oceans every year, occur due to damaged equipment or human error.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} of a two-part {{interview}} with The Wall Street Journal, Grisham claimed that although he usually attempts to include humor in his submitted drafts, it is usually removed during the editorial process. However, in this case much of the humor survived editing. In {{the second part of the}} interview the following week, Grisham noted that his inspirations for the book included television advertisements and the Deepwater Horizon <b>oil</b> <b>spill.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though he was {{originally}} sentenced {{to assist with}} the clean-up of the <b>oil</b> <b>spill,</b> due to the lengthy appeals process, his community service was conducted in the Anchorage, Alaska, area, beginning in June 1999 picking up trash from local roads, later moving to Bean's Cafe, a local soup kitchen. His community service was conducted over five years with the Anchorage Parks Beautification Program. He paid the $50,000 fine in May 2002.|$|E
5|$|Three {{bills were}} {{signed into law}} in {{response}} to the spill. Under a new law, the California Fire Marshall will be required to review the oil pipelines conditions every year while federal regulations only mandate a review every five years. Another new law provides for making <b>oil</b> <b>spill</b> response times faster and more effective. Finally, a new law will force intrastate pipelines to use the best-known technology such as automatic shut-off valves.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This paper re-considers {{corporate}} accountability with {{a specific}} focus on Royal/Dutch/Shell 2 ̆ 7 s discursive categorization of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - Using text analysis, we reflect on the classification of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> as operational (controllable) and sabotage (uncontrollable) {{and the construction of}} self and the 2 ̆ 7 other 2 ̆ 7 that inverts accountability relationship. Findings - We found Shell 2 ̆ 7 s identity construction of self and 2 ̆ 7 other 2 ̆ 7 assigns the causes of, and human agency to, <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> that inverts the accountability relationship. Shell provides accountability of the communities but not to the communities. To control or not to control <b>oil</b> <b>spills,</b> is a question which is consequentially real for the narrator and those categorized. Research limitations/implications - The paper directs attention to discursive categorization of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> by Royal/Dutch Shell, the boundaries of responsibility and the consequences for accountability. Originality/value - This paper contributes further to an understanding of corporate accountability in oil producing communities by focusing on Shell 2 ̆ 7 s discursive categorization of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> anchored in the process of narrative and identity construction, in both the parent and the operating subsidiary in Nigeria...|$|R

50|$|A December 2014 {{study by}} the Washington State Department of Ecology stated that the {{construction}} of the Gateway Pacific Terminal would cause an increase in potential <b>oil</b> <b>spills,</b> leading to environmental damage and disruption of traditional fishing grounds. The median amount of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> in the nearby Puget Sound is projected by the study to increase 26 percent, or an increase from approximately 10 to approximately 13 individual spills a year by 2019.

5|$|Alaska is {{the heartland}} of the sea otter's range. In 1973, the {{population}} in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals. By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals. A massive decline in sea otter populations in the Aleutian Islands accounts {{for most of the}} change; the cause of this decline is not known, although orca predation is suspected. The sea otter population in Prince William Sound was also hit hard by the Exxon Valdez <b>oil</b> <b>spill,</b> which killed thousands of sea otters in 1989.|$|E
5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to oil spills, both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon <b>oil</b> <b>spill,</b> said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed {{as a result of the}} spill.|$|E
5|$|At {{low tide}} {{extensive}} areas of mudflats (the Steart and the Berrow Flats) are exposed, providing important feeding and over-wintering grounds for waders (shorebirds). Invertebrate fauna including six nationally rare species and eighteen nationally scarce species {{can be found}} in the ditches and ponds around the shores. Consequently, Bridgwater Bay is a National Nature Reserve, and is managed by Natural England. Some of the potential risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local <b>Oil</b> <b>Spill</b> Contingency Plan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oils</b> <b>spills,</b> {{when they}} occur, are {{detrimental}} to the surrounding environment, humans, and native wildlife. This type of spill is statistically rare, given how much oil is pumped, refined, transported, and stored each day. In 1999, according to US Coast Guard data, of over 3.2 billion barrels of oil transported by oil tanker in the US, fewer than 200 barrels were spilled. The occurrence of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> has decreased in the current decades, with approximately 77% less <b>oil</b> <b>spilled</b> since the 1970s. This is due to increased awareness and improved technology.|$|R
30|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>spills</b> {{are causing}} serious damage to marine and coastal ecosystem. It is {{estimated}} that 0.25 % of world oil production {{ends up in the}} ocean. However, the main contribution of oil pollution originating from transportation activities still originates not from ship accidents, but from routine ship operations like tank washing and engine effluent discharges [1]. Timely and accurate detection of oil slicks help to monitor <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> and manage coastal resources. The detection of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> can efficiently be improved by the use of satellite images which are characterized by suitable special resolution for this purpose [2]. Remote sensing techniques include radar, microwave, infrared, and visible sensors [3]. However, most of <b>oil</b> <b>spills</b> are estimated by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data [3], which are limited by revisit frequency and coverage.|$|R
