5|$|In the Holy Roman and Byzantine empires, {{imperial}} purple was a colour {{reserved for}} emperors, kings and bishops, and purple parchment was rarely used for writing.

In 2005, the document was proposed for inclusion in the Memory of the World Register, but was not included.|$|E
50|$|In color theory, purple {{colors are}} any {{colors on the}} line <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> on the CIE {{chromaticity}} diagram (or colors that {{can be derived from}} colors on the line <b>of</b> <b>purples),</b> i.e., any color between red and violet, not including either red or violet themselves.|$|R
50|$|In color theory, {{the line}} <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> or the purple {{boundary}} is the locus {{on the edge}} of the chromaticity diagram between extreme spectral red and violet. Except for the endpoints, colors on the line <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> are not spectral. Line-of-purples colors and spectral colors are the only ones which are considered fully saturated in the sense that for any given point on the line <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> there exists no color involving a mixture of red and violet that is more saturated than it. There is no monochromatic light source able to generate a purple color. Instead, every color on the line <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> is produced by mixing a unique ratio of fully saturated red and fully saturated violet, at the extreme points of visibility on the spectrum of pure hues.|$|R

Despite critical acclaim, sales of The Big Room were considerably lower than their previous album, Shades <b>of</b> <b>Purple,</b> which Verdens Gang attributed to a lacklustre marketing effort by Atlantic Records. Citing disappointing sales Atlantic chose to replace M2M as Jewel's opening act halfway through the tour, after which they returned to Norway and disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Zoology is {{discussed}} in Books VIII to XI. The encyclopedia mentions different sources <b>of</b> <b>purple</b> dye, particularly the murex snail, the highly prized source of Tyrian purple. It describes the elephant and hippopotamus in detail, {{as well as the}} value and origin of the pearl and the invention of fish farming and oyster farming. The keeping of aquariums was a popular pastime of the rich, and Pliny provides anecdotes of the problems of owners becoming too closely attached to their fish.|$|E
5|$|During his 16-year stay at CRGS, student numbers {{increased}} from 29 to 180 boys under his guidance, particularly through {{the introduction of}} day pupils. Shaw Jeffrey is also credited {{with the introduction of}} many changes at the school, including the introduction <b>of</b> <b>purple</b> blazers, the setting up of the Old Colcestrian Society for former boys (and quite often honoured former masters), a preparatory school, a cadet corps, an orchestra, a bugle band and a series of school entertainments and theatrical performances, and the acquisition of several buildings on behalf of the school. He was a national pioneer of the teaching of modern European languages through phonetics, employed language teachers from Germany and France, and set up arrangements for foreign study during holidays.|$|E

5000|$|On a {{chromaticity}} diagram, {{the straight}} line connecting the extreme spectral colors (red and violet) {{is known as}} the line <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> (or 'purple boundary'); it represents one limit of human color perception. The color magenta used in the CMYK printing process is {{near the center of the}} line <b>of</b> <b>purples,</b> but most people associate the term [...] "purple" [...] with a somewhat bluer tone, such as is displayed by the color [...] "electric purple" [...] (a color also directly on the line <b>of</b> <b>purples),</b> shown below. Some common confusion exists concerning the color names [...] "purple" [...] and [...] "violet". Purple is a mixture of red and blue light, whereas violet is a spectral color.|$|R

5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. At {{the far end of}} the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads of male and female flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount <b>of</b> <b>purple</b> in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud <b>of</b> <b>purple</b> vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E

5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{influential}} factor shaping this new class was the competitive nature of scholarly candidates entering civil service through the imperial examinations. Although not all scholar-officials came from the landholding class, sons of prominent landholders had better access to higher education, and thus greater ability to pass examinations for government service. Gaining a scholarly degree by passing prefectural, circuit-level, or palace exams in the Song period {{was the most important}} prerequisite in being considered for appointment, especially to higher posts; this was a departure from the Tang period, when the examination system was enacted on a much smaller scale. A higher degree attained through the three levels of examinations meant a greater chance of obtaining higher offices in government. Not only did this ensure a higher salary, but also greater social prestige, visibly distinguished by dress. This institutionalized distinction of scholar-officials by dress included the type and even color of traditional silken robes, hats, and girdles, demarcating that scholar-official's level of administrative authority. This rigid code of dress was especially enforced during the beginning of the dynasty, although the prestigious clothing color <b>of</b> <b>purple</b> slowly began to diffuse through the ranks of middle and low grade officials.|$|E
5|$|The {{cities where}} {{emperors}} lived frequently in this period—Milan, Trier, Arles, Sirmium, Serdica, Thessaloniki, Nicomedia and Antioch—were treated as alternate imperial seats, {{to the exclusion}} of Rome and its senatorial elite. A new style of ceremony was developed, emphasizing the distinction of the emperor from all other persons. The quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' primus inter pares were abandoned for all but the tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use <b>of</b> <b>purple</b> cloth to all but the emperors. His subjects were required to prostrate themselves in his presence (adoratio); the most fortunate were allowed the privilege of kissing the hem of his robe (proskynesis, προσκύνησις). Circuses and basilicas were designed to keep the face of the emperor perpetually in view, and always in a seat of authority. The emperor became a figure of transcendent authority, a man beyond the grip of the masses. His every appearance was stage-managed. This style of presentation was not new—many of its elements were first seen in the reigns of Aurelian and Severus—but it was only under the tetrarchs that it was refined into an explicit system.|$|E

5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight <b>of</b> <b>purple</b> speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E
