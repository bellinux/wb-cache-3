5|$|Ab initio phasing {{or direct}} methods – This {{is usually the}} method <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> small {{molecules}} (<1000 non-hydrogen atoms), and has been used successfully to solve the phase problems for small proteins. If {{the resolution of the}} data is better than 1.4 Å (140 pm), direct methods can be used to obtain phase information, by exploiting known phase relationships between certain groups of reflections.|$|E
5|$|Argon {{may be used}} as {{the carrier}} gas in gas {{chromatography}} and in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; it is the gas <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> the plasma used in ICP spectroscopy. Argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for scanning electron microscopy. Argon gas is also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in microelectronics and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication.|$|E

5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function.

In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all {{to be sensitive to}} beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E

5|$|Although sauropods {{may have}} been the prey <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> Majungasaurus, discoveries {{published}} in 2007 detail finds in Madagascar that indicate the presence of other Majungasaurus in their diet. Numerous bones of Majungasaurus have been discovered bearing tooth marks identical to those found on sauropod bones from the same localities. These marks have the same spacing as teeth in Majungasaurus jaws, are of the same size as Majungasaurus teeth, and contain smaller notches consistent with the serrations on those teeth. As Majungasaurus is the only large theropod known from the area, the simplest explanation is that it was feeding on other members of its own species. Suggestions that the Triassic Coelophysis was a cannibal have been recently disproven, leaving Majungasaurus as the only non-avian theropod with confirmed cannibalistic tendencies, although {{there is some evidence that}} cannibalism may have occurred in other species as well.|$|E

5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This {{was more than a}} protest against taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E
5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from the bark of trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time the remedy <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in the {{oral polio vaccine}} reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} {{that does}} not cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies demonstrate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants, but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction. According to a survey of psychiatrists, it is the drug <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> the treatment of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, although {{this is not an}} indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There have also been a few studies suggesting that bupropion can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, if they have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).|$|E
5|$|Coin-operated {{machines}} to vend food, for amusement, and for gambling became {{popular in the}} 1890s. Such machines could be placed on otherwise unused floor space in businesses, required little maintenance, and brought in money for owners. Beginning about 1898, coin-operated mechanical pianos also became popular. The Mills Novelty Company was a leading producer of such devices; by 1906 it was producing machines ranging from a mechanically played violin to fortune-telling devices. While some {{machines to}}ok cents or other denominations, the nickel was the coin <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> these machines.|$|E
5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E

Clindamycin {{should not be used}} as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action.

5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. The solid support is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the solid support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>for</b> parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E
