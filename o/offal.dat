5|$|Animal {{hearts are}} widely {{consumed}} as food. As {{they are almost}} entirely muscle, they are high in protein. They are often included in dishes with other <b>offal,</b> for example in the pan-Ottoman kokoretsi.|$|E
5|$|Some seabird {{species have}} benefited from fisheries, {{particularly}} from discarded fish and <b>offal.</b> These discards compose 30% of the food of seabirds in the North Sea, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total food of some seabird populations. This can have other impacts; for example, {{the spread of the}} northern fulmar through the United Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of discards. Discards generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins.|$|E
5|$|The tiger {{catshark}} is {{a sluggish}} predator of a {{diverse array of}} benthic organisms. Its diet is dominated by bony fishes and crustaceans, and also includes cephalopods, polychaete worms, smaller sharks, and scavenged fish <b>offal.</b> It has been observed at the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), feeding on squid that have descended to the bottom to mate and deposit eggs. Documented predators of this species include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) and the ragged tooth shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
50|$|As {{a street}} food fare, {{customer}} might choose {{the type of}} pork <b>offals</b> in their dish, {{and they will be}} charged accordingly. Other than pork meat, the types of pork <b>offals</b> being offered as sekba are pig's ears, tongue, liver, tripe, intestines and lungs. The prices of each pieces of pork <b>offals</b> ranged between Rp 5,000 to Rp 15,000. A personal portion usually contains three types of <b>offals</b> or meat. Vegetables, such as boiled potatoes, salted vegetables, tofu, and sometimes hard boiled egg might be added.|$|R
40|$|Animal <b>offals</b> can {{be divided}} into (1) edible <b>offals</b> and {{by-products}} including fats, blood, and low-grade trimmings such as poultry skin and pork hock meat; (2) extracts from edible <b>offals</b> for use as ingredients in food products; (3) inedible offals; (4) hides and skins; (5) raw materials for extraction of pharmaceuticals or chemicals; (6) raw materials for sundry by-products.

30|$|Higher {{proportions}} of total and edible <b>offals</b> {{were obtained from}} L 2 than L 1 goats, which is {{in agreement with the}} results of Solomon et al. (2008) and Solomon and Simret (2008). The total edible <b>offals</b> (2.8 – 3.2  kg) reported for HH (Asnakew and Berhan 2007) and Sidama goats (Tadesse et al. 2013) are also similar with finding of the present study. The fact that SS goats had lighter total <b>offals</b> in the present study indicates that this breed can produce more proportion of usable carcass components relative to their body size than Bati and HH goats.|$|R
5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail <b>offal</b> discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from <b>offal</b> discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for <b>offal</b> in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, the winghead shark {{is caught}} {{throughout}} its range using gillnets, seines, stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh, the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup, the liver {{is a source}} of vitamin oil, and the <b>offal</b> is processed into fishmeal. This species is taken in large numbers in some areas, such as in the Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{close to}} the sea floor, the bignose shark feeds on bony and {{cartilaginous}} fishes, and cephalopods. It is viviparous, meaning the embryos are sustained to term via a placental connection. Females bear litters of three to 15 pups after a 10-month gestation period. Despite its size, this shark lives too deep to pose much danger to humans. It is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries {{in many parts of}} its range; the meat, fins, skin, liver oil, and <b>offal</b> may be used. The International Union for Conservation of Nature presently lacks enough information to assess the global conservation status of this species. However, the various fishing pressures within its range are cause for concern given its slow reproductive rate, and it may have already declined in the northwestern Atlantic and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Larger {{species of}} procellariid face similar {{problems}} to the albatrosses with long-line fisheries. These species readily take <b>offal</b> from fishing boats and will also steal bait {{from the long}} lines as they are being set, risking becoming snared on the hooks and drowning. In {{the case of the}} spectacled petrel this has led to the species undergoing a large decline and its listing as critically endangered. Diving species, most especially the shearwaters, are also vulnerable to gillnet fisheries. Studies of gill-net fisheries show that shearwaters (sooty and short-tailed) compose 60% of the seabirds killed by gill-nets in Japanese waters and 40% in Monterey Bay, California in the 1980s, with the total number of shearwaters killed in Japan being between 65,000 and 125,000 per annum over the same study period (1978–1981).|$|E

5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, the {{sluggish}} and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: crustaceans (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, mantis shrimp, and hermit crabs), annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including anchovies, jack macherels, and gobies), cephalopods (including squid), and fish <b>offal.</b> Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is crustaceans, followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem to prefer polychaetes, while females prefer crustaceans. It has been observed attacking a common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) by tearing off an arm with a twisting motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{albatross}} diet {{is predominantly}} cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and <b>offal</b> (organ meat), although {{they will also}} scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. It {{should be noted that}} for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance of each of these food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.|$|E
5|$|The sicklefin weasel shark is not {{dangerous}} to humans. It is caught by artisanal fishers throughout its range, mostly in drifting and bottom gillnets {{but also in}} bottom trawls and on longlines. The meat is eaten, the fins are used in shark fin soup, and the <b>offal</b> is processed into fishmeal. However, {{the small size of}} this shark limits its economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sicklefin weasel shark as Vulnerable, noting that it is naturally uncommon and resides in heavily fished regions. In addition, compared to the related Australian weasel shark it is less productive and thus less resilient to withstand fishing pressure.|$|E

5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for <b>offal</b> outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries operating throughout its range, including off Pakistan, India, Thailand, and the Philippines; an exception is in Australian waters, where it is only taken in small numbers as bycatch. This shark is caught using demersal trawls, floating and fixed bottom gill nets, and on hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted, the fins are used for shark fin soup, and the <b>offal</b> processed into fishmeal. In addition, the liver {{is a source of}} oil and vitamins, and the thick, tough skin is made into leather products. Off Queensland, Australia, the {{tawny nurse shark}} is valued by big-game anglers. When hooked, large individuals are tenacious opponents and are difficult to subdue due to their habit of spinning. They are also capable of spitting a powerful jet of water into the faces of their captors, making grunting noises in between jets (making the tawny shark one of the few species of sharks to produce a noise);whether this is a deliberate defensive behavior is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries across {{most of its}} range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. Furthermore, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the <b>offal</b> for fishmeal. Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat {{and low levels of}} dispersal between populations, and market surveys suggest that they are much less common now than in the past. They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development, and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning. As a result, the World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered. Off Australia, the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn trawls, and there it has been assessed as of Least Concern.|$|E
30|$|The green <b>offals</b> {{are then}} taken by tripe {{cleaners}} into the tripe room for cleaning and washing before the veterinary officers can inspect them. The red <b>offals,</b> of lungs, heart and liver, are then washed by the skinners and made {{ready for the}} veterinary officers to inspect them in the post-mortem examination. Another set of flayers, (splitters), divide the remaining carcass into two and then wash the carcass {{to get rid of}} any traces of blood and bone before examination.|$|R

5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillar and beetles. In autumn and winter, {{the diet}} is supplemented with nuts and seeds, hazel nuts and beech mast being preferred. The young are fed {{mainly on the}} insects favoured by their parents, with some seeds. Food items are found mainly on tree trunks and large branches, but smaller branches may also be investigated, and food may be taken from the ground, especially outside the breeding season. Nuthatches can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. Some prey is caught in flight, and a nuthatch will remove bark or rotten wood to reach insects, although it cannot chisel into healthy wood like a woodpecker. A pair may temporarily join a mixed-species foraging flock as it passes near their territory. The Eurasian nuthatch readily visits bird tables and bird feeders in winter, eating human-made food items such as fat, cheese, butter and bread. It has even been recorded as taking slaughterhouse <b>offal.</b> Sizeable hard food items like nuts or large insects are wedged into crevices in tree bark and smashed with the strong bill.|$|E
5|$|The typical prey {{consists}} of surface organisms such as small fish, squid, crustaceans and jellyfish. The storm petrel will also eat <b>offal</b> and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, {{more than half}} the food items are zooplankton and the fish caught include small herring and sprats; whale carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to carotenoids. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in vitamin A, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies' diet is mainly fish, particularly Mediterranean sand eels. Petrels also catch opossum shrimps from waters close to the colony. Bluefin tuna farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including angiosperm seeds and sorrel, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach's storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.|$|E
25|$|The kidneys, {{like other}} <b>offal,</b> can be cooked and eaten.|$|E
50|$|Avian <b>offals</b> are {{commonly}} consumed too. Giblets, liver and intestines of chicken, duck and burung ayam-ayaman (watercock) are consumed as delicacies, commonly skewered as satay and being deep fried. Deep fried crispy chicken intestine {{in particular is}} a popular snack.|$|R

40|$|Carcass and non-carcass {{production}} of Priangan and Fat Tail sheep were {{studied at the}} Department of Animal Production, Faculty of Animal Science, Bogor Agricultural University. Six male Priangan and six male Fat Tailed lambs were killed at 17. 5 kg slaughter weight. A similar number of both breeds were also killed at 25. 0 kg. Priangan and Fat Tail of 18. 483 ± 0, 160 and of 18. 583 ± 0. 262 kg body weight were fasted 24 hours (water was allowed) and fasted body weight (slaughter weight) were 17. 600 ± 0. 089 and 17. 490 ± 0. 020 kg, respectively. Similarly, Priangan and Fat Tail of 26. 190 ± 0. 207 and 26. 283 ± 0. 349 kg were also fasted at the same treatment and slaughter weights were 24. 914 + 0. 183 and 24. 890 ± 0. 114 kg. Before killing, they were reared on a pelleted ration containing 73. 3 % TDN and 16 % crude protein (100 % dry matter basis). Those animals were killed and dissected. The results showed {{that there were no}} significant differences in the weight of carcass, organs and <b>offals,</b> except in the weight of head and tail at 17. 5 kg (P< 0. 05) and at 25. 0 kg (P< 0. 01). At 17, 5 kg slaughter weight, Priangan (17600 ± 89 g) produced 47. 10 % carcass, 11. 14 % head and shank, 6. 67 % skin, 14. 38 % <b>offals,</b> 4. 84 % blood and 12. 71 % gut content; Fat Tail (17490 ± 20 g) produced 48. 76 % carcass, 9. 20 % head and shank, 7. 00 % skin, 13. 38 % <b>offals,</b> 4. 08 % blood and 11. 99 % gut content.
