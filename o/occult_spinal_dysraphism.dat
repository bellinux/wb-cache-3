50|$|Tethered cord {{syndrome}} (TCS) or <b>occult</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphism</b> sequence {{refers to}} a group of neurological disorders that relate to malformations of the spinal cord. Various forms include tight filum terminale, lipomeningomyelocele, split cord malformations (diastematomyelia), dermal sinus tracts, and dermoids.All forms involve the pulling of the spinal cord {{at the base of the}} spinal canal, literally a tethered cord. The spinal cord normally hangs loose in the canal, free to move up and down with growth, and with bending and stretching. A tethered cord, however, is held taut at the end or at some point in the spinal canal. In children, a tethered cord can force the spinal cord to stretch as they grow. In adults the spinal cord stretches in the course of normal activity, usually leading to progressive spinal cord damage if untreated. TCS is often associated with the closure of a spina bifida. It can be congenital, such as in tight filum terminale, or the result of injury later in life.|$|E

40|$|Background: Diastematomyelia {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} malformation of the spinal cord, which belongs {{to the group of}} <b>occult</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphisms.</b> This disorder consists in the separation of the spinal cord into two parts in the sagittal plane (hemicords). Diastematomyelia may coexist with other <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphisms,</b> such as myelomeningocele, meningocele, spinal lipoma, neuroenteric cysts or dermal sinuses and vertebral abnormalities, such as hemivertebrae, butterfly vertebrae or scoliosis. Case Report: We reported a case of a woman with a congenital defect of the spinal cord, in the form of diastematomyelia, which was diagnosed at the age of 78. The patient had been complaining of back pain for many years. The X-ray radiograms showed the fusion of vertebra L 3 –L 4, defective fusion of posterior spinal bony elements L 5 –S 1. Moreover, abnormal hair growth (hypertrichosis) in the lumbar region was found. The separation of the spinal cord was only diagnosed in MR imaging which was performed at the age of 78. Conclusions: Diastematomyelia is mostly diagnosed in the prenatal period or in children; much less often in adults. This disorder has {{to be taken into account}} in differential diagnosis in patients with X-rays revealing defects of the spine in the form of hemivertebrae, butterfly vertebrae or the fusion of vertebrae, especially when there are additional skin lesions in the back area, at the level of the diagnosed osseous anomalies.

40|$|<b>Spinal</b> <b>dysraphism</b> {{includes}} anomalies of midline fusion involving bony, mesenchymal, and neural elements. MR imaging of {{the spine}} was performed as the initial imaging technique to determine {{its role in the}} evaluation of 31 children when <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphism</b> was clinically suspected or when radiographs revealed errors of ossification of the posterior elements (spina bifida). Correlation of surgical findings in 17 of 18 abnormal examinations and metrizamide myelography with CT in six of these cases indicated that accurate diagnosis was provided by MR in all instances.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} neurosurgical intervention on the appearance of upper motor neuron (UMN) signs in newborns diagnosed with <b>occult</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphism</b> and tethered cord (TC) during {{the first month of}} life. METHODS: A prospective study (1990 to 1996) of 22 consecutive newborns with <b>occult</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphism</b> monitored for the appearance of UMN signs. Untethering was performed when neurologic or urodynamic investigation indicated the presence of UMN dysfunction. RESULTS: Of 22 patients, 10 remained free of UMN symptoms during follow-up (mean, 67 +/- 22 months). Untethering was performed in 12 of 22 patients {{because of the presence of}} UMN symptoms. In 7 of these 12 patients, there was a documented asymptomatic period of 13 +/- 11 months before the onset of UMN symptoms. Untethering at a mean age of 18 +/- 17 months restored normal neurologic and urinary function in all patients (mean postoperative follow-up, 25 +/- 16 months). Of the 12 children, 5 presented with UMN signs at birth. In these children, untethering was performed at a mean age of 9 +/- 5 months. In two of these five patients, UMN symptoms did not resolve after surgery, and ongoing conservative bladder treatment was required (mean follow-up, 37 +/- 14 months). In none of the 12 operated children did signs of retethering occur. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number (10 / 22) of children born with <b>occult</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphism</b> and TC did not develop UMN symptoms during follow-up; neurosurgical correction after the appearance of an UMN sign restored normal neurologic and urinary function in all children; and untethering in children presenting at birth with UMN symptoms resulted in poorer outcome. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>Spinal</b> <b>dysraphism</b> {{is a broad}} term {{including}} heterogeneous {{group of}} congenital spinal anomalies. Defects in the early embryologic age cause <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphism.</b> Several environmental and genetic factors are noted for causing this congenital entity. <b>Spinal</b> <b>dysraphism</b> is broadly grouped in to two groups, closed (spina bifida occulta) and open type (spina bifida aperta).

40|$|Abstract Isolated sacral dimples are {{a common}} {{occurrence}} in Caucasian newborns {{and there has been}} a concern about their association with <b>occult</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphism.</b> A retrospective study was carried out in which infants born in a regional hospital during the year 2003 with a diagnosis of sacral dimple were examined.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chiari II {{deformity}} {{is associated}} with open <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphism.</b> A causal relationship has been proposed by McLone and Knepper. This article evaluates that hypothesis. OBJECTIVE: To establish the frequency of Chiari II deformity in fetuses with open <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphism,</b> assess whether meningocele sac neck area and volume influence the severity of posterior fossa changes, and assess whether the severity of associated findings (ventriculomegaly, amount of extracerebral CSF) are associated with Chiari II deformity. METHODS: Sixty-five fetuses with open <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphism</b> were compared with ges-tationally aged matched “normal ” fetuses on ultrafast MR images. Cerebellar vermis and bony posterior fossa surface area were measured on midline sagittal images. Hindbrain herniation was noted if present. In the open spinal dysraphic group, sac neck area and volume were measured. Ventriculomegaly was assessed by linear measurement of the trigone of the lateral ventricle and extracerebral CSF depth was measured maximally over the lateral surface of the cerebral hemispheres. RESULTS: Fifteen of 65 fetuses with open <b>spinal</b> <b>dysraphism</b> did not have Chiari II deformity.

The aim of this prospective study {{was to develop a}} reliable method {{that could be used in}} the preoperative assessment and postoperative follow-up of children with a tethered cord syndrome (TCS). METHODS: From 1989 to 1997, 15 children underwent spinal cord untethering for TCS. Preoperatively, patients were assessed with MRI and UDS. Postoperative UDS were repeated at 6 - to 12 -month intervals. Four UDS parameters were identified, graded, and added to obtain a UDS score. A group of 38 children without dysraphic condition was used as control and allowed the calculation of a normal score.
