5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{the circular}} path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> year; {{it is the}} basis of the ecliptic coordinate system.

5|$|The sand whiting is a {{schooling}} species, whose {{movements are}} associated with a variety of factors including prey, lunar patterns and spawning movements; although there appears to be little consistency in its movements in relation to these factors. Studies on the species over the period of a year have shown the species does not change its local distribution <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> day, generally being of the same abundance during both night and day. Seasonal abundance due to spawning is variable, with studies conducted in Moreton Bay, Queensland finding the species recruits heavily to shallow waters and increase numbers during winter months, while studies in the Noosa River estuary have shown no difference in numbers recruited <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> season. Like other sillaginids, they have the ability to 'burrow' into the sand and remained hidden until a predator or seine net has passed by.|$|E

The dress was asymmetrical, with a cowled–neck. Fernandez specifically chose cuts {{to ensure that the}} dress kept well. Flank steak was chosen as the material to use, with the meat coming from his family butcher. The dress required Gaga to be stitched into the outfit backstage.|$|E
5|$|Frank Abagnale {{sold the}} film rights to his {{autobiography}} in 1980. Executive Producer Michel Shane purchased the film rights in 1990, for Paramount Pictures. By December 1997, Barry Kemp purchased the film rights from Shane, bringing {{the project to}} DreamWorks, with Jeff Nathanson writing the script. By April 2000, David Fincher was attached to direct <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few months, but dropped {{out in favor of}} Panic Room.

5|$|Haumea has an {{orbital period}} of 284 Earth years, a {{perihelion}} of 35 AU, and an orbital inclination of 28°. It passed aphelion in early 1992, {{and is currently}} more than 50 AU from the Sun. Haumea's orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity {{than that of the}} other members of its collisional family. This is thought to be due to Haumea's weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> billion years, through the Kozai effect, which allows the exchange of an orbit's inclination for increased eccentricity.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the {{battalion}} was re-raised {{as a part-time}} unit of the Citizens Forces based in Newcastle, New South Wales, drawing lineage {{from a number of}} previously existing infantry units. They remained in existence until 1929 when, due to austerity measures during the Great Depression and manpower shortages, {{the battalion}} was amalgamated with two other infantry battalions <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of re-organisations. It was re-formed in 1939 and undertook garrison duty in Australia during the Second World War until 1943 when it was merged once again.|$|E
5|$|In third-person {{missions}} and occasionally some other types, a PDA is available. In the PDA the player can view {{their list of}} objectives (which can change <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mission), maps of the area if available, a help screen {{and a list of}} weapons held with information on each. Characters also typically have cell phones which they sometimes receive calls on during missions. Some missions involve sniping using first-person shooter gameplay. These missions resemble the use of a sniper rifle during normal missions but the player cannot switch to a third-person view.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the day varies {{significantly}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year.

50|$|Data was {{gathered}} using these PPs on timescales of milliseconds up through days. Their {{goal was to}} establish the stability of network burst profiles on the timescale of minutes to hours and to establish stability or developmental changes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> days. In summary, they were successful in demonstrating stability over minutes to hours, but <b>the</b> PPs gathered <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> days displayed significant variability. These finding imply that studies of plasticity of neurons can only be conducted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> minutes or hours without bias in network activity introduced by normal development.|$|R

Domínguez later revealed that the club's lack of trust in academy players had contributed to his decision to sign for Gladbach.|$|E
5|$|Leopold's abdication {{message of}} 1 August 1950 was premised on a {{reconciliation}} {{in the person}} of his eldest son <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> year.

According to a law approved on 11 August, executive powers were transferred to Baudouin in advance of the official abdication. Leopold formally abdicated on 16 July 1951. His son succeeded him the following day.|$|E
