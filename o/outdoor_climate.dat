40|$|In a {{variable}} air volume (VAV) system with 100 % outdoor air, the cooling {{need in the}} building is satisfied with a certain air flow at a certain supply air temperature. To minimize the system energy use, an optimal supply air temperature can be set dependent on the load, specific fan power (SFP), chiller coefficient of performance, outdoor temperature and the outdoor relative humidity. The theory for an optimal supply air temperature is presented and the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) energy use is calculated depending on supply air temperature control strategy, average U-value of the building envelope and two <b>outdoor</b> <b>climates.</b> The analyses show that controlling the supply air temperature optimally results in a significantly lower HVAC energy use than with a constant supply air temperature.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a qualitative effect of ventilation mode at daytime, night ventilation flow and outdoor air temperature, the temperature differences between of indoor air setting and outdoor air on cooling load reduction and indoor air temperature fluctuation at nighttime using thermal mass and night ventilation. A simple residential building model is chosen {{to obtain the}} hourly variation of cooling load at daytime and indoor air temperature at nighttime. It is noted that the temperature distribution of thermal mass material governed by an one-dimensional non-steady heat conduction equation. is considered in the paper. The dependence of the cooling load and indoor air temperature at nighttime on night ventilation flow, the outdoor air temperature, the temperature differences between of indoor air setting and outdoor air is further validated. Our results show that only suitable night ventilation flow with suitable <b>outdoor</b> <b>climates</b> and the appropriate temperature differences between of indoor air setting and outdoor air will benefit most. The present work provides guidance for designing night ventilation...|$|R

40|$|The {{important}} {{variation of}} the urban morphology has direct effects on the disparity of the <b>outdoor</b> <b>climates,</b> as well as indoor climates. In this context, this work aims at answering at the following question: how to simulate, in an operational way, the relation between urban form and climate, at an intermediate scale corresponding to the neighbourhood? Our approach tries to answer to this question, 1 by working at the neighbourhood scale, and by proposing a complete and operational system of morphological indicators of the built environment. These indicators are embedded in a GIS system, baptised “Morphologic”. In this paper, we will focus our attention on the tri-dimensional characteristics of the urban canopy, assimilated to a porous medium with rigid skeleton, and on the three relevant indicators, namely rugosity, porosity, and sinuosity. The possible applications of this system are challenging: analysis of outdoor microclimate, inter- district or inter- city comparisons, or modelling climatic effects of a future urban amenities.

50|$|The {{adaptive}} {{model is}} {{based on the idea that}} <b>outdoor</b> <b>climate</b> influences indoor comfort because humans can adapt to different temperatures during different times of the year. The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors, such as having access to environmental controls, and past thermal history can influence building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. Numerous researchers have conducted field studies worldwide in which they survey building occupants about their thermal comfort while taking simultaneous environmental measurements. Analyzing a database of results from 160 of these buildings revealed that occupants of naturally ventilated buildings accept and even prefer a wider range of temperatures than their counterparts in sealed, air-conditioned buildings because their preferred temperature depends on outdoor conditions. These results were incorporated in the ASHRAE 55-2004 standard as the adaptive comfort model. The adaptive chart relates indoor comfort temperature to prevailing outdoor temperature and defines zones of 80% and 90% satisfaction.|$|E

Others are produced in a container and sometimes as topiary for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly, the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree out of its natural winter dormancy, leaving it little protection when put back outside into a cold <b>outdoor</b> <b>climate.</b> Often Christmas trees are a large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the survival rate of these trees is low. However, when done properly, replanting provides higher survival rates.|$|E
40|$|The {{maintenance}} and repair of ancient buildings and monuments {{is one of the}} most important tasks connected with the preservation of cultural heritage.

Before carrying out repair work or changing climatic conditons at monuments it is absolutely necessary to test the suitability of the renovation campaign. One possibility is testing the suitability for use by simulation methods.

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{performance}} of arbitrary crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules is proposed. The model represents the output power of the module as a function of module temperature and in-plane irradiance, with a number of coefficients to be determined by fitting to measured performance data from indoor or outdoor measurements. The model has been validated using data from three different modules characterised through extensive measurements in <b>outdoor</b> <b>climates</b> over several seasons. The model was then applied to indoor measurement data for 18 different PV modules to investigate the variability in modelled output from different module types. It was found that for a Central European climate the modelled output of the 18 modules varies with a standard deviation (SD) of 1. 22 %, but that the between-module variation is higher at low irradiance (SD of 3. 8 %). The variability between modules of different type is thus smaller than the uncertainty normally found in the total solar irradiation per year for a given site. The model can therefore be used for generalized estimates of PV performance with only a relatively small impact on the overall uncertainty of such estimates resulting from different module types.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters for the durability of wood linings for outdoor exposure is the amount of surface checks that are initiated already in the sawing procedure. The main object for this project is to test the durability under outdoor exposure for wood from two different sawing patterns. At conventional sawing pattern tangential surfaces are exposed, while the star-sawing method gives radial surfaces. The development of cracks and changes in appearance has been investigated on radial and tangential surfaces of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and spruce (Picea abies Karst.) which have been exposed for <b>outdoor</b> <b>climates</b> for 61 months. The annual ring orientation is the most important factor for crack development on weathering. The type of wood and impregnation treatment has only a marginal effect on the crack development. After 61 months of outdoor exposure, tangential surfaces of pine have 1. 7 – 2. 2 times more total crack length per unit area than the corresponding radial surfaces. In spruce, the total crack length on the tangential surfaces is 2. 2 – 2. 6 times greater than on the radial surfaces. Tangential surfaces of both pine and spruce have a greater number of cracks per unit area and wider cracks than the corresponding radial surfaces.

50|$|In {{its more}} passive forms with minimal warming, what season {{extension}} accomplishes {{is to allow}} plants to remain metabolically idle (with very slow growth) but avoid dying. This allows growers to make a conceptual distinction between extending the growing season and extending the harvest season. The reality is a spectrum, and the same farm can do both (on a crop-by-crop or field-by-field basis), but nonetheless these two conceptual poles can be distinguished. The former type of extension is what a hothouse does, such as producing tropical fruit in winter by totally conquering the <b>outdoor</b> <b>climate</b> at high expense. In contrast, the latter type of extension can be viewed not {{as a way to}} escape the context of seasonality entirely but rather, working within the context of seasonality, to achieve food preservation in a way that uses life itself for preservation instead of using technology applied to dead plant or animal tissue (as mechanical refrigeration, freezing, or canning would). From this viewpoint it can even be compared to ancient norms of meat preservation, which relied on the principle that a good way to avoid meat spoilage is to keep the animal alive until just before consumption. In other words, the best postharvest strategy sometimes can be to confine the postharvest period to hours or days instead of weeks or months (by keeping the plant or animal alive as long as possible—the ultimate form of preservation). In the meat example, in preindustrial contexts livestock were brought to market on the hoof, and sailing ships on months-long voyages would keep turtles in forced semihibernation until each one was slaughtered to make a meal.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDesigning energy {{efficient}} and comfortable buildings requires harmonizing the complex interactions of architecture, construction and building service engineering. The building envelope {{has a particular}} importance, since it integrates many functions and has direct influence on indoor climate. Focusing on satisfaction of the user means that the indoor climate is a key for a holistic design approach. Only a satisfied user will not intervene with the designed energy concept or the indoor climate control; dissatisfaction results in multiple system interventions which may cause waste of energy and sometimes even damage to building envelope components. Satisfaction with the indoor environment also increases working productivity or enables effective recreation of residents.

50|$|Cannabis grown is induced into {{flowering}} by decreasing its photoperiod to {{at least}} 10 hours of darkness per day. In order to initiate a flowering response, {{the number of hours}} of darkness must exceed a critical point. Generally the more hours of darkness each day, the shorter the overall flowering period but the lower the yield. Conversely, the fewer hours of darkness each day, the longer the overall flowering period and the higher the yield. Traditionally, most growers change their plants lighting cycle to 12 hours on and 12 hours off since this works as a happy medium to which most strains respond well. This change in photoperiod mimics the plant's natural outdoor cycle, with up to 18 hours of light per day in the summer and down to less than 12 hours of light in fall and winter. Some 'semi-autoflowering' strains that have been bred exclusively for outdoor use, particularly in <b>outdoor</b> <b>climates</b> such as that of the UK, will start flowering with as much as 16-17 hours of light per day. Usually they can start flowering in July and finish far earlier than other strains, particularly those that haven't been bred as outdoor strains. Semi-autoflowering strains can be harvested before the weather in northern latitudes becomes very wet and cold (generally October), whereas other strains are just finishing flowering, and may suffer from botrytis (grey mold) caused by wet weather. Alternatively growers may artificially induce the flowering period during the warmer months by blacking out the plants for 12 hours a day i.e. by covering the plants with black plastic for example, which excludes all light during this period so the plant can flower even during long days.|$|R

The resulting SA@OISP nanospheres have a mean diameter of 65. 2 nm and contained a SA soft core with a mean diameter of approximately 54. 8 nm and an organic inorganic silica precursor (OISP) shell with a thickness of approximately 6 - 10 nm. Furthermore, the prepared CHAR film exhibited a high transmittance and good ruggedness. An average transmittance (T-AV) of 97. 64 % was obtained, and the value is close to the ideal single-layered antireflection coating (98. 09 %) over a broad range of wavelengths (from 380 to 1100 nm).

Two types of nuclear reactor containments were studied, for a BWR reactor and a PWR reactor in Sweden. They both have a thick concrete wall with a steel lining inside, but the BWR containment walls are enclosed in a building, protecting it from the <b>outdoor</b> <b>climate.</b> The PWR containment walls are exposed to outdoor weather conditions. The conditions inside the containment walls include high temperatures, up to around + 50 °C.

By comparing the vapour contents in different points a method was developed {{that can be used for}} predicting the previous and future surface climate at the containment walls. Two major differences between the two types of reactors are the presence of significant temperature gradients between the outer and inner wall surfaces in the PWR reactor that are missing in the BWR reactor and an exposure to <b>outdoor</b> <b>climate</b> of the PWR containment walls. In both types of reactors there are large temperature differences at different levels. The consequences of these conditions are major differences in surface humidity, from below 20 % RH in the upper parts of the BWR containment wall in wintertime to some 70 - 80 % RH in the outer parts of the PWR containment walls.

The ideal ambient temperature for a naked person at rest is about 29 °C, a climatic condition found in the mountain and savannah landscapes of Africa, the probable origin of our ancient ancestors. Without clothing and shelter, man could {{be regarded as a}} tropical animal that can only survive in a narrow zone along the equator. When our forefathers migrated north not only was proper clothing needed but a protective climatic shield also had to be devel-oped: housing and building technology were adapted to very challeng-ing winter climates. Originally, we were also biologically adapted to con-tinuous supplies of fresh outdoor air for breathing and keeping our bod-ies cool. The term “indoor environment ” is a consequence of the need for shelter against wild animals and – as Mankind moved to more weath-er-beaten areas – against unfavourable <b>outdoor</b> <b>climates.</b> Indoor air qual-ity, however, depends on a number of factors, including the outdoor air quality, the amount of fresh air provided indoors and the amount of air pollution derived from numerous indoor sources.

The simulation {{study was conducted}} {{as part of a}} project to develop building envelope assemblies that are energy efficient and durable under extreme cold <b>outdoor</b> <b>climates</b> and indoor conditions typically found in these climes. Energy costs in northern Canada are high especially in the Arctic where communities are accessible only by air or boat or ice roads. Energy efficiency is therefore a primary objective here however this objective must be balanced with transportation and construction costs, which are also high. The objective of the simulation study was to compare the energy performance of proposed high performance wall assemblies with typical baseline wall assemblies. Four high performance walls were compared with two baseline walls, one a wall typical of low latitude regions, and the second a typical arctic wall assembly. Seven locations were selected for analysis, 2 representing western, 2 representing central, and 3 representing eastern arctic conditions. Three buildings were simulated, a fully detached home, a middle unit of a multiunit residence, and an end unit of a multiunit residence. A model for estimating the change in energy consumption with changes in wall thermal conductance was developed. Obviously the most highly insulated wall system exhibits the best performance with respect to space heating consumption. Recommending a wall type was outside the scope of this study but within the scope of the larger project. The objective of this work was to provide a method to easily determine change in space heating consumption due to a change in wall construction, which can then be used as the basis for a total life cycle assessment of the proposed walls.

40|$|Tougher fire {{requirements}} {{and the desire}} to make simpler designs have enabled construction companies to go from the traditional well-ventilated attic to attic with limited ventilation. Theoretically limited ventilated winds should perform well. The problem you see if there is construction moisture or external moisture sources. Problems may occur when the small ventilation is not able to remove moisture to the extent necessary. Heavier constructions usually have a large amount of construction moisture in the attic floor, which can be transferred to the attic space. Heavier structures with limited ventilated attics have not been studied previously. AK Consulting was commissioned to evaluate five attics to a construction company erected in 2014 and 2015. Former investigations showed that there was a risk initially with respect to the excess moisture from building moisture. This study was carried out with theoretical calculations on a model of an existing attic with moisture problems. The present thesis was commissioned by AK Consulting. It evaluated the data and reports from the five attics and assesses them with the help of WUFI BIO and made theoretical calculations in WUFI. The study shows that attics with limited ventilations work well initially and that the ventilation of the attic does not lead to drier attics. Longer measurement periods are required in order to see how the wind works in the long term and in different <b>outdoor</b> <b>climates.</b> It is difficult to determine the effect of initial dehumidification of the winds. The attics have little or no excess moisture over the measurement period. The recommendations are to dehumidify attics initially until further studies have been done on similar structures. It is also important to continue monitoring the attics in this study to follow up how they work in the long term and during years with different climatic conditions...|$|R
