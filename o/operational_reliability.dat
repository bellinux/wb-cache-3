25|$|Serial {{manufacturing}} of the WS-10 {{and integration}} with the J-11, {{proved to be}} more difficult than expected. As a result, even though several related prototypes had been tested and at least one regiment converted to the Taihang powered J-11B version in 2007, these aircraft were later grounded for an extended period due to a poor <b>operational</b> <b>reliability.</b> A report in the Washington Times suggested that the Chinese engines lasted 30 hours before they needed servicing, compared to 400 hours for the Russian versions. Defects were traced back to the engine manufacturer, Shenyang Liming Aircraft Engine Company employing sub-standard manufacturing and quality control procedures. Several subsequent batches temporarily reverted to the original, Russian AL-31F turbofans. The engines manufacturing problems had finally been solved by the end of 2009 and the WS-10A had reportedly proved mature enough to power the Block 02 aircraft.|$|E

40|$|As control {{rooms are}} modernized with new digital systems at nuclear power plants, it is {{necessary}} to evaluate operator performance with these systems as part of a verification and validation process. While there is regulatory and industry guidance for some modernization activities, there are no well defined standard processes or predefined metrics available for assessing what is satisfactory operator interaction with new systems, especially during the early design stages. This paper proposes a framework defining the design process and metrics for evaluating human system interfaces as part of control room modernization. The process and metrics are generalizable to other applications and serve as a guiding template for utilities undertaking their own control room modernization activities. CONTROL ROOM MODERNIZATION Main control room (MCR) modernization is a necessity at nuclear power plants (NPPs).

30|$|In {{the last}} four decades, {{reliability}} evaluation techniques and reliability management strategies have been well developed and studied. These reliability evaluation techniques are more focused on planning and expansion of conventional power systems. However, the fast development and widely utilization of intermittent and fluctuating wind power generation have brought complexities for securing system balancing and maintaining system and customersâ€™ <b>reliabilities</b> during the <b>operational</b> phase. Moreover, {{in the last two}} decades, power systems have been restructured: electric energy and reserve are traded in different correlated markets. The restructuring of power systems has changed reliability management strategies fundamentally. Some existing and widely used criteria e.g., N- 1 criterion {{may or may not be}} suitable for securing the reliable operation of power systems. In this paper, a new technique for assessing <b>operational</b> <b>reliabilities</b> of restructured power systems with high wind power penetration has been developed, which is based on reliability network equivalents and time-sequential simulation approaches. For reducing computational complexities, a simplified method has been developed and utilized in the simulation procedure. The proposed technique can be used to assistant system operator and market participants to assess their risks during system operation and make optimal decisions.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCommercial {{nuclear power}} plants in the United States (U. S.) have {{operated}} reliably and efficiently for decades. With a second 20 -year life extension of operation beyond the plant's original operating licenses now being considered by many utilities, there are opportunities to achieve even greater efficiencies, while maintaining high <b>operational</b> <b>reliabilities,</b> through strategic, risk- and economically-informed, upgrades to plant systems and infrastructure. The U. S. Department of Energy's Light Water Reactor Sustainability (LWRS) program supports the commercial nuclear industry's modernization efforts through research and development (R&D) activities across many areas to help establish the technical and economic bases for modernization activities. The Advanced Instrumentation, Information, and Control Systems Technologies pathway is one R&D focus area for the LWRS program, and has researchers at Idaho National Laboratory working with select utility partners to use human factors and instrumentation and controls R&D to help modernize the plant's main control room. However, some in the nuclear industry have not been as enthusiastic about using human factors R&D to inform life extension decision-making. Part {{of the reason for}} this may stem from uncertainty decision-makers have regarding how human factors fits into the value chain for nuclear power plant control room modernization.
