5|$|In {{the last}} {{fight on the}} {{preliminary}} card, American Kickboxing Academy's Jon Fitch faced Akihiro Gono. The bout saw Fitch continually taking down Gono and landing with ground-and-pound punches on the downed opponent. Fitch came close to submitting Gono {{in the first and}} second rounds when he went for a rear naked choke and an armbar respectively, but he was unable to finish the Japanese fighter. All three judges scored the bout in favor of Fitch, two scoring it 30–27 with <b>one</b> <b>judge</b> seeing it 30–26 giving Fitch the unanimous decision victory.|$|E
5|$|The Shia {{community}} of the Eastern province have a separate legal tradition. Although they follow Sharia, they apply the Shia Jafari school of jurisprudence to it. In 1913, when Abdul Aziz conquered the area, he granted the Shias a separate judiciary for dealing with religious and family law cases: <b>one</b> <b>judge</b> in Qatif, and one in Al-Hasa. This remained the position, with the two judges ministering to a population of around two million, until 2005 {{when the number of}} judges was increased to seven. For all other areas of law, the Shia community are {{under the jurisdiction of the}} regular Sunni courts.|$|E

If <b>one</b> <b>judge</b> or justice {{disagreed}} with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend, and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practiceas required by the Judiciary Act of 1793was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. After 1802, in cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions {{were less likely to be}} resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit-riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E

40|$|Can’t <b>one</b> truly <b>judge</b> that <b>one</b> is <b>judging?</b> Matthew Soteriou {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} authoritatively knowing one’s own mental acts which depends on a surprising assumption: <b>One</b> cannot truly <b>judge</b> that <b>one</b> is <b>judging.</b> After briefly criticizing his account of one’s awareness that <b>one</b> is <b>judging,</b> I critically scrutinize two of his arguments against the possibility of truly <b>judging</b> that <b>one</b> is <b>judging.</b> Firstly, assuming such a possibility leads to a regress. Secondly, the second-order judgement inevitably replaces the first-order judgement such as to make the former wrong. Matthew Soteriou (2005) has provided a thorough analysis of our intuitive claims to be directly and authoritatively aware of our own mental activity. Soteriou opposes non-occurrent belief and conscious judgement. The latter is a mental act, the former is not. Conscious judgement is identified with occurrent belief (Soteriou 2005, 96). While one can have a non-occurrent belief that one is believing that p despite not believing that p, one’s non-occurrent belief that <b>one</b> is now <b>judging</b> that p cannot be subject to such a mistake. Whenever <b>one</b> is <b>judging</b> that p, <b>one</b> has a non-occurrent belief that <b>one</b> is <b>judging</b> that p (Soteriou 2005, 95). Whenever one has a non-occurrent belief that <b>one</b> is <b>judging</b> that p, this belief cannot be false...|$|R

From 1997 to 1998, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won almost all the UK awards judged by children, {{but none of the}} children's book awards judged by adults, and Sandra Beckett suggested the reason was intellectual snobbery towards books that were popular among children. In 1999, the winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year award children's division was entered {{for the first time on}} the shortlist for the main award, and <b>one</b> <b>judge</b> threatened to resign if Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was declared the overall winner; it finished second, very close behind the winner of the poetry prize, Seamus Heaney's translation of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.|$|E
5|$|Eduard Peter Nicolaas Stibbe, known also as Eddy Stibbe, {{competed for}} the Netherlands Antilles as its only equestrian athlete. Stibbe competed in {{individual}} eventing. Born in 1948 in 's-Hertogenbosch, Stibbe first competed, aged 23, in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, riding the horse Autumn Flash and representing the Netherlands. He returned {{at the age}} of 43 to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, riding Olympic Bahlua on the Netherlands' behalf. At age 51, Stibbe represented the Netherlands Antilles {{for the first time at}} the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia on horse Eton, finishing his event for the first time. He returned again to the Olympics {{at the age of}} 55, riding horse Dusky Moon, for his fourth Olympic appearance and sixth Olympic event. On August 16, Stibbe faced 74 other athletes during the dressage portion of the event. The Dutch Antillean competitor accrued 57.80 penalty points but was awarded 62.40 points by <b>one</b> <b>judge</b> and 61.20 points by another, tying Jaroslav Hatla of the Czech Republic for 38th place. During the August 17 cross-country phase of the event, Stibbe accrued 49.20 penalty points (20 from jumping, 29.20 from time), finishing the race in 10:59. This placed him at 60th place of the 71 athletes who advanced to the cross-country round. Overall, at this point, Eddy Stibbe's combined point values placed him at 58th place.|$|E
5|$|Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the United States circuit {{courts were}} {{composed}} of a stationary United States district court judge and any two Supreme Court justices riding circuit. If <b>one</b> <b>judge</b> or justice disagreed with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend (as was authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1793), and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practice was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. Following a brief intermezzo with the soon-repealed Midnight Judges Act of 1801 (which briefly abolished circuit riding), under the Judiciary Act of 1802, the circuit courts were {{composed of a}} stationary district judge and one Supreme Court justice assigned to the circuit. But, a single judge (either the district judge or the circuit rider) could preside alone. In cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions {{were less likely to be}} resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E
