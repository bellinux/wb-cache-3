Ferroboron (15% boron) {{is used to}} introduce boron into steel; nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and case hardening compositions for the engineering industry. Alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. Germanium forms many alloys, most importantly with the coinage metals.|$|E
5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study of the solid and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth.

5|$|Novello printed an Octavo {{edition of}} the D major Magnificat in 1874, using a {{translation}} to English which John Troutbeck based on the text in The Book of Common Prayer. In 1880, when Bach's autographs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> were already kept in the Royal Library (later State Library) of Berlin, Philipp Spitta devoted many pages to the Magnificat in his Bach-biography, considering it {{recognized as one of}} the greatest achievements of the composer's genius.

5|$|The {{general area}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> {{of the early}} Upanishads is {{considered}} as northern India. The region is bounded on the west by the upper Indus valley, on the east by lower Ganges region, on the north by the Himalayan foothills, and on the south by the Vindhya mountain range. Scholars are reasonably sure that the early Upanishads were produced at the geographical center of ancient Brahmanism, comprising the regions of Kuru-Panchala and Kosala-Videha together with the areas immediately {{to the south and}} west of these. This region covers modern Bihar, Nepal, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, eastern Rajasthan, and northern Madhya Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{main goal}} of the Liber was to {{document}} the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to {{the property of the}} church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the Liber should be seen as a working document, compiled {{for the use of the}} bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The Liber was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E

5|$|Etty was {{a regular}} attender at the Royal Academy's life class {{throughout}} his career. Nyssia stands in a pose which Etty had sketched many times, that {{of a woman with}} her knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a hanging rope. (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose the obscure subject of the painting as a pretext to paint a woman in this pose. As with many Etty works the female figure has a far better finish {{than the rest of the}} canvas, and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> later in a studio.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, {{writing as}} Major Harold Ridley FRCS RAMC, the English {{ophthalmic}} surgeon published a short {{paper in the}} British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its head from the grass and forcibly spat venom toward the man's right eye from a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured {{that in the future}} diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Chéreau staged Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen at the Bayreuth Festival to {{celebrate}} the festival's centenary, termed the Jahrhundertring. The production, celebrating 100 years after Wagner's work had been performed {{for the first time}} as a cycle at the first Bayreuth Festival, became known as the Jahrhundertring (Centenary Ring). Chéreau collaborated with conductor Pierre Boulez, who had recommended him to the festival direction. The French team revolutionised the understanding of Wagner in Germany, as music critic Eleonore Büning wrote in her obituary in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Chéreau set the scene in the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition,</b> with a critical view of the time's capitalism, industrialism and spiritual background. As Büning and others pointed out, the staging left a standard for productions of the Ring Cycle to follow. Gerhard R. Koch mentioned in his obituary that the unity of direction, scene and light was new for Bayreuth and suggested a critical view on capitalism heading towards fascism.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a focal point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition.</b> The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; {{it had not been}} present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, and finally a wife in The Little White Girl. At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion to the Christian sacrament of marriage, which lends a religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E

5|$|Reported values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> and {{concentrations}} of trace metals and minerals in Boletus edulis tend to differ considerably, as the mushroom bioaccumulates different elements to varying degrees, and the element {{concentration in the}} fruit bodies is often {{a reflection of the}} element concentration of the soils from which they were picked. In general, B.edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium (1317 ppm), a trace mineral essential for good health, though the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low. Whole fruit bodies also contain 4.7μg of vitamin D2 per 100g dry weight. The relatively high ergosterol content (see next section) of the fruit bodies can make the mushroom nutritionally pragmatic for vegetarians and vegans, who would otherwise have a limited intake of vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, {{and different}} sulphur compounds, with no agreement on {{which may be}} primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.|$|E
5|$|The 1499 Madonna {{panel is}} a free adaption, in that the artist has changed and repositioned a number of elements. However, art historians usually agree that they are to the {{detriment}} of the balance and impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition.</b> The panel attributed to Gossaert shows even more significant, though perhaps more successful, alterations, including shifting the centre of balance by adding a section to the right-hand side, dressing the Virgin entirely in dark blue and changing her facial features. Both copies omit the two pools of bright light on the floor across from her, thus removing the mystical element of van Eyck's original, perhaps because its significance was not grasped by the later artists. That Gossaert followed other aspects of the original so closely, however, is evidence of the high regard he held for van Eyck's technical and aesthetic ability, and his version has been seen by some as a homage. The Master of 1499's admiration for van Eyck can be seen in his left-hand panel, which contains many features reminiscent of van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, including the rendering of the ceiling beams and the colour and texture of the red fabrics.|$|E

5|$|The Sun {{inherited}} its {{chemical composition}} from {{the interstellar medium}} out of which it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and the heavier elements were produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in generations of stars that completed their stellar evolution and returned their material to the interstellar medium before {{the formation of the}} Sun. The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> of the primordial Solar System. However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere. Therefore, in today's photosphere the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). The protostellar Sun's composition {{is believed to have been}} 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{source for}} the composition is a copied manuscript dated 1768, therefore the date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> is not certain. Research leads to a funeral of a former mayor of Mühlhausen on 16 September 1708. The text is a carefully compiled juxtaposition of biblical texts, three quotations from the Old Testament and four from the New Testament, combined with funeral hymns, of which two are sung and one is quoted instrumentally, and some additions by an anonymous author. Bach scored the work for four vocal parts and a small ensemble of Baroque instruments, two recorders, two violas da gamba and continuo. The work is opened by an instrumental Sonatina, followed by through-composed sections which have been assigned to three movements. The structure is symmetrical around a turning point, when the lower voices, who contemplate the Old Covenant, are overcome by a soprano calling for Jesus.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Early Netherlandish painters did not usually {{pay much attention to}} landscape backgrounds. They were often included, showing strong influence from the Italian painters, but typically as minor elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>composition,</b> seen in the far distance and lacking any real observation of nature. This diptych, however, contains {{one of the most memorable}} landscape backgrounds in Northern 15th-century art. The panoramic view of Jerusalem extends upwards in the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The sky, which continues to the upper part of the right hand panel, is rendered in deep blues and lined with cumulus clouds. These clouds are similar to those in the Ghent Altarpiece and, as in that work, are included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape. The sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the panel captures the moment of Jesus' death. Faint cirrus clouds can be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.|$|E
