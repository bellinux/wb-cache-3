Although Dent became a Red Sox demon, the Red Sox would get retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their manager during a series at Fenway Park.|$|E

25|$|Boston {{began the}} playoffs by {{sweeping}} the AL West champion Anaheim Angels. The Red Sox {{blew out the}} Angels 9–3 in Game 1, scoring 7 of those runs in the fourth inning. However, the Sox' 2003 off season prize pickup Curt Schilling suffered a torn tendon when {{he was hit by}} a line drive. The injury was exacerbated when Schilling fielded a ball rolling down the first base line. The second game, pitched by Pedro Martínez, stayed close until Boston scored four in the ninth to win 8–3. In game three, what looked to be a blowout {{turned out to be a}} nail-biter, as Vladimir Guerrero hit a grand slam <b>off</b> <b>Mike</b> Timlin in the top of the seventh inning to tie it at six.

25|$|On April 21 {{against the}} San Francisco Giants, he hit three {{home runs and}} had six RBI in a single game. In the 3rd inning off Giants pitcher Dom Zanni, Demeter hit the first ever inside-the-park home run at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The next inning saw another home run, this time <b>off</b> <b>Mike</b> McCormick and to deep left. Demeter capped off the {{performance}} by hitting a game winning walk-off two-run {{home run in the}} bottom of the 11th inning off Al Worthington to win the game 9-7. It was the only game of his career where Don had an inside-the-park or walk-off home run. Don was the first Dodger to hit three home runs in a single game since Snider did it four years prior on June 1, 1955 at Ebbets Field. As of July 2009, only 22 players in the history of the majors since 1900 had three home runs in a single game during their rookie season. Demeter was the 1st Dodger and 9th overall to accomplish the feat, sharing the accomplishment with hall-of-famers Eddie Mathews and Mickey Cochrane. The next morning, a photographer got Demeter out of bed at 5 in the morning to take photos for an afternoon Los Angeles newspaper.|$|E

25|$|The England v India {{series in}} 1979 took {{place after the}} World Cup ended and four Tests were played. England won the first at Edgbaston by an innings and 83 runs after opening with a massive total of 633 for five declared. Botham scored 33 and then took two for 86 and five for 70. On {{the first day of}} the second Test at Lord's, Botham swept through the Indian batting with five for 35 and a catch <b>off</b> <b>Mike</b> Hendrick to dismiss them for only 96 in 56 overs. Surprisingly, however, India {{recovered}} to salvage a draw. In the third Test at Headingley, it was Botham the batsman who did the business, scoring 137 from 152 balls in England's first innings total of 270 (the next highest innings was 31 by Geoff Boycott). The match was ruined by the weather and was drawn. In the final Test at The Oval, England opened with 305 (Botham 38); India replied with 202 (Botham four for 65); and England with 334 for eight declared (Botham run out for a duck) extended their lead to 437 with four sessions remaining. Thanks to a brilliant 221 by Sunil Gavaskar, India came agonisingly close to pulling off a remarkable last day victory but ran out of time on 429 for eight (Botham three for 97), just nine runs short, and so England won the series 1–0 with three draws.|$|E

Homer believes that Lisa {{needs to do}} what is good to the team, while Marge thinks she should reconsider, since the family comes first. Under Lisa's leadership, the team advances to the championship against Capital City. On the day of the game, Marge takes Bart to an amusement park; while they ride the roller coaster, Lisa calls Bart to beg for his help, but he brushes her <b>off.</b> <b>Mike</b> Scioscia, manager of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, pops up in the seats behind Marge and Bart and tells him that the best players listen to their managers, pointing out his three World Series wins [...] two as player, one as manager. Marge takes Bart to the game, which is now in its last inning with the Isotots down 11-10. Bart puts aside his differences with Lisa and offers to pinch-run from first base, then ignores her signs and steals both second and third. As he begins to steal home, Lisa realizes the odds are vastly against him, then decides to ignore the numbers and cheer him on anyway. He is tagged out at the plate, costing the Isotots their championship bid, but Lisa thanks him for helping her learn to love baseball as a game, and the team cheers them for resolving their differences.|$|E
