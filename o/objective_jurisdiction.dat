40|$|Whether {{complying}} with {{federal or state}} regulations or addressing local vital watershed protection/restoration <b>objectives,</b> local <b>jurisdictions</b> are confronted with {{the daunting task of}} developing, administering and funding complex effective multi-objective stormwater management programs, Today’s comprehensive stormwater program not only has to deal with runoff quantity and quality control but, may also have to address such complicated issues as ecosystem restoration, combined sewer overflow reduction, fisheries protection, potable surface/ground water source protection, and wetland, riparian buffer and stream protection. As our understanding of the technical and practical limitations of conventional stormwater management technology has increased over the past two decades, and as watershed protection objectives have changed, many jurisdictions have begun to question the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of conventional stormwater approaches in meeting today’s complex environmental/water resources objectives. Older communities with existing extensive stormwater management infrastructures are also struggling with the economic reality of funding the high costs of maintenance, inspection, enforcement and public outreach necessary to support an expanding and aging infrastructure. Still more challenging are the exceptionally high costs of retrofitting existing urban development using conventional stormwater management end-of-pipe practices to restore and protect receiving waters and living resources. With growing concerns about the limitations of conventional technology and to address the changing objectives o...|$|R

Virologic surveillance provides the foundation from which this information can be obtained. However, morbidity and mortality data are needed to better understand the burden of disease, which, in turn, can provide useful information for policy makers relevant to the allocation of resources for prevention and control efforts. Data on the impact of influenza can be used to identify groups at increased risk for severe influenza-related complications, develop prevention and control policies, and monitor the effect of these policies. Influenza surveillance systems frequently monitor outpatient illness, hospitalizations, and deaths, but selection of influenza surveillance components should be based on the surveillance goals and <b>objectives</b> of the <b>jurisdiction.</b> 19496841 PMC 463452...|$|R

These programmes take {{a variety of forms}} and often exist to satisfy a number of <b>objectives.</b> In some <b>jurisdictions,</b> they play a significant funding role. Even in countries where retail borrowing programmes play a small role, they are in many cases politically important because they satisfy primarily social objectives. In recent years, some OECD countries have begun to reconsider their retail borrowing programmes. Shrinking borrowing requirements in a number of countries have led to priority being put on maintaining liquid wholesale markets. Other countries continue to see benefits from their retail borrowing programmes and use them as a significant and stable source of funding. These governments are often innovative at finding ways to drive down administration costs, such as through the use of new electronic distribution channels and total dematerialisation of securities. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Objectives</b> Many <b>jurisdictions</b> {{are moving}} toward greater public {{involvement}} in health technology assessment (HTA) processes. This study aims to provide a broad, cross-sectional indication of the extent and methods of public engagement in HTA, {{with a focus on}} which public are engaged, by what mechanisms, and the purpose of public engagement. Methods An international Web-based survey of 217 organizations involved in HTA was undertaken. Contact e-mail addresses for targeted organizations were identified from the Internet. Results Individuals from 39 (18 %) of the contacted organizations completed a survey. The majority (67 %) of responding HTA organizations undertake public engagement activities, predominantly involving lay representatives of organized groups (81 %), {{and to a lesser extent}} individual patients/consumers (54 %) or citizens/community members (54 %). For organizations undertaking public engagement, mechanisms based on communication or consultation were the most common, although some organizations have used or intend to use participatory approaches, particularly the Citizens’ Jury (8 %) or Consensus Council (20 %) methods. Respondents identified with a number of rationales and barriers for undertaking public engagement. Conclusions This survey provides further insight into the public engagement approaches that are used by HTA organizations in practice. In particular, it suggests a limited adoption of participatory methods to date, and interest in the use of social media. Study findings require further confirmation, due to limitations related to survey response. There is considerable opportunity for further research into pragmatic, robust, and meaningful approaches to public engagement to strengthen HTA policy and decision-making frameworks. An agenda for future research evolving from the survey responses is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Many {{cetacean}} {{species are}} susceptible to mortality or serious injury from vessel collisions. Spatially explicit assessments of risk per whale can help identify potential problem areas to guide appropriate mitigation measures. Canada’s Pacific waters host high cetacean densities and intense maritime traffic, {{and the issue of}} vessel collisions has taken on a high priority in British Columbia (BC) recently due to several major industrial development applications. Spatially-explicit statistical modelling and Geographic Information System (GIS) visualisation techniques identified areas of overlap between shipping activity and waters used by humpback, fin and killer whales. Areas of highest risk were far removed from areas with highest concentrations of people, suggesting that many beach-cast carcasses could go undetected. With few exceptions, high-risk areas were found in geographic bottlenecks, such as narrow straits and passageways. Port expansion and a proposed pipeline for carrying oil from Alberta to BC’s north coast (with associated oil tanker traffic) would increase ship strike risk for all three species. The risk assessments illustrate where ship strikes are most likely to occur, but cannot estimate how many strikes occur. Propeller wounds on live killer whales are common in the region, and fatal collisions have been reported in BC for all three species. Procedures were used to estimate potential mortality limits in accordance {{with a wide range of}} quantitative management <b>objectives</b> from <b>jurisdictions</b> around the world. While the extent of under-reporting of ship strikes has not been evaluated, the few known cases of collisions involving fin whales suggest that mortality due to ship strike for this species may already be approaching or even exceeding mortality limits under the most risk-averse management objectives. It is hoped that risk maps may infor...|$|R
40|$|<b>Objective</b> While many <b>jurisdictions</b> internationally now require learner {{drivers to}} {{complete}} a specified number of hours of supervised driving practice before being able to drive unaccompanied, very few require learner drivers {{to complete a}} log book to record this practice and then present it to the licensing authority. Learner drivers in most Australian jurisdictions must complete a log book that records their practice thereby confirming to the licensing authority that they have met the mandated hours of practice requirement. These log books facilitate the management and enforcement of minimum supervised hours of driving requirements. Method Parents of learner drivers in two Australian states, Queensland and New South Wales, completed an online survey assessing a range of factors, including {{their perceptions of the}} accuracy of their child’s learner log book and the effectiveness of the log book system. Results The study indicates that the large majority of parents believe that their child’s learner log book is accurate. However, they generally report that the log book system is only moderately effective as a system to measure the number of hours of supervised practice a learner driver has completed. Conclusions The {{results of this study suggest}} the presence of a paradox with many parents possibly believing that others are not as diligent in the use of log books as they are or that the system is too open to misuse. Given that many parents report that their child’s log book is accurate, this study has important implications for the development and ongoing monitoring of hours of practice requirements in graduated driver licensing systems...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 Contradictory {{management}} <b>objectives</b> {{in adjacent}} <b>jurisdictions</b> can affect transboundary wolves and their associated socio-ecological systems. Elite interviews and case study methodology {{were used in}} this thesis to explore three transboundary wolf management agreements, their effectiveness, and their impacts on wolves, ecosystems and stakeholders. Separate agreements between the State of Alaska and: Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, and Denali National Park and Preserve, and an agreement between Italy and Switzerland show that despite a diversity of socio-ecological contexts, approaches, and hierarchical level of actors, transboundary wolf agreements are prone to ephemerality. The ephemerality of these agreements appears to be due primarily to institutional path dependency, and to political tension between management entities. The impacts of these agreements and their cessation, on socio-ecological systems are limited by the agreements' limited scopes. The agreements do however figure incrementally into larger trends, especially including changes in rural and urban identities, and in large carnivore management discourse. I argue that a diversity of wolf management approaches across a landscape, and the inherent conflict between management entities preserves adaptive capacity by preventing {{one size fits all}} prescriptions based on incomplete knowledge. Assuming no acute state of emergency, incremental rather than transformational change is more equitable to diverse stakeholders; allowing public perception, policy, and scientific knowledge to shift concurrently. The cases also suggest that facilitating trans-entity conversation and coordination at multiple levels would support understanding, and increase the prevalence of creative agreements contributing to amenable, incremental change. Landscape Conservation Cooperatives are put forth as a potential platform or template for this facilitation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the legality review of secondary rules in Italy. In {{the era of}} the vast administrative state there are numerous situations in which some activities are covered by rules emanating from government, departments of state or other governmental agencies. They are like a delegate is invited to stand in the shoes of the legislature. Governmental rules have two-fold nature. Regulations, on the one hand, are sources of law similar to primary legislation. On the other hand, secondary rules are administrative instruments that supplement the executive power, that is, they are an inherent feature of public authority. The twofold nature affects the legality review. Secondary rules may not be reviewed by the Constitutional Court. Although regulations are legislative instruments, their administrative set-up {{plays a key role in}} the application of procedural rules. Indeed, the judicial review of secondary rules is up to administrative courts, which can intervene mainly after a regulation is challenged. Because of this flexibility, administrative judicial proceedings are suitable for challenging regulations on account of the hybrid nature of regulations, which are halfway between legislative instruments and tools inherent in the exercise of public authority. The aim of this article is to demonstrate how administrative law courts seized with the review of regulations. The judicial review by administrative courts appears to be quite similar to that of the Constitutional Court, as it is modeled after an <b>objective</b> approach to <b>jurisdiction.</b> Judges must disapply regulations that infringe laws and they can adjust themselves to and admit of innovative approaches...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the identification and analysis of the policy objectives of US antitrust and EU competition law, with particular reference to the hardcore vertical restrictions, absolute territorial protection (ATP) and minimum resale price maintenance (RPM). It does not critique the identified policy objectives as such, but it does critique the underlying economic principles through which they are interpreted to assess whether the US and EU legal positions on the hardcore restrictions are logically justifiable. As such, two chapters are dedicated to the identification of the objectives of US antitrust policy and EU competition policy, respectively. This is done through analysis of their legal development, and political and historical context. They conclude that the promotion of consumer welfare has become the sole objective of US antitrust policy, but that EU competition policy has retained a multifaceted set of objectives, including the protection of market integration and the promotion of effective competition, as well as the welfare objectives the EU has adopted more recently. The final chapter assesses whether the US and EU legal positions on the hardcore vertical restrictions are logically justified by the policy <b>objectives</b> of each <b>jurisdiction</b> identified in the previous chapters. It considers the development of the legal positions in detail, and goes on to critique the economic analysis of vertical restraints under which the restrictions have been considered. It concludes that the EU justifies its absolute prohibition of both hardcore restrictions under its multifaceted set of competition policy objectives, but that the US can only logically justify its rule of reason for ATP under the sole objective of consumer welfare, while minimum RPM should have continued to be subject to per se illegality. The Leegin decision to permit minimum RPM subject to a rule of reason relied on flawed analysis of its economic effects...|$|R
40|$|Taxation {{methods are}} {{increasingly}} being used as tools to achieve environmental objectives, though the risks of ill-conceived environmental taxes are severe. The thesis offers lawmakers and policymakers guidance as to choices of tax measures, and how such methods can be utilised effectively, by exploring the various issues and decisions facing policymakers in the introduction of such methods. It does this by investigating means by which environmental taxes can be effective in changing consumption choices and behaviour towards the environment, which requires an examination {{of a series of}} pertinent issues which any policymaker is advised to respond to before implementing such tax methods; such as how the environment can be valued and how to decide which taxpayers should bear the burden of environmental taxation. The overarching objective for the thesis is to set out a design for a universal legal model for environmental taxation, and question whether this model can be utilised by policymakers to achieve environmental <b>objectives</b> in any <b>jurisdiction.</b> The findings of all chapters will contribute to the purposeful design of such a model. This initially requires a fundamental examination of the nature of tax itself, before considering the concept and utility of tax incentivisation. The thesis then questions whether a tax can philosophically be considered an ‘environmental tax’, and seeks to distinguish this from revenue-raising measures through its behaviour-changing functions. The design of such taxation is then considered, with the aim of achieving maximum benefits at minimum cost. In considering a variety of methods to achieve environmental policy, the thesis will identify methods to target environmental problems efficiently and in a manner which will prevent unintended consequences such as loss of competitiveness or other social ills. It is intended that the findings will be useful initially in contributing to the knowledge in this field, but further the answer to the overall thesis may help tackle the greatest challenge facing mankind in our time.

40|$|Examining Board: Professor Loïc Azoulai, European University Institute Professor Marise Cremona, European University Institute (Supervisor) Professor Christophe Hillion, Leiden University Professor Daniel Thym, University of Konstanz. Defence date: 3 June 2013 Constitutions {{of today}} do not merely address the salus populi anymore, {{the welfare of}} the people, but {{increasingly}} exhibit international ambitions. This is true in particular for the EU Treaties. To make sense of these developments, this thesis presents a comprehensive account of foreign policy objectives as a growing part of European constitutional law. It grasps these provisions as legal norms, discerns their legal force and functions, and situates them into the overall legal order of the state, the Union, and the composite 'European Constitutional Space’. It argues that for comparative constitutional law in general, the codification of foreign policy objectives suggests a step forward {{in the evolution of the}} role of the constitution: From limiting public authority to guiding it towards certain goals, both at home and in the world. For the EU in particular, this research advances a comparative constitutional perspective for the study of EU external relations, and adds a constitutional dimension to the 'normative power’ debate in the study of EU foreign policy. Drawing on established national doctrines on constitutional objectives from Germany, France and India, the thesis elaborates a common vocabulary for understanding foreign policy <b>objectives</b> across different <b>jurisdictions.</b> It adapts these findings to the pluralist context of the Union and its Member States, which closely intertwines both legal orders and foreign policies. It reveals that constitutional foreign policy objectives represent norms of constitutional rank which commit a polity to an active and 'normative’ foreign policy, serving principally as an interpretive lens through which public powers can be enlarged. As a feature peculiar to the EU context, such objectives help to channel the individual ambitions of the Member States through the Union framework towards a more coherent, albeit polyphonic, external action. Furthermore, the project feeds its legal findings into the debate on the EU as an actor in International Relations, drawing on the main IR theories to sharpen the analysis of these norms in inter-institutional struggles as well in long-term processes of identity-shaping, legitimation and socialization...|$|R
40|$|In 1994 the Tasmanian State Government {{finalised}} a {{suite of}} legislation, the Resource Management and Planning System (hereafter called the System), in response to pressures resulting from the State's past problems and conflicts associated with economic development and environmental management. In this dissertation examples of these problems and conflicts, their underlying circumstances, and {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the environment protection and land-use planning legislation applicable at that time are examined. These pressures induced a reform process involving a change in political attitudes towards environmental management, and a complete review of the legislation, culminating in the formulation of the new System. The reform process, and the objectives, structure, instruments and processes of the System are explained. The System is intended to incorporate into resource management and planning decisions the principles of sustainable development. Using the principles, objectives, and proposed measures for achieving sustainable development which emerged from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the author has deductively constructed a benchmark concept for sustainable development relevant to Tasmania. The System is assessed in terms of the degree to which it has incorporated of these principles and its potential to facilitate their objectives. In addition, the System is assessed for its potential means to avert or resolve a recurrence of Tasmania's past development and environmental management problems and conflicts. Assessment shows that all the principles of sustainable development considered relevant to Tasmania are incorporated within the System either explicitly or, occasionally, by generous interpretation. Notwithstanding their incorporation, the principles are sometimes poorly defined, and can be expected to generally diminish the System's outcomes. I argue that the potential for the System to facilitate the objectives of sustainable development is substantial, but is diminished by ambiguities in the System's own <b>objectives,</b> its limited <b>jurisdiction,</b> a lack of obligation on decision-makers to adhere to those objectives, and the absence or incompleteness of planning instruments and processes. The System could offer effective means for addressing Tasmania's development and environmental management problems and conflicts. The principal obstacles to this potential are its restricted jurisdiction, and the absence of a formal regional planning mechanism. The realisation of this potential greatly depends on the quality of Ministerial, and therefore political, decision-making required by the System, the level of leadership given to promoting the System's objectives, and an adequate level of resourcing. The assessment of the System undertaken here concludes with an overview of the lessons learned from Tasmania's experience in formulating and implementing a resource management and planning system intended to facilitate the objectives of sustainability. These lessons include the significant benefits resulting from a comprehensive consultation process with all stakeholders, the need for adequate education in relation to the System's objectives and processes for those using the System, and the shortcomings in the System's instruments and processes...|$|R
40|$|A visão tradicional com que a doutrina processual enquadra a função jurisdicional não mais se compatibiliza com os anseios da nossa sociedade, principalmente, com o Estado Constitucional Democrático de Direito, sendo imperioso que se reflita sobre a nova postura do juiz diante dos conflitos que lhe são impostos, bem como a própria concepção do que seja Direito e qual sua precípua função dentro das comunidades contemporâneas. Dessa forma, a idéia de que a jurisdição deve-se limitar a desvelar a vontade da lei o caso concreto, quer pela sua atuação em específico, quer criando a norma {{individual}} para o caso em exame, compondo a lide de forma justa, não pode prevalecer ante os desafios que a Constituição impõe ao Poder Público com o fito de implementar os direitos e garantias fundamentais do cidadão, dentre eles, o direito a um pleno acesso à Justiça em caso de qualquer ameaça ou violação a direito, ou seja, um direito fundamental à tutela jurisdicional protetiva dos direitos. Por outro lado, somente se atingirá um resultado eficaz esse sentido, se houver radicalmente uma mudança da própria função que o Direito deve assumir a sociedade contemporânea e, notadamente, a sua interpretação e aplicação, sem que o mesmo se limite à operação formal de que a lei é a solução para todos os casos. Analisa-se, desse modo, a evolução dos princípios em todas as suas nuanças de modo a destacar sua convivência regular com as regras, todavia, demonstra-se que o exegeta precisa não só conhecer a essência destes, mas procurar extrair a sua máxima eficácia, principalmente os constitucionais, que irradiam suas vontades sobre as demais, contudo deve ecessariamente atribuir sentido a eles em cada caso concreto, pois texto e norma são coisas distintas. Assim, ao se tratar da cognominada nova hermenêutica, que tem suas raízes constitucionais, verifica-se a desnecessidade, como pensam alguns, de abandonar a hermenêutica clássica, pois ambas possuem métodos que podem conviver em harmonia e são extremamente necessárias para a concretização dos pilares constitucionais e, por conseguinte, a prevalência dos seus valores o ordenamento jurídico. Com a nova realidade, de uma sociedade pluralista e baseada no imanente escopo de realização dos direitos fundamentais, torna-se indispensável o surgimento de um cabedal instrumental de técnicas interpretativas que não só compreendam o sentido das normas, mas, quando necessário, concretizem de plano seu comando, da do sentido ao caso específico banindo-se a idéia de que a interpretação se subsume a reprodução de uma vontade preestabelecida, respeitando, por outro lado, a separação dos poderes e principalmente o princípio democrático. Para tanto, o hermeneuta tem que, inarredavelmente, assumir novos compromissos a fim de que a jurisdição possa ser eficaz para o seu desiderato de efetivamente tutelar os direitos. Nesse sentido, é importante que a jurisdição constitucional, em razão do princípio da supremacia constitucional, passe a ser uma constante em toda operação da atividade jurisdicional, eis que todos os meios de interpretação, em sentido amplo, têm como escopo a manutenção da estrutura constitucional, que deve ser compreendida como o lócus hermenêutico, tudo para que as necessidades de direito material, em cada caso concreto, sejam asseguradas. The traditional vision {{with that}} the procedural doctrine fits the jurisdictional function not more makes {{compatible with the}} yearnings of our society, mainly with the Democratic Constitutional State being imperious the reflection about the new posture of the judge before the conflicts which he has to handle {{with as well as}} the conception of what is Law and which is your main function inside of the contemporary communities. In this way, the idea that the jurisdiction must be limited to show the will of the law in the concrete case, for an specific case or creating the individual rule for the case in examination, solving the conflict in a fair way cannot prevail before the challenges that the Constitution imposes to the Public Power with the objective to implement the rights and basic guarantees of the citizen, amongst they, the right of a full access to Justice in case of any threat or violation of rights, that is, a fundamental to the jurisdictional protection of rights. On the other hand, an efficient result in this direction will only be reached if a radical change of the function of Law must assume in the contemporary society and remarkable in its interpretation and application without limitation to the formal idea that the law is the solution for all the cases. One analyzes, in this way, the evolution of the principles in all its nuances in order to detach its regular acquaintance with rules. However, one demonstrates that exegete not only needs to know their essence, but try to extract its maximum effectiveness, mainly the constitutional ones, that radiate its wills on the others. Although must necessarily attribute meaning to them in each concrete case, because text and rule are distinct things. Thus, dealing with the so called new hermeneutics, that has its constitutional roots, one verifies unnecessaryness, as some think, to abandon the classic hermeneutics because both possess methods that can coexist in harmony and are extremely necessary for the concretion of constitutional basis and, therefore, the prevalence of its values in the legal system. In the new reality, of a society pluralist and based in the immanent objective of accomplish the basic rights, its necessary the sprouting of one instrumental tradition of interpretive techniques that not only understand the meaning of rule, but, when necessary, realize immediately your order giving sense to the specific case banishing the idea that interpretation is under a present will respecting, on the other hand, the separation of powers and, - 9 - mainly, the democratic principle. For in such a way, the hermeneutics scholar has to sturdily assume new commitments with the <b>objective</b> that <b>jurisdiction</b> can be efficient for its desire of effectively protect the rights. In this way, {{it is important that the}} constitutional jurisdiction, in reason of the principle of the constitutional supremacy, pass to be a constant in all operation of the jurisdictional activity, therefore all the ways of lato sensu interpretation have as target the maintenance of the constitutional structure, that must be understood as the hermeneutic lócus; all this to assure the needs of the material right in the concrete case...|$|R
