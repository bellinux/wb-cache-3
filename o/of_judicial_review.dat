5|$|Due to {{the limited}} form <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> {{available}} under the ISA, whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs. This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes? – who guards the guardians? If preventive detention is applied illegitimately {{in a manner that}} cripples lawful democratic opposition, the absence <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> would preclude the exposure of such abuse. It has been submitted that the voice of public opinion is most suited for this purpose.|$|E

40|$|Essays in {{commemoration}} of the seventieth birthday of Professor Osanai SatoruModern constitutional law has developed various means of supervising and guaranteeing the effective implementation of the constitution. The principal means <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> control <b>of</b> constitutionality is <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the constitutionality of legislation enacted by Parliament, or constitutional <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> This has become a dominant feature of modern constitutionalism, and recent decades have seen a global expansion <b>of</b> such <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> mechanisms. This article considers the phenomenon and institution <b>of</b> constitutional <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> from historical and comparative perspectives. The different models, structures and forms <b>of</b> constitutional <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> are discussed {{with reference to the}} historical contexts in which they have evolved, their modes of operation and their underlying rationales. The possible tension between constitutional <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> and democracy is also considered. preprin...|$|R
25|$|A special {{aspect of}} the High Court's {{original}} jurisdiction is its <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> jurisdiction. This jurisdiction is implied rather than expressly stated in any statute. The Court exercises two types <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> review: <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> under the Constitution <b>of</b> Singapore, and <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> administrative acts. However, only the first type is an exercise <b>of</b> the Court's <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> jurisdiction, as <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> administrative acts is regarded as falling within the Court's supervisory jurisdiction (see below).|$|R

5|$|The {{ground of}} fettering {{discretion}} {{on this basis}} is distinct from {{the right to a}} fair hearing.

25|$|The High Court hears both {{criminal}} and civil cases as a court of first instance – it can deal with trials of matters coming before the courts for the first time.

5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics.

5|$|Some {{of the key}} {{principles}} {{associated with}} the thin conception {{of the rule of}} law include judicial independence, natural justice, the availability <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review,</b> and the accessibility of justice. Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules, though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence. One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{suggested}} that, in {{the light}} of Chng Suan Tze, the validity of an order for preventive detention made by the Minister under section 30 of the CLTPA is dependent on the objective satisfaction of the Minister. Moreover, in Re Wong Sin Yee (2007), which also involved judicial review of an applicant's detention under section 30 of the CLTPA, the High Court, following the decision in Chng Suan Tze, held that the absence of the need to establish a jurisdictional or precedent fact meant that the scope <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> as regards the exercise of the Minister's discretion under section 30 was limited to the GCHQ grounds <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> The Court thus applied an objective test to the subjectively worded powers in section 30; if it Court had applied a subjective test, it would have deferred to the subjective satisfaction of the Minister that the detention was in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E
5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E

5|$|Alternative views {{have been}} {{expressed}} that the amendments were not seeking {{to replace the}} common law <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> Instead, they borrowed from the common law by turning the clock back, and merely clarified the limits of judicial power {{in relation to the}} ISA. It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E
5|$|Chng Suan Tze was {{followed}} by amendments by Parliament to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 which purported to return the applicable law regarding judicial review of government discretion under the ISA to that in Lee Mau Seng. The legality of these changes was challenged in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990). In that decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the legislative amendments to the Act were plain and unambiguous, and thus validly established that the subjective test <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> now applied to internal security matters.|$|E
5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review.</b> On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E

5|$|Fettering of {{discretion}} {{by a public}} authority {{is one of the}} grounds <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> in Singapore administrative law. It is regarded as a form of illegality. An applicant may challenge a decision by an authority on the basis that it has either rigidly adhered to a policy it has formulated, or has wrongfully delegated the exercise of its statutory powers to another body. If the High Court finds that a decision-maker has fettered its discretion, it may hold the decision to be ultra vires – beyond the decision-maker's powers – and grant the applicant a suitable remedy such as a quashing order to invalidate the decision.|$|E
