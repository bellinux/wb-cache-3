Early in life she had discovered the important truth that nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion; and by a series of reckless escapades, half of them quite harmless, she had acquired all the privileges of a personality. She had more than once changed her husband; indeed, Debrett credits her with three marriages; but as she had never changed her lover, the world had long ago ceased to talk scandal about her. She was now forty years of age, childless, and with that inordinate passion for pleasure which is the secret of remaining young.|$|E

Several different sequences of mixing the isocyanate and polyurethane with the chemicals used to prepare tannin-based foams were tested. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that addition of either pMDI <b>or</b> <b>PUR</b> yielded a more ordered microstructure of the foam {{and a larger}} cell size.

The cell size, density, thermal conductivity and mechanical property of tannin/furanic foams were controlled by changing the amount of blowing agent and weight fraction of pMDI. The cell size of pMDI modified foams was largest when the weight fraction of pMDI was 5 % and kept decreasing as the pMDI percentage became higher. The density of the foams increased with the increase of the weight fraction of pMDI. The addition of pMDI increased slightly the thermal conductivity of tannin/furanic foam with the foams still presenting good thermal insulation.

40|$|Polyurethane (PUR) {{injection}} into underground {{coal mine}} strata has been practiced in Australia {{as early as}} 1985. The ACARP report C 100019 discussed several case studies of which one included PUR injection into resin anchored, pre-tensioned hollow central tube cable bolts. In cases of rapid response to accelerating strata movement it is the preference of site geotechnical personnel to install immediate pre-tensioned cable support, followed by re-consolidation of the strata through injection of grout <b>or</b> <b>PUR.</b> Cementitious grouting of cable bolts has two operational time restrictions; 1) 24 - 48 h restrictions can be placed on roadway widening or longwall chock removal {{while waiting for the}} grout to achieve adequate strength and 2) a 24 h restriction being placed on PUR injection after grouting has taken place to avoid unwanted chemical reactions and heat generation. In the last few years, more mines, faced with time critical ground support, have been utilising hollow cable bolts as the support and the means of injecting PUR into the strata. The main reason is time, 24 h lost to cementitious grout curing could be used in stabilising the strata by PUR injection into distant fractures, and operationally 24 h gained on a longwall move represents a large financial advantage. It has been considered that foregoing cementitious grouting of cables and replacing it with PUR will reduce the load transfer of the cable bolt, but no readily available data exists on how much reduction in bond strength occurs. Underground short encapsulation cable pull tests were conducted at Springvale Colliery comparing cementitious grout against PUR at both 24 h and nine days cure time...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Czech Republic is {{a country}} which {{generally}} sees low seismic activity; however, this activity {{needs to be taken}} into account in ca 50 % of the country's area with 10 districts being considered as having seismic activity higher than 0. 08 g. In terms of masonry structures, this issue concerns mainly the execution of the head joints of the masonry and its reinforcement (both in the direction of the bed joint and in the perpendicular direction). All these technologies are rather difficult and expensive to implement. The research focuses on assessing the possibilities of constructing dry masonry and binding it with polyurethane foam. This method allows for significantly higher shear strength of the masonry and appears to be an interesting alternative in the area of constructing buildings in seismically active areas. The structure was stiffened by filling hollow masonry units with large cavities with polyurethane foam. The PUR foam was sprayed into the units during construction. The foam thus applied hardens perpendicularly to the bed joint of the masonry and, having expanded throughout the clay units, it functions as a binder and a stiffening component to the masonry as a whole. The initial shear and flexural strength of the masonry segments were determined. The newly developed method of filling the cavities of masonry units with PUR foam was compared with the conventional method of constructing masonry by means of bonding the blocks with mortar <b>or</b> <b>PUR</b> foam in the bed joints (with no cavities filled). The filling of the masonry unit cavities brought a significant increase in the shear and flexural strength of the masonry. This indicates the stiffness of the structure increased as well...|$|E

40|$|Bradykinin B 1 {{receptor}} (BKB 1 R) {{is involved}} in a variety of pathophysiological processes, particularly those related to inflammation. The gene for this receptor is known to be upregulated by interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, a proinflammatory cytokine. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the BKB 1 R gene expression have not been defined. We demonstrated that IL- 1 beta induces a rapid increase in BKB 1 R mRNA level and the binding of desArg 10 -kallidin in human embryo lung fibroblasts (IMR 90). This increase in BKB 1 R mRNA level is protein synthesis-independent as indicated by treatment of cells with cycloheximide (CHX) <b>or</b> puromycin (<b>PUR).</b> By testing the IL- 1 beta effect on BKB 1 R mRNA degradation, we showed that the IL- 1 beta upregulation of BKB 1 R expression is achieved through both transcriptional activation and post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization. In addition to the IL- 1 beta effects, translation inhibitors, CHX and PUR increase the steady state BKB 1 R mRNA level by inhibiting BKB 1 R mRNA degradation. Removal of the CHX block with subsequent resumption of protein synthesis results in a sizable increase of desArg 10 -kallidin binding. Using signalling pathway inhibitors, we show that IL- 1 beta functions through a protein tyrosine kinase, not protein kinase C or protein kinase A. However, activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate increases the level of BKB 1 R mRNA and the binding of desArg 10 -kallidin.

The scope {{of the study is}} to investigate the three different floors in the public sector in Sweden, Norway, and Finland. A similar study was made many years ago where remarkable result was uncovered. The way used to determining the result in this study is made by two different methods within the LCC. The LCC calculations in this study are based on the primary data collections; qualitative interviews, time study, and observations. Secondary data have also been used in the report. When a customer invests in a floor there are three major costs purchasing, installation, and maintenance. Maintenance will ultimately be the biggest cost because it extends over the entire life cycle while the others are two fixed costs. The analysis uncover that the amount of water and chemical usage to maintain the floors has reduced since the old study. The consumption that has increased is the energy, a result from the increase usage of cleaning machines in the public sector. The most profitable floor to invest in is the vinyl with PUR reinforced surface. This floor has in Sweden and Norway a higher purchasing price than linoleum and vinyl without PUR reinforced surface {{but in the long run}} (30 years) its total life cycle cost are lesser than the two others.

40|$|Thesis (MA (VA) (Visual Arts)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. This {{investigation}} {{draws on}} theories of sacrifice to explore Wim Botha’s sculpture Premonition of War: Scapegoat {{in relation to}} nationalist and patriarchal thought. Since the artist deals with myth, his approach is {{discussed in terms of}} Barthes’ formulation of myth as a meta-language. It is maintained that Botha is using a meta-mythical language to deconstruct the narratives he deals with. Sacrifice is seen as an act that binds communities together but that also separates them from threats (Nancy Jay 1992 : 17). It is argued that the crucifix has been used as symbol of sacrifice to denote immortality, and that this over-emphasis of continuity has been to the detriment of those that do not fall within the boundaries of the “same” as defined by white men. The incorporation and exclusion of the feminine into male structures are discussed, as well as the role that institutionalised religious thought has played in South African Nationalism. An interpretation of Scapegoat using Freud and Žižek seems to point to the necessary compromise made by the Church with the dualisms it has created between its definitions of good and evil. Nietzsche’s conception of sacrifice as a system of debt when applied to the Scapegoat also seems to point to a contradiction inherent within it, since Botha’s inversion puts into question the idea of a gift given outside of a creditor/debtor system. The burnt appearance of the Scapegoat appears to indicate that the attempt to sacrifice the act of sacrifice is futile, since sacrifice eternally returns. However, the “pure gift”, <b>or</b> don <b>pur</b> that Derrida writes of, seems to point to a way beyond dialectics, towards a morality freed from duty...|$|R
