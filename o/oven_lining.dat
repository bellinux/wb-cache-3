25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag and you have to keep your thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most <b>oven</b> <b>line</b> is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} {{processed food}} in Milpa Alta is {{the making of}} barbacoa, sheep meat cooked in a pit <b>oven</b> <b>lined</b> with maguey leaves. This is made principally for weekend sales for traditional markets and street stands in most of Mexico City. The most important barbacoa producing area is Barrio San Mateo in Villa Milpa Alta. About three thousand sheep are slaughtered and prepared as barbacoa each week in Milpa Alta, but barbacoa is increasingly being made with sheep meat imported from Australia, New Zealand and the United States as it is cheaper than that produced in Mexico. The barbacoa business in the area began in the 1940s and since then has been successful enough to allow many families {{to send their children}} to school and become professionals. Despite the younger generation’s higher education, many still participate in the family business. Its success has also allowed barbacoa families to gain a certain amount of prestige in the community.|$|R
50|$|Since its {{creation}} in 1830, the eatery's <b>ovens</b> have been <b>lined</b> with lava rocks from nearby Mount Vesuvius. At {{the time of}} {{its creation}}, one popular pizza was the Mastunicola, topped with lard, sheep milk cheese, and basil. Basil and oregano were the most common herbs, while other toppings included seafood, buffalo mozzarella, cured meats, and cecinielli, small white fish still in development.|$|R
40|$|Heat-setting of {{synthetic}} fabrics is an industrial stabilization {{process that has}} been adapted by designers to create dimensional textures through shaped-resists and non-industrial heat-setting methods. The article overviews heat-setting properties, physical resist techniques, and presents an experiment to determine best practices for heat-setting physically resisted polyester fabric. Two polyester fabrics, organza and lining, were gathered and secured to a wooden dowel and heat-set under four heating conditions: steaming in a pressure cooker, boiling in a pot of water, dry heat in a conventional oven, and radiation waves in a microwave oven. Pre- and post-treatment lengths were analyzed using GLM for two-way ANOVA and post hoc tests. Based on results from the statistical analysis and visual evaluation, steaming in a pressure cooker is recommended for sheer fabrics such as organza and dry heat from a conventional <b>oven</b> for <b>lining</b> weight fabrics...|$|R
40|$|MSc in Operational ResearchThis {{research}} {{is done to}} investigate the practical applications of Computer simulation to analyze and solve frequently met problem areas in a tire manufacturing factory. Automated solid tire production line of Loadstar (Pvt.) Ltd. at Midgame factory was one such selected production line for this Research. The identified problem areas were, e formation for unloading cured tires in <b>oven</b> <b>lines</b> and resulted production output delays due to same reason and also due to other various reasons such as poor production planning and delay in producing raw tires etc. After an initial system study {{with the help of}} the production staff, I analyzed the above mentioned problem and discussed how to avoid those. Introduction of the 'Pommel' (Production Simulation Package) to build a computer simulation model for this problem area was experienced in this research as a smart proactive problem solving tool. And also, I introduced a better production - scheduling method for this process, using Heuristic method to replace the then used poor production planning method. With these changes, the result was; a provision of an easy proactive problem solving tool to try and find out the best allocation of ovens to get the least queue formation at the computer screen to select the best possible array with an easy monitoring facility, before it is performed in real world at the production floor. So, Simulation was experienced as a smart replacement for a tedious; or rather irreversible, rigid, outdated, hit-or -miss procedure which left out at the end with no choice other than bearing up the very expensive loss of rejects and low outputs. A comparatively convenient way to allocate the available resources for an optimum increase of the productivity was the result of this exercise. 'Promote' is one of the available simulation packages in the market today and for the study we used a student version of it. Expensive commercial versions may consist with more facilities for modeling to customize more closure to the practical needs of the organization. A wide survey of latest verities is advisable before an investment to buy a commercial version. Report consists with other suggestions to avoid the observed bottle necks at the press and the ways and means to improve and strengthen the supply chain of raw tires also. Changes at the stage of factory wise or line wise allocation of the orders, line lay-out changes, and visual sign system to improve communication through out the supply chain of raw tire production etc. are discussed in detail at the report...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} part of the 19th century, coal ovens were developed. Its shape was {{cylindrical}} and was made of heavy cast-iron. The gas oven saw its first use as early as the beginning of the 19th century as well. Gas stoves became very common household <b>ovens</b> once gas <b>lines</b> were available to most houses and neighborhoods. James Sharp patented one of the first gas stoves in 1826. Other various improvements to the gas stove included the AGA cooker invented in 1922 by Gustaf Dalén. The first electric ovens were invented in the very late 19th century, however, like many electrical inventions destined for commercial use, mass ownership of electrical ovens could not be a reality until better and more efficient use of electricity was available.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. General purpose {{pressure}} vessels for digestion in microwave ovens {{have been developed}} and their applications investigated. The vessels were manufactured from PTFE and polypropylene and included a safety valve. The easily manufactured vessels {{were found to be}} reliable {{for a wide range of}} samples. A small vessel of 10 ml capacity, also constructed from PTFE and polypropylene, was developed for very small samples. These were used for the digestion of blood. A design for a simple modification of microwave ovens for use in the laboratory has been investigated. A Sharp microwave <b>oven</b> was <b>lined</b> with polypropylene and an extraction system that worked by the Venturi effect was used to remove the fumes from the cavity of the oven. This modification was found to be adequate to prevent corrosion of the oven and to provide the necessary safety features required for a laboratory system. In another modification, a thermocouple and a controller were used for maintaining the temperatures of the samples. Ports were available at the top of the cavity for insertion of suitable vessels for a variety of investigations. A computer-controlled waveguide has been designed for general laboratory applications. The temperature of the samples could be monitored and controlled. The waveguide was used for investigating sample digestions and the heating characteristics of a wide range of materials. A cylindrical applicator has been developed for the microwave heating of large (ca. 300 - 600 ml) samples. Temperature monitoring and control was achieved through the use of a thermocouple and a computer. The instrument was found useful for many laboratory investigations involving relatively large samples. A new applicator has been developed for the even heating of multiple laboratory samples. The vessels (tubes) were introduced into the multimode cavity through ports. A choke was developed to allow rotation of the ports and the samples inside the cavity. Vapours could be extracted from the vessels outside the cavity using a fume extraction system. This system was found to be safe in terms of microwave leakages and yielded very good evenness of heating...|$|R
