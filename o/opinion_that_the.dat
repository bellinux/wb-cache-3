In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman.

5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in status is requested by the town council.

Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E

Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder. Hitler was {{taken on a}} tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. Hitler and Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, Hitler and the officers of Bismarck had lunch in the officers' mess, where Hitler spoke about America's unwillingness to enter the war.

5|$|After {{the first}} two shows of season two, Jim Shelley in The Guardian, called The Wire the best show on TV, praising the second season {{for its ability to}} detach from its former {{foundations}} in the first season.

5|$|As {{part of this}} campaign, Isbul and Malamir {{captured}} the Thracian fortresses of Probaton (near Adrianople, modern Edirne) and Bourdizon (modern Babaeski). After conquering these two fortresses, the Bulgarian troops reached Philippopolis (now Plovdiv). As the defence forces of the city had fled, Isbul and Malamir entered negotiations with the population in order to persuade them to cede the fortress. Pavlov is of the <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war ended with {{a continuation of the}} peace of 815. He believes that Byzantine Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) was forced to make concessions to Bulgaria, which may have included the incorporation of Philippopolis and its close surroundings into the Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was of the <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name {{may not be as}} rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E
5|$|In early 1988, Butthole Surfers {{were ready}} to record a new album and wanted to use a modern studio for the first time, {{choosing}} a state-of-the-art facility in Texas. The following sessions took only one week, as the band had been performing most of the material for years. The band opted to follow this album's blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on their earlier recordings had undergone far more in-studio development and experimentation. Pinkus has expressed the <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled their earlier releases.|$|E
5000|$|On December 20, 1999, the Vermont Supreme Court {{ruled in}} three {{different}} <b>opinions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> denial of marriage benefits {{was a violation of}} the state constitution.

[...] Justices John Dooley and Denise R. Johnson each wrote separate <b>opinions</b> concurring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> exclusion of same-sex couples to the state's marriage rights was unconstitutional, but with different rationales.|$|R

5|$|Other {{theories}} include André Chastagnol's minimalist <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{author was}} a pagan {{who supported the}} Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the History are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven {{into the fabric of}} a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 NFL Network program “10 Worst Teams of All Time” (produced {{prior to}} the Lions’ winless season) {{recognized}} the 1976 Buccaneers as the worst NFL team ever, although it is disputed whether their record was not deceptive, as they were decimated by injuries and were a play away from victory several times. There is some <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 1976 team was not even the worst in Buccaneers history, with the 2–14 1986 squad deserving of that distinction.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis took {{advantage}} of the fire to advance their own political aims. The Reichstag Fire Decree, passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the German Communist Party were suppressed, and some 4,000 communist party members were arrested. Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but Rudolf Diels, head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order. Some researchers, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are of the <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{genocide}} in Lithuania {{is seen by}} some historians {{as one of the}} earliest large-scale implementations of the Final Solution, leading some scholars to express an <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust began in Lithuania in the summer of 1941.

5|$|While in Egypt, Zoghby {{considered}} {{the issues of}} ecumenism and the schism between the Melkite Catholic and Antiochian Orthodox Churches.

He also began to question the domination of the so-called Uniate churches by the See of Rome. Zoghby, along with other Melkite priests in Egypt such as George Hakim and Joseph Tawil, were influenced by Father Oreste Karame, who advocated the need for the Melkite Church to return to its proper traditions and work for communion with the Orthodox Church.|$|E
