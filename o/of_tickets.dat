5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled the sale <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> for wheelchair areas {{was replaced by}} a dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised for their use of an 0844 revenue share number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged by the minute. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E

40|$|A digital {{ticket is}} a {{certificate}} that guarantees certain rights <b>of</b> the <b>ticket</b> owner. There are many applications for digital tickets but the ticket properties {{vary depending on}} the application. This variety makes the digital ticket processing system expensive, especially if dedicated systems must be developed for each application. This paper thus addresses issues on developing a common data schema and processing architecture for various types <b>of</b> digital <b>tickets.</b> This paper clarifies requirements for a general-purpose digital ticket and shows four features in contrast to digital cash: 1) parameterization <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> properties on anonymity, transferability, and divisibility; 2) machineunderstandability <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> contents; 3) statetransitionality <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> status; and 4) composability <b>of</b> multiple <b>tickets.</b> To achieve parameterization <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> properties and machine-understandability, we propose a Resource Description Framework (RDF) -based ticket description method.

5|$|Ticket sales {{began in}} September 2014. The Games {{expected}} to have 1.4million tickets for sale, with over 75% of them priced under $45. The first tranche <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> was to be allocated via a lottery system. Over one million tickets were sold.|$|E
5|$|A {{soup kitchen}} {{was built in}} 1880, {{replacing}} the police station which adjoined the hospital on the west side, by public subscription and dispensed soup to the ‘deserving poor’ until 1891. The soup was not free: it cost half a pence per pint. People who had donated each had a number <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> which they could give {{to those people who}} they believed qualified for the ration. The deserving poor in Victorian times were those unable to work during the winter months. Those individuals classed as undeserving were those whose poverty was deemed to be caused by indolence and alcoholism.|$|E

On March24, 2011, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Abdulmutallab chose to attack Detroit because the plane ticket {{there was the}} least expensive <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> to potential US targets, which included Chicago and Houston.

5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with only a small number <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E
5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend on the number <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> sold.|$|E
5|$|In November, Color Air {{changed the}} {{conditions}} tied to purchase <b>of</b> <b>tickets.</b> Reduced price tickets were only available seven days or more before departure, and only full-price tickets could be refunded. At the same time, the maximum price increased to NOK870, though all ticket prices were changed {{to include all}} taxes, after requirements from the authorities. A new, cheapest ticket was introduced at NOK345, including taxes. After the winter settled, the front between Color Air and Braathens grew colder following Braathens' denying Color Air to use their deicing equipment at Ålesund, resulting in the plane being stuck at the airport.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003. The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model {{in the center of}} the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the number <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> to be won. The game incorporated music and sounds from the video games.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{approximately}} £1 million ($1.6 million) <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> were pre-sold. 18,827 tickets pre-sold for the London IMAX, {{the largest}} IMAX {{screen in the}} country, which broke the theater records for the highest grossing week of pre-sales with £293,312 ($474,687), and the highest grossing first day of pre-sales with £137,000 ($221,717). It extended this record to 30,000 tickets sold and £470,977 ($737,588) earned, and become the most pre-booked film at that theater, exceeding the performance of high-profile IMAX releases including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 and Avatar.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{the play}} was a {{tremendous}} financial success; the previews broke attendance records. In Boston, the show sold out even after the addition of extra matinées. The first week on Broadway took in nearly $ 20,000, close to the maximum the Shubert Theatre could generate at normal prices. However, ticket sales fell off rapidly following the strongly negative reviews. Woods pre-sold four weeks <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> to local ticket brokers, which helped the box office totals, but the brokers were left with unsold seats even after offering deep discounts. After leaving New York, the show returned to strong sales on the road.|$|E

This was despite a limit of 15,000 for FA Cup finals which were also held at Wembley. A crowd of nearly 100,000 was expected to be inside the stadium, although only highlights were to be shown on television.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} information visibility in public transportation ticket systems. The case is the replacement <b>of</b> paper <b>tickets</b> with smart card tickets in the Oslo region in Norway. By contrasting the visibility <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> information to users <b>of</b> paper <b>tickets</b> and smart card tickets, this paper describes the move from local information on paper tickets to distributed information on smart cards. We used a qualitative content analysis of reader comments to an online opinion article on the new smart card system to analyse {{the effect of the}} loss <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> information. Using the concept of ‘networked visibility’, this paper argues that the move from paper to smart card ticket resulted in less informed travelers and more informed providers. We discuss issues around the visibility <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> information and present diverse design solutions, including an augmented reality application, which may address the <b>ticket</b> information needs <b>of</b> public transportation users...|$|R

In Peru, it was the first Hindi film to be released on the same day as in India. Chennai Express was also released in Morocco, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, and Israel. The price <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> for Chennai Express was increased 40 percent above the usual tariff during the weekday shows and up to 20 percent on weekends; although this increase was not uniformly applied in all multiplexes.|$|E

Although the amount of overbooked buses has been sharply reduced with this new system, Greyhound still does not explicitly guarantee a seat to everyone with a ticket (except on Greyhound Express routes).|$|E
