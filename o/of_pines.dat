Accompanying widespread celebrations as news of Batista's downfall spread across Cuba on 1 January 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to take responsibility for policing the country, in order to prevent widespread looting and vandalism.|$|E

Total purchase price <b>of</b> <b>pine</b> nuts with a cone per processor averaged 1. 2 billion won and the mean net income per bag <b>of</b> <b>pine</b> nuts with a cone was 35 thousand won. Total purchasing amount <b>of</b> <b>pine</b> nuts with a cone of Hongcheon–gun, Gangwon–do was 1, 000 ~ 2, 000 bags, averaging 1, 500 bags per processor and the price range per bag <b>of</b> <b>pine</b> nuts with a cone was 580 ~ 630 thousand won, averaging 610 thousand won.

Therefore, {{it was suggested that}} in order to activate local economy through maintenance and expansion <b>of</b> <b>pine</b> nut processors, financial supports such as low interest loan for expansion of processing amount were necessary in the short run and expansion of new forestation and crown shape control to facilitate seed exploitation as well as work enforcement such as thinning for increase of yield was required in the long run...|$|R

However, in 1921, the route was realigned off the route that would become NY129 in favor of NY9A. Nine years later, the state designated the route as NY129 during the state highway renumbering. The route originally followed a route used by NY131 once the routes were swapped in the 1940s, with NY131 being decommissioned soon after. NY129 was extended to end at a traffic circle with NY100 in the hamlet <b>of</b> <b>Pines</b> Bridge. This lasted up to at least 1969, when the designation was truncated back to NY118, which was extended to the traffic circle instead. The traffic circle in Pines Bridge was removed by 1991. Originally, NY129 had an interchange with the Taconic, but the ramps were removed in 1969 and a new interchange was built on nearby Underhill Road.|$|E

Just six hours later on August 21, all tropical storm warnings east of 88°W were discontinued. Shortly after that, a tropical storm warning east of Progreso was removed. All warnings for Mexico were discontinued at 15:00UTC on August21. When Dolly entered the Bay of Campeche on August22, a hurricane watch was put into action for Veracruz, La Pesca, and all areas in between, at 09:00UTC.

5|$|NY118 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it did not initially follow any of its modern alignment. Instead, NY118 headed northeastward from its current southern terminus on modern NY100 and US202 to a terminus at NY22 in Croton Falls while all of what is now NY118 was part of NY100. At the time, NY100 continued north along Baldwin Place Road and Myrtle Avenue to meet then-US6 near Mahopac Falls. In June 1934, the portion of NY118 between Somers and Croton Falls became concurrent to US202, a new interstate route extending from Delaware to Maine. The alignments of NY100 and NY118 north of New Croton Reservoir were flipped , placing NY118 on its modern alignment. NY118 initially continued north to NY6N over NY100's original alignment; however, this extension was eliminated in the mid-1940s. With the flip, NY118 terminated at a junction with NY129 in Croton Lake, while the latter extended to a traffic circle with NY100 in the hamlet <b>of</b> <b>Pines</b> Bridge. This alignment remained until , when the route was extended over the easternmost piece of NY129 to end at the traffic circle with NY100. The traffic circle in Pines Bridge was removed between 1988 and 1991 and replaced with a three-way intersection between the two routes.|$|E
