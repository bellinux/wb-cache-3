The suit was dismissed in Federal District court in 2007 and the reinstatement appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was unsuccessful. [...] The Supreme Court refused to hear this case and cases brought by US Vietnam War veterans in 2009. [...] Subsequently, VAORRC and VFP helped draft legislation to address the main unresolved issued surrounding the use of Agent Orange herbicides in Vietnam.

30|$|Although {{glyphosate}} (and glufosinate) {{have long}} been considered to be low-risk herbicides {{with regard to the}} evolution of resistance [78], at least 34 glyphosate-resistant weed species (more than 240 populations) have been confirmed today, observed on millions of hectares, and increasingly associated with HR crop cultivation [76]. Many of them express resistance to <b>other</b> <b>herbicide</b> classes, too. In the US, the true area infested likely exceeds 28 million ha [79] by a sizable margin. In particular, glyphosate-resistant palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) creates control problems and poses a major economic threat to US cotton production [58].

40|$|Studies of {{mechanisms}} {{of resistance to}} glyphosate have increased current understanding of herbicide resistance mechanisms. Thus far, single-codon non-synonymous mutations of EPSPS (5 -enolypyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase) have been rare and, relative to <b>other</b> <b>herbicide</b> mode of action target-site mutations, unconventionally weak in magnitude for resistance to glyphosate. However, {{it is possible that}} weeds will emerge with non-synonymousmutations of two codons of EPSPS to produce an enzyme endowing greater resistance to glyphosate. Today, target-gene duplication is a common glyphosate resistance mechanism and could become a fundamental process for developing any resistance trait. Based on competition and substrate selectivity studies in several species, rapid vacuole sequestrationof glyphosate occurs via a transportermechanism. Conversely, as the chloroplast requires transporters for uptake of important metabolites, transporters associated with the two plastid membranes may separately, or together, successfully block glyphosate delivery. A model based on finite glyphosate dose and limiting time required for chloroplast loading sets the stage for understanding how uniquely different mechanisms can contribute to overall glyphosate resistance...|$|R

GR crops have been rapidly adopted in soybean, maize, cotton, canola, and sugarbeet {{in large part}} because of the economic advantage of the technology, as well as the simple and superior weed control that glyphosate delivers. Furthermore, the GR crop/glyphosate technology is generally more environmentally benign than the weed management technologies that it replaced. In the Americas, except for Canada, adoption has meant continuous and intense selection pressure with glyphosate, resulting in evolution of GR weeds and shifts to weed species that are only partially controlled by glyphosate. This development is jeopardizing the benefits of this valuable technology. New transgenic crops with resistance to <b>other</b> <b>herbicide</b> classes—in some cases coupled with glyphosate resistance—will be introduced soon.

40|$|A waterhemp biotype was {{recently}} reported resistant to 2, 4 -D in Nebraska. In {{addition to the}} repeated use of 2, 4 -D, atrazine and imazathapyr were reported to be frequently used to control broadleaf weeds. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to confirm 2, 4 -D resistance and test for resistance to growth regulator <b>herbicides</b> and <b>other</b> <b>herbicide</b> modes-of-action (MoA). A single dose-response experiment showed reduced sensitivity in all three waterhemp biotypes to atrazine, imazethapyr and lactofen; therefore, they were generally considered resistant to those three herbicide MoA. None of the biotypes contained the Ser 264 target-site mutation. Since the ametryn dose-response experiment resulted in all susceptible biotypes, atrazine resistance is suspected to be metabolism based. Trp 574 Leu mutation conferring broad cross-resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides including imidazolinones and sulfonylureas was identified in the two 2, 4 -D susceptible waterhemp biotypes. Trp 574 Leu mutation was {{not found in the}} 2, 4 -D resistant biotype, but Ser 653 mutation conferring resistance to imidazolinones was identified.

40|$|How plants survive {{glyphosate}} Glyphosate is {{the most}} widely used herbicide in the world for several reasons, including: 1) high level of effectiveness, 2) flexibility in application, 3) large margin of crop safety in glyphosate resistant crops, and 4) safety to applicators and the environment. Glyphosate was used for more than 20 years before weeds developed resistance to the chemical. This relative low risk of glyphosate resistance compared to <b>other</b> <b>herbicide</b> classes resulted in considerable debate on how best to use the technology to minimize selection of resistant biotypes. This paper will briefly review the factors that make glyphosate such an effective herbicide, and then describe the mechanisms that provide resistance to glyphosate in glyphosate resistant crops (GRC) and weeds. Glyphosate activity Several factors contribute to glyphosate’s unprecedented performance in controlling weeds, including disruption of an important metabolic process, inefficient metabolism of glyphosate by plants, and efficient translocation to growing points. The primary target for glyphosate is the enzyme EPSPS (5 enolpyruvoylshikimate 3 -phosphate synthase). When glyphosate binds to EPSPS it forms a very stable complex that essentially permanently disables the enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the shikimic aci...|$|R
40|$|In rapidly {{changing}} environments, selection history may impact {{the dynamics of}} adaptation. Mutations selected in one environment may result in pleiotropic fitness trade-offs in subsequent novel environments, slowing the rates of adaptation. Epistatic interactions between mutations selected in sequential stressful environments may slow or accelerate subsequent rates of adaptation, depending {{on the nature of}} that interaction. We explored the dynamics of adaptation during sequential exposure to herbicides with different modes of action in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Evolution of resistance to two of the herbicides was largely independent of selection history. For carbetamide, previous adaptation to <b>other</b> <b>herbicide</b> modes of action positively impacted the likelihood of adaptation to this herbicide. Furthermore, while adaptation to all individual herbicides was associated with pleiotropic fitness costs in stress-free environments, we observed that accumulation of resistance mechanisms was accompanied by a reduction in overall fitness costs. We suggest that antagonistic epistasis may be a driving mechanism that enables populations to more readily adapt in novel environments. These findings highlight the potential for sequences of xenobiotics to facilitate the rapid evolution of multiple-drug and -pesticide resistance, as well as the potential for epistatic interactions between adaptive mutations to facilitate evolutionary rescue in {{rapidly changing}} environments...|$|R
