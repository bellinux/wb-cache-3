25|$|Wright {{expressed}} the following sentiments regarding the CLMC death threat {{in an interview}} he conducted with journalist Emer Woodful in late August 1996:My heart goes <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> family {{at a time like}} this. Well, if you think you're right, then you're right. Although I have done nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I've been prepared to die for long many a year. I don't wish to die, {{but at the end of}} the day no one will force their opinions down my throat – no one.|$|E
2500|$|Madoff {{apologized to}} his victims, saying,I {{have left a}} legacy of shame, as some of my victims have pointed <b>out,</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> family and my grandchildren. This is {{something}} I will live in {{for the rest of}} my life. I'm sorry. He added, [...] "I know that doesn't help you," [...] after his victims recommended to the judge that he receive a life sentence. Judge Chin had not received any mitigating factor letters from friends or family testifying to Madoff's good deeds. [...] "The absence of such support is telling," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Laura Ricketts is {{a former}} {{corporate}} lawyer. She lives with her partner on the North Side of Chicago. Ricketts received her Bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1994, and her Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1998. Laura talks of her own struggle to come out; [...] "I came <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> family I would say early to mid 90s. I think {{for a long time}} I wasn't really out to myself, growing up in Omaha, Neb., to a Catholic conservative family. It {{took me a while to}} come out to myself and not long after that I came out to them. I think that it really couldn't have been a better experience. They were all immediately supportive. ... I have been really really fortunate in that regard." ...|$|E

60|$|I whistled {{for the dog}} as I went <b>out,</b> but <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{surprise}} he did not answer.|$|R
6000|$|I was not astonished. I had {{accomplished}} just what I had set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> do. <b>My</b> one thought now was <b>to</b> make <b>my</b> escape. How {{was it to}} be done? ...|$|R
2500|$|Studdard's third album, The Return was {{released}} in October 2006; {{it goes back to}} his R roots, but is different from his previous efforts. [...] Studdard collaborated with the artist Ne-Yo on this album, along with a variety of producers. The single [...] "Change Me" [...] {{was released}} ahead of the album. The Return sold 71,000 copies in its first week to open at number eight on the Billboard 200 album chart, but sales declined rapidly after that, not approaching those of his earlier albums. [...] However, Studdard did have good success on the Urban Contemporary chart with [...] "Change Me" [...] (which reached number one) and its successor [...] "Make Ya Feel Beautiful". Studdard continued to tour, saying he would play a variety of music: [...] "Coming <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> show is like coming to my house. I'll play the songs I love. It's like a party. For me, a party has all different types of music happening." ...|$|E
2500|$|In particular, {{soon after}} Robert South Barrett, Jr., {{the first of}} their six children, was born in Richmond, Virginia, a young {{unmarried}} woman with her own child begged for help at their door. The Barretts provided the {{young woman with a}} meal and listened as she told of being deserted by a man who had promised marriage. Barrett recognized the similarities between herself and the young woman, and concluded that only luck separated her from the young woman in her home; one of them {{had fallen in love with}} a [...] "good" [...] man and one with a [...] "bad" [...] one. Furthermore, from her own experiences as a slaveholder and with Jim Crow laws, Barrett also realized how spirits could be broken by degradation. Profoundly moved by her new-found bond with this [...] "fallen" [...] woman, she vowed, [...] "By the power of God that rules the Universe, I would spend my life trying to wipe out some of the inequalities that were meted <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> sisters who were so helpless to help themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The white man’s lodges for the Great Spirit, whose pinnacles {{reach the}} sky, and which have stood for more seasons than the red man reckon, all struck me with terrible wonder. And the Great Spirit speaks to me {{sometimes}} since I have been here. [...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for when I looked around the great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams. [...] Our people will wonder at these things, when we return to the Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.” ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{critical}} backlash began {{over the}} repetitive {{nature of his}} lyrics, his clean-cut image, and his perceived over-reliance on sampling others' entire hooks for {{the basis of his}} singles—criticisms also directed to his contemporary, Vanilla Ice. He was mocked in music videos by 3rd Bass (including a rap battle with MC Serch), The D.O.C., DJ Debranz, and Ice Cube. Oakland hip-hop group Digital Underground criticized him in the CD insert of their Sex Packets album by placing Hammer's picture in it and referring to him as an unknown derelict. Q Tip criticized him in [...] "Check the Rhyme," [...] asking, [...] "What you say Hammer? Proper. Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop." [...] LL Cool J dissed him in [...] "To tha Break of Dawn" [...] (from the Mama Said Knock You Out album), calling Hammer an [...] "amateur, swinging a Hammer from a bodybag ," [...] and saying, [...] "My old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap.", though this could have been seen as a response to Hammer calling him out in [...] "Let's Get it Started", when he was mentioned along with Run DMC and Doug E Fresh as rappers that Hammer claimed to be better than. (LL Cool J would later compliment and commend Hammer's abilities/talents on VH-1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop, which aired in 2008). However, Ice-T came to his defense on his 1991 album O.G. Original Gangster: [...] "A special shout <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> man M.C. Hammer: a lot of people dis you, man, but they just jealous." [...] Ice-T later explained that he had nothing against people who were pop-rap from the start, as Hammer had been, but only against emcees who switch from being hardcore or dirty to being pop-rap so that they can sell more records.|$|E

60|$|The day {{had become}} very sultry {{by the time}} I went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> visit <b>my</b> patients. The sky was {{overcast}} with dark thunderous clouds, and, as there seemed every chance of a heavy shower, I returned <b>to</b> <b>my</b> lodgings for an umbrella.|$|R

60|$|Another curious effect, {{and rather}} absurd mistake, {{resulted}} from the different densities in the super-heated atmosphere which caused this mirage. Fancying that I saw two springboks on the horizon I pointed them <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> boy.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh no! no!" [...] said Mrs. Barker suddenly, {{clinging}} to her dress and looking fearfully towards the door. [...] "I couldn't, COULDN'T see him now. Say I'm sick, tired <b>out,</b> gone <b>to</b> <b>my</b> room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I," [...] I said, [...] "am, I fear, a coward. Even when to-night I started <b>out</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>my</b> {{appointment}} with you I had fears. I was so afraid," [...] I continued, [...] "that I {{even went so}} far as <b>to</b> insure <b>my</b> safety." ...|$|R

60|$|I pointed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> darling {{how this}} could {{scarcely}} be, because Mr. Woodcourt {{had come to her}} cousin John's house and had known us all there, and because he had always liked Richard, and Richard had always liked him, and--and so forth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] he said, {{removing}} his cap, [...] "the joke which I pointed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> friend has, without doubt, humour, but the journal, as you see, {{is for the}} students. Monsieur will excuse me if I refrain from offering it to him." ...|$|E
