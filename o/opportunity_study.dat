50|$|Housing {{segregation}} has {{an effect}} on the quality of education received by community members. Specifically, the spatial separation of specific populations due to housing segregation leads to geographic concentrations of quality education. For example, public schools in suburban areas are usually more equipped with resources, have a higher percentage quality teachers, and produce a larger amount of successful students. The negative effects of housing segregation on quality of education is demonstrated by the lack of integration and diversity in schools. The Equality of Educational <b>Opportunity</b> <b>study</b> in 1966 found that racial composition of schools impacted student success more than the resources available to schools. This cycle of unequal educational opportunities is perpetuated by the real estate market. Areas with quality school systems usually contain higher housing prices and higher property taxes. In addition, these areas are typically racially and economically homogenous.|$|E
5000|$|Scripture notes a twofold equity {{on which}} this commandment is founded. Man is both the image of God and our flesh. Wherefore, if we would not violate the image of God, we must hold the person of man sacred—if we would not divest {{ourselves}} of humanity we must cherish our own flesh. The practical inference {{to be drawn from}} the redemption and gift of Christ will be elsewhere considered. The Lord has been pleased to direct our attention to these two natural considerations as inducements to watch over our neighbour's preservation, viz., to revere the divine image impressed upon him, and embrace our own flesh. To be clear of the crime of murder, {{it is not enough to}} refrain from shedding man's blood. If in act you perpetrate, if in endeavour you plot, if in wish and design you conceive what is adverse to another's safety, you have the guilt of murder. On the other hand, if you do not according to your means and <b>opportunity</b> <b>study</b> to defend his safety, by that inhumanity you violate the law. But if the safety of the body is so carefully provided for, we may hence infer how much care and exertion is due to the safety of the soul, which is of immeasurably higher value in the sight of God.

40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that prediction-based coherence optimizations offer substantial performance improvements for scientific applications in distributed shared memory multiprocessors. Important commercial applications also show sensitivity to coherence latency, which will become more acute {{in the future as}} technology scales. Therefore it is important to investigate prediction of memory coherence activity in the context of commercial workloads. This paper studies a trace-based Downgrade Predictor (DGP) for predicting last stores to shared cache blocks, and a patternbased Consumer Set Predictor (CSP) for predicting subsequent readers. We evaluate this class of predictors {{for the first time on}} commercial applications and demonstrate that our DGP correctly predicts 47 %- 76 % of last stores. Memory sharing patterns in commercial workloads are inherently non-repetitive; hence CSP cannot attain high coverage. We perform an <b>opportunity</b> <b>study</b> of a DGP enhanced through competitive underlying predictors, and in commercial and scientific applications, demonstrate potential to increase coverage up to 14 %...|$|E

40|$|The Coleman Report has {{inspired}} various lines of inquiry offering new understandings of inequality of educational opportunity and the persistent achievement gaps in American schools. Of the various models and theories, stereotype threat, {{which focuses on}} social-psychological dimensions of inequality, has received considerable attention {{over the past twenty}} years. But what if stereotype threat theory, and associated interventions to combat it, had existed fifty years ago? Using data from the original Equality of Educational <b>Opportunity</b> <b>Study,</b> we find, consistent with the stereotype threat literature, that African American students confronted with more threatening educational contexts are burdened by a less favorable self-image; this finding partially explains how students’ internalization of racial stereotypes depresses their test scores. Based on these findings and on results from numerous laboratory and field experiments documenting the impact of stereotype threat and how to mitigate it, we explore its usefulness for studying educational inequality in the years to come...|$|E

Framed by critical reflections on community-based tourism (CBT) literature and existing sustainable tourism standards (STS) practices, qualitative research consisting of interviews with six key industry experts provided core insights into a number of CBTS’ implementation challenges. Findings indicate the main hindering factors for the implementation of CBTS to be the lack of adequate governance, limited funding and insufficient community capacity. The study concluded that although at the moment the full implementation of CBTS as a certification programme would be premature, ASEAN-CBTS’ criteria are a useful benchmarking and strategic planning tool for local communities, which would eventually lead to improved CBT benefits, standards and performance in the region. At the same time, this paper argues that aspects including CBT competitiveness and service delivery need to be tackled first to create fruitful grounding for CBT certification...|$|E
40|$|Plant species {{introduced}} into new regions can both leave behind co-evolved pathogens and acquire new ones. Traits important to infection and virulence {{are subject to}} rapid evolutionary change in both plant and pathogen. Using Stemphylium solani, a native foliar necrotroph on clovers (Trifolium and Medicago) in California, USA, we explore how plant-fungal interactions may change in an invasion context. After four generations of experimental serial passage through multiple hosts, Stemphylium consistently showed increased infection rates but no consistent change in damage to the host. In a historical <b>opportunity</b> <b>study,</b> we compared infection and virulence across four groups of clover hosts: California natives, European clovers not found in California, and both California and European genotypes of species naturalized in California. There was significant variation among hosts, but no pattern across the four groups. However, in direct comparisons of familiar California genotypes to unfamiliar European genotypes of the same naturalized species, Stemphylium consistently infected familiar hosts more frequently, while causing less damage on them. This pattern {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis of adaptive evolution in both the pathogen (ability to infect) and the host (tolerance of infection). Together these results suggest the potential for rapid evolution to alter interactions between plant invaders and their natural enemies...|$|E
