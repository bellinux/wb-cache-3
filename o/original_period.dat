5|$|The Abdullah {{case that}} had brought him to South Africa {{concluded}} in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi {{as he prepared to}} return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his <b>original</b> <b>period</b> of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob.|$|E

25|$|Glasgow {{is known}} for its tenements – the red and blond {{sandstone}} buildings {{are some of the most}} recognisable features of the city. These were the most popular form of housing in 19th- and 20th-century Glasgow and remain the most common form of dwelling in Glasgow today. Tenements are commonly bought by a wide range of social types and are favoured for their large rooms, high ceilings and <b>original</b> <b>period</b> features. The Hyndland area of Glasgow is the only tenement conservation area in the UK and includes some tenement houses with as many as six bedrooms.|$|E

The first phase of the works programme involved the removal and replacement of the Dargan Wing roof. The next two phases of the project involved the replacement of the Milltown Wing roof, followed by an extensive upgrade of the fabric and services of the two buildings whilst reclaiming their <b>original</b> <b>period</b> elegance. Refurbishment of the two wings were completed in June 2017.|$|E
25|$|Adjustment {{of status}} (AOS) – Adjustment of status is {{for when the}} {{immigrant}} is in the United States and entered the U.S. legally. Except for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, the immigrant must also be in legal status {{at the time of}} applying for adjustment of status. For immediate relatives and other relative categories whose visa numbers are current, adjustment of status can be filed for at the same time with the petition (step 1 above). Adjustment of status is submitted to USCIS via form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. The USCIS conducts a series of background checks (including fingerprinting for FBI criminal background check and name checks) and makes a decision on the application. Once the adjustment of status application is accepted, the alien is allowed to stay in the United States even if the <b>original</b> <b>period</b> of authorized stay on the Form I-94 is expired, but he/she is generally not allowed to leave the country until the application is approved, or the application will be abandoned. If the alien has to leave the United States during this time, he/she can apply for travel documents at the USCIS with form I-131, also called Advance parole. If there is a potential risk that the applicant's work permit (visa) will expire or become invalid (laid off by the employer and visa sponsor) or the applicant wants to start working in the United States, while he/she is waiting for the decision about his/her application to change status, he/she can file form I-765, to get Employment Authorization Documents (also called EAD) and be able to continue or start working legally in the United States. In some cases, the applicant will be interviewed at a USCIS office, especially if it is a marriage-based adjustment from a K-1 visa, in which case both spouses (the US citizen and the applicant) will be interviewed by the USCIS. If the application is approved, the alien becomes an LPR, and the actual green card is mailed to the alien's last known mailing address.|$|E

2500|$|Baz Luhrmann {{produced}} the opera for Opera Australia in 1990 with modernized supertitle translations, and {{a budget of}} only A$60,000. A DVD was issued of the stage show. According to Luhrmann, this version was set in 1957 (rather than the <b>original</b> <b>period</b> of 1830) because [...] "... discovered that 1957 was a very, very accurate match for {{the social and economic}} realities of Paris in the 1840s." [...] In 2002, Luhrmann restaged his version on Broadway, the production won two Tony Awards out of six nominations; for Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design as well as a special award, the Tony Honor for Excellence in Theatre. To play the eight performances per week on Broadway, three casts of Mimìs and Rodolfos, and two Musettas and Marcellos, were used in rotation.|$|E
2500|$|Jo-Han limped {{through the}} 1980s re-issuing old kits and promos. The company gave {{up trying to}} retail its models and set up a branch company called X-El Products to sell reissued promos. The X-El reissues have {{sometimes}} been passed off as originals in antique malls and flea markets. The X-El Products era was an ironic time. Models were carefully prepared and respected by collectors, but there was no capital to develop new products, so the company fell into decline. One consumer purchase update card sent by X-El Products to buyers in 1988 encouraged patience when waiting for models that wer ordered, saying, [...] "These promos are not done on a mass production basis. They are practically made to order and babied from start to finish." [...] This is another way of saying that Jo-Han did not have the resources to improve their service. Nevertheless, the reproductions from this time have also escalated in collector value and were as well rendered as the <b>original</b> <b>period</b> promos, done with accurate color schemes.|$|E
2500|$|Bluehole used closed alpha and beta periods {{with about}} 80,000 players, {{including}} popular streamers, to gauge initial {{reaction to the}} gameplay and adjust balance prior to a wider release. The early access phase on Steam began in March 2017 for the Windows version. This early access period was planned to last approximately six months, originally aiming for a September 2017 release. In July 2017, Greene announced that {{they would need to}} extend the early access period by a few months, continuing to release updates on a regular basis, with plans to still release by the end of 2017, as committing to this <b>original</b> <b>period</b> [...] "could hinder us from delivering a fully featured game and/or lead to disappointment within the community if the launch deadline is not met". Initially, Bluehole had expected that they would just gain enough players through early access to smooth out the gameplay, and only when the game was completed, they would have started more marketing for the title. The sudden interest in the game from early access exceeded their expectations, and put emphasis on the stability of the game and its underlying networking alongside gameplay improvements. Through August 2017, these updates generally included a major weekly patch alongside major monthly updates that provided key performance improvements. However, from August onward Bluehole backed off the rate of such patches, as the high frequency has led to some quality control issues, and the developers rather make sure each patch content is well-vetted by the community before providing new updates; this did not change their plans for a 2017 release. Bluehold anticipated to leave the early access period by late December 2017.|$|E

60|$|The {{progress}} of the Czar from Buckingham Palace to the Mansion House, where he had, after all, consented to lunch with the Lord Mayor, witnessed a popular outburst of enthusiasm absolutely inexplicable to the general public. It was known that affairs in Central Europe were in a dangerously precarious state, and {{it was felt that}} the Czar's visit here, and the urgent summons which had brought from St. Petersburg his Foreign Minister, were indications that the long wished-for entente between Russia and this country was now actually at hand. There was in the Press a curious reticence with regard {{to the development of the}} political situation. One felt everywhere that it was the calm before the storm--that at any moment the great black headlines might tell of some startling stroke of diplomacy, some dangerous peril averted or defied. The circumstances themselves of the Czar's visit had been a little peculiar. On his arrival it was announced that, for reasons of health, the <b>original</b> <b>period</b> of his stay, namely a week, was to be cut down to two days. No sooner had he arrived at Windsor, however, than a change was announced. The Czar had so far recovered as to be able even to extend the period at first fixed for his visit. Simultaneously with this, the German and Austrian Press were full of bitter and barely veiled articles, whose meaning was unmistakable. The Czar had thrown in his lot at first with Austria and Germany. That he was going deliberately to break away from that arrangement there seemed now scarcely any manner of doubt.|$|E
