He made <b>our</b> <b>nation</b> stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.|$|E

5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for <b>our</b> <b>nation</b> be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

From their examples we must learn that we must all contribute toward the development of <b>our</b> <b>nation</b> and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. So we should all attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order that we may render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.|$|E

It is out of our belief in this broad definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation's priorities and future direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same.|$|E

40|$|I {{believe that}} we can only remain optimistic in the midst of events in our world today if we can answer for our-selves this one question: Does God Intervene in the Affairs of Nations? This is a time of {{tremendous}} uncertainty. We see decisions being made in our world that alarm us. Decisions are made that hurt others either by accident or with evil motivation. At best, decisions seem to be made with very narrow interests in mind, not for the general good. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} <b>our</b> <b>nations</b> are now so inter-connected that a decision made in one corner of our world affects those across the globe. As a consequence, the problems we face in leading <b>our</b> <b>nations</b> seem beyond the abili-ty of any individual to solve. The question is on all of our lips: Is there any help for us? I want to test two hypotheses with you: First, there is a God actively involved in the affairs of <b>our</b> <b>nations.</b> Second, His help is essential in leading and building healthy nations. For two decades I have been testing, together with gov-ernment officials, the proposition that <b>our</b> <b>nations</b> must be governed in partnership with God. I would like to share with you some of those conclusions. I would also like to help you understand the work that God is doing in the life of each government official so that you can better understand the work of God around your own life. Let me give you background information before we begin testing these hypotheses. God spoke through one of His servants to reveal the following truth: He rules forever by His power, His eyes watch the nations. ...|$|R
