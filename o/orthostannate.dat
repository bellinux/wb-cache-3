40|$|Cadmium meta- and <b>orthostannate</b> were {{synthesized}} by {{thermal treatment}} using the coprecipitation method. Tin (IV) chloride, cadmium acetate {{were used as}} the initial components, the ammonium carbonate was a precipitant. The coprecipitated compounds and the thermolysis products were analyzed by TGA/DSC methods, the thermal treatment samples were studied by XRD and SEM. The formation of proper products in soft thermal treatment conditions was confirmed. The stannates formation in terms of submicron sized particles was observed by microscopial investigation...|$|E
40|$|A novel yet simple {{technique}} of synthesizing oxide ceramics from metallic precursors has been described. Magnesium <b>orthostannate,</b> Mg 2 SnO 4, a potential candidate for applications in high tem-perature-high frequency domain as a ceramic capacitor element, was synthesized from metallic tin and magnesium powders. An alloy of composition Mg 2 Sn was {{prepared by the}} conventional powder metallurgy route. This up on heating in air under carefully designed ordinary and mild experimental conditions, yielded single-phase inverse spinel type Mg 2 SnO 4. The systematic evolution of phase(s) and powder morphology of the target oxide is discussed and compared with those in powders obtained by other techniques. The present method totally obviates the use of resilient oxides and of carbonate and nitrates precursors, which are invariably the source of environmental pollutants such as CO 2 and NOx. In addition, the difficulties normally encountered in ceramic syntheses from the significant difference in particle size of the starting powders are also eliminated. The {{technique of}}fers an environmental-friendly viable solution to making dense ceramics in thin multilayer formats (MLFs) with miniaturized dimensions, provided a suitable metallic alloy precursor {{can be found in}} the relevan...|$|E
