5|$|Elemental gallium is {{not found}} in nature, but it is easily {{obtained}} by smelting. Very pure gallium metal has a silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. Gallium liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; therefore, {{it should not be}} stored in glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with a short list <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> that includes water, silicon, germanium, antimony, bismuth, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{has many}} uses in the {{construction}} industry; lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material, cladding, flashing, gutters and gutter joints, and on roof parapets. Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet. Lead is still used in statues and sculptures, including for armatures. In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased out in favor <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Arctic {{small tool}} {{tradition}} {{is a broad}} cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait around 2,500BCE (4,500years ago). These Paleo-Arctic peoples had a highly distinctive toolkit of small blades (microblades) that were pointed at both ends and used as side- or end-barbs on arrows or spears made <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials,</b> such as bone or antler. Scrapers, engraving tools and adze blades were also included in their toolkits. The Arctic small tool tradition branches off into two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset, and the Independence traditions. These two groups, ancestors of Thule people, were displaced by the Inuit by 1000Common Era (CE).|$|E
5|$|The {{second largest}} of the inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe orbits within {{the outer edge of}} the Thebe gossamer ring that is formed from dust ejected from its surface.

5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} that the annual worldwide production of thallium is about 10metric tonnes as a by-product from the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores. Thallium is either extracted from the dusts from the smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected {{at the end of}} the smelting process. The raw materials used for thallium production contain large amounts <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> and therefore a purification is the first step. The thallium is leached either by the use of a base or sulfuric acid from the material. The thallium is precipitated several times from the solution to remove impurities. At the end it is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless steel plates. The production of thallium decreased by about 33% in the period from 1995 to 2009 – from about 15metric tonnes to about 10tonnes. Since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content, it would be possible to increase the production if a new application, such as a hypothetical thallium-containing high-temperature superconductor, becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory.|$|E

25|$|The most {{effective}} ways of achieving the nanoscale Pt on carbon powder, {{which is currently}} the best option, are through vacuum deposition, sputtering, and electrodeposition. The platinum particles are deposited onto carbon paper that is permeated with PTFE. However, there is an optimal thinness to this catalyst layer, which limits the lower cost limit. Below 4nm, Pt will form islands on the paper, limiting its activity. Above this thickness, the Pt will coat the carbon and be an effective catalyst. To further complicate things, Nafion cannot be infiltrated beyond 10um, so using more Pt than this is an unnecessary expense. Thus the amount {{and shape of the}} catalyst is limited by the constraints <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} used in sculpture are diverse, changing throughout history. The classic materials, with outstanding durability, are metal, especially bronze, stone and pottery, with wood, bone and antler less durable but cheaper options. Precious materials such as gold, silver, jade, and ivory are often used for small luxury works, and sometimes in larger ones, as in chryselephantine statues. More common and less expensive materials were used for sculpture for wider consumption, including hardwoods (such as oak, box/boxwood, and lime/linden); terracotta and other ceramics, wax (a very common material for models for casting, and receiving the impressions of cylinder seals and engraved gems), and cast metals such as pewter and zinc (spelter). But a vast number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> {{have been used as}} part of sculptures, in ethnographic and ancient works as much as modern ones.|$|E
500|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. steel {{industry}} came under increasing pressure from foreign competition and from American mini-mills that had much lower overhead by using salvaged steel. Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming. Foreign mills and factories, built {{with the latest}} technology, benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships, allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products. Separately, demand for steel softened due to recessions, the 1973 oil crisis, and increasing use <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials.</b> [...] The era began with the RIDC's [...] "Building on Basics" [...] report in 1974.|$|E
