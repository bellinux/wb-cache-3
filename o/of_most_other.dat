5|$|A 2001 {{report by}} Newell et al. at Southampton University {{undertaken}} for Studio Sound in 2001 {{found that the}} NS-10 had excellent time-domain response at low frequencies – its ability to start and stop in response to signal input {{was found to be}} superior to that <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> nearfield monitors. Part of this was related to its closed-box design. The researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments (guitar and drums) are correctly balanced in the mix.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's shirts {{have been}} made by {{manufacturers}} including Bukta (from the 1930s until the early 1970s), Umbro (from the 1970s until 1986), Adidas (1986–1994), Nike (1994–2014), and Puma (from 2014). Like those <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> major football clubs, Arsenal's shirts have featured sponsors' logos since the 1980s; sponsors include JVC (1982–1999), Sega (1999–2002), O2 (2002–2006), and Emirates (from 2006).|$|E
5|$|Boletopsis nothofagi is {{a genetically}} clearly {{differentiated}} {{representative of the}} genus Boletopsis, which according to the investigations of Cooper and Leonard separated relatively early from the precursor <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> known species. Only a North American species, B.leucomelaena, branches off from their phylogenetic tree even earlier. However, the relationships between many of the species were not fully resolved in the study, so in the future, new species may be described.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other species}} in genus Scytalopus, the Perijá tapaculo is secretive and {{therefore}} difficult to observe. The call and song {{differ from those}} <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> species in the genus, and the latter is composed of two short churrs repeating up to 65 times at 0.5 to 3second intervals. The diet of the species is little known, but studies of the stomach contents of seven specimens suggested that they fed exclusively on insects.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|Most mammals are viviparous, {{giving birth}} to live young. However, the five species of monotreme, the platypus and the four species of echidna, lay eggs. The {{monotremes}} have a sex determination system different from that <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> mammals. In particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more {{like those of a}} chicken than those of a therian mammal.|$|E

5|$|Muskrats {{spend much}} of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> mammals. They can close off their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Samarium forms a cyclopentadienide Sm(C5H5)3 and its chloroderivatives Sm(C5H5)2Cl and Sm(C5H5)Cl2. They are {{prepared}} by reacting samarium trichloride with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran. Contrary to cyclopentadienides <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> lanthanides, in Sm(C5H5)3 some C5H5 rings bridge {{each other by}} forming ring vertexes η1 or edges η2 toward another neighboring samarium atom, thereby creating polymeric chains. The chloroderivative Sm(C5H5)2Cl has a dimer structure, which is more accurately expressed as (η5-C5H5)2Sm(µ-Cl)2(η5-C5H5)2. There, the chlorine bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.|$|E
5|$|T.chatareus can be {{distinguished}} by their sooty colour, {{as opposed to the}} typical silver <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> archerfish. They have five dorsal spines, whereas T.jaculatrix have four. The markings on their flanks are also alternating long and short spots rather than bands. T.chatareus also have six or seven markings on its sides, whilst banded archerfish have four to five. T.chatareus has 29–30 lateral line scales, compared to 33–35 in T. jaculatrix. T.chatareus are also less common upstream than T.microlepis.|$|E

5|$|The Government of Massachusetts {{is divided}} into three branches: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. The {{governor}} of Massachusetts heads the executive branch; duties of the governor include signing or vetoing legislation, filling judicial and agency appointments, granting pardons, preparing an annual budget, and commanding the Massachusetts National Guard. Massachusetts governors, unlike those <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> states, are addressed as His/Her Excellency. The current governor is Charlie Baker, a Republican from Swampscott. The executive branch also includes the Executive Council, which is made up of eight elected councilors and the Lieutenant Governor seat, which is currently occupied by Karyn Polito.|$|E
5|$|The alpine pika can emit three {{different}} vocalizations. The long call is heard during the mating season from only the subspecies O. a. alpina, O. a. changaica, and O. a. nitida. The short call is a harsh, sharp whistle that is easily distinguishable from the short high-pitched whistle {{of the northern}} pika. The alarm call is given out immediately any danger from predators or humans is perceived, and can travel greater distances than the calls <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> pika species.|$|E
5|$|The {{systemic}} {{heart has}} muscular contractile walls {{and consists of}} a single ventricle and two atria, one for {{each side of the}} body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular endothelium which is quite unlike that <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.|$|E

5|$|Ytterbium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolYb and atomic number70. It is the fourteenth and penultimate {{element in the}} lanthanide series, which {{is the basis of}} the relative stability of its +2 oxidation state. However, like the other lanthanides, its most common oxidation state is +3, as in its oxide, halides, and other compounds. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules. Because of its closed-shell electron configuration, its density and melting and boiling points differ significantly from those <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> lanthanides.|$|E
5|$|Around 1350BC, the {{stability}} of the New Kingdom seemed threatened further when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> deities, and attacked the power of the temple that had become dominated by the priests of Amun in Thebes, whom he saw as corrupt. Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to events in the Near East (where the Hittites, Mitanni, and Assyrians were vying for control). He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, the priests of Amun soon regained power and returned the capital to Thebes. Under their influence the subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and possibly even Neferneferuaten/Nefertiti herself worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the cases}} <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> {{refractory}} metals, the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides. Tantalum carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride {{is used as a}} thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes. Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a tantalum carbide-graphite composite material {{that is one of the}} hardest materials ever synthesized. Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum-tungsten-copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys. There are two tantalum aluminides, TaAl3 and Ta3Al. These are stable, refractory, and reflective, and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors.|$|E

5|$|Because army ants are {{unpredictable}} {{in their}} movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers {{to maintain a}} territory that always contains swarms to feed around. Antbirds have evolved a more complicated system than the strict territoriality <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs {{of the same species}} may attend a swarm, with the dominant pair at the swarm being the pair which holds the territory that the swarm is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the ocellated antbird is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain woodcreepers, motmots and the rufous-vented ground cuckoo). At a swarm, the dominant species occupies positions above the central front of the swarm, which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less dominant species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the dominant species, where prey is less plentiful.|$|E
5|$|Frogs live on all {{the continents}} except Antarctica, {{but they are not}} present on certain islands, {{especially}} those far away from continental land masses. Many species are isolated in restricted ranges by changes of climate or inhospitable territory, such as stretches of sea, mountain ridges, deserts, forest clearance, road construction, or other man-made barriers. Usually, a greater diversity of frogs occurs in tropical areas than in temperate regions, such as Europe. Some frogs inhabit arid areas, such as deserts, and rely on specific adaptations to survive. Members of the Australian genus Cyclorana bury themselves underground where they create a water-impervious cocoon in which to aestivate during dry periods. Once it rains, they emerge, find a temporary pool, and breed. Egg and tadpole development is very fast in comparison to those <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> frogs, so breeding can be completed before the pond dries up. Some frog species are adapted to a cold environment. The wood frog (Rana sylvatica), whose habitat extends into the Arctic Circle, buries itself in the ground during winter. Although much of its body freezes during this time, it maintains a high concentration of glucose in its vital organs, which protects them from damage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the New Kingdom, Pharaoh Akhenaten {{promoted}} the god Aten over all others and eventually abolished the official worship <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> gods. Traditional temples were neglected while new Aten temples, differing sharply in design and construction, were erected. But Akhenaten's revolution was reversed soon after his death, with the traditional cults reinstated and the new temples dismantled. Subsequent pharaohs dedicated still more resources to the temples, particularly Ramesses II, the most prolific monument-builder in Egyptian history. As the wealth of the priesthoods continued to grow, so did their religious influence: temple oracles, controlled by the priests, were an increasingly popular method of making decisions. Pharaonic power waned, and in the eleventh century BC a military leader, Herihor, made himself High Priest of Amun and the de facto ruler of Upper Egypt, beginning the political fragmentation of the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1070–664BC).|$|E
