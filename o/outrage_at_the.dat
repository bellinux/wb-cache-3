5|$|Jackson {{was among}} the councilman and {{citizens}} who expressed <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> light punishment issued by the mayor's office over a multimillion-dollar city contract scheme. Jackson viewed it as a moral issue where the Mayor did not appropriately condemn immoral activity, which in her eyes encourages similar behavior. During a Summer 2008 violent crime rash she {{was among the}} aldermen calling for refocussed emphasis on adequate police support.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century Reformation and Counter-Reformation, Western historians saw the Crusades {{through the}} lens of their own {{religious}} beliefs. Protestants saw them as a manifestation of the evils of the papacy, and Catholics viewed them as forces for good. 18th century Enlightenment historians tended to view the Middle Ages in general, and the Crusades in particular, as the efforts of barbarian cultures driven by fanaticism. These scholars expressed moral <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conduct of the Crusaders and criticised the Crusades' misdirectionthat of the Fourth in particular, which attacked a Christian power (the Byzantine Empire) instead of Islam. The Fourth Crusade had resulted in the sacking of Constantinople, effectively ending any chance of reconciling the East–West Schism and leading to the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans. In The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 18th-century English historian Edward Gibbon wrote that the Crusaders' efforts could have been more profitably directed towards improving their own countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, John Camden Neild, an {{eccentric}} miser, left Victoria an unexpected legacy, which Albert {{used to obtain}} the freehold of Balmoral. As usual, he embarked on an extensive programme of improvements. The same year, he was appointed to several of the offices left vacant {{by the death of}} the Duke of Wellington, including the mastership of Trinity House and the colonelcy of the Grenadier Guards. With Wellington's passing, Albert was able to propose and campaign for modernisation of the army, which was long overdue. Thinking that the military was unready for war, and that Christian rule was preferable to Islamic rule, Albert counselled a diplomatic solution to conflict between the Russian and Ottoman empires. Palmerston was more bellicose, and favoured a policy that would prevent further Russian expansion. Palmerston was manoeuvred out of the cabinet in December 1853, but {{at about the same time}} a Russian fleet attacked the Ottoman fleet at anchor at Sinop. The London press depicted the attack as a criminal massacre, and Palmerston's popularity surged as Albert's fell. Within two weeks, Palmerston was re-appointed as a minister. As public <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Russian action continued, false rumours circulated that Albert had been arrested for treason and was being held prisoner in the Tower of London.|$|E

The flotilla would not leave New Orleans until 15 April 1843.|$|E
25|$|When the {{interrogation}} techniques {{used on the}} internees became known to the public, there was <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> British government, especially from Irish nationalists. In answer to the anger from the public and Members of Parliament, on 16 November 1971, the British government commissioned a committee of inquiry chaired by Lord Parker (the Lord Chief Justice of England) {{to look into the}} legal and moral aspects of the 'five techniques'.|$|E

25|$|In her Senate career, Senator Clinton {{is often}} seen wearing a suit. However, twice in 2006, Clinton was criticized by National Review Online editor Kathryn Jean Lopez for showing {{cleavage}} while speaking in the Senate. Lopez implored Clinton to be more modest. The Washington Post revisited this question based on a new incident in July 2007, which provoked a widespread round of media self-criticism about {{whether it was a}} legitimate topic or not; the Clinton campaign then used claimed <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> reporting for fundraising purposes.|$|E
25|$|Brooks's {{account of}} the bull market of the 1960s in The Go-Go Years {{similarly}} delineated the personalities {{at the center of}} the action, like high-flying portfolio manager Gerald Tsai. In Brooks's retelling of the decade's events, Tsai and others correctly intuited that the ways of the Street were changing, and adjusted their trading strategies accordingly. Speculation was on the rise, Brooks noted, made easier by the new casino mentality. Writer Michael Lewis noted that Brooks's <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new speculative excesses of the 1960s marked the end of an era.|$|E
25|$|The {{disaster}} was {{met with}} worldwide shock and <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> huge loss {{of life and the}} regulatory and operational failures that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.|$|E
25|$|Prescott in {{particular}} was <b>outraged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fact that the police did not inform him of the phone tapping, but Assistant Commissioner John Yates stated {{that there was no}} actual evidence that Prescott's phone had been tapped.|$|R

25|$|A {{newspaper}} reported that Kelly's body was dissected by medical students who removed {{his head and}} organs for study. Dissection outside of a coronial enquiry was illegal. Public <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rumour raised real fears of public disorder, leading the commissioner of police to write to the gaol's governor, who denied that a dissection had taken place. (Saw cuts {{on a piece of}} his occipital bone recovered in 2011 confirm that a dissection had been done.) His head was allegedly given to phrenologists for study, then returned to the police, who used it for a time as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|In 1891, {{the theatre}} started {{a policy of}} modern drama. Ibsen's Ghosts premièred, to {{predictable}} <b>outrage,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> theatre, in a single private London performance on 13 March 1891. The Lord Chamberlain's Office censorship was avoided by {{the formation of a}} subscription-only Independent Theatre Society, which included Thomas Hardy and Henry James among its members. Again, for the Society, George Bernard Shaw premièred Widowers' Houses, his first play, here the following year. When the theatre finally had a great success, with Brandon Thomas’s play Charley's Aunt in 1892, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to the larger Globe Theatre.|$|E
25|$|When Sandoz {{returns to}} Earth, {{his friends are}} dead, and his faith, once {{considered}} worthy of actual canonization by his superiors, is merely an extension of his bitter anger with the God who sent him to Rakhat. Due to relativistic space-time effects, decades had passed while he has been gone, during which popular <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> UN's initial and highly out-of-context report on the mission, and especially Sandoz's role in the tragedy, had left the Society of Jesus shattered and nearly extinct. As Sandoz painfully explains what really happened, his personal healing begins, but only time will prove whether {{the same is true}} of the Society of Jesus.|$|E

25|$|Valuev {{defeated}} Holyfield by {{a highly}} controversial majority decision after a relatively uneventful bout. One judge scored the bout a draw 114–114, {{while the others}} had Valuev winning 116–112 and 115–114. Many analysts were <b>outraged</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> decision, thinking Holyfield had clearly won. There was talk of a rematch in 2009.|$|R
25|$|However {{public support}} quickly waned {{as it became}} {{apparent}} that the war would not be easy and it dragged on, partially contributing to the Conservatives' spectacular defeat in 1906. There was public <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> use of scorched earth tactics – the forced clearance of women and children, the destruction of the countryside, burning of Boer homesteads and poisoning of wells, for example – and the conditions in the concentration camps. It also became apparent that there were serious problems with public health in Britain: up to 40% of recruits in Britain were unfit for military service, suffering from medical problems such as rickets and other poverty-related illnesses. This came at a time of increasing concern for the state of the poor in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Beginning 8 November, American and Iraqi forces {{invaded the}} militant stronghold of Fallujah in Operation Phantom Fury, killing and {{capturing}} many insurgents. Many rebels {{were thought to}} have fled the city before the invasion. U.S.-backed figures put insurgency losses at over 2,000. It was the bloodiest single battle for the U.S. in the war, with 92 Americans dead and several hundred wounded. A video showing the killing {{of at least one}} unarmed and wounded man by an American serviceman surfaced, throwing renewed doubt and <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> efficiency of the U.S. occupation. The Marine was later cleared of any wrongdoing because the Marines had been warned that the enemy would sometimes feign death and booby-trap bodies as a tactic to lure Marines to their deaths. November was the deadliest month of the occupation for coalition troops, surpassing April.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Persian {{has become}} {{just one of}} many Iranian blog languages. English in {{particular}} is used. This is both because it is a relatively well known second language due to high education levels, and to expose the outside world to the goings on in Iran. Several influential bloggers made a plea to other bloggers to use this medium to increase international <b>outrage</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Iranian regime. It also seeks to provide a lens from which to see the Iranian people as separate from their repressive government. Additionally, many blogs being read are written abroad by diasporic communities of Iranians throughout the globe. Many of their families left during the Brain-drain following the Islamic revolution in 1979 and after, creating a dedicated politically motivated and educated author base. These people use their native or adopted languages in addition to Persian.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the film}} was released, {{distributor}} Shackleton reportedly hired fake protesters to picket movie theaters showing the film.
