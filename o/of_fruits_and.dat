40|$|Background/Objectives: Perceptions that <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> {{vegetables}} are expensive {{are more common}} among the socio-economically disadvantaged groups and are linked to poor dietary outcomes. Such perceptions may be exacerbated in countries recently affected by natural disasters, where devastation <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable crops has resulted in increase in prices <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables. Examining the associations <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable affordability and children 2 ̆ 7 s diets can offer insights into how the high prices <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables might {{have an impact on}} the diets of children. Subjects/Methods: We analysed the data from 546 socio-economically disadvantaged mother–child pairs to assess the relationship between maternal perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable affordability and the diets of their children. Results: Fruit consumption was lower among children whose mothers felt the cost <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> was too high. Maternal perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable affordability were not associated with any other aspect of child 2 ̆ 7 s diet. Conclusions: Our results suggest a possible role for maternal perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> affordability in children 2 ̆ 7 s diet, though further research is warranted. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Objective Perceptions that <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> {{vegetables}} are expensive {{have been found}} to be associated with lower consumption <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables among disadvantaged women; however, the determinants of these perceptions are relatively unknown. The purpose of the current paper is to examine whether perceived availability <b>and</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables, and social support for healthy eating, are associated with perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable affordability among women residing in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Design Cross-sectional self-report survey. Setting The study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia. Subjects An Australian sample of 4131 women, aged 18 – 45 years, residing in neighbourhoods ranked in the lowest Victorian tertile of relative disadvantage by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, an index that considers aspects of disadvantage such as residents’ income, education, motor vehicle access and employment. Results Results showed that irrespective of education, income and other key covariates, women who perceived poor availability <b>and</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables in their local neighbourhood were more likely to perceive <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables as expensive. Conclusions Our results suggest that perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable affordability are not driven exclusively by lack of financial or knowledge-related resources, but also by women 2 ̆ 7 s psychological response and interpretation of their local nutrition environment. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explored}} internal <b>and</b> external predictors <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable intake {{in children}} of different age groups. The first sample were toddlers between 2 - 3 {{years old and}} the second sample were children between 5 - 9 years old. Intake <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> was analysed separately from intake of vegetables, <b>and</b> subgroups <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables with strong sensory properties were also analysed separately. The results showed that in the older sample lifetime exposure to variety <b>of</b> different <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables was positively associated with quantity <b>and</b> diversity <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables consumed. In toddlers, liking <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables was not directly linked to their intake. In children of less controlling mothers fruit liking was positively associated with <b>fruit</b> intake <b>and</b> children <b>of</b> the more controlling mothers ate <b>fruit</b> independent <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> liking.

5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E

Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} inundation {{caused by}} Vera's storm surge submerged {{areas around the}} periphery of the bay for extended periods of time, with some low-lying areas remaining underwater in excess of four months. Due to the failure of multiple flood mitigation systems in quick succession, coupled with the narrow coverage of telecommunications exacerbated by Vera's strong winds, many persons in affected regions had very little time to evacuate. Nagoya {{was one of the worst}} impacted cities by Vera, and as a result of the storm surge and wind, its harbor was put out of service in under three hours. The effects of the typhoon's storm surge there were further worsened by the destruction of lumber yards in Nagoya Harbor, which set loose large quantities of logs that caused considerable damage to structures. The release of logs also hampered relief efforts following the typhoon's passage. Citywide, 50,000homes were severely damaged by flood waters, and 1,800other residences were washed away off of their foundations. Total damage to crops was estimated at US$30million. Rice crops sustained heavy impacts, with 150,000tons (135,000tonnes) of rice lost. In addition to the crop damage, US$2.5million worth <b>of</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> US$4million worth of vegetables were lost. The collapse of a single apartment home in the city buried 84people under debris; a similar incident in Naka, Ibaraki buried roughly 300people. Beach houses were destroyed, and large swaths of nearby cropland were heavily damaged. In addition to the storm surge, Nagoya experienced sustained winds of about 145km/h (90mph), with gusts reaching as high as 260km/h (160mph), downing power lines and causing power outage. Southeast of Nagoya, in Handa, Aichi, around 300people were killed after Vera's waves engulfed more than 250homes. Casualties throughout Aichi totaled 3,168 and roughly 59,000people were injured, based on an enumeration conducted in March1960.|$|E

40|$|The {{association}} between greater <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable intake and better health outcomes is now well established, and dietary {{guidelines and recommendations}} promote increased intake <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables. The correspondence of self-assessed change in, <b>and</b> adequacy <b>of,</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable intake with dietary intake data was investigated using data from a food frequency questionnaire administered in 1989 and again in 1992 to 453 randomly selected adults from Dalby, Queensland. There was some accuracy in self-reported increased intake <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> for women, although the dietary data for 44 per cent of women who reported an increase in intake did not show such an increase. Self-reported increased intake did not correspond with dietary data for men or for vegetable intake for women. Self-assessed adequacy <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetable intake was associated significantly with mean intake and intake frequency data. The association was stronger for men for <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> for women for vegetables. Nonetheless, high percentages of people who consumed less than two servings <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> or three servings of vegetables daily assessed their intake as 2 ̆ 7 about right 2 ̆ 7.
