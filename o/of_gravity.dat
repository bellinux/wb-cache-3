5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether or not a surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b>|$|E
5|$|After he had {{realized}} {{the validity of}} this geometric analogy, it took Einstein a further three years to find the missing cornerstone of his theory: the equations describing how matter influences spacetime's curvature. Having formulated what are now known as Einstein's equations (or, more precisely, his field equations <b>of</b> <b>gravity),</b> he presented his new theory <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> at several sessions of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in late 1915, culminating in his final presentation on November 25, 1915.|$|E

5|$|Experiments and {{observations}} show that Einstein's description of gravitation accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in {{the orbits of}} Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, most recently gravitational waves.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} gravitational waves, ripples in {{the curvature}} of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling {{outward from the}} source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> propagate at infinite speed.|$|E
5|$|In Newton's {{description}} <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> {{the gravitational}} force {{is caused by}} matter. More precisely, it {{is caused by a}} specific property of material objects: their mass. In Einstein's theory and related theories of gravitation, curvature at every point in spacetime is also caused by whatever matter is present. Here, too, mass is a key property in determining the gravitational influence of matter. But in a relativistic theory <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> mass cannot be the only source <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> Relativity links mass with energy, and energy with momentum.|$|E

50|$|A gravity {{gradiometer}} can independently determine the components <b>of</b> the <b>gravity</b> vector on a real-time basis.

Hence, the gradient can be measured by determining the difference in gravity at two close but distinct points. This principle is embodied in several recent moving-base instruments. The gravity gradient at a point is a tensor, since it is the derivative of each component <b>of</b> the <b>gravity</b> vector taken in each sensitive axis. Thus, the value of any component <b>of</b> the <b>gravity</b> vector can be known all along the path of the vehicle if {{gravity gradiometer}}s are included in the system and their outputs are integrated by the system computer.
