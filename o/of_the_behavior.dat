5|$|When World War II began, Teller {{wanted to}} {{contribute}} to the war effort. On the advice of the well-known Caltech aerodynamicist and fellow Hungarian émigré Theodore von Kármán, Teller collaborated with his friend Hans Bethe in developing a theory of shock-wave propagation. In later years, their explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of the gas behind such a wave proved valuable to scientists who were studying missile re-entry.|$|E
5|$|Although Fodor {{originally}} {{rejected the}} idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, he has in recent years devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposes reductive accounts of the mind. He argues that mental states are multiply realizable {{and that there is}} a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of neurons and synapses. He has also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterizes as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{began taking}} pre-orders for the first-generation iPad on March 12, 2010. The only major {{change to the}} device between its {{announcement}} and being available to pre-order was the change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of the side switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking (user selectable). The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010. The Wi-Fi+3G version was released on April 30. 3G service in the United States is provided by AT and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data {{and the other for}} 250MB per month at half the price. On June 2, 2010, AT announced that effective June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan. The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.|$|E

5|$|Being {{chemically}} stable, neptunium phosphates {{have been}} investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste. Neptunium pyrophosphate (α-NpP2O7), a green solid, has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive. The series of compounds NpM2(PO4)3, where M is an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs), are all known. Some neptunium sulfates have been characterized, both aqueous and solid and at various oxidation states of neptunium (IV through VI have been observed). Additionally, neptunium carbonates {{have been investigated}} to achieve a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of neptunium in geological repositories and the environment, where it may {{come into contact with}} carbonate and bicarbonate aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium {{should be}} a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.7g/cm3 in the solid state; in comparison, the most dense known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from copernicium's high atomic weight, the {{lanthanide}} and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough copernicium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. However, some calculations predict copernicium to be a gas at room temperature, the first gaseous metal in the periodic table (the second being flerovium), due to the closed-shell electron configurations of copernicium and flerovium. The atomic radius of copernicium {{is expected to be}} around 147pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Cn+ and Cn2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E

5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.61), similar to its lighter congener hafnium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.2g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of 22.61g/cm3. This results from rutherfordium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough rutherfordium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. The atomic radius for rutherfordium {{is expected}} to be around 150pm.
