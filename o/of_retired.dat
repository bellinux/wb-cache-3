30|$|The other {{covariates}} that we {{have included}} in the estimation provide evidence mostly in line with previous empirical findings. 15 We obtain a negative impact of higher education on the probability <b>of</b> <b>retiring,</b> in agreement with Villagarcía (1995) and Gutiérrez-Domènech (2006). 16 Further, the effect of education is reinforced by duration, so that the probability <b>of</b> <b>retiring</b> <b>of</b> a higher educated worker becomes larger the longer the time it has elapsed since becoming eligible.|$|R

5|$|Cariappa's {{alliance}} with the Indian Army was spread {{over a period of}} around three decades, during which he had broad experience of staff and command work. After his retirement in 1953, he served as the Indian high commissioner to Australia and New Zealand until 1956. With a view toward ex-servicemen's welfare, Cariappa founded the Indian Ex-Servicemen's League (IESL) in 1964.

5|$|Fearing the {{approaching}} Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital {{would have been}} viewed {{as an act of}} capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction was more important than preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance. In January 1126, {{a few days before the}} New Year, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role <b>of</b> <b>Retired</b> Emperor. The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor Qinzong (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital.|$|E

40|$|Data {{from the}} 2002 and 1994 General Social Survey {{are used to}} analyze the {{determinants}} <b>of</b> <b>retiring</b> due to mandatory retirement and the expected age of retirement in Canada. Changes between 1994 and 2002 are decomposed into a component attributable to shifts in the composition of respondents and the other component to changes in the preferences and constraints of respondents, the latter playing a very important role for both outcomes. Specifically, between 1994 and 2002 we find: (1) a 1. 3 percentage point drop in the probability <b>of</b> <b>retiring</b> due to mandatory retirement, with that drop due to preference/constraint changes substantially reducing the probability <b>of</b> <b>retiring</b> due to mandatory retirement but being almost offset by a change in the composition of the workforce that increased the probability <b>of</b> <b>retiring</b> due to mandatory retirement; and (2) a 3. 7 year increase in the expected age of retirement, with that increase being almost exclusively attributable to preference and constraint shifts. The implications of these findings for employers, employees and policy makers areRetirement, Expected Retirement Age, Labour Supply, Mandatory Retirement...|$|R
