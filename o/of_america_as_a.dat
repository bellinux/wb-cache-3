5|$|A July 1861 {{address to}} the people of Bourbon County, {{authored}} by Hawes and other like-minded Democrats, blamed Republicans for starting the Civil War, denounced the coercion of states to remain in the Union, and warned that the Lincoln administration would fight to end slavery.

5|$|Representations <b>of</b> <b>America</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> female Native American, or Indian princess, dated {{back to the}} 16thcentury; cartographers {{would place}} a native woman, often wearing a {{feathered}} headdress, upon their version of the North American continent. This evolved into an image of an Indian queen, then an Indian princess, and although Columbia eventually came to be the favored female embodiment of the United States, {{the image of the}} Indian princess survives in the popular view of such figures as Pocahontas and Sacagawea.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise <b>of</b> <b>America</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E

5|$|In {{cases of}} massive and severe {{infection}} of invasive pests, techniques of pest control {{are often used}} in combination. An example is the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed {{tens of millions of}} ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States <b>of</b> <b>America</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> possible biological control of the emerald ash borer. Initial results for Tetrastichus planipennisi have shown promise, and it is now being released along with Beauveria bassiana, a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.|$|E

25|$|While {{the global}} {{awareness}} and {{popularity of the}} Tour grew during this time, its finances became stretched. Goddet and Lévitan continued to clash over {{the running of the}} race. Lévitan launched the Tour <b>of</b> <b>America,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> precursor to his plans to take the Tour de France to the US. The Tour of America lost a lot of money, and it appeared to have been cross-financed by the Tour de France. In the years before 1987, Lévitan's position had always been protected by Émilien Amaury, the then owner of ASO, but recently, Émilien Amaury had retired and his son Philippe Amaury was now responsible. When Lévitan arrived at his office on 17 March 1987, he found that his doors were locked and he was fired. The organisation of the 1987 Tour de France was taken over by Jean-François Naquet-Radiguet. He was not successful in acquiring more funds, and was fired within one year.|$|E
