5|$|A flame fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) is a type <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> or improvised explosive device which uses an explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target. The flame fougasse {{was developed by the}} Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E

5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force {{to be able to}} bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E
5|$|Black Creek is {{situated}} within the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. Rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Llwellyn Formation. Coal {{beds in the}} watershed include the Lower Red Ash bed, the Upper Red Ash bed, the Lower Ross bed, the Upper Ross bed, and the Baltimore Bed. Ridges <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> waste also occur in the creek's drainage basin. Mining {{was done in the}} watershed as early as the winter of 1836-1837, but it stopped in 1955. The creek and the surrounding areas were the subject of a joint study by several federal and state organizations in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In December 1939, Massey {{joined a}} {{group at the}} Admiralty Research Laboratory in Teddington led by Stephen Butterworth. They were soon joined {{by a number of}} other physicists, {{including}} Bates, Buckingham, Francis Crick and John Gunn. Together, they came up with a series of countermeasures that enable the Navy to successfully sweep the mines. With this in hand, Massey became Deputy Chief Scientist to the Scientific Section <b>of</b> <b>Mine</b> Design Department at the Admiralty Mining Establishment in Havant in early 1941. This time, the job was to create mines as good as the German ones. Massey brought his team with him. While Bates worked on packaging to protect the mine when it was dropped from an aircraft, Buckingham and Gunn calculated its theoretical effectiveness, and Crick designed the circuitry. Their mine codenamed MX, was soon in service, and the group turned its attention to developing acoustic or pressure mines. On the retirement of A. B. Wood in 1943, Massey became Chief Scientist at Havant.|$|E

5|$|In early September 1917, {{following}} the German {{conquest of the}} Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The Admiralstab (Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of √ñsel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula. On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture √ñsel and Moon Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, Moltke, along with the III and IVBattle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. The IISquadron consisted of the four K√∂nig-class ships, and was by this time augmented with the new battleship Bayern. The IVSquadron consisted of the five Kaiser-class battleships. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the line was prompted by the need <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> owners around Guisborough and East Cleveland to transport their iron ore to the River Tees. Guisborough was already served by the Middlesbrough and Guisborough Railway (M), {{a subsidiary of the}} Stockton and Darlington (S), which had built a line (opened in 1854) running along the south of the valley in which Guisborough sits. However, the line was an inconveniently long distance from the lucrative iron ore mines in the north of the valley, along the south flank of the Eston Hills, and provided no connection at all for mines east of Guisborough. The M had been built by a group of industrialists based in Stockton and Darlington who used it to service their own mines, deliberately avoiding the estates of their rivals. It only provided a minimal passenger service to Middlesbrough ‚Äì one train a day each way ‚Äì and the line had originally not even been planned to have a passenger station in Guisborough.|$|E
5|$|The labor {{situation}} in Jerome was complicated. Three separate labor unions‚Äîthe International Union <b>of</b> <b>Mine,</b> Mill, and Smelter Workers (MMSW), the Industrial Workers of the World or IWW, and the Liga Protectora Latina, which represented about 500 Mexican miners‚Äîhad members in Jerome. In 1917, two miners' strikes involving the IWW, {{which had been}} organizing strikes elsewhere in Arizona and other states, took place in Jerome. Seen as a threat by business interests {{as well as other}} labor unions, the Wobblies, as they were called, were subject nationally to sometimes violent harassment. The MMSW, which in May called a strike against United Verde, regarded the rival IWW with animosity and would not recognize it as legitimate. In response, the IWW members threatened to break the strike. Under pressure, the MMSW voted 467 to 431 to settle for less than they wanted.|$|E
