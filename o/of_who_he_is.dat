25|$|In Either/Or, A and Judge William {{each has}} one epistolary novel in two volumes. The A is an aesthete {{well aware that}} he can {{use the power of}} {{interpretation}} to define who he is and what he takes to be valuable. He knows he can shape and reshape his own self-identity. Nothing binds him to his relationships. Nothing binds him to his past actions. In the end though, he also knows he lacks a consistent understanding <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> He lacks a self that resists his own power of reinterpretation. His older friend Judge William, argues that a deeper concept of selfhood is discovered as one commits to one's actions, and takes ownership of the past and present. A concept of oneself, as this particular human being, begins to take form in one's own consciousness.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Children's BBC {{expressed}} an interest in producing a Doctor Who spin-off. Their initial idea was [...] "a drama based on the idea of a young Doctor Who", but Russell T Davies vetoed this. [...] "Somehow, the idea of a fourteen year old Doctor, on Gallifrey inventing sonic screwdrivers, takes away from the mystery and intrigue <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> and where he came from," [...] said Davies. He suggested instead a series based on the Doctor's former companion Sarah Jane Smith.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, McAdams starred {{opposite}} Channing Tatum in {{the romantic}} drama The Vow, {{based on a}} true story. McAdams and Tatum played a newlywed couple who try to rebuild their relationship after a car crash leaves the wife with no recollections <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> or their marriage. McAdams was drawn to the [...] "roller coaster" [...] faced by her character and found it interesting that the story was told [...] "through the guy's eyes". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that [...] "the dimply and adorable Rachel McAdams" [...] brings [...] "enough physical charm and emotional warmth to distract from the threadbare setting and the paper-thin plot". Joseph Amodio of Newsday felt that McAdams, [...] "exuding her usual uncanny warmth on-screen", [...] "is the real draw". However, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt she was [...] "wasted" [...] in the role: [...] "She is such an appealing actress that it's hard not to wish someone could make better use" [...] of her. Mary Pols of Time found the film an example of McAdams [...] "coasting" [...] in [...] "unabashedly romantic" [...] movies and asserted that [...] "she's a much more versatile and clever actress" [...] than such projects would suggest. The film, financed for $30 million, was a major commercial success and became her biggest box-office hit in a leading role. It topped the U.S. box office and has grossed over $196 million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Chloe's first romantic {{relationship}} {{is with the}} man {{believed to be the}} millionaire son of Jill Abbott, Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard). In July 2009, it is revealed that Cane Ashby is not the son of Jill Abbott. Hendrickson compared their relationship, which ensued as a result of Chloe practically [...] "threatening him", to the psychological thriller film Fatal Attraction (1987); [...] "I've definitely channeled my inner Glenn Close at times. But I'm trying really hard not to make Chloe go down the crazy path. I don't think she's crazy. She just desperately wants to be loved," [...] she said. While Cane is drunk, Chloe sleeps with him and becomes pregnant. Hendrickson described Chloe's actions as [...] "definitely plotting" [...] but, in reference to Chloe's backstory, said it was [...] "not because <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> She just wanted him". Prior to the revelation that she is Kate Valentine, Chloe marries Cane, angering the Chancellors. According to the actress, Chloe's [...] "defense" [...] is, [...] "I came here to start fresh and I wanted to do it on my own. I didn't tell Cane because I was afraid he would think I was going after him for his money. There was no plotting." [...] Chloe disrupts the pairing of Cane and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), creating a [...] "bitchy" [...] rivalry between the female characters. Ultimately, Chloe gives birth to a daughter named Cordelia [...] "Delia" [...] Abbott (Sophie Pollono). In a dramatic love rectangle storyline, it is revealed that Delia's father is actually Jill's son, Billy Abbott (Billy Miller); this revelation ends Chloe's manipulations of Cane, despite his excitement at the prospect of being a father.|$|E

Weatherly stated, [...] "She was really the beginning of his love for movies and why that is such a deep, penetrating part <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> The last gift she gave him was to turn to the movies as a moral compass."

2500|$|Enter Che: the 1960s {{symbol of}} student revolution, the all-pervasive ascetic gaze used to add allure and mystique to a product, because either a {{sophisticated}} audience is savvy enough {{to distinguish between}} revolution and commerce while enjoying the irony, or oblivious <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> or what he represents. This began the metamorphosis from Che the martyred resistance fighter beloved by many, and Che the violent Marxist revolutionary despised by others, to his dual paradoxical position in the global corporate capitalist culture. The commodification of the image has been ongoing since his death, and since the late 1990s has seen a resurgence. UCLA art historian David Kunzle, has described the phenomenon by noting [...] "if you go to Havana today, you will not see Che with a gun, you will see him with a rose or a dove.

After the events of the [...] "Civil War" [...] storyline, the Vision travels the world posing as different people in order {{to gain a better understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> He then finds Cassie and declares his love, and states he has adopted the name [...] "Jonas".

In the past Prue and Curtis shared an interest in drawing superhero fan art, but Prue has moved on to botanical illustration, leaving Curtis and his love of comic books behind. He is an awkward [...] "persecuted loner" [...] who lacks Prue's confidence, and is, at first, easily intimidated and manipulated by Prue, Alexandra, and others. He grows {{in the course of the}} book, gaining a more definite sense <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> after being forced to choose sides and stand up to the Dowager Governess Alexandra. His relationship with Alexandra recalls the seduction of Edmund Pevensie by the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. After being hustled into an ill-fitting role as an officer in the coyote army, he inadvertently distinguishes himself in battle. Later, by free choice, he becomes a full member of the bandits, and decides to stay behind with them in Wildwood, even as Prue returns home to St. Johns. Like Prue, Curtis is a [...] "half-breed" [...] who has a dual nature that allows him to enter The Wood, but the exact nature of this connection not revealed in Wildwood, other than Curtis speculating that he has a strange reclusive aunt, and a number of odd relatives.|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{donated the}} maximum {{allowable}} amount to John McCain's {{campaign in the}} summer of 2007 and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, on October 19, 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Barack Obama during a Meet the Press interview, citing [...] "his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> and his rhetorical abilities", in addition to his [...] "style and substance." [...] He additionally referred to Obama as a [...] "transformational figure". Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, stating that {{despite the fact that she}} is admired, [...] "now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president." [...] He said that Obama's choice for vice-president, Joe Biden, was ready to be president. He also added that he was [...] "troubled" [...] by the [...] "false intimations that Obama was Muslim." [...] Powell stated that [...] " [...] is a Christian—he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America." [...] Powell then mentioned Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan, a Muslim American soldier in the U.S. Army who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, [...] "Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me." [...] Powell concluded his Sunday morning talk show comments, [...] "It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this morning, and I regret that [...] I think we need a transformational figure. I think we need a president who is a generational change and that's why I'm supporting Barack Obama, not out of any lack of respect or admiration for Sen. John McCain." [...] Later in a December 12, 2008, CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign, Palin pushed the Republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it.|$|E
