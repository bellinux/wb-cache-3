5|$|Fibropapillomatosis disease {{caused by}} a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with {{internal}} and external tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> cause permanent blindness. Trematodes of the family Spirorchiidae inhabit tissues throughout {{the body of the}} loggerhead, including vital organs, such as the heart and the brain. Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease. A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads, causing histologic lesions in the respiratory tract.|$|E
5|$|The Magyars buried their dead, {{laying the}} {{deceased}} {{on their backs}} with the arms resting along their bodies or upon their pelvises. A deceased warrior's tomb always contained material connected with his horse. These are most frequently its skin, skull, and the lower legs; these were put into its master's grave, but occasionally only the harness was buried together with the warrior, or the horse's skin was stuffed with hay. The Magyars rolled the corpses in textiles or mats and placed silver plates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and the mouth.|$|E
5|$|In {{retrospective}} {{reviews of}} the Genesis version, Dynamite Headdy has continued to receive considerable praise. Critics agreed that the game is excellent despite not receiving the same legendary status as some of Treasure's other works such as Gunstar Heroes, Ikaruga, and Radiant Silvergun. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN said the game is overload <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> but it makes sense with respect to Treasure's chaotic design. Frank Provo of GameSpot noted the game's impressive graphical effects, large bosses, and bizarre premise providing {{the same level of}} excitement as Gunstar Heroes. Damien McFarren of Nintendo Life called it one of the best Treasure games of the Genesis era {{and one of the best}} platformers on the system.|$|E

5|$|The Klingons {{received}} {{the first major}} revision in design since their appearance in The Motion Picture. Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged {{that it would be}} unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another concern was that there was not enough of designer Robert Fletcher's The Motion Picture uniforms for all the Klingons in the film. While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore ready-made masks, with minor touch-ups <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and mouth. Since it was important for the actors' expressions to be visible through the makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest glues and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed braids and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.|$|E

25|$|Another {{accessibility}} {{feature is}} to increase contrast on the screen which acts by reducing the transparency of background elements on Movie and TV Show pages, menu tabs, {{and other parts of}} the operating system. High-contrast can also be turned on, with a cursor to better delineate the focused content. The user can also opt to turn on Reduce Motion which in some screen actions, such as moving between app icons on the Home screen and launching apps are visually simpler which is of benefit to reduce strain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Optical illusions (also called visual illusions) are {{characterized}} by visually perceived images that differ from objective reality. The information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a percept that differs from the object being imaged. Optical illusions can {{be the result of}} a variety of phenomena including physical effects that create images that are different from the objects that make them, the physiological effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and brain of excessive stimulation (e.g. brightness, tilt, colour, movement), and cognitive illusions where the eye and brain make unconscious inferences.|$|E

25|$|The {{efficacy}} {{profile of}} lidocaine {{as a local}} anaesthetic {{is characterized by a}} rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action. Adrenaline vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delays the resorption of lidocaine, almost doubling the duration of anaesthesia. For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes local numbing less painful. Lidocaine drops can be used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> for short ophthalmic procedures.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin {{and other}} retinoids {{are well known}} to affect the eyes. Dry eyes are very common during {{treatment}} and is caused by isotretinoin's apoptotic effect on the meibomian glands. Some patients develop contact lens intolerance as a result. In some patients, these changes are long-lasting or irreversible and represent Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). Other common effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> include inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), red eye caused by conjunctivitis and irritation of the eye. More rare ocular side effects include blurred vision, decreased night vision (which may be permanent), colour blindness, development of corneal opacities, inflammation of the cornea (keratitis), swelling of the optic disk (papilloedema, associated with IIH), photophobia and other visual disturbances.|$|E
25|$|In the Cairo museum may be {{seen the}} statue of {{a man from the}} period of the Great Pyramid of Giza, {{possibly}} 4000 B.C. The expression of the face and the realism of the carriage have never been surpassed by any Egyptian sculptor of this or any other period. The figure is carved out of a solid block of sycamore, and in accordance with the Egyptian custom the arms are joined <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> are inlaid with pieces of opaque white quartz, with a line of bronze surrounding to imitate the lid; a small disk of transparent rock crystal forms the iris, while a tiny bit of polished ebony fixed behind the crystal imparts to it a lifelike sparkle. The IV., V. and VI. dynasties cover the finest period of Egyptian sculpture. The statues found in the tombs show a freedom of treatment which was never reached in later times. They are all portraits, which the artist strove his utmost to render exactly like his model. For these are not, like mere modern statues, simply works of art, but had primarily a religious signification (Maspero). As the spirits of the deceased might inhabit, these Ka statues, the features and proportions were closely copied.|$|E

500|$|Both {{contemporaneous}} and retrospective reviewers offered lavish {{praise for}} the game's aesthetics, level design, and gameplay, which became legacies of the game. Some called it [...] "charm". Delgrego of Nintendo Life would stop mid-game just to watch what enemies would do. Martin Watts of the same publication called it [...] "an absolute pleasure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and unlike any other SNES game". Others praised the control scheme, technical effects, and sound design. Nintendo Life Delgrego felt [...] "goosebumps and tingles" [...] during the ending theme, and marked the soundtrack's range from the lighthearted intro to the [...] "epic grandeur of the final boss battle".|$|E
500|$|Libby is {{a mysterious}} {{character}}, {{seated at the}} tail-section of the plane. Her character was written {{to be in her}} late forties to early fifties, easy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> amicably maladjusted, and a compulsive liar so good at what she does, most people will not know she is not what she seems. Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense as some of the other characters.

[...] He commented, [...] "it should be clear that a reader seeking a single, nonredundant and objective account of targeted killing should find another book. On the other hand, this collection of essays provides several original and useful treatments of various aspects of the subject."

500|$|Overall, {{the show}} {{received}} {{a positive response}} from many music critics. Mike Weatherford of the Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote, [...] "The spectacle rivals Celine Dion's 'A New Day' as the singer transforms from fragile soul to the rock warrior alter ego of her album title, I Am ... Sasha Fierce." [...] Melissa Arseniuk of Las Vegas Weekly wrote in her review of the show, [...] "Once Beyoncé took to the stage, she hardly left it. Appearing both on her own and with back-up dancers, she worked the theater {{from left to right}} throughout the showcase. She sang, danced, and looked good while she did it... Indeed, the mezzo-soprano is as easy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> as she is on the ears." [...] John Griffiths of Us Weekly described the concert as [...] "lavish". Andy Kellman from Allmusic wrote, [...] "The show is certainly a theatrical production worthy of Vegas, with Beyoncé and her large backing band energetically rolling through the singer's back catalog." ...|$|E
500|$|Corriea {{was mixed}} about the game's HD upgrade, stating {{that while the}} {{background}} were [...] "gorgeous" [...] and the main characters moved fluidly and expressed emotion properly, NPCs or characters unimportant to the stories did not receive the same attention as the main cast. Schilling was disappointed with the result, frequently citing scenery and character behavior that looked out of place on the big screen. Miller said that the game's visuals were [...] "dominated by muddy textures and frequent loading.", while he negatively noted {{the removal of the}} original's multiplayer. Damiani praised the upgrades for the main characters, but noted multiple inconsistencies in both the environments and cutscenes. Famitsu found the graphics [...] "dramatically beautiful", but found it strange seeing the original environments on a large screen. Meyerink said that, while not hard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> the upgrades were well below what he expected. Sullivan praised the lighting and shading effects, but shared Corriea's criticism of NPCs and noted low-quality environmental textures, saying she was [...] "so bored by most environments that [...] stopped caring about them halfway through the story." [...] The localized dialogue also received mixed to negative reactions, with multiple reviewers faulting the English voice actors' performances. Opinions on the PC port were mixed: Meyerink marked it as an improvement of the ports of the XIII games while acknowledging issues with the graphics and controls, while Roberts was not impressed by its performance.|$|E
