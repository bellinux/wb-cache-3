25|$|In tournaments within {{countries}} like Taiwan where they use house conditions, spinning {{can be an}} advantage <b>over</b> <b>rolling.</b> However, when tournaments use the more conventional oil patterns, where the oil is laid from the foul line to about 40 feet, and is dry up to the pin rack, spinning loses its advantage since friction exists. Carry is also a more reliable and consistent technique of knocking pins down on the first ball, as spinning is less predictable in terms of pin deflection, and at times can result in odd leaves - including the 5-pin and wash-outs when missing the 1-pin.|$|E

500|$|The {{team had}} a very {{successful}} Tour of Austria, a race concurrent to the Tour de France. Kessiakoff rode to a strong stage 2 win on a summit finish at Kitzbüheler Horn. On a day where {{the composition of the}} leading group changed several times <b>over</b> <b>rolling</b> terrain, Kessiakoff was the first rider to attack out of the main peloton and surpassed all riders ahead of him to finish alone atop the [...] summit. A former mountain bike veteran, this solo ride was Kessiakoff's first career road win in his third year in the discipline. The result gave him a lead of a minute and 18 seconds in the overall standings. After most of the riders finished together on the next four stages, Kessiakoff built his lead even higher in the stage 7 time trial. He was fifth, ceding time only to riders well behind him in the overall standings, extending his lead to two and a half minutes. He easily won the race overall the next day, finishing safely in the peloton in an uncomplicated sprinters' stage. After Masciarelli won the youth award at the inaugural Giro di Padania, Valentin Iglinsky provided for the team's final wins of 2011 at the Tour of Hainan. In a race that actually counted toward the 2012 Asia tour standings, Iglinsky, the race's defending champion, won stage 8 and subsequently the overall crown the next day.|$|E

Objective Correlate the occurrence of falls and the activity of <b>rolling</b> <b>over</b> in bed with performance on the Trunk Mobility Scale (TMS) in patients with PD, and determine whether this instrument score can predict the risk of falls. Method This is a cross-sectional study. Assessed patients reported the frequency of falls {{in the previous year}} and whether they had difficulties <b>rolling</b> <b>over</b> in bed. Then, the following scales were applied: TMS, Hoehn and Yahr, Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-III and Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living. Results Eighty-five patients were analyzed. Patients with a history of falling showed worse performance in the TMS (p < 0. 01). There is a significant correlation between TMS and the activity of <b>rolling</b> <b>over</b> in bed (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Introduction. Motor {{development}} {{depends on}} the interaction between nature and nurture. Several studies looked at the effect of stimulating activities and stimulating materials on the motor development of school-aged children and adolescents, but little {{research has focused on}} babies. Also little research has focused on gender differences in motor development and stimulating activities and stimulating materials. In the present study this will be considered based on the motor milestone <b>rolling</b> <b>over,</b> a motor milestone that is mostly reached between the age of four till six months. Method. In this study sixty-two first time parents participated by reporting about the stimulating activities they engaged in en the stimulating materials they used trough the questionnaire ‘Parenting questionnaire: ‘Babies motor development and motor habits’. A hierarchal regression analysis was used for testing the relation between gender, stimulating activities and the motor milestone <b>rolling</b> <b>over</b> of babies in the age of four till six months. A second hierarchal regression analysis was used for testing the relation between gender, stimulating materials and the motor milestone <b>rolling</b> <b>over.</b> Results. No significant gender differences in the attainment of the motor milestone <b>rolling</b> <b>over</b> was found. Second no effect was found of stimulating activities or stimulating materials, because the total effect of gender on the motor milestone <b>rolling</b> <b>over</b> did not change after adding these factors. Conclusion. No relation was found between gender, stimulating activities, stimulating materials and the motor milestone <b>rolling</b> <b>over</b> of babies in the age of four till six months. This implies that other factors are involved. Further research on other factors is recommended...|$|R
