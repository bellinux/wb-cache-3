5|$|Akshaya Tritya is {{considered}} holy and supremely auspicious by Jains. It {{is believed that}} Rishabhanatha took his first ahara (alms) after becoming an ascetic on this day.

King Shreyansa of Hastinapur offered sugarcane juice (ikshu-rasa) to Rishabhanatha. Jains attach great importance to this day as it was only after one year that Rishabhanatha was offered food. The day is celebrated in the Jain tradition <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>day</b> of the bright fortnight of the month Vaishaka (usually April).|$|E
