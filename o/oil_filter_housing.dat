Next, we show numerical results, validating the model and the algorithm. Finally, we present results from simulation of 3 -D oil flow through a real car filter...|$|R

Weight-saving measures include aluminium chain cases, oil sump, motor mount arms, accessory mounts and a cartridge-style <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> <b>housing.</b> Closely {{related to the}} SOHC M40, the M42's DOHC 16 valve head and chain-driven cams provided increased power {{in comparison to the}} M40.|$|E
50|$|When {{installed}} in the BMW E30, a two-piece oil pan with a removable front sump was fitted to the M42. In this two-piece arrangement, the upper oil pan casting incorporates the oil pump's supply passage, and is sealed to the crankcase <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> with a paper gasket. This can cause problems, because thermal cycles and engine vibration tend to loosen the six 10mm upper pan mounting bolts inside the motor.|$|E

50|$|The basic Family II {{architecture}} was substantially re-engineered in 2000 {{to become}} the Ecotec Gen I. Unlike its notably harsh predecessor, the engine was designed for smoothness. Dual in-block balance shafts were integral to the design, the power-steering pump was mounted directly to the cylinder head and driven by the intake camshaft, the water-pump housing was cast into the block, and the A/C compressor and alternator were mounted directly on the block without brackets. The <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> <b>housing</b> was cast into the block with a removable cover and replaceable paper element. It did not use an EGR valve. The Ecotec line is manufactured in Tonawanda, New York and Kaiserslautern, Germany, and was also manufactured for Saturn in Spring Hill, Tennessee until Saturn's discontinuation. In North America this engine replaced both the Quad-4 and the GM 122 engines and {{first appeared in the}} 2000 Saturn L-Series.|$|E
50|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> is {{a filter}} {{designed}} to remove contaminants from engine oil, transmission oil, lubricating oil, or hydraulic <b>oil.</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>filters</b> {{are used in}} {{many different types of}} hydraulic machinery. A chief use of the <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> is in internal-combustion engines in on- and off-road motor vehicles, light aircraft, and various naval vessels. Other vehicle hydraulic systems, such as those in automatic transmissions and power steering, are often equipped with an <b>oil</b> <b>filter.</b> Gas turbine engines, such as those on jet aircraft, also require the use of <b>oil</b> <b>filters.</b> Aside from these uses, oil production, transport, and recycling facilities also employ filters in the manufacturing process.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{automobile}} engines {{did not use}} <b>oil</b> <b>filters.</b> For this reason, {{along with}} the generally low quality of oil available, very frequent oil changes were required. The first <b>oil</b> <b>filters</b> were simple, generally consisting of a screen placed at the oil pump intake. On November 27, 1923, American inventors George Greenhalgh and Ernest Sweetland filed U.S. Patent #1721250 for an automotive <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> and called it the Purolator, a portmanteau of [...] "pure oil later". The Purolator <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> was the first <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> invented for the automobile and revolutionized the filtration industry. The Purolator <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> is still in production today. This original invention was a bypass filter: most of the oil flowed directly from the oil pan to the engine's working parts, and a smaller proportion of the oil was sent through the filter via a second flow path in parallel with the first. The <b>oil</b> was thus <b>filtered</b> over time. Modern bypass <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> systems for diesel engines are becoming popular in consumer applications, but have been in commercial use for some time due to potential reduction in maintenance costs.Oil filters are generally located near the middle or bottom of the engine.|$|R
