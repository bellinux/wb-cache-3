5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is used for}} coherent Doppler lidar measurements capable of detecting very weak light scattered in the atmosphere and monitoring wind speeds with high accuracy. It has application in <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> communications, in various high resolution spectroscopic techniques, and the self-heterodyne method {{can be used to}} measure the linewidth of a laser.|$|E
5|$|Fabry-Pérot etalons {{are widely}} used in telecommunications, lasers and {{spectroscopy}} to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division multiplexing, the technology that {{enables the use of}} multiple wavelengths of light through a single <b>optical</b> <b>fiber,</b> depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.|$|E
40|$|We present {{development}} of new methods and techniques of the splicing and shaping <b>optical</b> <b>fibers.</b> We developed new techniques of splicing for standard Single Mode (SM) and Multimode (MM) <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> and <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> with different diameters. Together with development these techniques we prepared other techniques to splicing hollow core Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) and theirs cross splicing methods. Development of these new techniques and methods of the <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> splicing are made with respect to using these fibers to another research and development {{in the field of}} <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> sensors...|$|R
40|$|An optical {{assembly}} {{is formed}} {{by one or}} more piezoelectric fiber composite actuators having one or more <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> coupled thereto.

40|$|A light scatter sensor {{includes}} a sensor {{body in which}} are positioned a plurality of <b>optical</b> <b>fibers.</b> The sensor body {{includes a}} surface, in one end {{of each of the}} <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> terminates at the surface of the sensor body.

5|$|Between 1945 and 1952, optical {{engineers}} {{built upon}} the earlier work of Rudolph Schindler (1888–1968), developing the first gastrocamera. In 1964, <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> technology {{was applied to}} one of these early gastrocameras to produce the first flexible fiberoptic endoscope. Initially used in upper GI endoscopy, this device was first used for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a central venous catheter.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} New York {{described}} detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround <b>Optical</b> <b>Fiber</b> Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus {{so that it is}} totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser.|$|E
5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. The reason was lack of <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> cable {{connection to the}} archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of data {{as they would have}} to pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on the mainland and Longyearbyen. Construction started in June 2003 and was completed in January 2004.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{embedded}} <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> on the interlaminar fracture behavior of composite laminates was investigated. Double cantilever beam (DCB) tests and end notched flexure (ENF) tests {{were performed to}} obtain the mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture toughness, respectively. Two different stacking sequences of glass fiber-epoxy matrix composite laminates ([0 (18) {X} 0 (18) ] and [0 (6) / 90 (4) / 0 (8) / 90 {X} 0 (8) / 90 (4) / 0 (6) ]) were studied, where {X} refers {{to the location of}} embedded <b>optical</b> <b>fibers.</b> It was shown that the mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture toughness values were in general little affected by the <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> embedded {{in the same direction as}} the crack propagation. In contrast, for composites with <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> embedded in the direction perpendicular to crack propagation, the mode I fracture toughness was generally lower than for those without embedded <b>optical</b> <b>fibers,</b> while the mode I fracture toughness showed large increases at the locations of <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> where the crack arrested. The failure mechanisms associated with the large diameter <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Testing <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> {{for their}} {{response}} to ionizing radiation is unavoidable if their properties in radiation environments need to be known. So far, no model exists that {{would be able to}} predict the behavior of <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> in the presence of radiation, for example because too many, mostly unknown parameters influence the changes in the fiber. To obtain reliable results from irradiation tests of <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> a well-defined setup and thorough experience is needed to avoid erroneous data that might lead to wrong decisions for the final application.

25|$|Immunity to {{electromagnetic}} interference: Light transmission through {{optical fibers}} is unaffected by other electromagnetic radiation nearby. The <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> is electrically non-conductive, {{so it does}} not act as an antenna to pick up electromagnetic signals.

25|$|Inevitable {{manufacturing}} imperfections in <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> {{leads to}} birefringence, {{which is one}} cause of pulse broadening in fiber-optic communications. Such imperfections can be geometrical (lack of circular symmetry), due to stress applied to the <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> and/or due to bending of the fiber. Birefringence is intentionally introduced (for instance, by making the cross-section elliptical) {{in order to produce}} polarization-maintaining optical fibers.|$|E
25|$|Three key {{characteristics}} of fiber optic waveguides {{can be affected}} by environmental conditions: strength, attenuation and resistance to losses caused by microbending.

On the inside, coatings ensure {{the reliability of the}} signal being carried and help minimize attenuation due to microbending.|$|E

40|$|A {{drop-weight}} {{impact test}} and delamination buckling test {{were performed to}} investigate the development of impact damage and post-impact compression behavior of cross-ply composite laminates with <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> embedded in the interface of two different angle plies. It {{was found that the}} presence of <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> had little or marginal effect on the shape and size of damage area of the laminate when the <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> were embedded parallel to the host reinforcing <b>fibers.</b> Non-parallel <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> promoted unstable crack growth through the formation of resin rich regions, which in turn increased slightly the impact damage area. It was also shown {{that a large number of}} parallel <b>optical</b> <b>fibers</b> may have an ameliorating effect on delamination buckling strength as they promote the waviness of the delamination fracture surface. © 1999 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

25|$|During operation, {{light from}} a laser source travels through an <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> to {{illuminate}} {{the surface of a}} reflective diaphragm. Sound vibrations of the diaphragm modulate the intensity of light reflecting off the diaphragm in a specific direction. The modulated light is then transmitted over a second <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> to a photo detector, which transforms the intensity-modulated light into analog or digital audio for transmission or recording. Fiber optic microphones possess high dynamic and frequency range, similar to the best high fidelity conventional microphones.|$|E
