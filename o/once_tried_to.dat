5|$|Nash grew {{up playing}} soccer—he stated in a 2005 {{interview}} {{that he could have}} played professionally if he had focused on it—and continues to hold an interest in the sport. When Dirk Nowitzki arrived in the NBA from Germany, he and Nash became close friends, in part because they enjoyed watching soccer together. Nash is friends with several professional soccer players, including Alessandro Del Piero, Thierry Henry, Owen Hargreaves, Massimo Ambrosini and Steve McManaman. During his off-season, when he lives in New York City, he has trained with the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer, and <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> arrange a pick-up game in the city's Central Park with the Red Bulls and one of his local teams.|$|E

A hostile alien invader known as Captain Kabuki (voiced by Lorelei King) descends upon Little Muu and starts taking it apart, piece by piece, contrasting on what Aloha himself had <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do to Crater Planet in the first game. Aloha flees the onslaught in his space pod, and lands on an asteroid far away from Little Muu, where he calls for help from his sworn enemy, Universal City Hall. Once again, Robbit is dispatched to help, and manages to free the parts of Little Muu which Kabuki has taken, and ultimately faces Kabuki one-on-one in mortal combat. Robbit defeats Kabuki, resulting in the latter escaping.|$|E

25|$|Zhao Wenhua had now {{reached the}} apex of his career. However, he had by this time become arrogant and earned the enmity of people from {{government}} officials to the court eunuchs.

The emperor liked the wine, and later asked Yan Song about it, who was quite surprised and had to confess that he knew nothing about the wine. Yan almost severed relations with Zhao Wenhua for this transgression if not for the good words by Yan's wife. In another incident, Zhao Wenhua was so drunk that he failed to bow and kneel when receiving a gift from the emperor.|$|E
25|$|When Susan Richards {{experienced}} {{problems with}} her second pregnancy while Reed was away, Johnny contacted Doom for help, correctly guessing that Doom {{will be unable}} to pass up a chance to succeed where Reed failed (due to the complex events involving the then-recent resurrection of Galactus, this pregnancy is a 'repeat' of an earlier one where Sue miscarried). Doom not only saves Sue's daughter but also cured Johnny of a recent problem with his powers where Johnny was unable to 'flame off' without technological support after becoming overcharged with energy from the Negative Zone by channeling Johnny's excess energy into Sue to keep her alive. After the birth, Doom's only apparent condition for his aid is that he be allowed to name Sue and Reed's daughter, calling her 'Valeria' after his long-lost love. However, this inspires a new plan where Doom makes Valeria his familiar while seeking out her namesake as part of a deal with a trio of demons; by sacrificing his old lover, Doom is granted magical powers on the level he would possess if he had spent the past years studying sorcery rather than science. With this new power, Doom trapped Franklin in Hell, immobilised Doctor Strange, and then neutralises the FF's powers, torturing the other three while taunting Reed by leaving him in his magical library, comparing it to giving a dog a road-map as he concluded that it would be impossible for Reed to master sufficient magical skill to be a threat to him. However, Reed was able to release Doctor Strange's astral self from Doom's traps, allowing Strange to give Reed a sufficient crash-course in magic for Reed to free {{the rest of the team}} and trick Doom into angering his demonic benefactors, prompting them to take him to Hell. Determined to ensure that Doom cannot be a further threat, Reed takes control of Latveria to dismantle all of Doom's equipment, simultaneously subtly driving his family away so that he can trap Doom and himself in a pocket dimension so that he can make sure Doom never threatens anyone again. However, this plan backfires when the rest of the team attempt to rescue Reed, resulting in Doom transferring his spirit into Sue, Johnny and Ben respectively, forcing Reed to kill his best friend to stop his greatest enemy. Doom was returned to Hell, but Reed is later able to use the same machine Doom <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> create to travel to Heaven and restore Ben to life. Doom remained in Hell until Mjolnir falls to Earth after the events of Ragnarok as it creates a dimensional tear during its fall that allows Doom to escape, although he decides to focus on rebuilding his power base when he proves unable to even lift the hammer. The events of this were deleted from Marvel Comics continuity in the 2015 series Secret Wars.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to Ernest Thayer's 1888 baseball poem [...] "Casey at the Bat." [...] The episode makes several allusions to the film The Natural. Homer's secret weapon, his self-created [...] "Wonderbat", is akin to Roy Hobbs's [...] "Wonderboy", and both bats are eventually destroyed. The scene featuring the explosion of stadium lights as Homer circles the basepaths is also taken directly from the film. The end song [...] "Talkin' Softball" [...] is a parody of [...] "Talkin' Baseball" [...] by Terry Cashman. Jeff Martin wrote the {{new version of the}} song, but Cashman was brought in to sing it. The scenes of the Power Plant team traveling from city to city by train, overlaid with the pennant of the city they are going to, is {{a reference to}} the 1942 film The Pride of the Yankees. Carl batting with a piano leg is a reference to Norm Cash of the Detroit Tigers, who <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> bat with a table leg in a game where Nolan Ryan was extremely overpowering and threw a no-hitter.|$|E
500|$|He {{was often}} in {{conflict}} with his brothers regarding internal matters, with Nhu, Diệm's most influential adviser, controlling {{the southern part of}} the country. The brothers often competed with each other for U.S. aid contracts and the rice trade, but did not interfere with matters in one another's territorial zone. Cẩn had <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> set up an office for his secret police in Saigon (which was in Nhu's southern region) by showing Diệm his long list of detained political opponents, but insisted that he not have to report to Nhu. He brutally suppressed dissent by using torture and re-education camps to achieve his aims. Comparing Cẩn to his brothers, Scigliano said that he was [...] "also considered the most severe, some would say primitive, member of the family and he rules his domain with a strict and sometimes brutal hand". Referring to his autocratic style, a Vietnamese critic said that unlike Diệm, Cẩn was consistent and left his followers in no doubt as to what he wanted: [...] "They are not confused by double talk about democratic ideals and institutions". His creation of a well-defined system of incentives and deterrence has been cited as one reason for his success.|$|E
500|$|Dinklage has {{received}} widespread praise for his performance, with Matthew Gilbert from The Boston Globe saying that Dinklage [...] "gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware". Dan Kois of The New York Times noted that Dinklage's performance {{has made the}} character [...] "all the more popular". The Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "In many ways, Game of Thrones belongs to Dinklage". Tyrion {{has been called the}} [...] "most quotable" [...] character and [...] "one of the most beloved characters" [...] of the series. For his performance, he has gone on to win a Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2011 and 2015, as well as the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. As a result of his performance and increased screen time, Dinklage was given top billing starting in the series' second season. In 2014, he said on The Late Show with David Letterman that he had <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> read the books the show is based upon, but had found them confusing. He joked, [...] "George Martin, our author, is probably going to kill my character soon because I mentioned that." [...] In 2014, Dinklage and four of his Game of Thrones co-stars became some of the highest paid actors on television, although sources differ on the actors' per-episode salaries as of 2017. In 2015, Dinklage lent his voice for the role of Tyrion in , an episodic graphic adventure video game based on the show.|$|E

500|$|Like Delingpole, Andrew Blair found {{similarities}} between the Ninth Doctor era and the Third Doctor era, summarising Eccleston's single series as [...] "a modern day season seven". In his retrospective of the character, he states that Eccleston's casting proved that {{the revival of the}} show [...] "was not a light entertainment concern". He comments that in online fandom there was a sense [...] "of a ship being steered in a different direction" [...] and praises the plot device of the Time War as allowing the character to become mysterious again by providing him a [...] "blank slate". He compares the Ninth Doctor to the First Doctor (William Hartnell) in that both characters are [...] "an unknown who remains aggressively weird until his new-found human friends soften him up". Blair also felt that the Ninth Doctor's relationship with the Doctor's arch enemies the Daleks was more successful than in other incarnations giving particular praise to Eccleston's [...] "spittle-enhanced and terrifyingly furious reaction" [...] to the monsters in [...] "Dalek". Blair ends his retrospective by noting that without the foundations laid by Eccleston the show [...] "wouldn't have been able to move onwards towards the even more popular David Tennant era". Steven Moffat, who wrote [...] "The Empty Child"/"The Doctor Dances" [...] for Eccleston's Doctor and would become Doctor Who executive producer in 2010, observed that in 2005 there was a distinct lack of science fiction and fantasy drama in the UK. He felt that the first series had to establish itself as [...] "a bit Hollyoaks" [...] and [...] "a bit tough detective" [...] to prove itself as a [...] "proper, sensible drama series". Moffat notes that the 2005 series [...] "changed the landscape into which it <b>once</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> fit" [...] and that now Doctor Who [...] "has to be the most fantastical of the fantasy shows." ...|$|E
