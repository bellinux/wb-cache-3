25|$|Espionage novelist David John Moore Cornwell, {{better known}} as John le Carré, whose books include The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy has lived in St Buryan for more than forty years. Many of his novels have been adapted for film, the most recent being <b>Our</b> <b>Kind</b> of Traitor in 2016. The author Derek Tangye, who died in 1996, also lived and wrote in the parish for many years, writing over twenty books, the Minack Chronicles, about life in rural Cornwall (Minack {{deriving}} from Dorminack Farm). Sam Peckinpah's 1971 film Straw Dogs, starring Dustin Hoffman, was filmed in St Buryan.|$|E
25|$|Many criticisms {{focus on}} {{versions}} of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler's anthropic cosmological principle, which are teleological notions that tend to describe the existence {{of life as a}} necessary prerequisite for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Shermer, and others claim that the stronger {{versions of the}} anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of <b>our</b> <b>kind</b> of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house barnacles. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been fine-tuned through natural selection to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.|$|E

Another episode, [...] "Branch Wars", gave viewers a brief glimpse of the Utica branch, one of several purportedly in upstate New York. Zbornak says that city was on the short list for where to base the show, with some of its writers having ties to Central New York, and that they always intended for at least a branch office to be located there, for reasons of phonetics.

Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in <b>our</b> <b>kind</b> of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people.

2500|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe {{argument has}} also been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination, as it assumes no other forms of life, {{sometimes referred to as}} carbon chauvinism.
