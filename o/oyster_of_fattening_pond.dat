40|$|Purpose. To {{reproduce}} Amur carp population using cryopreserved {{sperm and}} analyze some biological and fish culture peculiarities of the reproduced fish stock. Methodology. Generally accepted methods for fish culture [1]. Experimental reproduction {{was carried out}} in pond conditions of «Carpathian vodogray» LTD (Lisnevychi village, Pustomytivsky district, Lviv region). Hydrochemical analysis was carried out classically by O. Alуokin (1970) [2], hydrobiological studies in the fatting ponds according to V. Zhadin (1956, 1960) [3, 4]. Haemoglobin concentration was determined by hemocyanin method of G. Dervis, A. Vorobiov [5]. Blood for this method was collected from fish heart with the use of Pasteur pipettes in Eppendorf tubes with heparin. Following exterior morphometric parameters were analysed: body weight (m, g), standard fish body length (l, cm), largest body height (H, cm) and body circumference (O cm). Following exterior indices were calculated based on these parameters: body depth index (l/H), body circumference index (l/O) and Fulton’s condition factor (Kv). The study was carried out using two groups of carp: control and experimental. The first group was reproduced from the native sperm, the second from the cryopreserved sperm. Findings. Carp reproduction and growing was carried out using native and cryopreserved sperm. This work contains the results of growing 1 + Amur carp of experimental and control groups. Hydrochemical and hydrobiological parameters <b>of</b> the <b>fattening</b> <b>ponds</b> were studied. Peculiarities of the exterior and some hematological parameters of the carp of different origin were characterized. Originality. For the first time we performed a comparison of some biological parameters of Amur carp reproduced using native and cryopreserved sperm. Practical Value. Considering the economic importance of Amur carp due to its use in hybridization, reproduction of its population {{plays an important role in}} the development of the stocks of the pure forms of Amur carp and in the provision of carp farms with appropriate genetic material for its use in the breeding selection...|$|R
40|$|A low {{efficiency}} <b>of</b> bull <b>fattening</b> {{resulted in}} a decrease of beef production in Poland. One of the possibilities of the improvement <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> efficiency is a proper choice of decisions concerning the course <b>of</b> a <b>fattening</b> process. Making the optimal decisions can be supported by means of dynamic programming (DP) models, using the hierarchic Markov process (HMP) technique.

Fattening and hardening period varied from 10 to 30 days. The Sundarban mangrove, tidal rivers, estuaries, canals, shrimp farms and <b>fattening</b> <b>ponds</b> were the sources of mud crabs.

Beef {{is one of the}} main products of cattle breeding sometimes provided by <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> heifers, cows and bulls. Producing meat with the highest quality with low costs is the main goal <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> the cattles. I have tested the influence of selected fators on the fattening capacity and carcass values of Czech Fleckvieh bulls in the control station as well as the economic requirements <b>of</b> the <b>fattening</b> period.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to compare productivity traits of two pig genotypes fattened in two different ways, on deep litter and in a conventional way (flat deck), and to determine whether there was microclimatic influence on the productivity traits <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> pigs. The research was carried out on 57 <b>fattening</b> pigs <b>of</b> both sex, divided into two groups by their housing. Each group consisted of pigs of two genotypes, i. e. three-way crossbreeds of Large White and German Landrace (LW x GL) in the dam line, and of German Landrace and 8 Pietrain (P) in the sire line. Pigs were fed ad libitum with isocaloric and isoprotein diets. During the whole experiment, temperature, air moisture, air circulation speed and the content of NH 3 and CO 2 were measured in pens. No statistically significant differences were recorded with respect to temperature, air moisture, air circulation speed and content of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and ammonia (NH 3) in the air in pens with deep litter and without it (P> 0. 05). Pigs housed without deep litter had statistically highly significant (P< 0. 01) higher final weights than pigs kept on deep litter. Pigs crossed with Pietrain as a terminal breed, kept in pens without deep litter, had statistically significantly higher (P< 0. 05) average daily gains than pigs of the same genotype kept on deep litter. In the finishing phase <b>of</b> <b>fattening,</b> group <b>of</b> pigs being kept in pens without deep litter had statistically higher average daily gains than pigs kept on deep litter (P< 0. 05). The way <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> had statistically highly significant (P< 0. 001) influence on live weight of pigs in the first, second and fourth fattening phase.

Bulls were five months old when the research commenced and they were eleven months old when the reserch was terminated. All body dimensions were measured by Litin stick except for breast circuit, metacarpus circuit and body weight. Bulls were tied and remained at the same place during their fattening period staying in ordinary cow-shed made of brick. All height measures increased at the relatively equal pace during the fattening period. Withers height increased most and back height increased the least. Tenderness of the back appeared to be most prominent at the end <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> period. Concerning length dimensions, body length developed quickest, head length slowest. As far as body width of bulls is considered the fastest growth was recorded concerning pelvis breadth; head front breadth increased the least. Breast depth was most notable at the point of bulls entering the category of very good condition during their fattening process. Brest circuit increase, as well as metacarups circuit and body weighat increase, were considerably quicker during the period of bulls going from medium condition category to good condition category then from the middle to the end <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> period. Breathing and body temperature remainer almost the same during the fattening period and the process <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> itself did not influence them. Blood sedimentation of bulls remained approximately the same during periods of medium and good condition state. Blood sedimentation increased constantly after bulls reacshed very good condition state, that is, it increased due to intensive feeding and richer accumulation of fat tissue of simenthaler bulls...|$|R

The production system can be difficult to optimise, therefore the objective {{of this study was to}} develop a model to optimise the grazing strategy, feed level in winter and time <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> and slaughter in organic steer production with regard to economic output at steer level. The steer model is a 4 -level hierarchical Markov process with decisions defined at three levels. Decisions taken in the model include grazing strategy (permanent or ryegrass/clover pasture), feed level in winter (high and low), time for beginning <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> (age 19 - 27 months) and time of slaughter (age 19 - 30 months). Overall optimal strategies at child level 1 with regard to economic output per produced steer were low feeding {{level in the}} winter period, grazing on permanent pastures in the first grazing season, whereas ryegrass/clover pastures gives the optimal net return per steer in the second and third grazing season.

The results of the conducted research show that the decision on buying mercantile maize mainly contributes to improving competitiveness of family farms directed at the final production <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> beef cattle compared with the decision on buying alfalfa hay.
