The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended <b>on</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, <b>on</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E

25|$|The Dieppe Raid of 1942 {{had shown}} that the Allies could not rely <b>on</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{penetrate}} the Atlantic Wall to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed sufficient depth of water under their keels, together with dockside cranes, to off-load their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain Operation Overlord and the Battle of Normandy. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour: breakwater, piers, roadways etc.|$|E
25|$|Although WCW tried all {{it could}} to {{alleviate}} the strain of debt in early 2001, the financial burdens proved too heavy to bear for the promotion and its new parent, AOL Time Warner. Once it gained the power to sell off WCW, AOL Time Warner looked to unload its financial albatross. A sale nearly occurred in late 2000 to Bischoff {{and a group of}} private investors calling themselves Fusient Media Ventures, with news reports and even Eric Bischoff declaring a deal was in place. However, Fusient backed out when Turner networks head Jamie Kellner formally cancelled all WCW programming from its television networks. With no network on which to air its programming, WCW was of little value to Fusient, whose offer depended <b>on</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue to air WCW programming on the Turner networks, despite the fact that WCW, according to Bischoff in his book, had received offers from FOX and NBC.|$|E

In the press, Horatio was accused of {{ignoring}} warnings and allowing Aborigines to encroach on his property. The retribution was also called excessive. Tom vehemently defended his father against any perceived criticism. Privately, in his letter to Harrison, he admitted, [...] "if we had used common precaution all would have been well". It was later revealed that, prior to leaving the camp, Tom advised Horatio to be watchful of the local Aborigines, but according to Hammersley, [...] "the old man prided himself <b>on</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manage the blacks ... and said they would never harm him."

The author Martin Banham thought that many of Hordern's characters shared a general identity of [...] "an absent-minded, good-hearted English eccentric". The American journalist Mel Gussow, writing in Hordern's obituary in The New York Times in 1995, described the actor as being [...] "a classical actor with the soul of a clown", while the actors John Hurt and Michael Bryant described Hordern as being [...] "the Austin Princess among British actors", which implied to the author Sheridan Morley that Hordern possessed an element of [...] "reliability but [...] a faint lack of charisma". Morley, who wrote Hordern's biography for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, went on to describe the actor as being [...] "one of the great eccentrics of his profession, perched perilously somewhere half way between Alistair Sim and Alec Guinness".|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} {{development}} process as smooth as possible, Hataya tried {{to work in the}} same environment as Sasaki so that they could exchange data more efficiently. The main tools and software used during development were Digital Performer and Pro Tools, which, according to Hataya, were the standard tools used in music production. In order to stress that the atmosphere of Journey of Dreams was centred around surrealism and dreams themselves, Sasaki discarded tying the game's music down to a single genre and took the approach of not having a clear musical policy. Sasaki also ensured that each theme included the exhilaration of [...] "flying in the air", as it was a core element of gameplay. Hataya echoed that the music of the game was produced by focusing <b>on</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> empathise with the feeling of flying, as well as to exemplify the game's atmosphere and characters. Since the team were aware that Journey of Dreams had a greater sense of adventure than the original, the team knew that they could incorporate a larger variety of music into it so that players would enjoy a wider range of emotions. In addition to composing the music itself, Hataya took the responsibility of re-arranging Sasaki's music in different ways so that the theme matched the in-game situation. Hataya said that he and Sasaki produced around 70 percent of the game's music between them; the rest was produced by Sega's sound team.|$|E

[...] If there are membership fees to attend a meeting, prohibitions <b>on</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> spend money for membership would be an abridgement of the right to peaceful assembly.
