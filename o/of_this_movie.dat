Costumes were kept for future Fox productions or given to homeless shelters, rather than thrown away. Hybrid vehicles were used and crew members had orders to turn off their car engines if they sat in their vehicles for more than three minutes.|$|E
500|$|The {{script was}} written by Jerry Gracio, {{influenced}} by the poem The Hound of Heaven, and won first prize at the scriptwriting competition hosted by the Film Development Council of the Philippines in 2000. This {{attracted the attention of}} Laurice Guillen, who bought the script (the first time in her career that she had done so) and signed on to direct the eventual film. The script was brought to Star Cinema, who became interested in producing it, but production stalled due to difficulties finding an appropriate actress to play Malen. Guillen stated that [...] "Since she was a Magdalene, she had to be sexy but she also had to be much more than that....I was shown many sexy actresses, some of them name stars, but I couldn't find my Santa-Santita. I felt that the role should go to someone relatively new, who had no fixed image, so {{that there would be no}} expectations". An additional problem was over the religious content of the film, which met with controversy. Guillen eventually found Angelica Panganiban to play Malen, and after five years without production, work on the film began for Unitel Pictures International, whose CEO stated that [...] "the majority of Filipinos, the so-called masses, are not the targets <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>movie.</b> Those who frequent the cineplexes and look for fresh material in the movies are". The title, Santa Santita, translates as [...] "saint who is not really a saint".|$|E
5000|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a rare zero-star rating, listed {{it as one}} of his most hated films of all time, {{describing}} the film thus: [...] "This movie doesn't scrape the bottom <b>of</b> the barrel. <b>This</b> <b>movie</b> isn't the bottom <b>of</b> the barrel. <b>This</b> <b>movie</b> isn't below the bottom <b>of</b> the barrel. <b>This</b> <b>movie</b> doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels....

500|$|Lindelof {{said that}} {{the other parts of}} the script were strong enough to survive without the Alien hallmarks, such as the Alien creature, which he {{believed}} had been diluted by the exposure it had received. He said, [...] " [...] were just looking for someone to say to them, Hey, we don't need the Alien stuff in here. It shouldn't be about that. It can be a part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>movie,</b> but it shouldn't be what it's about." [...] Lindelof {{said that the}} film could instead run parallel to the Alien series and that a sequel would be Prometheus 2 and not Alien, and submitted an idea for how such a sequel could work. Lindelof met with the producers the following morning, and was hired shortly afterward in late 2010. Under Lindelof, the script diverged from Spaihts's Alien prequel into an original creation. Scott and Lindelof worked together five days a week between July and August 2010 to construct the vision Scott wanted to convey and decide what script changes were needed, including scaling back the Alien symbolism and tropes. In August and September 2010, Lindelof spent almost five weeks writing his first draft, which he submitted in mid-September 2010. Inspired by Blade Runner and Spaihts's script, Lindelof thought that {{it would be possible to}} combine an Alien story of action and horror with [...] "the Blade Runner thematic," [...] to ask bigger questions than he felt were normally posed in science fiction films. Lindelof said, ...|$|E
500|$|Viewing The Lord of the Rings as {{a holiday}} film, United Artists {{pressured}} Bakshi to complete it on schedule for its intended November 15, 1978, release. Once it was finished, Bakshi {{was told that}} audiences would not pay to see an incomplete story; over his objections, The Lord of the Rings was marketed with no indication that a second part would follow. Reviews of the film were mixed, but it was generally seen as a [...] "flawed but inspired interpretation". Newsdays Joseph Gelmis wrote that [...] "the film's principal reward is a visual experience unlike anything that other animated features are doing at the moment". Roger Ebert called Bakshi's effort a [...] "mixed blessing" [...] and [...] "an entirely respectable, occasionally impressive job [...] still falls {{far short of the}} charm and sweep of the original story". Vincent Canby found it [...] "both numbing and impressive". David Denby of New York felt that the film would not make sense to viewers who had not read the book. He wrote that it was too dark and lacked humor, concluding, [...] "The lurid, meaningless violence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>movie</b> left me exhausted and sickened by the end." [...] The film, which cost $4 million to produce, grossed $30.5 million. The studio refused to fund the sequel, which would have adapted the remainder of the story. The Lord of the Rings won the Golden Gryphon at the 1980 Giffoni Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|The {{shooting}} script features {{a scene in}} Angela's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a [...] "big scene on a freeway" [...] in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, {{but only if the}} scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: [...] "When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back." [...] Jane asks: [...] "And what do you see?" [...] Ricky: [...] "Beauty." [...] Ball said, [...] "They wanted to cut that scene. They said it's not important. I said, 'You're out of your fucking mind. It's {{one of the most important}} scenes in the movie!' If any one line is the heart and soul <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>movie,</b> that is the line." [...] Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a [...] "turning point" [...] for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through 10 drafts.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, writing: [...] "I give the movie a {{negative}} review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying {{us what we}} more or less deserve from a Batman story. No matter how hard you try, superheroes and film noir don't go together; {{the very essence of}} noir is that there are no more heroes." [...] He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that [...] "the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum called DeVito [...] "a pale substitute for Jack Nicholson from the first film" [...] and felt that [...] "there's no suspense in Batman Returns whatsoever". Batman comic book writer/artist Matt Wagner was quoted as saying: [...] "I hated how Batman Returns made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked." [...] Ty Burr in Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-; he wrote that [...] "Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's more going on under the surface <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>movie</b> than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by Batman Returns: Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film." ...|$|E
500|$|When The Fabulous Baker Boys was {{released}} in 1989, the idea of Pfeiffer portraying a sex worker who becomes a singer immediately garnered attention from the media. Pfeiffer's performance of [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] was used heavily to promote the film; the attention garnered by this particular musical sequence rivaled those of every other film released that year. Pfeiffer continued to generate significant press even after the studio was forced to remove The Fabulous Baker Boys from most theaters to which it had initially been released due to financial concerns. In 1990, Empire magazine published an article entitled [...] "The Fabulous Pfeiffer Girl" [...] in homage to the actress' role. Ultimately, Pfeiffer's performance garnered widespread acclaim from nearly every critic who reviewed the film. The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin wrote that [...] "Pfeiffer is [...] unexpected... choice for this musical bombshell" [...] but ultimately admitted that she [...] "proves to be electrifyingly right." [...] According to Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel, [...] "Pfeiffer does as much for this movie as her Susie does for the Baker boys' act", praising all of her musical performances. Referencing one of her character's lines in which Susie negatively compares the song [...] "Feelings" [...] to parsley, Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers insisted, [...] "Michelle Pfeiffer... is not parsley. Take her out <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>movie,</b> and the movie would evaporate." [...] Travers credits the actress with resurrecting the film during its final moments, opining, [...] "The bounce goes out of the movie until Pfeiffer returns to wrap things up", concluding, [...] "the Bridges brothers are a winning pair. But make no mistake: It's Michelle Pfeiffer who puts the 'fabulous' into Baker Boys." [...] Steve Simels of Entertainment Weekly agreed that Pfeiffer [...] "saves Baker Boys from cliché", going on to hail the actress as [...] "a marvel... so funny and vulnerable that she almost makes her indifferently written bad-girl-with-a-heart-of-gold into something three-dimensional and believable." [...] Vanity Fairs Katey Rich concurred: [...] "The film is ostensibly about the Baker (and Bridges) boys, but Pfeiffer stole the show" [...] by [...] "endow her lounge-singer character {{with a lot more}} soul and vulnerability than she needed to." [...] Contributing to The Morton Report, Chaz Lipp agreed that [...] "Pfeiffer feels absolutely authentic in the role... put just the right spin on her line readings to sidestep cliche at every turn", appreciating the actress for interpreting Susie as more than simply a stock character. Despite lamenting that the three main actors [...] "become less interesting" [...] {{towards the end of the}} film, TV Guide agreed that although [...] "the Bridges boys give typically solid performances, it's Pfeiffer who deserves the most credit". The Independents David Thomson was particularly impressed with Pfeiffer's singing, opining, [...] "Anyone who can sing like that would be in Las Vegas, not holding together a piano act in the bars and clubs of Seattle". The Chicago Reader film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum agreed, calling Pfeiffer [...] "a terrific singer." ...|$|E
