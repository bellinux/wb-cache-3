5|$|The {{captaincy}} {{was given}} to Vic Richardson, Bradman's predecessor as South Australian captain. Cricket author Chris Harte's analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> that a prior (unspecified) commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia. Harte attributed an ulterior motive to his relocation: the off-field behaviour of Richardson and other South Australian players had displeased the South Australia Cricket Association (SACA), which was looking for new leadership. To help improve discipline, Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the South Australian and Australian teams. He took his adopted state to its first Sheffield Shield title for 10years, Bradman weighing in with personal contributions of 233 against Queensland and 357 against Victoria. He finished the season with 369 (in 233minutes), a South Australian record, made against Tasmania. The bowler who dismissed him, Reginald Townley, would later become leader of the Tasmanian Liberal Party.|$|E

Reegan’s paymaster, {{and the real}} {{organiser}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> <b>is</b> revealed: General Carrington. The General's actions have been prompted by paranoia, arising from his own encounter with the aliens {{when he was an}} astronaut on Mars Probe Six, where he witnessed his co-pilot, Daniels, killed by merely touching one of them. Carrington's mind is broken: he has lured the three aliens to Earth in order to expose them on television, and intends to call on {{the nations of the world}} to attack them. The use of the ambassadors to kill was done simply to arouse public opinion against them. But Carrington is so mentally disturbed by his experiences that he cannot grasp the fact that the aliens can destroy the world, and cannot be defeated.|$|E
25|$|Chris Harte has {{thoroughly}} {{researched the}} files of the SACA, and written histories of both the SACA and Australian cricket. His analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> that an (unspecified) prior commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia. Moreover, Harte attributes an ulterior motive to the SACA's recruitment of Bradman. The issue of the off-field behaviour of Vic Richardson, and some other regular SA players, had festered {{over a number of}} years and the SACA was desperate for a solution. Therefore, they wanted Bradman to provide new leadership and improve discipline, as well as score runs. Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the SA and Australian teams. He took his adopted state to the Sheffield Shield for the first time in ten years and set a string of SA records along the way.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{the rape}} of Tamar in 2 Samuel, Rapoport states that [...] "Amnon is an unmitigatedly detestable figure. Literarily, he is the evil foil to Tamar's courageous innocence. [...] The Bible wants the reader to {{simultaneously}} appreciate, mourn, and cheer for Tamar as we revile and despise Amnon." [...] Regarding the same passage, Bader wrote that [...] "Tamar's perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> given credibility; indeed Amnon's lying with her proved to be violating her. Simultaneously with increasing Tamar's credibility, the narrator discredits Amnon." [...] Trible opined that [...] " [...] words are honest and poignant; they acknowledge female servitude."

2500|$|In 1:2, Malachi has {{the people}} of Israel {{question}} God's love for them. This introduction to the book illustrates {{the severity of the}} situation which Malachi addresses. The graveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> also indicated by the dialectical style with which Malachi confronts his audience. Malachi proceeds to accuse his audience of failing to respect God as God deserves. One way in which this disrespect is made manifest is through the substandard sacrifices which Malachi claims are being offered by the priests. While Elohim demands animals that are [...] "without blemish" [...] (Leviticus 1:3, NRSV), the priests, who were [...] "to determine whether the animal was acceptable" [...] (Mason 143), were offering blind, lame and sick animals for sacrifice because they thought nobody would notice.|$|E

[...] In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explains that he was [...] "nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him..."

2500|$|General {{interpretation}} {{about the}} freedom of religion {{as described in the}} constitution in Malaysia is that a person has a right to practice his or her religion freely. This freedom does not grant a person a right to change his or her religion [...] "at a whim and fancy". For example, a Muslim who wants to convert to another religion must get an explicit permission from a syariah court. The syariah courts rarely grant such requests, except in cases where a person has actually lived his or her whole adult life as a person of different religion, and only wants to change the official documents to reflect this fact. The Islamic interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> that only the syariah courts can decide who is a Muslim and who is not. A person does not have such freedom, and so cannot have a say in the judgement given in a syariah court.|$|E

But it is absolutely to say that conservatism implies a certain submission to reality; and this war has an unrealistic frank and is being conscripted by events." [...] In a February 2006 column published at National Review Online and distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, Buckley stated unequivocally that, [...] "One cannot doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed." [...] Buckley has also stated that [...] "...it's important that we acknowledge in the inner councils of state that it (the war) has failed, so that we should look for opportunities to cope with that failure." ...|$|E

2500|$|In contradistinction to Dover Wilson and Waith, several {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} whilst the speech may not work on the page, it can work in performance. Discussing the Deborah Warner RSC production at The Swan in 1987, which used an unedited text, Stanley Wells argues that Donald Sumpter's delivery of the speech [...] "became a deeply moving attempt to master the facts and thus to overcome the emotional shock of a previously unimagined horror. We had {{the sense of a}} suspension of time, as if the speech represented an articulation, necessarily extended in expression, of a sequence of thoughts and emotions, that might have taken no more than a second or two to flash through the character's mind, like a bad dream." [...] Also speaking of the Warner production and Sumpter's performance, Alan C. Dessen writes [...] "we observe Marcus, step-by-step, use his logic and Lavinia's reactions to work out what has happened, so that the spectators both see Lavinia directly and see through his eyes and images. In the process the horror <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> filtered through a human consciousness in a way difficult to describe but powerful to experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the most}} common version of the false-belief task (often called the [...] "'Sally-Anne' test" [...] or [...] "'Sally-Anne' task"), {{children}} are told or shown a story involving two characters.

While she {{is out of the}} room, Anne takes the marble from the basket and puts it into the box. Sally returns, and the child is then asked where Sally will look for the marble. The child passes the task if she answers that Sally will look in the basket, where Sally put the marble; the child fails the task if she answers that Sally will look in the box, where the child knows the marble is hidden, even though Sally cannot know this, since she did not see it hidden there. To pass the task, the child must be able to understand that another's mental representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> different from their own, and the child must be able to predict behavior based on that understanding.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the events}} in [...] "Judgment Day", the Watchers abandon all pretense of not interfering in the Game. Believing that MacLeod is {{responsible}} for the slaughter of the Watchers, Jack Shapiro, their head, orders his death and, at the beginning of [...] "One Minute To Midnight", Duncan is trying to survive their manhunt. Believing the only way to avoid a war between the Watchers and the Immortals is to convince Shapiro of his innocence, MacLeod goes to their battle headquarters, only to find that the Immortal who is the real killer has beaten him to the punch. The bitter irony <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> revealed - Jacob Galati is hunting the Watchers after Horton killed his Immortal wife, Irena, during his rampage across Europe in 1992 that ended when he killed Darius in Paris, ("The Hunters"). Jacob refuses to believe that the Watchers are not evil, but agrees to meet Joe, who has been nursed back to health by Methos. Joe won't meet Jacob though and helps the Watchers to capture him. Duncan is forced to stand by whilst the Watchers murder Jacob and is devastated to receive his friend's Quickening. Methos rejects Joe and the Watchers for what they have become, but MacLeod returns to confront Shapiro, {{to put an end to}} the killing. When Shapiro refuses, Joe belatedly realizes that his friend has become another Horton and helps Duncan to secure peace with the Watchers. Wanting nothing to do with Paris, Duncan returns to Seacouver. There, he finds the Immortal Cassandra waiting for him. She is being hunted by Roland Kantos, one of her students, and she tells Duncan of a [...] "Prophecy" [...] that he will defeat great evil. Kantos relies on the hypnotic power of his voice to defeat his opponents, but Duncan, after nearly losing his head to Kantos' tricks, defeats the mesmerist by plugging his ears. Joe comes to the dojo and gets the cold shoulder from Duncan, but before he leaves, he tells MacLeod that Richie is in town, ("The End Of Innocence"). Duncan tries to make his peace with Richie, but the young Immortal is still plagued by nightmares after Duncan almost killed him in [...] "Something Wicked" [...] and warns Duncan to stay away from him. When Richie challenges and kills Carter Wellan, his mentor Haresh Clay comes for Richie, breaking his sword. Richie is arrested trying to steal another one from a museum and is bailed out by Duncan, who warns him that Clay is as good as they come and gives him a sword. The two Immortals work out their differences and, now acting as equals, it is Duncan who asks Richie to stand aside as he avenges his humiliation at Clay's hands when they first met and takes his head. In [...] "Archangel" [...] Duncan accidentally kills Richie thinking he is a demon he is destined to face.|$|E
2500|$|Following ALFs conclusion, Clausen was {{unemployed}} {{for seven}} months. Clausen's friend suggested {{him to a}} producer from the Fox animated series The Simpsons who {{were looking for a}} new composer. Clausen [...] "had no interest in doing animation" [...] and [...] "wanted to be a drama composer." [...] However, the show's creator Matt Groening told him [...] "we don't look upon this as being a cartoon but a drama where the characters are drawn, and we would like it scored that way." [...] Clausen took the job. Groening told Clausen that the [...] "emotion [...] scored first and the action scored second", unlike many other cartoons, and that [...] "scoring the emotions of the characters" [...] was the primary aim for The Simpsons. Clausen's first episode was [...] "Treehouse of Horror", the third episode of season two, in 1990. It served as an audition and he was hired permanently after that. He has since scored almost all of the music and songs which have appeared on the show, across a wide range of musical styles {{through the end of the}} 28th season. He conducted a 35 piece orchestra for the music, a rarity for television shows, and recorded the score for an episode every week. Clausen wrote an episode's score during the week, recorded it on a Friday, with some variation if vocals are required. The limited timeframe proved the most challenging aspect of the job for Clausen; he was once required to write 57musical cues in one week. For the show's original songs production is much longer; Clausen records the music to the writers' lyrics, over seven or eight months the scene is animated, and then Clausen can re-record the song with a full orchestra. The full orchestra allows easy transition between the wide range of musical styles required for the show. Clausen noted: [...] "The greatest composing challenge has been to try to make some kind of musical sense out of the cues when I have only a few seconds to make a musical statement. We have a joke on the scoring stage that I can make you feel five ways in thirteen seconds. We say it in jest, but the reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> that I am required to do just that quite often." [...] Clausen intentionally opted against composing themes for each character, with some exceptions such as Mr. Burns, and instead [...] " [...] each story its own theme and thematic development...That approach helps to give each story its own special identification, more like individual mini-movies." [...] He supplements the orchestra with additional instruments, such as extra brass for the episode [...] "Cape Feare", for which Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which continued to be played whenever Bob gets out of prison in subsequent episodes. It is based on the score of the movie Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical requests of the writers range from rerecord a specific piece of music to compose something based on this character's emotion in a scene.|$|E
