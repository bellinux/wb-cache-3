5|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of no {{economic}} value, the slender smooth-hound is occasionally caught incidentally in bottom trawls and <b>on</b> <b>bottom</b> longlines. Much of its northern range lies in little-fished waters, {{and thus the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. However, this shark's very low fecundity would render it susceptible to population depletion should fishing pressure increase in the future.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the cloudy {{catshark}} adapts well to captivity and has {{reproduced in}} the aquarium. It {{is often used}} as a model organism in physiology research. On September 25, 1995, Masuda Motoyashi and colleagues used this species to perform the first successful artificial insemination of a shark or ray. The cloudy catshark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries with bottom fishing nets including trawls and gillnets, as well as <b>on</b> <b>bottom</b> longlines. Captured individuals are typically discarded, possibly with a high survival rate due to their hardiness. Some 40% of the fish discarded in Yamaguchi Prefecture fisheries are of this species. The bottom trawl fishery operating off Fukushima Prefecture may catch over a ton of cloudy catsharks annually, which are also discarded.|$|E
5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two <b>on</b> <b>bottom</b> rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, British Waterways {{began to}} {{introduce}} a hydraulic system for operating paddles, especially those <b>on</b> <b>bottom</b> gates, which are the heaviest to operate. A metal cylinder about a foot in diameter was mounted on the balance beam and contained a small oil-operated hydraulic pump. A spindle protruded from the front face and was operated by a windlass in the usual way, the energy being transferred to the actual paddle by small bore pipes. The system was widely installed and on some canals it became very common. There {{turned out to be}} two serious drawbacks. It was much more expensive to install and maintain than traditional gear and went wrong more frequently, especially once vandals learned to cut the pipes. Even worse, it had a safety defect, in that the paddle once in the raised position could not be dropped in an emergency, but had to be wound down, taking a good deal longer. These factors led to the abandonment of the policy in the late 1990s, but examples of it survive all over the system, as it is usually not removed until the gates need replacing, which happens about every twenty years.|$|E
500|$|The first {{numbered}} {{routes in}} Delaware were announced in 1925 {{with the creation}} of the U.S. Highway System, in which US 13, US 40, and US 113 were planned to run through the state. These three U.S. Highways, along with US 122, were designated through Delaware on November 11, 1926. In 1930 and again in 1932, the DSHD recommended giving numbers to state roads to supplement the existing U.S. Highway System. By 1936, Delaware began assigning numbers to state routes. The original state route marker was a square with [...] "DEL" [...] on top and the route number <b>on</b> <b>bottom</b> in a block font. By 1955, the shield was modified to a square with [...] "DELAWARE" [...] on top and the route number <b>on</b> <b>bottom</b> in FHWA Series font. In 1964, the route marker became a cutout circle with [...] "DEL" [...] on top and the route number <b>on</b> <b>bottom.</b> The current route marker was introduced in 1971.|$|E
500|$|Throughout their range, {{substantial}} {{quantities of}} velvet bellies are caught as bycatch in bottom trawls meant for shrimp and lobsters, and deepwater longlines meant for other fish. Lacking commercial value, these sharks {{are almost always}} discarded with extremely high mortality, though occasionally they are dried and salted or made into fishmeal. The IUCN has listed the velvet belly under Least Concern overall, as its population remains stable across much of its range, and it is afforded some protection in the Mediterranean from a 2005 ban <b>on</b> <b>bottom</b> trawling below [...] However, in the northeastern Atlantic it has been assessed as Near Threatened, as its numbers have declined by almost 20% from 1970 to 19982004. The slow reproductive rate of this species limits its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E

500|$|Commercial {{fisheries}} for {{the copper}} shark exist off New Zealand, Australia (though the [...] "bronze whaler fishery" [...] of Western Australia actually takes mostly dusky sharks), South Africa, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico, and China; it {{also contributes to}} the bycatch of other commercial fisheries across its range. This species is caught in gillnets and <b>on</b> <b>bottom</b> longlines, and to a much lesser extent in bottom trawls and on pelagic longlines. The meat is sold for human consumption. The copper shark is also popular with recreational fishers in Namibia, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Mexico and California, predominantly by anglers but also by bowfishers and gillnetters. In New Zealand, it is the Carcharhinus species most frequently caught by sport fishers and sustains a small, summer recreational fishery in northern North Island, that mainly captures pregnant and post-partum females {{and for the most}} part practices tag and release. A tag and release program is also practiced in Namibia.|$|E
500|$|... {{there are}} many flags {{worldwide}} that are similar or near identical to the flag of Poland despite being unrelated to it. For example, the historical flag of Bohemia, the major historical region of Poland's southern neighbor, the Czech Republic, consists of two horizontal stripes, white on top and red <b>on</b> <b>bottom.</b> Similarly to the flag of Poland, it is of heraldic origin, the coat of arms of Bohemia being Gules, a lion rampant, queue fourchÃ©e Argent, crowned, langued and armed Or, that is a silver double-tailed lion in a red field. The white-and-red Bohemian flag came into use definitively in 12th century, much before Bohemia became a province of Austria-Hungary. After {{the end of the}} First World War in 1918, it was shortly used as a flag of the newly formed Czecho-Slovak Republic. In 1920, in order to avoid confusion with the Polish flag, a blue triangle was added to create a flag used by Czechoslovakia until its dissolution in 1992 and currently is used as the flag of the Czech Republic. However, the traditional flag of Bohemia in proportion 2:3 (by contrast to 5:8 proportion of the Polish flag) was introduced again from 1990 to 1993 as the flag of the then not independent Czech Republic, one of the constituent entities of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia the traditional white-and-red Bohemian flag has become obsolete and fallen into oblivion by the Bohemian public.|$|E
