60|$|For out of {{this that}} we call Atheism come so many other isms and falsities, each falsity with its misery at its heels!--A soul is not like wind (spiritus, or breath) {{contained}} within a capsule; the Almighty Maker is not like a Clockmaker that once, in old immemorial ages, having made his Horologe of a Universe, sits ever since and sees it go! Not at all. Hence comes Atheism; come, as we say, many other isms; and as the sum of all, comes Valetism, the reverse of Heroism; sad root of all woes whatsoever. For indeed, as no man ever saw the above-said wind-element enclosed within its capsule, and finds it at bottom more deniable than conceivable; so too he finds, in spite of Bridgwater Bequests, your Clockmaker Almighty an entirely questionable affair, a deniable affair;--and accordingly denies it, and along with it so much else. Alas, one knows not what and how much else! For the faith in an Invisible, Unnameable, Godlike, present everywhere in all that we see and work and suffer, {{is the essence of}} all faith whatsoever; and that once denied, or still worse, asserted with lips only, and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bound</b> prayerbooks only, what other thing remains believable? That Cant well-ordered is marketable Cant; that Heroism means gas-lighted Histrionism; that seen with 'clear eyes' (as they call Valet-eyes), no man is a Hero, or ever was a Hero, but all men are Valets and Varlets. The accursed practical quintessence of all sorts of Unbelief! For if there be now no Hero, and the Histrio himself begin to be seen into, what hope is there for the seed of Adam here below? We are the doomed everlasting prey of the Quack; who, now in this guise, now in that, is to filch us, to pluck and eat us, by such modes as are convenient for him. For the modes and guises I care little. The Quack once inevitable, let him come swiftly, let him pluck and eat me;--swiftly, that I may at least have done with him; for in his Quack-world I can have no wish to linger. Though he slay me, yet will I not trust in him. Though he conquer nations, and have all the Flunkies of the Universe shouting at his heels, yet will I know well that he is an Inanity; that for him and his there is no continuance appointed, save only in Gehenna and the Pool. Alas, the Atheist world, from its utmost summits of Heaven and Westminster-Hall, downwards through poor seven-feet Hats and 'Unveracities fallen hungry,' down to the lowest cellars and neglected hunger-dens of it, is very wretched.|$|E

50|$|Pointers are {{implemented}} on the B5000 by indexed descriptors. During indexing operations, pointers are checked at each increment {{to make sure}} that neither the source nor the destination blocks are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bound.</b> During a scan or replace operation, the mechanisms used to read or copy large blocks of memory, both source and destination are checked at each word increment for a valid memory tag. Each memory segment is bounded by tag 3 words, which would make such an operation fail. Each memory segment containing integrity sensitive data, such as program code, is stored in tag 3 words, making an uncontrolled read - let alone modification - impossible. Thus a significant source of program errors can be detected early before software goes into production, and a more significant class of attacks on system security is not possible.|$|E
50|$|In sports, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> (or out-of-bounds) {{refers to}} being outside the playing {{boundaries}} of the field. Due to the chaotic nature of play, it is normal in many sports for players and/or the ball to go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> frequently during a game. The legality <b>of</b> going <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> (intentionally or not), and the ease of prevention, vary by sport. In some cases, players may intentionally go or send the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> when it is to their advantage.|$|R

5000|$|In the American game, roqueting a ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> {{or running}} a hoop <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> causes the turn to end, and balls that go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> are {{replaced}} only 9 {{in from the}} boundary rather than 1 yd as in association croquet.

5000|$|In {{the first}} half of the game, while the Jazz led 28-24 with just under 10 minutes left in the second quarter, Jazz guard Howard Eisley saved a pass that almost sent the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bound.</b> As the shot clock was running down, Jazz forward/center Antoine Carr passed the ball a long {{distance}} to Shandon Anderson, but the ball flew over Anderson's hands. Eisley caught the ball and hit a 3-pointer, but referee Dick Bavetta ruled that Eisley released the ball after the shot clock expired. Replays showed that the ball had left Eisley's hands with a second left on the shot clock. (This game took place 4 years before the NBA instituted instant replay to review calls.) Calling the game for NBC, Bob Costas narrated a replay of Eisley's shot: [...] "See if the ball isn't out of his hand. One second...it's on the way, and they missed the call." [...] In the second half, Bulls guard Ron Harper made a jump shot as the shot clock went off that tied it at 79; at the NBC play-by-play, Costas announced that Harper released the ball on time, but commentator Isiah Thomas, narrating a replay of Harper's shot, considered it to be [...] "a tough call." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{quantify}} and analyze the participation/pause game times and stoppages of 11 -a-side soccer. A total of 617 players of 44 Spanish men’s teams and 33 matches of the 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09 men’s soccer players of 2 nd division A and B and 3 rd division were studied. The methodology used is observational and systematic, active and non-participating and with an observational instrument based on a category system. The variables studied were: Stoppages and Game Rhythm. The most frequent stoppage is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bound</b> (mean±SD) (59. 03 ± 10. 15), followed by fouls (37. 33 ± 7. 09). The stoppage which registers the longest duration (in hours, minutes and seconds) is foul (16 ’ 35 ”± 3 ’ 48 ”), followed by <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bound</b> (14 ’ 30 ”± 3 ’ 26 ”). Regarding game rhythm the real time of each match totaled an average of 1 h 36 ’ 14 ”± 2 ’ 03 ” seconds. The actual time of play is on average 49 ’± 4 ’ 44 ” while the pause time is 47 ’ 14 ”± 5 ’ 23 ”seconds. In the description of the implications of pause time in the game dynamics of soccer, some regularities can be observed; such as the fact that the most frequent stoppages are those made due to fouls and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bound</b> and that the duration of the majority of these stoppages varies within a range of 4 to 7 seconds. The pauses have shown to be a major element in the study of soccer game rhythm because they take at least half the total time of the match. Consistent with this, it is understood that game rhythm can easily be improved with regulatory modifications such as the elimination of interruptions because of substitutions...|$|E

50|$|The {{deliberate}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> {{rule has}} a long history in Australian rules football, dating back to the 19th century. Prior to the 1883 season, a rule was introduced to award a free kick against a player who deliberately kicked the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> from a kick-in after a behind. This was extended to putting the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> from an in-play situation at the intercolonial conference prior to the 1886 season. At this time, the rule read almost identically to its present form, stating that a free kick shall be given when a player wilfully kicks or forces the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> while in play. The rules were introduced largely {{to put an end to}} the disliked strategy of kicking the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> as a means of timewasting.|$|R
50|$|In Canadian play, if {{the ball}} is fumbled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds,</b> the play ends with {{possession}} going to the team to last contact the ball in bounds (after the ball has completely left the possession of the fumbling ball carrier).

The ball may not, however, be intentionally kicked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> to gain possession, this is then treated as a scrimmage kick <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> and possession goes to the opposing team. Incidental contact with the foot does not count as kicking the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds.</b> In American play, when a ball is fumbled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds,</b> the last team to have clear possession of the football is awarded possession, unless the ball goes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the back or side of the end zone.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Writing {{correct and}} {{portable}} MPI programs is hard. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bound</b> parameters, inconsistent use of data types {{and many other}} complex violations of using MPI correctly can now automatically be detected at runtime.

To reliably deliver multicast messages in a process group, each process maintains copies of all messages it sends and receives. If a member fails to receive a message, any process which has the message in its buffer can retransmit it. In order to prevent these buffers from growing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bound,</b> stability tracking protocols must be used. That is, whenever a process learns that a message has been received by everyone, it declares this message stable and releases it from the buffer. We investigate several message stability tracking protocols commonly used in a number of popular reliable multicast protocols with a focus on their performance in large scale settings with thousands of participants. To improve the scalability of these protocols significantly, we derive a set of new protocols using a spanning tree structure which scale to at least tens of thousand [...] ...|$|E
