2500|$|A {{more recent}} {{feature is the}} [...] bronze statue of [...] Heisman Trophy winner Nile Kinnick, the statue depicts Kinnick dressed as a scholar, rather than in his {{football}} uniform. The bronze statue is placed near the team entrance to the stadium. [...] When the renovation of the stadium was completed, and the statue unveiled, a tradition among the players began: one player, before entering the locker room, reached <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> the helmet that was placed at Kinnick's feet. From that point on, all Iowa players, before entering the locker room, and after getting off the bus, {{walk up to the}} statue and rub the helmet, as a token of respect for Kinnick - the only Iowa player to ever win the Heisman Trophy.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, head {{football}} coach Terry Hoeppner had a southern Indiana limestone boulder nicknamed [...] "The Rock" [...] installed in the north end zone as a new campus tradition. [...] This limestone boulder was found prior to Hoeppner's first season at IU in the practice field. [...] It was removed, put on a granite slab {{and moved to the}} stadium. The Hoosiers and coach Hoeppner walked <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> the Rock before running onto the field at every home game during Hoeppner's time as head coach (a tradition that continues today). [...] Terry Hoeppner died of brain cancer on June 19, 2007, and The Rock (renamed [...] "Hep's Rock" [...] during a ceremony with the Hoeppner family on November 6, 2010) now serves as motivation for the team as well as a tribute to Hoeppner's influence on the football program.|$|E

60|$|Eliphalet had ambition, {{which is}} not a wholly {{undesirable}} quality. He began to wonder how it would feel to own a few of these valuable fellow-creatures. He reached <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> lightly a young mulatto woman who sat beside him with an infant in her arms. The peculiar dumb expression on her face was lost on Eliphalet. The overseer had laughed coarsely.|$|E
60|$|However, {{there was}} {{physical}} suffering. It came and went, and at such moments {{she saw the}} traces {{of it in the}} tightening of his lips, and longed with womanly intuition to alleviate it.

Beyond the ring, and on either side, as in a fog, she could see the crowded house.|$|E

60|$|Sinclair was {{standing}} guard. The others {{were listening to}} Brady's description of traffic congestion at the Rush Street bridge during the rush hour at night. The fire crackled cheerily. The owners of the yellow-green eyes raised their frightful chorus to the heavens. Conditions seemed again to have returned to normal. And then, as though the hand of Death had reached <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> them all, the five men tensed into sudden rigidity.|$|E
60|$|They were {{a boy and}} girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, {{in their}} humility. Where graceful youth should have filled their {{features}} <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.|$|E
60|$|The softly {{moving and}} {{attentive}} Brownster put the candle on the table, blew it <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> a button, thereby lighting {{up a very}} handsomely furnished room. Then, after performing every possible service for me, with a bow he left me. Throwing myself into a great easy chair, I kicked off my embroidered slippers and put my feet upon another chair gay with satin stripes. Raising my eyes, I saw {{in front of me}} a handsome mirror extending from the floor nearly to the ceiling, and at the magnificent personage which therein met my gaze I could not help laughing aloud.|$|E

60|$|He {{was gone}} {{longer than he}} expected, for Bonbright had left on his desk several telegrams {{concerning}} the Mexican situation that needed immediate replies. Trick camera in hand, Dick returned by a short cut across the house and patio. The dancing couples were ebbing down the arcade and disappearing into the hall, and he leaned against a pillar and watched them go by. Last of all came Paula and Evan, passing so close {{that he could have}} reached <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> them. But, though the moon shone full on him, they did not see him. They saw only each other in the tender sport of gazing.|$|E
60|$|For an instant, the King {{stood as}} tense and white {{as though the}} hand of death had reached <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> his heart with its icy fingers. The episode meant more to him than being bested in play by the best swordsman in England--for that surely was no disgrace--to Henry it seemed prophetic {{of the outcome of}} a future {{struggle}} when he should stand {{face to face with the}} real De Montfort; and then, seeing in De Vac only the creature of his imagination with which he had vested the likeness of his powerful brother-in-law, Henry did what he should like to have done to the real Leicester. Drawing off his gauntlet he advanced close to De Vac.|$|E

60|$|At {{last the}} spear reached <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> the ape-man on the breast {{and when it}} came away, a little trickle of blood ran down the smooth, brown hide and almost {{simultaneously}} there broke from the outer periphery of the expectant audience a woman's shriek which seemed a signal for a series of hideous screamings, growlings and barkings, and a great commotion upon that side of the circle. The victims could not see the cause of the disturbance, but Tarzan did not have to see, for he knew by the voices of the apes the identity of the disturbers. He only wondered what had brought them and what the purpose of the attack, for he could not believe that they had come to rescue him.|$|E
60|$|Janet {{turned to}} the basin again and began rubbing her face vigorously--ceasing for an {{instance}} to make sure of {{the identity of a}} sound reaching her ears despite the splashing of water. Lise was sobbing. Janet dried her face and hands, arranged her hair, {{and sat down on the}} windowsill; the scorn and anger, which had been so intense as completely to possess her, melting into a pity and contempt not unmixed with bewilderment. Ordinarily Lise was hard, impervious to such reproaches, holding her own in the passionate quarrels that occasionally took place between them yet there were times, such as this, when her resistance broke down unexpectedly, and she lost all self control. She rocked to and fro in the chair, her shoulders bowed, her face hidden in her hands. Janet reached <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> her.|$|E

[...] He {{went off}} into an ecstasy of smothered laughter; then his face grew grave, and slowly {{puckered}} {{into a sort}} of comic disgust. Gyp too had seen the humours of her baby, of its queer little reddish pudge of a face, of its twenty-seven black hairs, and the dribble at its almost invisible mouth; but she had also seen it as a miracle; she had felt it, and there surged up from her all the old revolt and more against his lack of consideration. It was not a funny one--her baby! It was not ugly! Or, if it were, she was not fit to be told of it. Her arm tightened round the warm bundled thing against her. Fiorsen put his finger <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> its cheek.|$|E
