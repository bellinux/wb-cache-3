25|$|The {{car barn}} is {{situated}} directly above the power {{house and the}} Cable Car Museum. The museum's entrance is at Washington and Mason. It contains several examples of old cable cars, together with smaller exhibits and a shop. Two galleries allow the visitor to overlook the main power house, and also to descend below the junction of Washington and Mason Streets and see the large cavern where the haulage cables are routed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
25|$|Overwhelmed by {{the sheer}} number of whites, more blacks retreated north on Greenwood Avenue to the edge of town. Chaos ensued as terrified {{residents}} fled for their lives. The rioters shot indiscriminately and killed many residents along the way. Splitting into small groups, they began breaking into houses and buildings, looting. Several blacks later testified that whites broke into occupied homes and ordered the residents <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> where they could be driven or forced to walk to detention centers.|$|E

50|$|On {{the second}} day, <b>the</b> rebels went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Thai Nguyen and {{announced}} a proclamation appealing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> population <b>to</b> support a general uprising. An estimated 300 poor civilians joined roughly 200 ex-prisoners and 130 guards, and the rebels {{were divided into}} two battalions.|$|R
25|$|The {{first to}} arrive on the scene were nurses and doctors from nearby Bucur Maternity Hospital, who were on duty that Friday night. They heard the screams of the injured and went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in robes and {{slippers}} to provide first aid. The first 112 call came at 10:32p.m., and the first emergency service arrived 11 minutes after the call. The State Secretary at the Ministry of Health, Raed Arafat, and deputy Prime Minister Gabriel Oprea arrived at the scene late in the night.|$|E
25|$|On 19 June, Pisciotta {{met with}} Colonel Luca {{and agreed to}} work with him to {{eliminate}} Giuliano. After deliberation and intrigue among Luca's command, it was decided to kill Giuliano on the morning of 5 July in Castelvetrano. Pisciotta would lure Giuliano <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> and a squad of Carabinieri led by Captain Perenze would assassinate the bandit chieftain. Unfortunately for Luca, one of Verdiani's partisans was at the planning meeting, and Verdiani sent Giuliano a letter warning of Pisciotta's betrayal. When Aspanu arrived at the de Maria house after midnight on 5 July, Turi confronted him with Verdiani's communique—somehow, Pisciotta convinced him that he was more trustworthy than the policeman but didn't dare to suggest they leave the house for the ambush. After both men laid down, ostensibly to sleep, Pisciotta waited until Giuliano was asleep. He then shot him twice killing him instantly. Aspanu ran outside, told a waiting Perenze what he'd done, and was spirited out of town. Perenze and his squad hauled Giuliano's corpse to a nearby courtyard, shot it with several rounds, and with Luca concocted a story of an informer, Giuliano's plan to flee the country by plane from Mazzara del Vallo, and the bandit's death in a running gun battle.|$|E
500|$|The {{grand opening}} was held December 16, 1931 with a crowd which {{extended}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Live action variety performances alternated with film showings. Unfortunately for the theater, {{the number of}} tickets sold in the subsequent months {{was not enough to}} keep the theater [...] It closed in June 1932, reopening in 1933 as only a movie theater, devoid of the extravagant live pieces.|$|E
60|$|All over London, at short {{distances}} apart, fire-escapes {{may be seen}} rearing their tall {{heads in}} recesses and corners formed by the angles in churches or other public buildings.

25|$|On 21 May, then-President Thabo Mbeki {{approved}} {{a request from}} the SAPS for deployment of armed forces against the attacks in Gauteng. It {{is the first time}} that the South African government has ordered troops <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> in order <b>to</b> quell unrest since the end of apartheid in 1994.|$|R
50|$|On January 21, 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians {{organised}} a human chain for Ukrainian independence between Kiev and Lviv, {{in memory}} of the 1919 unification of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the West Ukrainian National Republic. Citizens came <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> and highways, forming live chains by holding hands in support of unity.|$|R
2500|$|The central urban {{location}} of the prison also became part of its early character. [...] During the 1910s through 1930s, street peddlers made an occupation of passing outside messages in through the jail's windows and tossing tobacco and opium over the walls; letters and packets would be thrown <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in the opposite direction. [...] Within the prison itself, communication and ideas passed. [...] Indeed, many of the future leading figures in Communist North Vietnam spent time in Maison Centrale during the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E

5000|$|Chowdhury {{was elected}} mayor three times. The {{election}} was cited {{as an example}} of [...] "people power" [...] in the Bangladeshi national media.

During each episode, Eichner goes <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of New York and asks {{pedestrians}} questions about pop culture. Recurring games are [...] "For A Dollar" [...] and [...] "Quizzed in the Face". Eichner {{is also the}} executive producer and creator of the series.|$|R
60|$|I {{never had}} much talent for repartee, but she knocked silly what little I had, and I gulped down my tea a beaten man, while she gloated after me even as I passed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "What an uncommonly pretty girl!" [...] said Bartley, as they {{descended the}} rough {{stairway}} and {{found their way}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> past the dangling rope of a block and tackle wandering up into the cavernous darkness overhead.|$|E
60|$|The hall door below {{opened and}} shut. Footsteps thumped {{off the porch}} and <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Lane heard the giggle of girls, the snap of a car-door, the {{creaking}} of wheels, and then a low hum, dying away.|$|E

50|$|And {{the death}} of an {{imperial}} wife or sultan's mother could be even more extravagant. In one instance, {{the death of}} Hürrem Sultan brought throngs of mourners <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> including <b>the</b> sultan himself, who was traditionally supposed to seclude himself in the palace during the funeral of a family member. Once again, during the ceremony coins and food were distributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attendees, <b>to</b> pay tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> queen's generous and caring nature.|$|R
50|$|Every year, the Passion Week in Málaga takes <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> a real festival {{perceptible}} by {{the five}} senses: processional thrones carrying images that sway {{all along the}} entire route, thousands of penitents lighting and giving colour with their candles and robes, processional marches, as well as aromas of incense and flowers filling the air as the processions pass by {{and thousands of people}} crowded to see and applaud their favorite tronos.|$|R
60|$|They had telegraphed ahead {{concerning}} their coming, and found two chauffeurs employed by Dick Rover and Tom Rover {{on hand to}} receive them and take charge of their baggage. Then they went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> where they found two automobiles awaiting them, one containing Jack's mother and the other the mothers of Fred and the twins.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not long}} before the boat bumped into the slip on the {{opposite}} shore. The shock brought me to a recollection of the present, and in company with the other passengers I went ashore. I had something of a notion that a policeman would be in waiting for me, but none appeared, and I passed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> unaccosted.|$|E
60|$|As {{for this}} Parlement of Paris, now turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> we will without {{reluctance}} leave it there. The Beds of Justice {{it had to}} undergo, in the coming fortnight, at Versailles, in registering, or rather refusing to register, those new-hatched Edicts; and how it assembled in taverns and tap-rooms there, {{for the purpose of}} Protesting, (Weber, i. 299-303.) or hovered disconsolate, with outspread skirts, not knowing where to assemble; and was reduced to lodge Protest 'with a Notary;' and in the end, to sit still (in a state of forced 'vacation'), and do nothing; all this, natural now, as the burying of the dead after battle, shall not concern us. The Parlement of Paris has as good as performed its part; doing and misdoing, so far, but hardly further, could it stir the world.|$|E
5000|$|This {{demand was}} not {{met by the}} Spanish {{government}} and after three days Miguel Ángel Blanco was found shot dead when the deadline expired. More than six million people took <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>to</b> demand his liberation, with massive demonstrations occurring {{as much in the}} Basque regions as elsewhere in Spain, chanting cries of [...] "Assassins" [...] and [...] "Basques yes, ETA no". This response {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Spirit of Ermua".|$|R
5000|$|Pakistan Urdu and Punjabi {{speaking}} personnel {{rounded up}} Bangla speaking armed forces officers, NCOs, and enlisted personnel. Forced disappearances went rampant. On {{the evening of}} 25 March {{in an interview with}} David Frost, Sheikh Mujib still called out openly for negotiation and a united Pakistan. That night the Pakistan Army spilled <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> killing and started Operation Searchlight. It was official, they were not ready for a peaceful transfer of political power <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.|$|R
5000|$|The alien, who {{introduces}} {{himself as}} [...] "Hekon", was initially unsure about Earth and its people, but tells {{them that he}} is looking for a device known as [...] "Shilk", that allows him to travel through space without destroying his body. Shilk, like <b>the</b> spaceship, appears <b>to</b> be attracting water. As he goes <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>to</b> look for <b>the</b> device, the police mistake him for a drug addict and send him off to a police station to be interrogated.|$|R
6000|$|He {{pulled off}} his coat, and conquered the {{difficulties}} of packing in a hurry, {{as if he had}} done nothing else all his life. The landlady herself, appearing with pitiless punctuality exactly at the expiration of the hour, [...] "smoothed her horrid front" [...] in the polite and placable presence of Rufus. He insisted on shaking hands with her; he took pleasure in making her acquaintance; she reminded him, he did assure her, of the lady of the captain-general of the Coolspring Branch of the St. Vitus Commandery; and he would take the liberty to inquire whether they were related or not. Under cover of this fashionable conversation, Simple Sally was taken out of the room by Amelius without attracting notice. She insisted on carrying her threadbare old clothes away with her in the box which had contained the new dress. [...] "I want to look at them sometimes," [...] she said, [...] "and think how much better off I am now." [...] Rufus was the last to take his departure; he persisted in talking to the landlady {{all the way down the}} stairs and <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> door.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{wonderful}} thing I saw during that first eventful visit to the capital was the famed Don Eusebio, the court jester or fool of the President or Dictator Rosas, the [...] "Nero of South America," [...] who lived in his palace at Palermo, just outside the city. I had been sent with my sisters and little brother {{to spend the day}} at the house of an Anglo-Argentine family {{in another part of the}} town, and we were in the large courtyard playing with the children of the house when some one opened a window above us and called out, [...] "Don Eusebio!" [...] That conveyed nothing to me, but the little boys of the house knew what it meant; it meant that if we went quickly <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> we might catch a glimpse of the great man in all his glory. At all events, they jumped up, flinging their toys away, and rushed to the street door, and we after them. Coming out we found quite a crowd of lookers-on, and then down the street, in his general's dress--for it was one of the Dictator's little jokes to make his fool a general--all scarlet, with a big scarlet three-cornered hat surmounted by an immense aigrette of scarlet plumes, came Don Eusebio. He marched along with tremendous dignity, his sword at his side, and twelve soldiers, also in scarlet, his bodyguard, walking six on each side of him with drawn swords in their hands.|$|E
60|$|A {{few of the}} negroes bolted in the {{opposite}} direction. I paused from my flight a moment to grab at the all kinds of money on the floor. This wasn't theft: it was merely custom. Every man who hadn't run was grabbing. The doors crashed open and swung in, and through them surged a squad of bulls. We surged the other way. It was dark in the office, and the narrow door would not permit {{all of us to}} pass <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> at the same time. Things became congested. A coon took a dive through the window, taking the sash along with him and followed by other coons. At our rear, the bulls were nailing prisoners. A big coon and myself made a dash at the door at the same time. He was bigger than I, and he pivoted me and got through first. The next instant a club swatted him on the head and he went down like a steer. Another squad of bulls was waiting outside for us. They knew they couldn't stop the rush with their hands, and so they were swinging their clubs. I stumbled over the fallen coon who had pivoted me, ducked a swat from a club, dived between a bull's legs, and was free. And then how I ran! There was a lean mulatto just in front of me, and I took his pace. He knew the town better than I did, and I knew that in the way he ran lay safety. But he, on the other hand, took me for a pursuing bull. He never looked around. He just ran. My wind was good, and I hung on to his pace and nearly killed him. In the end he stumbled weakly, went down on his knees, and surrendered to me. And when he discovered I wasn't a bull, all that saved me was that he didn't have any wind left in him.|$|E
50|$|Leo Barnes (who is only {{identified}} as the Sergeant throughout the film’s course) is off-duty on that day and arms up before the commencement. His wife Janice sees {{what he is doing}} and tries to convince him that purging would not bring their son back and would not instill justice to them. She urges him not to go through with his plans, but Leo goes against her advice. He goes <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> heavily armed in his modified muscle car posing as a vigilante.|$|R
50|$|The song {{features}} a music video, directed by Tim Sutton, {{in which the}} band starts playing in a room, among some young people on sofa watching on TV an army incident in <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of an unspecified city.
