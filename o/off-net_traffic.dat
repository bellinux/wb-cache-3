40|$|Received {{literature}} {{have shown}} that if competing Telecom networks are restricted to linear pricing and are unable to discriminate between on- and off-net calls, high access charges can be a device for facilitating collusion. Under more general pricing schemes (allowing non-linear pricing and price discrimination between on-net and <b>off-net</b> <b>traffic)</b> high access charges {{are more difficult to}} sustain, because they reduce consumers ’ willingness to pay fixed fees. We show that an unbalanced calling pattern is sometimes sufficient to restore high access charges as an equilibrium outcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} content is {{increasing}} in the Internet {{but the current}} Internet’s ability to scale with the growing demand for Internet capacity is unclear. To determine this, various studies {{on the future of}} the Internet have been initiated; including studies on information networking. This work utilises value networks and the two-sided market theory in explaining the current and predicting the future market structure of Internet content delivery. The formulated value networks and SWOT analysis are used for comparing the different content delivery models; the client-server model, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and the Content Centric Network (CCN) model. In addition, the market potential for information networking (CCN) is investigated. Four two-sided markets in the Internet interconnection layer are identified in this work and the two-sided analysis predicts the consolidation of CDNs and Internet service providers (ISPs). However, the number of content providers is expected to rise based on the two-sided market analysis. The value network analysis shows that the CDN and CCN models reduce <b>off-net</b> <b>traffic</b> compared to the client-server model for Interne...|$|E
