40|$|The {{effect of}} varying doses of {{cimetidine}} and omeprazole, on acute gastric mucosal lesions produced by topical aspirin (200 mg/kg; 1 ml/ 100 g) in 0. 175 M HCl or topical sodium taurocholate (40 mM; 1 ml/ 100 g) in 0. 175 M HCl was {{studied in the}} pylorus ligated rat. Preliminary studies revealed dose dependent inhibition of acid secretion with both cimetidine and omeprazole. Intraperitoneal cimetidine 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg given before topical acidified aspirin reduced mucosal lesions from a control score of 23. 7 +/- 3. 5 (mean +/- SEM) in which 83 % <b>of</b> <b>stomachs</b> contained lesions, to 6. 9 +/- 2. 2 and 3. 5 +/- 2. 1 respectively (p less than 0. 05), 36 % and 27 % <b>of</b> <b>stomachs</b> containing lesions. A dose of 250 mg/kg failed to reduce lesion score significantly (17. 8 +/- 4. 9) and 64 % <b>of</b> <b>stomachs</b> contained lesions. Taurocholate-induced lesion score was reduced from a control value of 32. 7 +/- 4. 3 in which 97 % <b>of</b> <b>stomachs</b> contained lesions to 10. 8 +/- 3. 3 and 15. 5 +/- 3. 8 by cimetidine 10 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg respectively (p less than 0. 05), 62 % and 68 % <b>of</b> <b>stomachs</b> containing lesions. Cimetidine 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg failed to significantly reduce mucosal damage. Intraduodenal omeprazole (1. 25 to 50 mumol/kg) given before topical acidified aspirin or taurocholate failed to reduce mucosal lesions, as did intragastric omeprazole 5 mumol/kg and 50 mumol/kg given before acidified aspirin. Cimetidine showed cytoprotective properties over a specific dose range beyond which the effect was lost despite continuing suppression of acid secretion. Omeprazole exhibited no cytoprotective activity...|$|R

Killer whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis <b>of</b> <b>stomach</b> contents, but {{this is likely to}} be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} his death has been debated. Napoleon's physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found {{the cause of death}} to be stomach cancer. Antommarchi did not sign the {{official}} report. Napoleon's father had died <b>of</b> <b>stomach</b> cancer, although this was seemingly unknown {{at the time of the}} autopsy. Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.|$|E

5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} <b>of</b> <b>stomach</b> pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to {{supplement}} their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses <b>of</b> <b>stomach</b> contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E

40|$|Many authors {{state that}} cod (Gadus morhua) do not feed during the {{spawning}} period. However, this {{more or less}} established fact has rarely been investigated in the field. Here, the content <b>of</b> <b>stomachs</b> from Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) and Norwegian coastal cod (NCC) sampled from the spawning ground in Lofoten were examined over a 10 -year period (1996 – 2006). The occurrence of food in the <b>stomachs</b> <b>of</b> spawning cod, <b>stomach</b> fullness, diet composition, and variation in these variables between NEAC and NCC, year, and sex were analysed and compared. The analysis shows that cod do feed, {{even when they are}} in a spawning state. NCC had a lower proportion <b>of</b> empty <b>stomachs</b> and the stomachs were fuller than those from NEAC. Females had a lower proportion <b>of</b> empty <b>stomachs</b> than males and their stomachs were in general fuller. Herring (Clupea harengus) dominated the diet of cod. However, cod consumption of herring on the spawning grounds seems to be a minor source of mortality on herring. Although spawning cod do feed, the proportion <b>of</b> empty <b>stomachs</b> was higher and stomach fullness was lower than in <b>stomachs</b> <b>of</b> NEAC from the Barents Sea...|$|R

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} can {{be associated}} with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of the tissues of the upper airway. It can also {{be associated with}} potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary aspiration <b>of</b> <b>stomach</b> contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical aspiration pneumonitis, or unrecognized intubation of the esophagus which can lead to potentially fatal anoxia. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} lean swimmer {{known for her}} elegant technique, Leech started {{swimming}} as a child to build strength after a series <b>of</b> <b>stomach</b> disorders in her infancy. She quickly rose to prominence after breaking a string of age group records. In 1955, she became the youngest swimmer to win an Australian title, claiming victory in the 110-yard freestyle {{at the age of}} 13. She twice broke the Australian record in the 100-yard freestyle in late 1955, thereby positioning herself as a leading contender for Olympic selection in 1956. Leech's preparation was hindered by illness, which forced her out of the 1956 Australian Championships, but she recovered to gain Olympic selection in both the 100-metre freestyle and the corresponding relay. Leech produced a late surge to take bronze in the individual event and seal an Australian trifecta, before swimming the second leg in the relay to help secure an Australian victory in world record time. Leech retired after the Olympics at the age of 15; she cited anxiety caused by racing as one of the main factors in her decision.|$|E
