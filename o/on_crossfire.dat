5000|$|Fiorina was {{critical}} of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) health care reform legislation during the debate in 2009 {{that led to the}} act's passage.

[...] In a 2013 appearance <b>on</b> <b>Crossfire,</b> Fiorina called the law [...] "an abomination" [...] but said that she supported the law's requirement that individuals obtain health insurance and the law's prohibition on health insurance companies denying coverage {{on the basis of a}} policyholder's pre-existing condition. Fiorina supports a mandate that would require individuals to carry [...] "high-deductible 'catastrophic care' insurance plans and use federal dollars to subsidize state-based high-risk pools to provide care for those who otherwise cannot afford it." [...] According to a campaign spokeswoman, Fiorina's support for an individual mandate [...] "differs from Obamacare in that the law's mandate demands that every American be covered with plans that include a higher threshold of services." [...] When the act went into effect, it effectively banned many such high-deductible plans, and required that every American buy health insurance or face a financial penalty. Her spokeswoman said Fiorina's plan is [...] "set up a little like auto damage liability insurance - aimed at reducing taxpayer costs of unexpected ER visits," [...] adding, [...] "Not what Obamacare required, which is actually high end insurance coverage." ...|$|E
