5|$|Occasionally, {{individual}} murderers {{were perceived}} to have been so heinous that standard punishments like beheading or to be broken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> were not regarded as sufficiently commensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised. The case of Pavel Vašanský (Paul Wasansky in German transcript) may serve as an example here.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} initially {{opposed the}} Swedish reforms, {{as can be}} ascertained from church records and court transcripts. The Swedes did encounter civil revolts in many areas, including the Göinge district, in dense forest regions of northern Scania. The Swedish authorities resorted to extreme measures against the 17th-century rebels who were described as snapphanar, a term used for raiding enemy soldiers or bandits.. The punishments included the use of impalement breaking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{as well as the}} nailing of bodies to church doors. In that way, it could take four to five days before the victim died.|$|E
5|$|Making for the harbour mouth, the British ship's bow {{and stern}} {{alternately}} rose and plunged into the incoming waves; the propeller at times was spinning in air, requiring a careful hand on the throttle to keep the shaft from running away to destruction. Green seas were boarding the vessel and running {{the length of the}} deck. There were ten men <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and more below handling relieving tackle on the tiller to assist in maintaining control of the rudder. Taking two hours to travel four cables, the cruiser finally escaped the anchorage into the open sea, an achievement not known to Calliopes crew for some time, as sea spray and spume had reduced visibility to nothing.|$|E

25|$|The small rudder of the Bf 109 was {{relatively}} ineffective at controlling the strong swing {{created by the}} powerful slipstream of the propeller during the early portion of the takeoff roll, and this sideways drift created disproportionate loads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> opposite to the swing. If the forces imposed were large enough, the pivot point broke and the landing gear leg would collapse outward into its bay. Experienced pilots reported that the swing was easy to control, {{but some of the}} less-experienced pilots lost fighters on takeoff.|$|E
25|$|Lights can be powered through {{electromagnetic}} induction. Reelight, a Danish company, is {{well known}} for this and claims as much as one third of all bikes in Denmark feature it. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels and powered every time a magnet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> spoke passes, eliminating the need for batteries. The advantages are pretty much the same as with dynamo lighting while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos and eliminating the noise and wear of the tire.|$|E
25|$|When skeining from wheel spun yarn, the bobbin {{can either}} {{be removed from the}} wheel and placed on a kate, or skeined {{directly}} from the wheel. If the bobbin is left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> the tension on the drive band must be lessened in order to allow the bobbin to turn freely. Yarn spun on spindles {{can either be}} left on the spindle, or slipped onto a dowel for plying. The spindle or dowel is either placed in a lazy kate, or even a bowl to keep the spindle in one place while winding off the yarn.|$|E

25|$|Cubist and Futurist devices appear {{superimposed}} in Metzinger's At the Cycle-Race Track, {{creating an}} image that is readable yet essentially anti-naturalistic. Cubist elements include {{the reduction of the}} geometric schema to simplified shapes, and the juxtaposition of rotating planes to define spatial qualities, printed-paper collage, the incorporation of a granular surface and multiple perspective. Parallels with Futurism include the choice of a subject in motion (the bicyclist), the suggestion of velocity (motion blur <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> spokes), and the fusing of forms in a static picture plane. Metzingers's work integrates the idea of an aesthetic generated by the modern myth of the machine and speed.|$|E
25|$|By the 13th century Bavarian law {{held that}} the ministeriales (or Dienstmann) held a {{position}} higher than the ordinary milites, and only the monarchy and princes were permitted to maintain ministeriales. Imperial courts increasingly rendered justice for ministerials, as when Count Frederick of Isenberg murdered Archbishop Engelbert of Cologne in 1225. The archiepiscopal ministerials brought an appeal (and the blood-stained clothing) to the Royal Court to demand justice. The count's brothers, the bishops of Münster and Osnabrück, were brought before the court for complicity, and bloodshed at the court was narrowly averted. Count Frederick was convicted in absentia, all his ministerials were released from his service, and Frederick was captured and broken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clay is dug {{from the}} ground, checked for {{impurities}} and placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> to be molded. Once the potter gets the shape he desires, the potter stops the wheel, allowing the access water to run of. The artist then spins it again {{to ensure the}} water is off then it is placed in a kiln. The kiln was usually a pit dug {{in the ground and}} heated by fire; these were estimated to reach a temperature of 950 degree Celsius (1,742 degree Fahrenheit). Later kilns were built above ground to be easier to maintain and ventilate. During the firing of the pottery, artists went through a three-phase firing in order to achieve the right colour (further reading).|$|E

25|$|Melody Roulette—A wheel was spun onstage to {{determine}} a cash prize for identifying the tune. Early in both the daytime and syndicated versions the wheel contained categories. Each contestant selected a category before each spin and received $100 if the wheel stopped on their choice. However, the categories were later replaced by money amounts ranging from $20–$1,000 from 1974–76, $50–$1,000 from 1976–77, and $100–$1,000 from 1977–81 on the syndicated series and $50–$500 on the 1977 daytime series. Also, during early playings on the syndicated version, each contestant selected a $200 space <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel.</b> If the wheel landed {{on one of those}} spaces, that contestant won $200 automatically {{prior to the start of}} the tune.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} {{accurate}} tuning devices, strobe tuners work differently than regular electronic tuners. They are stroboscopes that flicker a light at the same frequency as the note. The light shines on a wheel that spins at a precise speed. The interaction of the light and regularly-spaced marks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> creates a stroboscopic effect that makes the marks for a particular pitch appear to stand still when the pitch is in tune. These can tune instruments and audio devices more accurately than most non-strobe tuners. However, mechanical strobe units are expensive and delicate, and their moving parts require periodic servicing, so they are used mainly in applications that require higher precision, such as by professional instrument makers and repair experts.|$|E
25|$|Biron thereupon forced Anne {{to order}} {{an inquiry into}} Volynsky's past career, {{with the result that}} he was tried before a {{tribunal}} of Biron's men. The charges faced were that he, as a minister, and Andrey Khrushchyov (1691—1740), as an assistant minister, tried to dethrone Queen Anna for Peter the Great's daughter, Elizabeth. He was arrested on June 23, 1740 and thus condemned to be broken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> and then beheaded. On the scaffold, by the clemency of the empress, his punishment was mitigated to the severing of his right hand followed by decapitation on June 27, 1740. The sentence was executed exactly 31 years after the Battle of Poltava. Volynsky had by his side architect Pyotr Yeropkin and Andrey Khrushchyov.|$|E
