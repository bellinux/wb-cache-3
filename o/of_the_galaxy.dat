It is the tenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was directed by James Gunn, who wrote the screenplay with Nicole Perlman, and features an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, John C.

50|$|<b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> {{dynamical}} friction {{explains why}} the brightest (more massive) galaxy tends to be found near <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> a <b>galaxy</b> cluster. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two body collisions slows down <b>the</b> <b>galaxy,</b> and <b>the</b> drag effect is greater <b>the</b> larger <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> mass.

In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy.</b> By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of {{globular clusters}} around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>galaxy</b> were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E
