At times, he collaborated with Gingrich and Lott on deregulation and tax cuts, collaborated with McCain and Phil Gramm <b>on</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> and spending restraints, legislated with and campaigned for Joseph Lieberman, and fought poverty with James Pinkerton. Pete du Pont was a progressive conservative ally. After retiring from Congress and serving in the Cabinet, Kemp remained close to Gingrich, Lott, Weber, and Mack. Kemp {{was a member of}} the federal committee to promote Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a national holiday. As a progressive voter, he had civil rights leaders such as Benjamin Hooks, Andrew Young and Coretta Scott King and conservative black intellectuals like Glenn C. Loury and Robert L. Woodson as supporters and friends. He boasted of having Democratic friends such as William H. Gray III, Charles B. Rangel and Robert Garcia. Ken Blackwell was a Deputy Secretary under Kemp. During the Reagan presidency, when Kemp was able to effect tax cutting, a leading United States Senate tax-cutting proponent was Democrat Bill Bradley, a former basketball star. Several American football players have followed Kemp to Congress: Steve Largent, J. C. Watts, and Heath Shuler.|$|E

25|$|A {{second group}} put their main {{emphasis}} <b>on</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> rather than spending cuts or debt reduction. Many embrace supply-side economics, arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment, tax cuts {{would result in}} economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues. These additional government revenues, would {{in the long term}} reduce debt, they also argue for reducing taxes even if it were to lead to short term increases in the deficit. Some supply-siders have even advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary. However, the Congressional Budget Office has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the Bush tax cuts added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002-2011 and would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels.|$|E

500|$|Despite a {{platform}} covering {{the full range}} of political subjects, Kemp's primary campaign weapon was a fiscal policy based <b>on</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> As part of his fiscal policy, he opposed a Social Security benefits freeze and endorsed a freeze on government spending. Some viewed Kemp's supply-side stance as an attempt to ignore the national budget deficit. [...] In late 1987, political pundits saw that Kemp needed to gain support from the far right on non-social issues. Kemp was among the majority of Republican candidates in opposition to Reagan's INF Treaty agreement with the Soviet Union's Mikhail Gorbachev despite general Republican voter approval of the treaty. [...] With aspirations of support from right-wing voters, all candidates with low levels of poll support for the nomination took this same [...] "sabre-rattling" [...] stand. By early 1988, the moderates (Bush and Dole) were clearly the front-runners and Kemp was battling with Pat Robertson as the conservative alternative to the moderates.|$|E

There's nothing serious about a plan that claims {{to reduce the deficit}} by spending a trillion dollars <b>on</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> for millionaires and billionaires." [...] The House passed the Ryan plan on April 15, 2011, by a vote of 235–193. Four Republicans joined all House Democrats in voting against it. On an April 27, 2011, conference call with reporters Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that passage of the Ryan plan [...] "would be {{one of the worst things}} to happen to this country". On May 25, 2011, the Ryan budget plan was defeated in the Senate.|$|E

However, the CBO also computes a current-policy baseline, which makes assumptions about, for instance, votes <b>on</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> sunset provisions. The current CBO 10-year budget baseline projection grows from $3.7 trillion in 2011 to $5.7 trillion in 2021.|$|R

Day was expected to have greater appeal to Ontario voters. At one point, the Alliance was at 30.5% in the polls, and some thought they could win the election, or at least knock the Liberals down to a minority government.

500|$|The {{surplus in}} fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third {{consecutive}} surplus and the largest surplus ever. In 2001, Bush's budget estimated {{that there would be}} a $5.6trillion surplus over the next ten years. Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35trillion <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> program—one of the largest <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> in U.S. history. Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying [...] "the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money." [...] Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> would stimulate the economy and create jobs. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>on</b> the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security. O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him <b>on</b> planned <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} counterintuitive {{effects of}} a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>on</b> current consumption in a small open economy where the government is endowed with an uncertain resource wealth. Depending on fiscal policy and the extraction path of the resource, different generations face different risks regarding their tax burden, and this affects private saving. The effect of a one-period <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> followed by <b>tax</b> increases in order to stabilize the expected government wealth depends <b>on</b> whether the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is financed by intensified resource extraction. This triggers increased precautionary saving which may offset the wealth effect of the <b>tax</b> policy <b>on</b> the consumption of present generations.

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>cuts</b> can deepen a {{recession}} if the short-term {{nominal interest rate}} is zero, according to a standard New Keynesian business cycle model. An example of a contractionary <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is a reduction in <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> wages. This <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> deepens {{a recession}} because it increases deflationary pressures. Another example is a <b>cut</b> in capital <b>taxes.</b> This <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> deepens a recession because it encourages people to save instead of spend {{at a time when}} more spending is needed. Fiscal policies aimed directly at stimulating aggregate demand work better. These policies include 1) a temporary increase in government spending; and 2) <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> aimed directly at stimulating aggregate demand rather than aggregate supply, such as an investment tax credit or a <b>cut</b> in sales <b>taxes.</b> The results are specific to an environment in which the interest rate is close to zero, as observed in large parts of the world today.

His focus <b>on</b> <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> was a questionable strategy, however. After the Wisconsin Legislature passed the revenue cuts, the State of Wisconsin was soon plagued by budget deficits, the first in many years. The deficits were caused by higher costs of government due to high inflation and interest rates. Unemployment also rose, further reducing revenue sources to government.|$|E

40|$|One aim of {{the first}} phase of the tax reform coming into effect in 2004 is to {{strengthen}} the economic recovery. One of its elements is a tax relief granted for retained profits of non-incorporated firms to further the formation of equity capital. However, since small firms and firms with low profits can realise only low tax savings, the effectiveness of this tax measure is restricted. Within personal income taxation, gross incomes up to 14. 500 € per year are completely tax-exempt from 2004 <b>on.</b> This <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> will reach a volume of € 329 million in 2004 and € 400 million in 2005.
