Hanson's final title reign was the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not involve Hawk, as he teamed with The Hangman in Montreal, Quebec to win the Canadian International Tag Team Championship in 1981. Hanson then returned to McMahon's New England-based Capitol Wrestling, which had since become the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Using the gimmick of a redneck, complete with long hair and a Confederate flag, he competed for the WWF as a face {{until his retirement in}} 1986.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station was the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in {{sharp contrast to the}} BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E
5|$|Low-altitude {{intercepts}} {{would also}} {{have the advantage of}} reducing the problem with nuclear blackout. The lower edge of an extended fireball used to induce nuclear blackout extended down to about 60km, the same as the altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be developed rapidly, before or between blackout periods. This demanded a very high-performance computer, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not exist at that time.|$|E

5|$|Because of Alyx's {{significant}} {{involvement in}} the game, Valve made modifications to her AI that allowed her {{to react to the}} player's actions. Modifications include commentating on objects the player manipulates or obstacles they have overcome. She also acts as an important device in both plot exposition and directing the player's journey, often vocalizing what the player is required to do next to progress. The developers explained that a large part of their focus was creating not only a believable companion for the player, but also <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not obstruct the player's actions. They wanted to allow the player to dictate his/her own pace and method of overcoming any challenges faced without being hindered. This meant that Valve often had to scale back Alyx's input and dialogue during the player's journey so they would not feel pressured to progress and consequently object to her presence. The developers also placed what they described as hero moments throughout the game, which allow the player to single-handedly overcome obstacles such as particularly challenging enemies, during which Alyx takes the role of an observer and gives the player praise and adulation for their heroic feats. Play testers were used extensively by the developers throughout the entirety of the game's creation in order for Valve to continually gauge the effectiveness of in-game scenarios as well as the difficulty.|$|E
25|$|The three {{theories}} {{taken together}} are {{often seen as}} being the hallmarks of the IS tradition, although this is contested by some former leaders of the IS, including Nigel Harris and Michael Kidron both of whom worked on the PAE and now repudiate it, and by some other Trotskyists outside the IS Tradition. The PAE, the most contested of the three theories, is also the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not originate with Tony Cliff.|$|E

The initial roster was reduced although six more characters became available by September 2011 alongside an updated version. Billy Kane was included {{as a result of his}} popularity within fans, although some were confused by the absence of Iori Yagami. Depending on the game's popularity, the staff may port it to other consoles.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic {{response}} to the Protestant Reformation was a conservative one, but <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> address {{the issues raised by}} Luther. In 1545 the long running Council of Trent began its work of reform and a Counter-Reformation on the borders of the Habsburg domains. The Council continued intermittently until 1563. Ferdinand and the Austrian Habsburgs were far more tolerant than their Spanish brethren, and the process initiated at Trent. However his attempts at reconciliation at the Council in 1562 was rejected, and although a Catholic counteroffensive existed in the Habsburg lands from the 1550s it was based on persuasion, a process in which the Jesuits and Peter Canisius took the lead. Ferdinand deeply regretted the failure to reconcile religious differences before his death (1564).|$|E
25|$|In late 2012, {{the eternal}} flame began {{malfunction}}ing. The {{causes of the}} malfunction were not known, but the automatic ignition system began clicking audibly. On January 31, 2013, Meltech Corporation of Landover, Maryland, was awarded a $350,000 contract to upgrade the eternal flame. The work required that the permanent flame be extinguished, and a temporary flame displayed to one side. Army Corps of Engineers officials {{said that this was}} the first time a temporary flame was used since the permanent flame was installed. A solid white fence surrounded the permanent flame during the renovations, although the headstones of Kennedy and his family were not obscured. The flame was transferred to the upgraded permanent eternal flame on May 17, 2013, and the temporary flame extinguished. The refurbishment replaced the original 1967 burner with <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not require a separate oxygen supply, laid new gas lines, relocated gas pressure regulators, installed automated controls to provide a more energy-efficient flame, and laid new electrical cables and replaced aging electrical conduits.|$|E
25|$|The Street family {{considered}} Harrison a skyscraper architect, so {{his decision}} to both plan and supervise the construction of their house in Scarborough, a hamlet of the village of Briarcliff Manor, surprised them. By October 6, 1937, the house that Harrison constructed had one story of stone {{in the shape of}} an L, with a short stone wall extending {{from the back of the}} house, and a ramp path with a serpentine wall running up along the front of the house to the entrance. By March 7, 1938, the two-story house was completed. The finished house was built of local fieldstone in the shape of an L, using steel beams on the roofs of the house and garage, with sixteen-inch walls, glass porthole windows, and large panes of glass and doors on the back of the house—it was related in design to other early Modernist houses constructed in the late 1930s by the Modernists Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. Breuer was a proponent of the more modern International Style, and Gropius, as Director of the Bauhaus in Germany, applied the International Style when he designed the school's faculty housing and building around 1925-1926. Gropius and Breuer represented a new form of architectural design, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not look to the past, but rather to modern industry for inspiration.|$|E
