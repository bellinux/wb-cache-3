5000|$|The Sony Xperia Z1's {{design is}} [...] "Omni-Balance", {{according}} to Sony, which {{is focused on}} creating balance and symmetry in all directions. Xperia Z1 has subtly rounded edges and smooth, reflective surfaces on all sides, which are held together by a skeleton frame made from aluminium. The phone features tempered glass, which is Sony's own and they claim is even tougher than Gorilla Glass, front and back, covered by shatterproof film on front and back. The aluminium power button {{is placed on the}} right side of the device. A dedicated hardware shutter key for easy access to camera is provided on the lower right side. The location is said to make operation easier. The metallic look and positioning of the power button is inspired by luxury watch crown design. Easy access to external memory card and sim card slots are provided. The sim card can be removed easily with bare hands. The phone is available in three colours: black, white, and purple. The Xperia Z1 is thicker (8.5mm) and heavier (169g) and has thicker screen bezels than the Xperia Z, even though the two phones share the same screen size. Sony said that the frame had to be enlarged due to the larger than average camera sensor. The camera sensor size is 1/2.3" [...] same as commonly are used in bridge camera. The phone is certified waterproof to 1.5 m for up to 30 minutes. The Z1 is dust resistant with an IP rating of 55 and 58. Unlike the Xperia Z, the Xperia Z1 doesn't have a flap covering its headphone jack, but maintains its waterproofing, a move welcomed by many due to the waterproofing warranty on the Sony Xperia Z being reliant on all ports being sealed. Additional less obvious connectivity includes support for USB OTG allowing for the connection of external USB devices as well as support for MHL <b>output</b> <b>connection.</b> The Xperia Z1 comes with 2GB of RAM and Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor clocked at 2.15 GHz.

The lateral giants make short latency <b>output</b> <b>connections</b> with phasic uropod motor neurones, including the productor, the lateral abductor and adductor exopodite motor neurones that we have identified both physiologically and anatomically. On the other hand, tonic motor neurones, including the ventral abductor and reductor exopodite motor neurones, receive no input from the lateral giants. We show that there is no simple reciprocal activation of the phasic opener (lateral abductor) and closer (adductor) motor neurones of the exopodite, but instead both phasic motor neurones are activated in parallel with the productor motor neurone during a tail flip. Our results show that the neuronal pathways activating the tonic and phasic motor neurones of the exopodite are apparently independent, with phasic motor neurones being activated during escape movements and tonic motor neurones being activated during slow postural movements...|$|R
