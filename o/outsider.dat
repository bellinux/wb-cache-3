5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was The <b>Outsider,</b> a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this <b>outsider</b> feeling comes from isolation suffered at a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, speaking only English. His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an <b>outsider</b> but insist that the public views him very differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading to the simple The Autobiography title.|$|E

5|$|The mercenaries pursue Zangurak to Lazulis Island. Lowell is fatally {{injured by}} a Gurak warrior. Zael finds Calista with Zangurak, who has used her Arganan {{blood and the}} Gurak half of the <b>Outsider</b> to anoint his right arm. After the group defeats Zangurak, he rips off his right arm and sends it to use the full power of the <b>Outsider</b> to revive him. However, Dagran kills Zangurak's arm so he can use the Arganan blood and <b>Outsider</b> half on it for himself. He reveals that he murdered Asthar because he learned that Asthar had {{commanded}} the Lazulis knights who killed his family. He has been collaborating with Zangurak with {{the ultimate goal of}} using the <b>Outsider</b> to remake the world so the mercenaries have a better life. Finding he is still not powerful enough to defeat the group, Dagran tries to absorb the Lazulis half of the <b>Outsider</b> into the center of his body, giving Zael an opening to kill him. Dagran reconciles with the group before dying, then his spirit uses the Outsider's energy to resurrect Lowell. Zael and Calista reunite the two halves of the <b>Outsider,</b> which leaves the planet after explaining that its true purpose is to collect scattered energy in outer space and use it to create life on new worlds.

5000|$|The {{insiders}} {{are those}} incumbent workers who enjoy more favorable employment opportunities than the <b>outsiders.</b> The {{reason for this}} disparity is that firms incur labor turnover costs when they replace insiders with <b>outsiders.</b> Examples of labor turnover costs are the costs of hiring, firing and providing firm-specific training. Insiders may resist competition with <b>outsiders</b> by refusing to cooperate with or harassing <b>outsiders</b> who try to underbid the wages of incumbent workers.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the social cognitions of <b>outsiders</b> and defenders about intervening in situations of victimization by bullying. Do <b>outsiders</b> and defenders behave differently in victimization situations because of differences in competence beliefs, or because of a selectivity effect in intervening? These issues were examined {{in a sample of}} 102 <b>outsiders</b> and 107 defenders who were classified into these bullying roles through a peer-nomination procedure out of a total sample of 761 10 - to 14 -year-old Dutch children. These children were presented with imaginary victimization events. They answered questions about their cognitions and self-efficacy beliefs about intervening in victimization situations and about handling such situations. <b>Outsiders,</b> compared to defenders, claimed to intervene indirectly in victimization situations rather than directly. Defenders, compared to <b>outsiders,</b> claimed to intervene directly in victimization situations rather than indirectly. Both <b>outsiders</b> and defenders claimed to be more likely to intervene when a friend was being victimized than when a neutral classmate was being victimized. <b>Outsiders</b> and defenders did not differ in their self-efficacy for indirect intervention, but only defenders claimed a high self-efficacy for direct intervention. Both <b>outsiders</b> and defenders claimed to benefit from direct help when they themselves are victimized, but only <b>outsiders</b> also reported to need indirect help. The results suggest that <b>outsiders</b> and defenders behave differently in victimization situations because of differences in competence beliefs rather than because of a selectivity effect. More generally, the results suggest that not only defenders but also <b>outsiders</b> have the intention to help children who are being bullied. However, outsiders' anti-bullying attempts are likely to be indirect and less firm than those of defenders. © 2013 Society for the Study of School Psychology...|$|R

Alevi taboos limited interaction with the dominant Sunni political-religious centre. Excommunication was the ultimate punishment threatening those who married <b>outsiders,</b> cooperated with <b>outsiders</b> economically, or ate with <b>outsiders.</b> It was also forbidden to use the state (Sunni) courts.|$|R
