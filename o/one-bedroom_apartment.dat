500|$|Bungie {{focused on}} the Mac {{platform}} due to familiarity with the platform and ease of use. [...] "The PC market was really cutthroat, but the Mac market was all friendly and lame.

Instead, Jones and Seropian wrote a brand-new story for what became Pathways Into Darkness. Since Bungie had no money and Jones was the only one with the available time, he single-handedly coded the game on a Mac IIfx, passing art chores to his friend Colin Brent. Pathways was successful enough that Bungie moved from a <b>one-bedroom</b> <b>apartment</b> to an actual office.|$|E
