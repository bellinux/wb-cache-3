Windsor Terrace is becoming more ethnically diverse and culturally active, owing to a demographic change since the 1990s, when the area had a more elderly population and not as many families with young children. The increased presence of many families with young kids has not indicated a significant cultural change in the neighborhood.|$|E

500|$|Bungie {{focused on}} the Mac {{platform}} due to familiarity with the platform and ease of use. [...] "The PC market was really cutthroat, but the Mac market was all friendly and lame. So {{it was easier to}} compete," [...] Jones said. After Minotaur, Bungie began work on a 3D graphics version of the game, but realized that the game's format was not suited to a 3D environment. Instead, Jones and Seropian wrote a brand-new story for what became Pathways Into Darkness. Since Bungie had no money and Jones was the only one with the available time, he single-handedly coded the game on a Mac IIfx, passing art chores to his friend Colin Brent. Pathways was successful enough that Bungie moved from a <b>one-bedroom</b> <b>apartment</b> to an actual office.|$|E
