50|$|A {{defendant}} is only {{liable for the}} act of a third party where the third party intervention is a foreseeable consequence of the <b>original</b> <b>negligence,</b> but policy considerations {{and the relationship between}} the defendant and the third party may be taken into account.|$|E
50|$|Hammett {{defined the}} {{equation}} {{based on two}} parameters: the reaction constant (ρ) and the substituent parameter (σ). When other reactions were studied using these parameters, a correlation was not always found due to the specific derivation of these parameters from the dissociation equilibrium of substituted benzoic acids and the <b>original</b> <b>negligence</b> of resonance effects. Therefore, the effects of substituents on an array of compounds must be studied on an individual reaction basis using the equation Hammett derived either for field or resonance effects, but not both.|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} that the {{defendant}} was responsible for the damage sustained {{as a result of the}} collision, but that the fall had been caused by the plaintiff's own carelessness. The defendant was not liable for the damage caused thereby: The fall was an intervening cause which broke the causal effect of the <b>original</b> <b>negligence.</b> As no evidence had been adduced to show that the plaintiff's doctor had incurred special expenses in qualifying, the {{court held that}} plaintiff's request for his qualifying expenses should not be allowed.|$|E
50|$|The {{doctrine}} legalizes de jure the {{de facto}} transfer of sovereignty caused {{in part by the}} <b>original</b> sovereign's extended <b>negligence</b> and/or neglect of the area in question. It was applied in the Island of Palmas and the Miniquiets and Ecrehos cases.|$|R
40|$|A 7 -year-old boy, {{diagnosed}} as having croup, develops an upper airway obstruction due to epiglottitis during the therapy, resulting in cerebral anoxia. Pediatricians to whom the boy is referred feel that failure to consider epiglottitis in the <b>original</b> diagnosis constitutes <b>negligence.</b> The parents suspect nothing. What should the pediatricians say or do...|$|R
50|$|But {{where the}} claimant’s {{response}} is not sufficiently unreasonable, {{the chain of}} causation will be unbroken and the defendant will remain liable. In Wieland v Cyril Lord Carpets (1969) 3 AER 1006 the defendant's negligence caused an injury to the claimant's neck that necessitated the wearing of a surgical collar. The claimant also wore bifocals and the collar inhibited the normal compensatory movement of her head to maintain perfect vision. She fell down some steps sustaining further injury. It was held that her difficulties in seeing with her usual spectacles were within the risk created by the <b>original</b> <b>negligence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Whether {{the acts}} of a third party break the chain of {{causation}} depends on whether the intervention was foreseeable. The general rule is that the original defendant will {{be held responsible for}} harm caused by a third party {{as a direct result of}} his or her negligence, provided it was a highly likely consequence. So, for example, where the defendant has control over the third party, or where the third party is faced with a dilemma created by the defendant, the chain of causation is unlikely to be broken and the defendant will normally be liable to the claimant for the damage caused: Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co Ltd. 1970 AC 1004. The continuity of liability is not imposed merely because the <b>original</b> <b>negligence</b> makes damage by the third party foreseeable, but where the defendant’s negligence makes it very likely that the third party will cause damage to the claimant: Lamb v. Camden LBC 1981 QB 625. In practice, however, the requirement that the third party intervention will usually break the chain and, at the very least, the liability to pay compensation representing the totality of the loss or damage will be apportioned between the two or more tortfeasors. So, for example, if A injures V, it is foreseeable that an ambulance will be called, that paramedics will lift and carry V, and that there will be a journey back to the hospital. This cycle of intervention is continued in the hospital. None of this activity affecting V would arise [...] "but for" [...] the <b>original</b> <b>negligence</b> so A will remain liable unless and until either an unforeseeable B intervenes (e.g. negligently drives his car and collides with the ambulance), or a paramedic or member of the hospital staff is so seriously negligent that it becomes a new cause of action.|$|E
5000|$|The victim {{worked for}} the {{defendant}} as a galvaniser. As part of his duty, he was required to lift articles, via a crane, into a tank of molten metal. While doing so on August 15, 1950, an object spattered out from the tank and burned him on the lip. This burn was the [...] "promoting agent" [...] of a cancer from which he died three years later.The employer's negligence in respect to the burn was not disputed, and was determined to have caused the claimant's death. The important legal issue, however, was that the claimant had a predisposition to the cancer in his skin tissue. The issue for the court to resolve was whether the cancer was too remote from the <b>original</b> <b>negligence</b> for the claimant to be allowed compensation.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} in Landeros v. Flood {{was the first}} time that a cause of action was established to exist in favor of a battered child against a physician who negligently failed to diagnose the battered child syndrome or to comply with an applicable reporting statute. Such failure was found to be the cause of further similar injury to the child. The causal chain was not broken by the fact that the subsequent injury was inflicted by the same third persons, namely the child's mother and her common-law husband who were responsible for the original injuries. The court held that no physician could be convicted for failure to make the necessary reports to the civil authorities as required by California statute, unless it was shown that it actually appeared to him that the injuries were inflicted on the child, so that his failure to report was intentional and not merely negligent. If the child wished to satisfy the requirements of the statute, it would be necessary to persuade the trier of fact that the physician actually observed her injuries and formed the requisite opinion that they were intentionally inflicted on her. The court also held that even if the trial court found the child experienced further beatings at the hands of her mother and the latter’s husband, it constituted an “intervening act” and not a “superseding cause", thereby relieving the defendants of liability. This was predicated on the finding (at the trial court level) that the foreseeability arose directly from the risk created by the <b>original</b> <b>negligence.</b> This would be the risk created by the original failure of the physician to diagnose and report the injuries. This was a question of fact for the jury, and could not be dismissed by the trial court as a matter of law.|$|E
5000|$|But, when {{negligence}} {{is followed}} by a natural event of such magnitude that it erases the physical effects of the <b>original</b> <b>negligence,</b> the defendant’s liability ceases at the moment in time when the supervening condition occurs. In Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government, the Carslogie collided with the Heimgar and admitted liability. Temporary repairs were effected with permanent repairs to be carried out later in the United States. After the collision but before crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar was given a certificate of seaworthiness, authorising her to be continued in her present class without fresh record of survey, subject to permanent repairs at the owner's convenience. She was held fit to carry dry and perishable cargoes. While crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar encountered heavy weather and sustained such serious damage as to become unseaworthy and to require immediate dry docking. Thus, prior to encountering the rough weather, the Heimgar was a seaworthy vessel, capable of earning profits for her owners. Repairs due to the collision and to the heavy weather, as well as the owner's repairs were all carried out at the same time. Ten of the fifty days in dry dock were allocated to the repair of the collision damage and the question for the House of Lords was whether the owners of the Carslogie were liable for that ten-day loss of earning capacity. The claim was for damages because a working ship is [...] "a profit-earning machine". If she ceases to earn a profit, it is essential to consider what caused the detention in dry dock at that time. In this case, the Heimgar was a profit-earning vessel before suffering the heavy weather damage. Thus, the loss of earnings at that time was not caused by the collision. Hence, The Oropesa demonstrates that where there are two successive causes of harm, the court may regard the first event as the cause of all the harm, or hold that the second supervening event reduces or eliminates the effect of the initial negligence as in Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government.|$|E
