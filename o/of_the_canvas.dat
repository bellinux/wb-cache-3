5|$|In the centre, {{the women}} dance. Their {{interlocked}} {{arms and hands}} create a pattern at the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas,</b> which acts {{as the focus of}} the painting. To the right of the central group of dancers a young man drags another woman away from the group of dancers, to join a pair of lovers who lie down together at the right of the painting.|$|E
5|$|The painted {{surface is}} divided into {{quarters}} horizontally and sevenths vertically; this grid is used to organise the elaborate grouping of characters, and was a common device at the time.

5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{composition of}} the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.|$|E
5|$|Elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> {{refer to}} Grünewald's c. 1512–16 Isenheim Altarpiece and Peter Paul Rubens's c. 1612–14 Descent from the Cross. According {{to the art}} critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the {{predator}} leaning over the cross link the painting to Rubens' Descent. The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are folded out of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's legs and arms are in violent motion, seemingly wildly flailing up and down.|$|E
5|$|Prolific and versatile, Ruisdael {{depicted}} {{a wide variety}} of landscape subjects. From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes of remarkable quality for a young man. After a trip to Germany in 1650, his landscapes took on a more heroic character. In his late work, conducted when he lived and worked in Amsterdam, he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire. In these, the sky often took up two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> In total he produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls.|$|E

5|$|Etty was {{a regular}} attender at the Royal Academy's life class {{throughout}} his career. Nyssia stands in a pose which Etty had sketched many times, that {{of a woman with}} her knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a hanging rope. (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose the obscure subject of the painting as a pretext to paint a woman in this pose. As with many Etty works the female figure has a far better finish than the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas,</b> and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest of the composition later in a studio.|$|E
5|$|Pandora Crowned by the Seasons is {{an unusual}} composition, painted to {{resemble}} a bas-relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan {{to one side and}} Venus and Cupid to the other, each leaning away from her; the figures of Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas,</b> create a diamond shape around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame, a favourite device of Rubens; elements of the picture's composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on the same subject, drawn by Etty's fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake. As with all Etty's history paintings from this time on, he worked by painting the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running {{along the top of}} the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> from deterioration and allows us to see some of the colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E
40|$|Two large {{cardiovascular}} outcome trials <b>of</b> canagliflozin, comprising <b>the</b> <b>CANVAS</b> Program, {{will complete}} in early 2017 : the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (<b>CANVAS)</b> and <b>the</b> CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study-Renal (CANVAS-R). Accruing {{data for the}} sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT 2) inhibitor class has identified questions and opportunities that were not apparent when the trials were designed. Accordingly, a series of modifications {{have been made to}} the planned analyses. These updates will ensure that the data from <b>the</b> <b>CANVAS</b> Program will maximize advances in scientific knowledge and patient care. <b>The</b> specification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis strategy prior to knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial results, their design by the independent scientific trial Steering Committee, the detailed a priori definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis plans, and the external review provided by the US Food and Drug Administration all provide maximally efficient and robust utilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data. <b>The</b> <b>CANVAS</b> Program should significantly advance our understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> canagliflozin, and <b>the</b> broader SGLT 2 inhibitor class, on a range of important efficacy and safety outcomes...|$|R
50|$|Danaë is an oil {{painting}} by Gustav Klimt, created in 1907. An example <b>of</b> Symbolism, <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> measures 77 x 83 cm, {{and is in}} the Galerie Würthle in Vienna.

50|$|Having {{lived in}} Tokyo {{for a number}} of years before coming to the United States, Baumeister-Rehm's works can be {{correlated}} to Ikebana style art. For Karin, less is more keeping her works bright in color and serene in nature, with few elements crowding <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> <b>The</b> simplicity <b>of</b> objects allows her paintings to complete <b>the</b> openness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blank <b>canvas.</b> <b>The</b> sun is symbolic to portray the clarity and positioning of her paintings. Her style is a jubilant disposition able to be accommodated any space at home or in an office environment.|$|R
5|$|The {{painting}} shows a {{large room}} in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid {{during the reign of}} King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position {{similar to that of the}} viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{creature}} {{may be a}} dog or a cat. Blood {{pours out}} of its mouth onto the head and body of its prey, a chimera rendered as owl-like with human facial characteristics. The prey unsuccessfully struggles to flee from its captor. The lower figure's human aspect is most notable {{in the details of}} its mouth and genitalia. Both figures are positioned in the centre foreground <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas,</b> and are each mutilated and covered in blood, their physical discomfort contrasted against the flat, neutral background typical of Bacon's paintings. The figures exhibit many elements found in his early work, noticeably the expressive broad strokes set against the tightness of the flat, nondescript background. The link with the biblical Crucifixion is made through the raised arms of the lower creature, and the T-shaped cross.|$|E
5|$|After the war Knight {{returned}} to her previous themes of the ballet, the circus and Gypsies, and continued to divide her time between London and Malvern. In 1948 Knight painted backstage at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, mostly observing {{the work of the}} wardrobe department, still working under austerity restrictions. The same year she painted a large group portrait of Princess Elizabeth and several civic dignitaries opening the new Broadgate Centre in Coventry. A period of illness affected her work on this commission, and, despite Knight's repainting large parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas,</b> the finished painting was not well received. A major exhibition of over eighty works by Knight was held at the Ian Nicol Gallery in Glasgow, in 1952. The following year Knight {{returned to}} the theatre, painting and producing crayon studies, backstage at the Old Vic in London during the Birmingham Repertory Theatre's production of Henry IV, Part 1 & Part 2. Throughout this period Knight continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy each year, most notably with a portrait of Jean Rhodes, a professional strong woman known as 'The Mighty Mannequin', which when shown in 1955 led to further portrait commissions for Knight. In 1956 Knight worked backstage at the Royal Opera House during performances and rehearsals by the Bolshoi Ballet.|$|E

5|$|Decorating of the Bride {{is one of}} Jovanović's Orientalist works, notable {{examples}} of which include The Wounded Montenegrin (1882), Fencing Lesson (1883) and Cockfight (1897). The painting is undated, and it remains unknown exactly when it was composed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, dates it to ca. 1885–86. Art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes that it was painted in 1888. What is known for certain is that Jovanović painted it in the mid-1880s {{on one of his}} travels through the Balkans. One source contends that it was composed while the artist was visiting the Ottoman town of Shkodër, in present-day Albania. Another version of the painting {{is said to have been}} created by the artist not long after the original, but is considered lost. An 1891 journal article describes this version as depicting two women decorating the bride, while to her left the bride's mother clasps her hands and cries with joy. This version is said to have shown a girl on the verge of tears standing by a door to the far left. On the right, a woman and young girl could be seen offering gifts to the bride. During conservatory examinations in 2009, it was discovered that Decorating of the Bride had been painted over a similar, earlier work. The artist appears to have shortened the right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> by about , altered the appearance of the interior, and slightly modified the left side of the painting. Save for the shortened canvas length, the right side of the painting is identical to that in the final version.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} works by Metzinger {{of the same}} period, there are {{elements}} to be found of the real world, e.g., a fan, windows, and feathers.

25|$|Journalists responded skeptically to McCloud's idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{infinite}} <b>canvas,</b> as {{five years}} after Reinventing Comics, the concept had not taken off in large proportions yet.

30|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> Lorenzo Viani, such as “The Plague in Lucca”, have {{suffered}} {{of a series}} of conservation problems, which deeply compromised the same physical integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artworks and calls for important conservation interventions. During World War II, the painting “The Plague in Lucca” was divided into several parts, probably to save it from <b>the</b> raids <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German Army: the upper part was rolled and stored underground, the bottom again divided into 6 pieces and hidden. In the after war restoration, a pigmented filling material was used to repair lacerations <b>of</b> <b>canvas.</b> <b>The</b> <b>canvas</b> was relined probably by using animal glue; the not original industrial frame permits a relatively good tension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original and relined <b>canvas.</b> Nowadays <b>the</b> painting shows a darkening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pigments, several stains mainly in the upper part caused by humidity; nevertheless, the thin paint layer is well adherent to <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> and no craquelures are visible.|$|R
50|$|Agnes Martin, Robert Mangold (see above), Brice Marden, Jo Baer, Robert Ryman, Richard Tuttle, Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, Charles Hinman are {{examples}} of artists associated with Minimalism and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shaped <b>canvas</b> also during <b>the</b> period {{beginning in the early}} 1960s. Many Geometric abstract artists, minimalists, and hard-edge painters elected to use <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image to define <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shaped <b>canvas</b> is primarily associated with paintings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. The Bykert Gallery, and the Park Place Gallery were important showcases for Minimalism and shaped canvas painting in New York City during the 1960s.|$|R
