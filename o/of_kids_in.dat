500|$|Rado {{described}} {{the inspiration for}} Hair as [...] "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. [...] We knew this group <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked {{out of school for}} growing their hair long". [...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This is happening in the streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E
500|$|Six out {{of eight}} areas in Knowle West are ranked as being {{economically}} deprived. The {{closure of the}} Imperial Tobacco factory at nearby Hartcliffe in 1990 meant the loss of 5,000 jobs and an estimated further 20,000 jobs in service and supporting industries throughout South Bristol. A House of Commons report noted that this had a seriously {{negative effect on the}} area as many people in Knowle West and neighbouring areas lost the opportunity for [...] "manual and semi-skilled employment". The Independent in 1995 noted high drug use and associated crime and reported on the establishment of Knowle West Against Drugs, led by local parents concerned about these problems. In 2006, BBC News said [...] "Knowle West has {{more than its share of}} social problems. [...] The highest number <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> care of any council ward in Bristol. [...] The lowest number of young people with any qualifications (under half). [...] A major petty crime problem, drug addiction, and add to that people are fed up with bad housing." [...] Shawnie, a 2006 novel by social worker Ed Trewavas, written from the point of view of a 13-year-old girl living in Knowle West, documents some of the deprivation he encountered in his work. One of the novel's characters [...] "describes Knowle West ... as a 'shit hole' populated by 'yokels, cider-heads, junkies, dole-scammers, slappers and failed wide boys, all interbreeding and nicking their cruddy possessions off of each other in some giant, dismal rota.'" ...|$|E

Rock Sound said that the album made the band into [...] "one of our greatest rock commodities" [...] and called it a [...] "defining record for the UK rock scene as a whole". Lee Gaze stated [...] "Start Something is the greatest hits of what Lostprophets do". Aled Phillips <b>of</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>In</b> Glass Houses said [...] "it was a turning point for a lot of bands" [...] but also that [...] "everyone's jeans got tighter and started wearing Nike Dunks - it was a cultural shift. With them it was never just about the music, everybody got swept up in the whole aesthetic as well". Five British rock records - All Our Kings Are Dead, We Are the Dynamite, World Record, Free and Hold Me Down - were all cited as being heavily influenced by Start Something.|$|E

2500|$|The Oakland Zoo was {{independently}} {{formed by}} Pitt {{students in the}} winter of 2001. The initial idea for the Zoo came from Matt Cohen and Zach Hale during the January 6, 2001 basketball game against Syracuse where they determined the Pitt student section was too calm. Cohen and Hale, rounded up eight of their fellow students from the university's Litchfield Towers dormitory to initiate the club first appearance at the [...] January 13, 2001 victory over then 15th-ranked Seton Hall. The name [...] "Zoo" [...] was meant to represent [...] "a bunch <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> a zoo acting crazy" [...] whereas [...] "Oakland" [...] is the neighborhood of Pittsburgh in which the university resides. Students adopted gold t-shirts and eventually grew to consume the majority of the student section at the team's home court then inside Fitzgerald Field House. [...] Originally, upon seeking official sponsorship from the University for the 2001-2002 season, the group was denied and the athletic department attempted to implement their own [...] counterpart to their football student cheering section called the [...] "Aero-Zone", named after then athletic department apparel sponsor Aéropostale, and issued free t-shirts to the students emblazoned with this name. [...] However, the [...] "Aero-Zone" [...] failed to catch on while the Oakland Zoo continued to grow, transitioning into the Petersen Events Center when it was opened in 2002 and filling the larger student section of the [...] "Pete". [...] The group is now an officially recognized student group of the University, and with over 2,000 members, is the largest such group.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{when it was}} {{announced}} that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, executive producer Diederick Santer described them as [...] "a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show". Other media sources branded them two of [...] "the most popular characters on the soap" [...] and an [...] "iconic couple". However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, [...] "It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?". Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back [...] "is very welcome". He comments, [...] "Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can we expect to see {{over the next couple of}} years?). Like it! Ricky arrives with a glamorous WAG [...] on his arm. [...] I sense friction along the way, especially when Ricky realises he never got over Bianca (how could he?). All very well thought through and positive. This sounds like a soap getting back in touch with its roots.".|$|E
