The music begins <b>on</b> <b>track</b> 13 {{and ends}} <b>on</b> <b>track</b> 25, starting the album with 12 hidden tracks consisting of five seconds of silence each, totaling 60 seconds of silence {{out of respect}} for a deceased fan, who also had track 10, or track 22, (Justin) named after him. Later prints move the silent tracks after the music. In interviews Jon Davis also mentioned he was very superstitious {{and did not want to}} end an album <b>on</b> <b>track</b> 13.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other racing series such as Formula One, Formula E has a specific qualifying mode, {{in which the}} twenty drivers are divided up into four groups, leaving enough space <b>on</b> <b>track</b> for everyone to produce lap times without interference by other drivers. Each group had ten minutes <b>on</b> <b>track</b> and the fastest time of each driver determined the grid position. A lottery determined which drivers started in which group. With five-minute breaks between the groups, qualifying had an overall length of 55 minutes.|$|E

5|$|A severe {{fire at the}} Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration train and manual operation had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle train <b>on</b> <b>track</b> 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train <b>on</b> <b>Track</b> 1 was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of Track 3 was delayed {{because of the need}} to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision was not made concerning whether or not the automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact <b>on</b> <b>track,</b> allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|Alex's extratropical {{remnants}} sank the Pink Lady, a rowboat carrying four British rowers {{attempting to}} break the record for fastest crossing from St. John's, Newfoundland to Falmouth, Cornwall.

5|$|Between {{the first}} and second Tests, the Australian victory over Middlesex, whose batting could not cope with Spofforth, was their only win in four matches at Lord's.

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. However, all three sessions were disrupted and little running took place. During {{the first session}} on Friday morning, a spillage of diesel <b>on</b> <b>track</b> prevented the cars from going out on until very late in the session. Eventually, Nico Hülkenberg topped the session for Force India, ahead of his compatriots Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Since water was used to clear the surface, the first laps were run on intermediate tyres by most drivers, with both Williams cars being equipped with full wet tyres, but Valtteri Bottas spun on them entering the pit lane. Later, the track dried enough to use slick tyres, Fernando Alonso being the first to do so. Due to the limited running, the last minutes were busy with most cars out <b>on</b> <b>track.</b> Marcus Ericsson however was confined to the sidelines as he stopped with an engine problem. As Lewis Hamilton spun on his last timed lap, he needed to settle for seventh fastest.|$|E
5|$|South of the station, {{underneath}} 92nd Street, is {{a diamond}} crossover allowing northbound trains from track S2 to terminate on either track, then {{go into the}} storage tracks or proceed south <b>on</b> <b>track</b> S1.

The tail tracks north of the station, which currently end at 99th Street, can store four trainsets, two on each track.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} session on Saturday was run without spectators {{to ensure their}} safety. <b>On</b> <b>track,</b> Lewis Hamilton was fastest, ahead of his closest championship rival Sebastian Vettel.
