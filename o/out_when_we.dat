25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was co-directed by Ray Kay and Beyoncé for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was {{released}} the same month: {{it was one}} of eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The choreography was done by Danielle Polanco and Jonte' Moaning, who used a 1980s retro set. Beyoncé explained the concept of the video at MTV: [...] "It's probably the most flamboyant video, and the metallic dresses are so beautiful, they added so much color. I had to do a video for this song. Everyone wanted to know what a 'freakum dress' was, and you can't really explain it, you have to see it. Everyone has their own version, so we had so many women — of different races, sizes, shapes, ages — because we all have those dresses we pull <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> need to shut it down." ...|$|E
500|$|Some 35 of the signers {{met at the}} St. Charles Hotel in Washington, D.C. on December 19, 1984, to {{determine}} a course of action. The meeting included 18 nuns of the Vatican 24. They said the Vatican, in its stern reaction, [...] "seeks to stifle {{freedom of speech and}} public discussion in the Roman Catholic Church and create the appearance of a consensus where none exists." [...] The group issed a statement describing the current Church stance as not {{in the spirit of the}} Vatican II which said, [...] "Let there be unity in what is necessary, freedom in what is unsettled and charity in any case." [...] Sister Donna Quinn, a past president of the National Coalition of American Nuns, said, [...] "We believe we have a right to speak <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> have a differing opinion, and this is something European men do not understand." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{movie was}} remastered from the {{original}} 16mm film negative by Apple Corps in 1992, {{with a few of}} those scenes used in The Beatles Anthology documentary. After additional remastering, a DVD release was planned to accompany the 2003 release of Let It Be... Naked, including a second DVD of bonus material, but it never materialised. In February 2007, Apple Corps' Neil Aspinall said, [...] "The film was so controversial when it first came <b>out.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> got halfway through restoring it, we looked at the outtakes and realised: this stuff is still controversial. It raised a lot of old issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2016 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Stefani expressed uncertainty {{with the future}} of No Doubt. [...] "I don't know what's {{going to happen with}} No Doubt. When Tony [...] and I are connected creatively, it's magic. But I think we've grown apart as far as what kind of music we want to make. I was really drained and burned <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> recorded that album [...] And I had a lot of guilt: 'I have to do it.' That's not the right setting to make music. There's some really great writing on that record. But the production felt really conflicted. It was sad how we all waited that long to put something out and it didn't get heard." ...|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} pointed <b>out</b> that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> ignore the {{quantization}} effects, R_N^Tot=R_N and α= 1. In practice, α≃ 1 - 2 Q (A_M/σ _y^(r)) [33], which means that for practical quantizers, α≃ 1 and using α= 1 has a negligible impact on the receiver’s performance.|$|R
