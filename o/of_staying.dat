40|$|The present {{investigation}} focused on three main questions: what factors can determine length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for primary surgery for breast cancer? can these factors {{be attributed to}} the decreasing trend in mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for primary breast-cancer surgery? and can there be any adverse effect of declining length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> such as prolonged sick leave, following breast-cancer surgery? For the four studies of the thesis, routinely collected data was used. In study I the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register was used to describe the trend in mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> women surgically treated for breast cancer and to investigate the effect of the increasing use of breast-conserving surgery on the decreasing trend in mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> In study II the effect of stage of disease on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> was investigated using the Southern Swedish Tumour Register and the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register. To study the possible adverse effect on prolonged sick leave of decreasing length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> data from the National Cancer Register, the Sick Leave Register and the National Hospital Discharge Register were combined (study III). In study IV the effect of social factors on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> was investigated using the Swedish Social Medicine Database. In terms of determinant <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> the present results support the hypothesis that individual factors such as age, severity of cancer according to tumour size and social factors influence length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Differences in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> according to clinical practice style, such as different types of surgery, were found. There was a difference of about 30 per cent in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> between breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy. The results indicate a small effect of change in type of surgery on the mean-length-of-stay trend. In the two studies investigating the effect of changes in surgery on mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> the calculated effects of the changes in techniques were 14 and 13 per cent, respectively. Cancer stage distribution did not affect the trend. In study III one possible adverse effect <b>of</b> reduced hospital <b>stay</b> was analyzed, namely the number of sick leave days after discharge. A statistical correlation between median length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for a particular hospital and number of sick leave days following discharge was established. Shorter median length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for a hospital is related to longer sick leave periods following care, indicating a possible adverse effect of shorter length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> But long median length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for a hospital was also related to longer sick leave period...|$|R

40|$|Background: In St. John's, Newfoundland {{there are}} three {{tertiary}} care institutions that provide acute inpatient psychiatry services. To date, the factors associated with increased length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> in these institutions, has not been systematically studied. [...] Some of the psychiatrists who admit patients to these facilities have speculated that the length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> {{and the distribution of}} the factors associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> varies across the inpatient psychiatric facilities in the city. The accuracy of their opinions has not been examined previously. [...] Objectives: Length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> on acute care hospital units is influenced by many factors such as patient demographics, diagnosis, treatment regime and attitudes of the attending physician. This study has three objectives: 1) to identify the factors associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> on the acute admission wards in St. John's, Newfoundland, 2) to assess the accuracy of the psychiatrists' opinions that length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> differs significantly among the three psychiatric institutions in St. John's and 3) to assess the accuracy of the psychiatrist's opinions with respect to the factors that impact on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in St. John's, Newfoundland. [...] Method: A chart review was conducted to measure length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> by institution and to determine which factors were associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for inpatient psychiatry units in St. John's. The data represents patients discharged from hospital between April and June 1997 inclusive. The patients were above 19 years of age, were discharged from an acute care inpatient unit during the study period, and had no other admissions during the thirty days prior to the admission or within 30 days of the discharge. Fourteen variables were examined for a potential association with length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Regression analysis was used to identify significant associations between patient, illness and treatment related factors and length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> [...] Data from the chart review was also used to assess the accuracy of the psychiatrists' opinion that length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> varies significantly among the acute care admissions of the city. The length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> was calculated for each admission site and then compared for significant differences. [...] Psychiatrists' perceptions of the factors associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> were gathered by an opinion questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered to all psychiatrists with admitting privileges for the acute psychiatry inpatient sites in St. John's. Descriptive analysis was used to quantify the psychiatrists' opinions. These opinions were then compared to the results of the chart review for factors associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> [...] Results: Results of the chart review revealed that length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> did not vary significantly among the three institutions, or between the two types of admission sites. Of the fourteen factors examined for an association with length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> patient age, primary diagnosis, presence of a discharge plan, and duration of the discharge plan were significant. The involvement of pastoral care workers in the patient care almost reached the level of significance. [...] Results of the survey revealed that the majority of psychiatrists were of the opinion that patient age, gender and race had little impact on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> The age and gender of the treating psychiatrist were also believed to have little impact on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Level <b>of</b> education, marital status, employment status, income level, and place of residence were believed to have moderate impact on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> The level <b>of</b> patient stress, primary diagnosis, the presence of co-morbid illness, treatment issues, the expertise of the attending psychiatrist and the practice composition of the attending psychiatrist were believed to impact substantially on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> This was not entirely consistent with the results of the chart review. [...] Discussion: Four of the fourteen variables were significantly associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> on the inpatient psychiatry units in St. John's, Newfoundland. Several of {{these findings are consistent with}} earlier studies. Of the ten remaining factors that were not significantly related to length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> seven had been previously studied and shown to be associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in other clinical settings. This suggests that the factors associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in St. John's, Newfoundland may be unique to that region and that length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> literature is not universally applicable. [...] The psychiatrists' perception that lengths <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> varied significantly among sites was inaccurate. As well, the psychiatrists' perceptions of factors that are associated with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> were not consistent with the findings of the chart review. This discrepancy between opinion and reality warrants further examination if physicians are to be expected to actively reduce length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in the future...|$|R

40|$|This paper employs count {{data models}} to {{estimate}} the determinants <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> as count models overcome censoring and truncation data issues associated with the positive integer nature <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> is critical to study consumption of local resources. This paper employs a rich micro dataset on tourists departing the Azores, a group of small Portuguese islands, widely perceived as a tourist destination with high growth potential due to its unique nature, which, hence, must be addressed with care given its small carrying capacity. This paper looks after the relationship between destination image and tourists’ behavior, focusing {{on the influence of}} destination image on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Environmental attitudes and destination image, constructed from a factor analysis exercise, also influence length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> It is found that sociodemographic profiles and trip attributes are important determinants <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> The results suggest that promoting the Azores for its nature, landscape, remoteness, weather and safety may increase length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> unlike cultural heritage. Our framework provides an interesting tool for policymakers to analyse the determinants <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> and, concomitantly, consumption of local resources.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objectives}} of this population-based study were to describe trends {{of more than}} a decade (1986 - 1999) in duration of hospitalization after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), patient characteristics associated with varying lengths <b>of</b> <b>stay,</b> and the impact of declining length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> on postdischarge mortality. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 4551 patients discharged after AMI from all greater Worcester, Mass, hospitals in 8 annual periods during the study period. Regression models were used to examine the influence of demographic, clinical, and treatment variables on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and the association between declining length <b>of</b> hospital <b>stay</b> and postdischarge mortality. RESULTS: Marked declines were observed in the average length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> between the 1986 - 1988 (11. 7 days) and 1997 - 1999 (5. 9 days) periods. Factors associated with a longer hospital stay included advanced age, female sex, anterior and Q-wave MI, and occurrence of clinically important cardiac complications. Patients with health maintenance organization, Medicare, Medicaid, or no insurance coverage were less likely to have an increased length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Increased 30 - and 90 -day mortality was associated with a length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> greater than 14 days (odds ratio, 2. 08; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 18 - 3. 66) relative to those with a length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> 6 to 8 days (odds ratio, 2. 01; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 34 - 3. 01). Patients with a length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> less than 6 days exhibited no significant increases in postdischarge mortality. Similar trends were observed in patients with a complicated AMI. CONCLUSIONS: We found marked decreases in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> for patients hospitalized with AMI during the past decade. However, we found no negative association between declining length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and short-term mortality after hospital discharge for AMI...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{relation between}} inpatient length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> after hip fracture {{and risk of}} death after hospital discharge. SETTING: Population ≥ 50 years old living in Sweden as of 31 December 2005 with a first hip fracture the years 2006 - 12. PARTICIPANTS: 116 [*] 111 patients with an incident hip fracture from a closed nationwide cohort. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death within 30 days of hospital discharge in relation to hospital length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> after adjustment for multiple covariates. RESULTS: Mean inpatient length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> after a hip fracture decreased from 14. 2 days in 2006 to 11. 6 days in 2012 (P< 0. 001). The association between length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and risk <b>of</b> death after discharge was non-linear (P< 0. 001), with a threshold for this non-linear effect of about 10 days. Thus, for patients with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> ≤ 10 days (n= 59 [*] 154), each 1 -day reduction in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> increased the odds of death within 30 days of discharge by 8 % in 2006 (odds ratio 1. 08 (95 % confidence interval 1. 04 to 1. 12)), which increased to 16 % in 2012 (odds ratio 1. 16 (1. 12 to 1. 20)). In contrast, for patients with a length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> ≥ 11 days (n= 56 [*] 957), a 1 -day reduction in length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> {{was not associated with}} an increased risk of death after discharge during any of the years of follow up. LIMITATIONS: No accurate evaluation of the underlying cause of death could be performed. CONCLUSION: Shorter length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in hospital after hip fracture is associated with increased risk of death after hospital discharge, but only among patients with length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> 10 days or less. This association remained robust over consecutive years. Karl Michaëlsson och Peter Nordström delar förstaförfattarskapet. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{framework}} to predict the impact of new health technologies on average length <b>of</b> hospital <b>stay.</b> Methods: A literature search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Health Management Information Consortium databases was conducted to identify papers that discuss the impact of new technology on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> or report the impact with a proposed mechanism of impact of specific technologies on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> The mechanisms <b>of</b> impact were categorized into those relating to patients, the technology, or the organization of health care and clinical practice. Results: New health technologies have a variable impact on length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Technologies that lead to an increase in the proportion of sicker patients or increase the average age of patients remaining in the hospital lead to an increase in individual and average length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Technologies that do not affect or improve the inpatient case mix, or reduce adverse effects and complications, or speed up the diagnostic or treatment process should lead to a reduction in individual length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> and, if applied to all patients with the condition, will reduce average length <b>of</b> <b>stay.</b> Conclusions: The prediction framework we have developed will ensure that the characteristics of a new technology that may influence length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> can be consistently taken into consideration by assessment agencies. It is recognized that the influence of technology on length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> will change as a technology diffuses and that length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> is highly sensitive to changes in admission policies and organization of care...|$|R
