30|$|For {{the pricing}} of {{vulnerable}} options, we improve {{the results of}} Klein and Inglis [Journal of Banking and Finance] and Tian et al. [The Journal of Futures and Markets], considering {{the circumstances in which}} the <b>writers</b> of <b>options</b> face financial crisis. Our pricing model faces the risks of default and the occasional impact experienced by the underlying assets and counterparty’s assets. The correlation between the option’s underlying assets and the <b>option</b> <b>writer’s</b> assets is clearly modeled. Asset prices are driven by the jump-diffusion processes of two related assets. Furthermore, we consider a variable default boundary (VDB) based on the option’s potential debt and the <b>option</b> <b>writer’s</b> other liabilities. In case financial distress happens, the payout rate is connected to the <b>option</b> <b>writer’s</b> assets. Through the Taylor expansion, we derive an approximate explicit valuation for vulnerable options.|$|R

5000|$|A naked put (also {{called an}} [...] {{uncovered}} put [...] ) is a put option contract where the <b>option</b> <b>writer</b> (i.e., the seller) {{does not hold}} the underlying position, {{in this case a}} short equity position, to cover the contract in case of assignment. The seller receives the premium cost of the put price, and hopes that the underlying equity or stock price stays the same or rises modestly, in which case the seller retains the premium. A put option buyer is hoping for a decrease in the price of the underlying equity, and upon exercise or expiration will collect cash representing the difference between the strike price of the option and the price of the underlying equity.|$|E
5000|$|A {{call option}} {{can be sold}} even if the <b>option</b> <b>writer</b> ("A") does not {{initially}} own the underlying stock, but is buying the stock at the same time.

If XYZ trades at $33 and $35 calls are priced at $1, then A can purchase 100 shares of XYZ for $3300 and write/sell one (100-share) call option for $100, for a net cost of only $3200. The $100 premium received for the call will cover a $1 decline in stock price. The break-even point of the transaction is $32/share. Upside potential is limited to $300, but this amounts to a return of almost 10%. (If the stock price rises to $35 or more, the call option holder will exercise the option and A's profit will be $35-32 = $3) If the stock price at expiry is below $35 but above $32, the call option {{will be allowed to}} expire, but A (the seller/writer) can still profit by selling the shares. Only if the price is below $32/share will A experience a loss.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{behavior}} of call options surrounding the underlying stock's ex-dividend date. The evidence is inconsistent with the predictions of a rational exercise policy; a significant fraction of the open interest remains unexercised, resulting in a windfall gain to <b>option</b> <b>writers.</b> This triggers a sophisticated trading scheme that enables short-term traders to receive a significant fraction of the gains. The trading scheme inflates reported volume and distorts its traditional relations to liquidity. The dramatic increases in the volume of trade on the last cum-dividend day are facilitated by limitations on transaction costs passed by the various option exchanges. The Author 2009.

The model considers options traded mutually between two <b>option</b> <b>writers</b> one of which may default. Based on this model the credit-risk adjusted price of an option is a conditional price with respect to the portfolio of options to which it is added. Using a numerical approximation (Monte-Carlo simulation), netting and portfolio effects are shown to increase the credit-risk adjusted value of a trading position. The paper shows that the price which a counterparty is willing to receive (pay) for selling (buying) an option, is less (more) than the usual price if the option has a credit risk mitigation effect on the existent portfolio...|$|R

40|$|Consider the {{performance}} of an <b>options</b> <b>writer</b> who mis-specifies {{the dynamics of the}} price process of the underlying asset by over-estimating asset price volatility. When does he overprice the option? If he follows the hedging strategy suggested by his model, when does the terminal value of his strategy dominate the option payout? We show that both these events happen if the option payoff is a convex function of the price of the underlying at maturity. The proofs involve the simple, powerful and intuitive techniques of coupling. 1 Robust hedging and super-replication The standard approach in mathematical finance, and particularly in the pricing of derivative securities, is to begin by writing down a stochastic model which is assumed, without comment, to correctly and precisely specify the dynamics of the underlying asset. Arbitrage theory, backed by change of measure techniques and martingale representation theorems, then allows options to be priced and hedged. The fairness of the pr [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a synthesized model of asymmetric information. An empirical analysis {{of more than}} 1, 400 NYSE common stocks shows that trade direction {{is more important than}} volume in revealing the asymmetry. There is also evidence to suggest that signed duration reflects informed trading activity. We use the proposed measure of information asymmetry to study daily changes in the level of informed trading and find that earnings announcements narrow the information gap between the informed and the uninformed. On average, information asymmetry is largest {{at the beginning of the}} trading day and it decreases monotonically toward the closing bell. More importantly, the asymmetric information measure is negatively related to the number of shareholders, number of analysts following a firm and whether there is an exchange-traded equity option written on the firm’s stock. An implication of this finding is that firms can reduce information asymmetry by implementing disclosure measures that attract not only more investors and analysts but also <b>option</b> <b>writers...</b>|$|R

If trading {{takes place in a}} frictionless market, this delta hedging strategy is said to eliminate the option writer's risk completely. It will be shown that for certain contingent claims, for example digital options, the hedge can fail completely if the underlying risky asset does not follow the assumed geometric Brownian motion. Indeed, the hedging error may diverge and delta hedging can actually increase the risk of the <b>option</b> <b>writer.</b> Option pricing, digital option hedging, hedging error...|$|E

When the {{counterparty}} defaults, the option holder will receive all {{the assets of the}} <b>option</b> <b>writer.</b> Hull and White [5] extend the model, assume that the counterparty has other liabilities, the payout rate is exogenous, and the option holder will obtain part of the option’s intrinsic value when the counterparty defaults, thereby deriving the vulnerable option’s pricing formula. Jarrow and Turnbull [6] propose a risk neutral evaluating mechanism of derivative securities exposed to default risk. Klein [7] provides an analytical solution of the European vulnerable option’s price, taking into account the interrelationship between the option writer’s asset and the underlying asset. They also assume that the option writers have other liabilities, and when the counterparty defaults, some of the nominal claims will be paid.|$|E

30|$|This {{paper will}} extend {{the results of}} [10] and [11] for valuing {{vulnerable}} options when the <b>option</b> <b>writer</b> suffers the financial crisis. As in [11], the asset prices are driven by jump-diffusion processes. The jump {{is divided into two}} parts: the trait part of each asset price and the part of the system that affects the price of all assets. Following Klein and Inglis [10], we assume that there are interrelations between the option’s underlying asset and the option writer’s assets, and the option writers have other liabilities. The value growth of the option itself may also give rise to financial distress. The default barrier is divided into a stochastic part that measures the option’s potential payoff and the fixed part that represents the option writer’s other liabilities. Furthermore, we make the assumption that only variations {{in the value of the}} asset underlying the option or the writer’s assets can cause financial distress. By the Taylor expansion, we derive an approximate explicit valuation for vulnerable options.|$|E
40|$|Option is {{derivative}} instrument that have investment benefit and provide {{return for the}} writer and the holder. Option price determination is affected by risk factor.

European call option is defined by Esscher Transform method and option price formula is determined by changing its form to linear approximation.

40|$|Trading in {{derivatives}} involves {{heavy use}} of quantitative models for valuation and risk management. These models are necessarily imperfect, and when options are involved, the models require a volatility input {{that must be}} forecasted, subject to error. This creates “model risk ” to which nearly all participants in derivatives markets are exposed. In this paper, we conduct an empirical simulation, with and without hedging, using historical data from 1976 - 1996 for several important markets. The object {{is to develop a}} quantitative assessment {{of the extent to which}} the different sources of model risk can be expected to affect the kind of basic option writing strategy that might be followed by a bank or another financial institution. Specifically, we explore the following problem: If a bank or a similar financial institution writes standard European calls and puts and prices them using the appropriate variant of the Black-Scholes model with a volatility forecast computed optimally from historical data, what are the risk and return characteristics of the trade? More generally, what is the market and model risk exposure faced by a bank that does this transaction repeatedly over time? The results indicate that pricing and hedging errors due to imperfect models and inaccurate volatility forecasts create sizable risk exposure for <b>option</b> <b>writers.</b> We then consider to what extent the bank can limit the damage due to model risk by pricing options using a higher volatility than its best estimate from historical data...|$|R
