5|$|Recent {{models of}} {{economic}} defence in a group-foraging context {{predict that the}} frequency <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with scaly-breasted munia show that the intensity <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> encounters was highest when patch location was signaled, {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether patch location was signaled or not. Signaling patch location was equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable. Changing patch density had no effect on the number <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> encounters when the location of food was not signaled. When food location was signaled, increasing patch density resulted in the predicted decrease in the number <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> encounters.|$|E

5|$|Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of {{rock music}} {{that began in}} the mid-1960s, with the garage, {{psychedelic}} and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with keyboards.|$|E
30|$|The BCC and the FCC {{algorithms}} can {{be considered}} as a series <b>of</b> different <b>aggressive</b> cube algorithms, each one performs for a different set of network nodes. In terms of two-party ECDH procedures, the BCC and FCC complexity is not higher than any <b>of</b> the single <b>aggressive</b> cube algorithms. This is because within a single two-party ECDH procedure of each algorithm, three ECDH procedures run simultaneously, each one corresponding to a different round <b>of</b> the <b>aggressive</b> cube algorithm.|$|R

5|$|Spiders {{can also}} be the prey <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> mimics. The assassin bug Stenolemus bituberus preys on spiders, {{entering}} their web and plucking its silk threads until the spider approaches. This vibrational aggressive mimicry matches a general pattern of vibrations which spiders treat as prey, having a similar temporal structure and amplitude to leg and body movements of typical prey caught in the web.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E
5|$|Elephants can exhibit bouts <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> {{behaviour}} {{and engage}} in destructive actions against humans. In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive. In parts of India, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in Jharkhand while in Assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.|$|E

He especially wished to eliminate the common practice whereby government workers, in exchange for their positions, were forced to kick back a percentage of their wages as political contributions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{courtship}} displays by splendid fairywren {{males have}} been recorded; the 'sea horse flight,' so {{named for the}} similarity of movements to those by a seahorse, is an exaggerated undulating flight where the male, with his neck extended and his head feathers erect, flies and tilts his body from horizontal to vertical and by rapidly beating wings is able to descend slowly and spring upwards after alighting on the ground. The 'face fan' display {{may be seen as}} a part <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.|$|E

5|$|The National Cancer Institute {{estimated}} 22,070 {{new cases}} of primary brain cancer and 12,920 deaths due to the illness in the United State in 2009. The age-adjusted incidence rate is 6.4 per 100,000 per year, and the death rate is 4.3 per 100,000 per year. The lifetime risk of developing brain cancer for someone born today is 0.60%. Only around {{a third of those}} diagnosed with brain cancer survive for five years after diagnosis. These high overall mortality rates are a result of the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> types, such as glioblastoma multiforme. Nearly 14% of new brain tumor diagnoses occur in persons under 20 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{occupied}} Martigny to {{the north}} of the massif, and their influence spread out well beyond the Alps into much of northern Europe. As a result <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> pressure from tribes in the north, the imperial forces of Rome were gradually withdrawn from the alpine regions until, by the 5thcentury AD, they had left completely. The areas left behind were occupied in the western part by the Burgundian tribes from what is today France, whilst the Alemanni tribes from Germany moved into eastern parts, resulting in the linguistic divide found today across the Alps.|$|E
5|$|While Burger King's {{advertising}} {{programs were}} highly focused on its new product, {{most of the}} company's sales gains were the result <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> price cutting by Burger King, specifically pricing its signature Whopper sandwich at 99¢, according to analysts at Salomon Brothers. The price cutting promotions by Burger King, and number-three chain Wendy's, forced McDonald's into its own price cutting program. According to Salomon, the burger segment's price wars would have a detrimental effect on the profits of segment leaders, allowing other smaller chains such as Sonic Drive-In, Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr to position themselves as attractive alternatives to the big three chains.|$|E

5|$|As {{the main}} attack {{developed}} on the 27th, the South Vietnamese General Assembly {{handed over the}} presidency to General Dương Văn Minh, who was sworn in the following day. It was widely assumed that Minh, who had no history <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> action against the communists, {{would be able to}} establish a cease-fire and re-open negotiations. Such hope was unrealistic. Their opponent, {{for the first time since}} the First Indochina War, held the upper hand on the battlefield and victory was within reach, regardless of any political changes in Saigon. They would not be denied victory, the only thing for which they had striven for over 30 years. The hope that the communists would make the same mistake they did 21 years prior by complying with the Geneva Agreements while the US and State of Vietnam did not was futile.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of political and strategic decisions, it was almost two years before the battalion went into combat again. In late 1944, in order to free up American troops for operations in the Philippines, Australian forces were directed to take over responsibility for operations around Aitape in New Guinea. The 6th Division returned to New Guinea in November 1944, with the final brigade arriving on 31 December 1944. Although basically cut off from resupply, there were around 35,000 Japanese troops in the area, holding the coast past Wewak and into the interior. Supported by food supplies from native gardens in the Torricelli Mountains, the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the Australians' primary tactic <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> patrolling.|$|E
5|$|In 216 Caracalla {{pursued a}} series <b>of</b> <b>aggressive</b> campaigns {{in the east}} against the Parthians, {{intended}} to bring more territory under direct Roman control. He offered the king of Parthia, Artabanus V of Parthia, a marriage proposal {{between himself and the}} king's daughter. Artabanus refused the offer, realizing that the proposal was merely an attempt to unite the kingdom of Parthia under the control of Rome. In response, Caracalla used the opportunity to start a campaign against the Parthians. That summer Caracalla began to attack the countryside east of the Tigris in the Parthian war of Caracalla. In the following winter, Caracalla retired to Edessa, modern Şanlıurfa in south-east Turkey, and began making preparations to renew the campaign by spring.|$|E
