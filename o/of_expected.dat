In total, South Florida's economy received an estimated $220million boost from visitors who arrived to watch the two games.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>expected</b> {{participants}} grew, the rally was {{moved from the}} grounds of the Washington Monument to the east end of the Mall facing the Capitol. The stage was {{on the east side of}} the rally with an open back, allowing the Capitol building to provide the backdrop for the performances. In order to meet the public safety requirements of the National Park Service permit, the Mall between the Capitol and 14th Street was divided into sections, with access aisles lined by portable fences. Speakers and jumbotron television screens were placed along both the north and south edges to encourage the crowd to spread out rather than press against the main stage.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{agencies}} predicted above-average activity, citing forecasts for slower-than-average trade winds, warmer-than-normal {{sea surface}} temperatures, abnormally low wind shear, and the unlikelihood of an El Niño developing {{prior to the}} peak of the season. On December5, 2012, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), a public consortium consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at University College London, issued an extended-range forecast. In its report, the organization called for 15.4 (±4.3) named storms, 7.7 (±2.9) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and a cumulative Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 134. While no value was placed on the number <b>of</b> <b>expected</b> landfalls during the season, TSR stated that the landfalling ACE index was expected to be above average. Four months later, on April5, Tropical Storm Risk issued its updated forecast, continuing to call for an above-average season with 15.2 (±4.1) named storms, 7.5 (±2.8) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 131; the landfalling ACE index was once again forecast to be higher than normal.|$|E

Since 2000, the university has awarded over 100,000 degrees. UCF is currently the largest university in the nation by terms of undergraduate enrollment, the largest university in Florida, and in 2003 held {{the distinction of being}} the fastest-growing university in the United States. During its Spring 2010 graduation ceremonies, The University of Central Florida awarded its 200,000th degree, less than five years after awarding its 150,000th diploma.|$|E
5|$|If {{a player}} is dealt {{a pair of}} eights, the total of 16 is {{considered}} a troublesome hand. In fact, the value 16 {{is said to be}} the worst hand one can have in blackjack. Since sixteen of the other fifty cards have a value of 10 and four have a value of 11, there is a strong chance of getting at least an 18 with either or both split cards. A hand totaling 18 or 19 is much stronger than having a 16. Splitting eights limits one's losses and improves one's hand. Probabilistic research <b>of</b> <b>expected</b> value scenarios shows that by splitting eights one can convert a hand that presents an expected loss to two hands that may present an expected profit or a reduced loss, depending on what the dealer is showing. A split pair of eights is expected to win against dealer upcards of 2 through 7 and to lose less against dealer upcards of 8 through ace. If a player hits on a pair of eights, he is expected to lose $52 for a $100 bet. If the player splits the eights, he is expected to lose only $43 for a $100 bet.|$|E
