5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E

For example, she said he had steam-cleaned his RV, but no {{evidence}} was introduced that he had. Dr. Henry Lee pointed out that if he had done so, they wouldn't have found the fingerprints and the bloodstain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet.</b> It should be noted, however, that David Westerfield was convicted of kidnapping and murdering Danielle van Dam.|$|E

25|$|Visually, <b>the</b> <b>carpets</b> {{serve to}} draw {{attention}} either to an important person, or to highlight a location where significant action is going on. In parallel {{with the development of}} Renaissance painting, initially mainly Christian saints and religious scenes are set out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpets.</b> Later <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpets</b> were integrated into secular contexts, but always served to represent the idea of opulence, exoticism, luxury, wealth, or status. First, their use was reserved for the most powerful and most wealthy, for royalty and nobility. Later on, as more people gained sufficient wealth to afford goods of luxury, Oriental <b>carpets</b> appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> portraits of merchants and wealthy burghers. During the late 17th and 18th century, the interest in depicting carpets declined. In parallel, the paintings pay less attention to detail.|$|R

Mark encounters the sickly Countess Elise De Longvalle Adler (Daria Nicolodi), who tells him that Rose has disappeared. After the two find blood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> outside Rose's room, Mark follows the stains. He becomes ill and falls unconscious. Elise sees a black-robed figure dragging Mark away, but the figure suddenly stops and gives chase to Elise. The figure eventually finds her swarmed with rabid cats in a room and stabs her to death. Mark staggers to the house's foyer where Carol and the nurse put him to bed.|$|E

Patterns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet,</b> columns, lanterns, and railing evoke cultural symbols.

She asks Jim to hook her up with Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak).

Frustrated, Lois takes him to a clothing store to get a new suit, where Peter finds some flannel pajamas. While wearing them, he suddenly notices that he can shock people with static electricity by rubbing his feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet.</b> Annoyed by this, Lois asks Quagmire to completely remove the carpet, which leads the family to find an antique 18th century Rhode Island ship token, hidden under the carpet, which the family sells for $50,000.

Mills said that her father once threw her brother against a window for making a mess <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> with crayons. The window broke and her brother had to be taken to hospital, where their father {{explained}} that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden. Fiona said: [...] "Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so we turned to shoplifting, learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties. I'm not ashamed to say that we were forced to steal because when you are a young child, you'd rather do that than face a beating from your father". (Their father disputed his daughters' allegations that he was violent towards them, later releasing home movies of family holidays in Wales, showing Mills playing happily.) ...|$|E

500|$|Oak Ridge {{security}} personnel considered any private party {{with more than}} seven people as suspicious, and residents—who believed that US government agents were secretly among them—avoided repeatedly inviting the same guests. Although original residents of the area could be buried in existing cemeteries, every coffin was reportedly opened for inspection. Everyone, including top military officials, and their automobiles were searched when entering and exiting project facilities. One Oak Ridge worker stated that [...] "if you got inquisitive, you were called <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> within two hours by government secret agents.

500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying {{on the table in front}} of him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet.</b> According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E

500|$|Kira Schlechter in The Patriot-News {{declares}} [...] "The Body" [...] "one of {{the finest}} episodes of any series ever", stating that the silence and novel cinematography are [...] "remarkable and the writing is brilliant". Buffy and Dawn's conversation at her school, Schlechter says, is [...] "positively wrenching". When the series ended in 2003, Amy Antangelo in the Boston Herald and Siona LaFrance of the New Orleans Times-Picayune both rated the best Buffy episodes giving [...] "The Body" [...] equal billing at the top with [...] "Hush" [...] and [...] "Once More, with Feeling", LaFrance designating the episode an [...] "instant classic". Jonathan Last in The Weekly Standard lists [...] "The Body" [...] eighth out of the ten best Buffy episodes, writing that it is [...] "the series' most difficult episode because it's real—and not real in the way ER or The Practice or Law & Order, all hyper-versions of reality, are real. At some point, {{most of us will}} experience a day like Buffy has in 'The Body' and we sense that the writers have gotten nearly every detail of that day—right down to the absence of a musical score—right." [...] In the A.V. Club, Noel Murray also finds small details compelling, such as the camera's focus on the paper towel Buffy uses to cover the vomit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet.</b> He does, however, write that some of the shots [...] "come off a little gimmicky, but the ones that work are so effective that it seems petty to complain that Whedon overdoes it at times.

2500|$|In 1820s British servant slang, to [...] "carpet" [...] someone {{means to}} call them for a reprimand. To be called <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>carpet</b> means to be summoned for a serious reason, {{typically}} a scolding reprimand; this usage dates from 1900. A stronger variant of this expression, to be [...] "hauled on the carpet", implies an even sterner reprimand. Carpet bombing {{is a type of}} bombing from airplanes which developed in the 20th century in which an entire city is bombed (rather than precise strikes on military targets). The slang expression [...] "laugh at the carpet" [...] means to vomit on the floor (especially a carpeted floor). The expression [...] "on the carpet" [...] refers to a matter which is under discussion or consideration. The term [...] "carpet muncher" [...] is a derogatory slang term for a lesbian woman; this expression is first attested in 1992.|$|E
