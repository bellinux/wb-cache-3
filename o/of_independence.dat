5|$|According to {{historian}} David Armitage, the Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Independence</b> did {{prove to}} be internationally influential, but not as a statement of human rights. Armitage argued that the Declaration {{was the first in}} a new genre of declarations <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> that announced the creation of new states.|$|E
5|$|Other French {{leaders were}} {{directly}} {{influenced by the}} text of the Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Independence</b> itself. The Manifesto of the Province of Flanders (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration; others include the Venezuelan Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Independence</b> (1811), the Liberian Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Independence</b> (1847), the declarations of secession by the Confederate States of America (1860–61), and the Vietnamese Proclamation <b>of</b> <b>Independence</b> (1945). These declarations echoed the United States Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Independence</b> in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original.|$|E

40|$|We prove a new general {{multiplicity}} estimate {{applicable to}} sets of functions without any assumption on algebraic independence. The multiplicity estimates {{are commonly used}} in determining measures <b>of</b> algebraic <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> values of functions, for instance {{within the context of}} Mahler's method. For this reason, our result provides an important tool for the proofs <b>of</b> algebraic <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> complex numbers. At the same time, these estimates can be considered as a measure <b>of</b> algebraic <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> functions themselves. Hence our result provides, under some conditions, the measure <b>of</b> algebraic <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> elements in F_q[[T]], where F_q denotes a finite field.

5|$|The May Revolution {{began the}} Argentine War <b>of</b> <b>Independence,</b> {{although}} no formal declaration <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> was issued {{at the time}} and the Primera Junta continued to govern {{in the name of the}} deposed king, FerdinandVII. As similar events occurred in many other cities of the continent, the May Revolution is also considered one of the early events of the Spanish American wars <b>of</b> <b>independence.</b> Historians today debate whether the revolutionaries were truly loyal to the Spanish crown or whether the declaration of fidelity to the king was a necessary ruse to conceal the true objective—to achieve independence—from a population that was not yet ready to accept such a radical change. A formal declaration <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> was finally issued at the Congress of Tucumán on July9, 1816.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the statue}} and framed by marble pilasters {{is a window}} that depicts scenes from Philadelphia history. In the window's {{tympanum}} is a depiction <b>of</b> <b>Independence</b> Hall. Below that are pictures showing William Penn's treaty with the Indians, George Washington's Farewell Address to Congress, the proclamation of the Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Independence,</b> the Philadelphia Convention, the drafting of the Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Independence,</b> Benjamin Franklin's printing office, Betsy Ross exhibiting the United States flag, and Caesar Rodney's ride from Delaware. The border of the window contains portrait busts of notable American Revolution-era Philadelphians: John Bartram, George Clymer, Robert Morris, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, and James Wilson.|$|E
5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the {{resolution}} <b>of</b> <b>independence,</b> Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, the wording of the Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Independence</b> was approved and sent to the printer for publication.|$|E

5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and hardly {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War <b>of</b> <b>Independence,</b> had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. One could say that Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War <b>of</b> <b>Independence,</b> is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E
40|$|Indicators <b>of</b> {{central bank}} <b>independence</b> (CBI) {{based on the}} {{interpretation}} central bank laws in place may not capture the actual <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> the central bank. This paper develops an indicator <b>of</b> actual <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> the Bank Indonesia (BI), the central bank of Indonesia, for the period 1953 - 2008 and compares it with a new legal CBI indicator based on Cukierman (1992). The indicator <b>of</b> actual <b>independence</b> captures institutional and economic factors that affect CBI. We find that before 1999, legal and actual <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> BI diverged substantially. After a new central bank law was enacted, the legal <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> BI increased and converged to actual independence. ...|$|R
