5|$|Greek mythology {{has changed}} over time to {{accommodate}} the evolution <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>culture,</b> of which mythology, both overtly and in its unspoken assumptions, is an index of the changes. In Greek mythology's surviving literary forms, as found mostly {{at the end of}} the progressive changes, it is inherently political, as Gilbert Cuthbertson has argued.|$|E
5|$|A {{rich source}} of Late Paleolithic sites and {{artifacts}} (the Magdalenian culture of 14,500 BCE) is the Prądnik River Valley. The Maszycka Cave there contained {{the remains of a}} typical (at that time) social unit of several families, 20-30 people, as well as numerous tools and other artifacts <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>culture,</b> including ornamented bone utensils. Remnants of a 15,000 to 17,000 years old Magdalenian culture dwelling (a dugout cabin site with traces of supporting posts, a hearth and imported materials) were discovered recently in Ćmielów, Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski County.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{differences}} between the northern and southern Betsimisaraka, many major aspects <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>culture</b> are similar. Major customs among the Betsimisaraka include sambatra (circumcision), folanaka (the birth of a tenth child), ritual sacrifice of zebu for the ancestors, and celebrating the inauguration of a newly constructed house. Marriage, death, birth, the New Year and Independence Day are also communally celebrated. The practice of tromba (ritual spirit possession) is widespread among the Betsimisaraka. Both men and women act as mediums and spectators in these events.|$|E

25|$|Once {{thought to}} face {{extinction}} as a race or culture, Native Americans of numerous tribes have achieved revival <b>of</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cultures,</b> together with asserting their sovereignty and direction <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own affairs since the mid-20th century. Many have started language programs to revive use of traditional languages; some have established tribally controlled colleges and other schools on their reservations, so {{that education is}} expressive <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cultures.</b> Since the late 20th century, many tribes have developed gaming casinos on their sovereign land to raise revenues for economic development, {{as well as to}} promote the education and welfare <b>of</b> <b>their</b> people through health care and construction of improved housing.|$|R
50|$|Their archenemies are the githyanki and the githzerai, {{descendants}} of the rebellious slaves who destroyed their empire millennia ago. Hunting and slaying illithids whenever they can {{is an integral part}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>cultures.</b>|$|R
5|$|Negombo Tamils, or Puttalam Tamils, {{are native}} Sri Lankan Tamils {{who live in}} the western Gampaha and Puttalam districts. The term does not apply to Tamil {{immigrants}} in these areas. They are distinguished from other Tamils by their dialects, one of which is known as the Negombo Tamil dialect, and by aspects <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>culture</b> such as customary laws. Most Negombo Tamils have assimilated into the Sinhalese ethnic group through a process known as Sinhalisation. Sinhalisation has been facilitated by caste myths and legends (see Passing (sociology)).|$|E
5|$|The 1970s {{ushered in}} a period of wide-ranging social and {{political}} changes, stemming largely from the concerns of the French speaking majority about the conservation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>culture</b> and language, given the traditional predominance of the English Canadian minority in the business arena. The October Crisis and the 1976 election of the Parti Québécois, supporting sovereign status for Quebec, resulted in the departure of many businesses and people from the city. In 1976 Montreal was the host of the Olympics. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities.|$|E
5|$|Yamhad's {{population}} was predominately Amorite, {{and had a}} typical Bronze Age Syrian culture. Yamhad was also inhabited by a substantial Hurrian population that settled in the kingdom, adding the influence <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>culture.</b> Yamhad controlled a wide trading network, being a gateway between the eastern Iranian plateau and the Aegean region in the west. Yamhad worshiped the traditional Northwest Semitic deities, and the capital Halab was considered a holy city among the other Syrian cities as a center of worship for Hadad, who was regarded as the main deity of northern Syria.|$|E

5|$|South Indian {{music and}} dances {{such as the}} Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam styles are popular in the Deccan region. As a result <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>culture</b> policies, North Indian music and dance gained {{popularity}} during {{the rule of the}} Mughals and Nizams, and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif (courtesans). These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture, and were appointed to teach singing, poetry and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy. This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music, dholak ke geet (household songs based on local Folklore), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events. The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} peoples of Taiwan face {{economic and social}} barriers, including a high unemployment rate and substandard education. Since the early 1980s, many aboriginal groups have been actively seeking {{a higher degree of}} political self-determination and economic development. The revival of ethnic pride is expressed in many ways by aborigines, including the incorporation of elements <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>culture</b> into commercially successful pop music. Efforts are under way in indigenous communities to revive traditional cultural practices and preserve their traditional languages. The Austronesian Cultural Festival in Taitung City is one means by which community members promote aboriginal culture. In addition, several aboriginal communities have become extensively involved in the tourism and ecotourism industries with the goal of achieving increased economic self-reliance and preserving their culture.|$|E
5|$|US {{cast members}} Kevin Clash and Marty Robinson have cast and trained the {{international}} puppeteers. At first, Muppet builder Kermit Love constructed the puppets {{for the new}} shows in the US. According to Gikow in 2009, Jim Henson's Creature Shop, overseen by Connie Peterson, has taken over puppet creation. The producers of Sisimpur, the Bangladesh co-production, created their own traditional puppets because their puppet-making craft is thousands of years old and an important part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>culture.</b> The producers of each co-production developed and built their own sets, live-action videos, and animations in-country. After they developed, produced, and aired the new show, they conducted research to ascertain whether their curriculum goals were met, just as {{was done in the}} US after the first season of Sesame Street. According to producer Nadine Zylstra, they faced unusual challenges rarely experienced in the US. For example, riots and conflicts between Serbs and Albanians in 2004 delayed production of the Kosovo co-production for three months. In 2005, a nationwide strike in Bangladesh temporarily stalled production of their show.|$|E
