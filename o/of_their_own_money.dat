Having {{spent more than}} $20million <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>money,</b> Broussard and Miller asked Take-Two for $6million to {{complete}} the game. According to Broussard and Miller, Take-Two initially agreed, but then only offered $2.5million. Take-Two maintained that they offered $2.5million up front and another $2.5million on completion. Broussard rejected the counteroffer, and on May 6, 2009, suspended all development.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> than in the past.|$|E

25|$|Under normal circumstances, the Outfit {{would have}} distanced itself from DeStefano {{due to his}} sadistic, irrational behavior. However, the bosses tolerated DeStefano because he earned them {{a great deal of}} money.

At first, like Colonel Shute and Governor Burner, he was engaged in disputing with the Legislature about his salary. But, as he found it impossible to get a fixed sum, he finally obtained the king's leave to accept whatever the Legislature chose to give him.

25|$|Subset Games had {{initially}} planned {{to work on}} the title for about a three-month period after saving enough <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> to cover expenses for about a year. The additional attention to the game forced them to extend development - what would be a two-year process - and thus they turned to Kickstarter in order to fund the final polish of the game as well as costs associated to its release, seeking a total funding goal of $10,000. Their Kickstarter approach was considered well-timed, riding on the coattails of the highly successful Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter in March 2012, as well as gaining the attention of top developers like Ken Levine and Markus Persson; with interest spurred in crowd-funded games, Subset games was able to raise over $200,000 through the effort. FTL represents one of the first games to come out from this surge in crowd-funded games, and demonstrates that such funding mechanisms can support video game development.|$|E

500|$|Scott Turow's 1987 novel Presumed Innocent {{had first}} {{attracted}} film producers {{a year before}} it was published. The film rights were {{the subject of a}} bidding war among a host of established studios and producers. David Brown and Richard D. Zanuck made the first bid of $75,000. Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer initially offered $300,000, financed by Paramount Pictures, but backed down when bids climbed to $750,000. Peter Guber and Jon Peters, and Sydney Pollack and Mark Rosenberg of Mirage Productions made $1 million bids <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>money.</b> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Irwin Winkler also made bids, while Universal Pictures passed on the project. After Pollack and Rosenberg acquired the rights in December 1986, United Artists negotiated with the producers to finance and distribute the film. In May 1987, Pollack hired Frank Pierson to write the script. Shortly after, United Artists backed out as a distributor. Roger Birnbaum, head of worldwide production for United Artists, claimed that the studio found the project [...] "just too expensive". In July 1988, the project moved to Warner Bros.|$|E
500|$|As the {{previously}} prolific band were unusually quiet, the UK music press began to speculate. Melody Maker {{calculated that the}} total recording cost had come close to £250,000; however, McGee, Green, and Shields dispute this. Shields argued that that estimated cost (and Creation's near-bankruptcy) was a myth exaggerated by McGee because the Creation owner [...] "thought it would be cool." [...] According to Shields, [...] "The amount we spent nobody knows because we never counted. But we worked it out ourselves just by working out how much the studios cost and how much all the engineers cost. 160 thousand pounds was the most we could come to as the actual money that was spent." [...] In Green's opinion, the Melody Maker's estimate erred on the low side, by £20,000. He said, [...] "Once you'd even got it recorded and mixed, {{the very act of}} compiling, EQ-ing, etcetera took weeks on its own." [...] In a December 1991 interview, Shields said that most of the money claimed to have been spent on the album was simply [...] "money to live on" [...] over three years, with the album itself only costing [...] "a few thousand". He also claimed that the album represented only four months work over two years. Shields later said that most of the money spent was the band's own money, and that [...] "Creation probably spent fifteen to twenty thousand pounds <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> on it, and that's it.
