It employs the recently developed metallic triple-beam resonators with thick-film printed {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) drive and pickup elements. The new torque transducer has been tested in a torque range of up to 20 Nm, resulting in a strain level of 400 microstrain on the measurement shaft surface and giving a large frequency-change output of 800 Hz. The strain level required by the new torque transducer can be much lower (~ 100 microstrain) than the level (~ 1800 microstrain) usually required by conventional metallic resistance-strain-gauge-based torque transducers, thus increasing the transducer <b>overload</b> <b>capability</b> by a large factor.

40|$|AbstractDifferential {{pressure}} sensors using precision-engineered protection mechanisms provide an <b>overload</b> <b>capability</b> {{of at least}} Δp= 160 bar at a nominal range of Δp= 10 mbar.

The presented measuring element achieves these characteristics for one-sided overload by limiting the deflection of the diaphragm with an integrated overload protection made of structured glass (Fig. 2). The overload resistant differential pressure sensor with nominal range Δp= 10 mbar is able to provide an average <b>overload</b> <b>capability</b> of Δp= 220 bar (Fig. 1).

40|$|Smart grids {{have been}} {{constructed}} {{so as to guarantee}} the security and stability of the power grid in recent years. Power transformers are a most vital component in the complicated smart grid network. Any transformer failure can cause damage of the whole power system, within which the failures caused by overloading cannot be ignored. This research gives a new insight into <b>overload</b> <b>capability</b> assessment of transformers. The hot-spot temperature of the winding is the most critical factor in measuring the overload capacity of power transformers. Thus, the hot-spot temperature is calculated to obtain the duration running time of the power transformers under overloading conditions. Then the overloading probability is fitted with the mature and widely accepted Weibull probability density function. To guarantee the accuracy of this fitting, a new objective function is proposed to obtain the desired parameters in the Weibull distributions. In addition, ten different mutation scenarios are adopted in the differential evolutionary algorithm to optimize the parameter in the Weibull distribution. The final comprehensive <b>overload</b> <b>capability</b> of the power transformer is assessed by the duration running time as well as the overloading probability. Compared with the previous studies that take no account of the overloading probability, the assessment results obtained in this research are much more reliable...|$|E

In order to analyze daily temperature variation of the cable the ratio of high level current loading to rated current of the cable is also required. Parameters that affect results are varied in analysis: thermal conductivity and diffusivity of soil, the distance between adjacent cables, temperature of referent soil, cross-bonding of metal sheets, etc. The results of analysis are ranges of conductor temperature variation, i. e. daily minimum and maximum temperature of the conductor for different laying and ambient conditions.

40|$|Many {{researches}} {{have been}} carried out to induction motors for starting, braking, speed reversal and speed control, because they are relatively cheap, reliable and rugged machines due to absence of slip rings or commutators. Induction motors exhibit highly coupled, nonlinear time varying system which is difficult to control since some state variables are difficult to be measured. However, recent advancements in semiconductor power electronics and microcontrollers have made it possible to use induction motors in many variable speed drive applications, as they are capable of similar performance as DC motor. This paper presents a study for indirect vector control of induction motor as it can be operated over a wide speed range, including low speed, with rapid, accurate torque control and good momentary <b>overload</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Also, the use of artificial neural network, ANN is proposed to emulate the function of Indirect-Field-Oriented-Control (IFOC), to perform the critical function of synchronous speed estimation internally, transformation from three-phase ABC currents to two-phase d-q synchronous frame currents and transformation from two-phase d-q synchronous frame voltages to three-phase ABC voltages during both constant torque and constant power regions, also for motor reversing and braking modes...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to synchronous generators, {{due to their}} asynchronous operation, the speed variation of Type 3 WTGs is {{much larger than the}} permissible system frequency variation. Their rotor speed can be controlled between 0.7 and 1.2 using modern power converters [62]. Their emulated inertial constant can be set as large as several times their inherent inertial constant in an auxiliary control loop. The partial-scale power converter (20 %– 30 % of full rating) in the rotor circuit of Type 3 WTGs imposes limitations on the deloaded operating level, maximum inertial response and rotational speed range (within ± 20 %–± 30 % of synchronous speed) [55]. Compared to Type 3 WTGs with the identical rated power capability and inertial constant, Type 4 WTGs are capable of providing stronger inertial response due to the wider operating range of their rotor speeds (0.5 – 1.2 p.u.) [34]. Moreover, the full-scale power converter allows Type 4 WTGs to possess a higher <b>overloading</b> <b>capability,</b> so that more temporary inertial power can be injected into grid for a short period [78]. In addition, Type 4 WTGs might utilize a larger amount of energy stored in the DC-link capacitor to enhance the emulated inertial response and compensate for the temporary power deficit during the rotor speed recovery [37].|$|R
