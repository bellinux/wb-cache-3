5|$|Later in {{the morning}} North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the {{southern}} tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> overlooking Agok to take these troops under fire. When the squad reached the tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit these houses with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running for the river. At this the light machine gun at the tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> took them under fire, as did another across the Naktong to {{the south in the}} US 25th Infantry Division sector. Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force. In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.|$|E

5|$|Three {{divisions}} {{were ultimately}} responsible for manning the frontline defences opposite the Canadian Corps. The 16th Bavarian Infantry Division was located opposite {{the village of}} Souchez and responsible for the defence of the northernmost section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> The division was created in January 1917 through the amalgamation of existing Bavarian formations and had so far only opposed the Canadian Corps. The 79th Reserve Division {{was responsible for the}} defence of the vast central section including the highest point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> Hill 145. The 79th Reserve Division fought for two years on the Eastern Front before being transferred to the Vimy sector at the end of February 1917. The 1st Bavarian Reserve Division had been in the Arras area since October 1914 and was holding the villages of Thélus, Bailleul and the southern slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b>|$|E

40|$|First year sea ice ridges were {{characterized}} off <b>the</b> West Coast <b>of</b> Newfoundland from 07 to 22 March 1999. This report presents a comprehensive investigation of five <b>ridges</b> sampled during <b>the</b> March 1999 program. <b>The</b> ice microstructure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> is correlated to the bulk physical properties (temperature, salinity and density) and consolidated layer thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridged</b> ice. <b>The</b> <b>ridges</b> had a maximum sail height {{that ranged from}} 1. 5 to 3. 8 m. The consolidated layer thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridged</b> ice ranged from 0. 7 to 2. 1 m and the total ice thickness varied from 1. 8 to 5. 0 m. <b>The</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice cores was just below 00 C. The average bulk ice salinity ranged from 3. 6 to 4. 1 2 ̆ 030, with a maximum of 6 2 ̆ 030. Ice densities from <b>the</b> examined <b>ridge</b> site ranged from 0. 85 to 0. 93 Mg/m 3. The warm temperatures, high porosity and low density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice indicated temperate ridges in a deteriorated state. Due to <b>the</b> deteriorated state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridged</b> ice, {{it is expected that}} the measured average salinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> may have decreased after <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> formed. <b>The</b> sail blocks showed that the ice involved in <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> formation consisted <b>of</b> columnar grained ice, predominantly. Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> macrostructure <b>of</b> <b>ridged</b> ice cores showed highly porous, loosely consolidated ice with discrete banding. <b>The</b> microstructure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cores revealed a non-uniform matrix comprised of mostly granular ice, with some coarse frazil particles and elongated columns.

5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from the toe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E

5|$|On 14 and 15 July 1942, {{during the}} First Battle of El Alamein, the {{battalion}} {{was engaged in}} what would {{be known as the}} Battle of Ruweisat Ridge. Ruweisat Ridge was held by the enemy and was in the centre of the El Alamein line, dominating the surrounding area. The 4th Brigade was to take the western end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> with Kippenberger's 5th Brigade tasked with the capture of the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> The 5th Indian Brigade was allocated to deal with the eastern end. British tanks, in the form of two armoured brigades, were to protect the flanks and be in support to deal with the expected counterattack. However, little thought was given to communication and liaison between the infantry and armoured brigades, nor was a clear chain of command established. This would have implications for the outcome of the battle.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November, {{fighting}} for the main position around Sattelberg commenced. The previous night, in order {{to prepare for the}} attack on the 2200 feature, the 2/48th Battalion captured Green Ridge, a small but important feature that dominated the Sattelberg road. The capture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> secured a start line forward of Jivevaneng for Whitehead's 26th Brigade to launch the first stage of their attack upon Sattelberg. The following day, the 2/48th Battalion handed over responsibility for the defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> to a company from the 2/23rd Battalion, and the attack commenced amidst heavy supporting artillery and machine-gun fire. In response, the Japanese artillery from Sattelberg fired a limited barrage onto the Australians on Green Ridge.|$|E
25|$|Geologically, Iceland is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mid-Atlantic <b>Ridge,</b> a <b>ridge</b> {{along which}} <b>the</b> oceanic crust spreads and forms new oceanic crust.

50|$|Parting lineation is a {{sedimentary}} structure commonly found on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> parallel-laminated sandstones. It is {{aligned with the}} current direction, the alignment holding out in places over several square meters. The lineation is formed by flat, parallel ridges which are separated by depressions or grooves. <b>The</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> rarely exceeds several grain diameters. In profile the depressions are flat-bottomed and <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> are rounded. Ridges and depressions are arranged en echelon, so that in downstream direction <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> pass into depressions and vice versa. The crosswise distance between individual ridges typically varies between 0.59 and 1.25 centimeters. Length as well as spacing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> augments with increasing grain size: in fine-grained sands <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> are 3.5 to 12 centimeters long, whereas in medium-grained sands they can reach 30 centimeters in length. <b>The</b> long dimension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> is therefore 5 to 20 times their crosswise spacing. The coarse(r) sediment fraction accumulates in <b>the</b> <b>ridges,</b> whereas dark heavy minerals and mica trails take up an intermediate position between <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> and <b>the</b> grooves.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} <b>the</b> periodic spacing <b>of</b> wrinkle <b>ridges</b> observed on <b>the</b> Tharsis Plateau <b>of</b> Mars is investigated by examining <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacing <b>of</b> <b>ridges</b> in six major provinces on the plateau; these regions were further divided into domains on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>ridge</b> orientation. <b>The</b> <b>ridges</b> are interpreted to be folds resulting from buckling, followed by reverse to thrust faulting (flexure-fracture). Several buckling models that {{may account for}} <b>the</b> periodic nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> are analyzed. <b>The</b> model that would account for the periodic spacing and the asymmetric fold geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> involves plastic yielding confined to the hinge area, {{that would result in}} rapid closing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fold and, with continued horizontal shortening, <b>the</b> eventual development <b>of</b> reverse to thrust faulting...|$|R

5|$|The {{objective}} of the Canadian Corps was {{to take control of}} the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive. This would ensure that the southern flank could advance without suffering German enfilade fire.

The village of Thélus fell during the second day of the attack, as did the crest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient against considerable German resistance. The final objective, a fortified knoll located outside the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, fell to the Canadian Corps on 12 April. The German forces then retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line.|$|E
