50|$|Domestic <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> {{same-sex}} {{relationships is}} a pattern <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> or abuse that occurs within same-sex relationships. Domestic violence {{is an issue that}} affects people of any sexuality, but there are issues that affect victims <b>of</b> same-sex domestic <b>violence</b> specifically. These issues include homophobia, HIV and AIDS stigma, STD risk and other health issues, lack of legal support, and the violence they face being considered less serious than heterosexual domestic violence. Moreover, the issue <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> same-sex relationships has not been studied as comprehensively as domestic <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> heterosexual relationships. However, there are legal changes being made to help victims <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> same-sex relationships, as well as organizations that cater specifically to victims <b>of</b> domestic <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> same-sex relationships.|$|R

5|$|The Great Silence was one {{of several}} Spaghetti Westerns {{produced}} between 1967 and 1968, along with Enzo G. Castellari's Kill Them All and Come Back Alone and One Dollar Too Many, Sergio Sollima's Run, Man, Run and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West, to be showcased in Patrick Morin's made-for-television documentary Western, Italian Style. During the making of the film, Corbucci and Trintignant were interviewed; Corbucci discussed the nature <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> his films and Spaghetti Westerns in general (comparing the use <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> such films to the James Bond franchise), while Trintignant spoke of the unusual nature of his role and how he would practice drawing his gun – by pulling a sock (substituting for the gloves Silence wears in the film) off his hand and reaching for a long-steamed artichoke in his pocket.|$|E

30|$|In Indonesia, {{data from}} the Annual Report National Commission on Anti-Violence Against Women of the Republic of Indonesia (Indonesian National Commission on Violence Against Women, 2017) {{revealed}} that sexual <b>violence</b> ranked second <b>in</b> 2016 <b>in</b> <b>violence</b> against women cases, an increase compared with the rank of third in 2014. The most significant form <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> women is rape (72 %), followed by obscenity (18 %) and sexual harassment (5 %). Regarding investigations <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence,</b> only {{a few studies have}} reported the prevalence <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia. Hayati et al. (2011) reported that the prevalence of lifetime exposure to sexual violence was 22 % among women in rural areas (Hayati et al., 2011). A study in the 3 provinces in Indonesia reported that the incidence <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> men ranged between 1.5 % and 1.8 % (Jewkes et al., 2013).

5|$|From October 1988 to September 1994 {{the voices}} of representatives from Sinn Féin and several Irish republican and loyalist groups were banned by the British {{government}} from being broadcast on television and radio in the United Kingdom.

5|$|In 1831 {{there were}} {{extensive}} riots in the Forest of Dean, led by Warren James. After {{the intervention of}} the military, the rioters were dispersed and order restored, but a range of complaints were levied about the enforcement of the local laws on miners and metal-workers. There had been attacks against St Briavels Castle by discontented locals before during the 1780s, but the degree <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> this case was much greater. An act of Parliament followed, establishing a number of commissioners who investigated local practices and recent events at the Castle.|$|E

5|$|The film premiered with {{a single}} {{screening}} at the Dom Kino in Moscow in 1966. Audience reaction was enthusiastic, despite some criticism of the film's naturalistic depiction <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> <b>In</b> February 1967, Tarkovsky and Alexei Romanov complained that the film was not yet approved for a wide release and refused to cut further scenes from the film. Tarkovsky's refusal resulted in Andrei Rublev not being released for years, despite being a topic of discussion at the top level of Mosfilm, Goskino and even during {{a meeting of the}} Central Committee of the Communist Party.|$|E

They only left Cyprus on the rumour of an imperial fleet approaching the island, but only after they had forced all Cypriots to ransom themselves, {{with the exception of}} the wealthiest individuals (including Emperor Manuel's nephew, John Doukas Komnenos), whom they carried off to Antioch. Cyprus would never entirely recover from the devastation that Raynald's and Thoros's marauding raid caused.|$|E

5|$|Black Sabbath {{was made}} {{at the end of}} {{production}} of The Girl Who Knew Too Much during an eight-week period between February and March 1963. American International Production's involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of the Titra Sound Corporation to be on set to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically pronounce their dialogue as {{it had to be done}} rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also on set to give suggestions to Bava on how to make his film more appropriate for American audiences which led to decreasing the amount <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> the film.

5|$|Jinnah {{rejected}} Gandhi's {{proposal and}} called for Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for partition of Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now Bangladesh and West Bengal, gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day. The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, {{and tens of thousands}} were injured in the cycle <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> the days that followed. Gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres.|$|E
5|$|The Stanford rugby {{teams of}} 1906 to 1917 {{represented}} Stanford University as the school's only football program during those years, replacing American football with rugby union. The school had played American football from 1892 to 1905, but in 1906, {{concerned with the}} growing levels <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> football, Stanford and other universities changed to rugby. Stanford played twelve seasons of rugby, during which it played other college teams, club teams from the United States, Canada, and Australia, {{as well as the}} New Zealand national team and Australia national team. Despite the team's success, it became clear that other schools were not adopting rugby in large numbers, and after rival California returned to football in 1915, Stanford faced a limited number of potential opponents; and after a year of playing neither sport officially due to World War I, the school returned to American football in 1919.|$|E

5|$|The era of American film {{production}} {{from the early}} sound era to {{the enforcement of the}} Hays Code in 1934 is denoted as Pre-Code Hollywood. The era contained violence and crime in pictures which would not be seen again until decades later. Although the Hays office had specifically recommended removing profanity, the drug trade, and prostitution from pictures, it had never officially recommended against depictions <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> any form in the 1920s. State censor boards, however, created their own guidelines, and New York in particular developed a list of violent material which had to be removed for a picture to be shown in the state. Two main types of crime films were released during the period: the gangster picture and the prison film.|$|E
5|$|The {{lieutenant}} governor is elected {{on the same}} election ticket as the Governor in a statewide election held every four years, concurrent with United States presidential elections. Should a {{lieutenant governor}} die while in office, resign, or succeed to the governorship, the constitution specifies no mechanism by which to fill vacancies in the lieutenant governor's office. Historically, the position has generally remained vacant during such events. The last attempt to fill such a vacancy in 1887 led to the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> the state legislature known as the Black Day of the General Assembly. However, {{in recent years the}} Governor has appointed a Lieutenant Governor if a vacancy arises.|$|E
5|$|The party's {{views on}} the United States and the Middle East have evolved over time. Despite the anti-American views of some right-wing forums in the 1970s and 1980s (that chiefly were rooted in worries over US {{cultural}} expansion and hegemonic role in world politics {{at the expense of}} Europe), the FPÖ were more positively inclined towards the United States under Haider's leadership in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, this changed in 2003 following Haider visiting Saddam Hussein {{on the eve of the}} Iraq War; he subsequently condemned US foreign policy and derided George W. Bush for not being very different from Hussein. This move was strongly criticised by the FPÖ, which was part of the then-current government. Nevertheless, in the mid- to late 2000s the FPÖ too criticised US foreign policy as promoted by Bush, which it saw as leading to increased levels <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> the Middle East. The party also became more critical of Israel's part in the Israel-Palestine conflict.|$|E
