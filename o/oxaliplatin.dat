5|$|Platinum {{is used in}} {{catalytic}} converters, laboratory equipment, {{electrical contacts}} and electrodes, platinum resistance thermometers, dentistry equipment, and jewelry. Being a heavy metal, it leads to health problems upon exposure to its salts; but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic platinum has not been linked to adverse health effects. Compounds containing platinum, such as cisplatin, <b>oxaliplatin</b> and carboplatin, are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, <b>oxaliplatin</b> and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Oxalate, the {{conjugate}} base of oxalic acid, {{is an excellent}} ligand for metal ions, e.g. the drug <b>oxaliplatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{the tumor}} is {{determined}} to be platinum-resistant, vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) {{or some combination of}} paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and <b>oxaliplatin</b> may be used as a second-line therapy.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{depends on}} the tumor type, but tends to be cisplatin-based (or {{carboplatin}} or <b>oxaliplatin)</b> every three weeks with fluorouracil (5-FU) either continuously or every three weeks. In more recent studies, addition of epirubicin was better than other comparable regimens in advanced nonresectable cancer. Chemotherapy may be given after surgery (adjuvant, i.e. to reduce risk of recurrence), before surgery (neoadjuvant) or if surgery is not possible; in this case, cisplatin and 5-FU are used. Ongoing trials compare various combinations of chemotherapy; the phase II/III REAL-2 trial – for example – compares four regimens containing epirubicin and either cisplatin or <b>oxaliplatin,</b> and either continuously infused fluorouracil or capecitabine.|$|E
25|$|The use of DMSO as an {{alternative}} treatment for cancer is of particular concern, {{as it has been}} shown to interfere with a variety of chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, carboplatin, and <b>oxaliplatin.</b> There is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that DMSO has any effect, and most sources agree that its history of side effects when tested warrants caution when using it as a dietary supplement, for which it is marketed heavily with the usual disclaimer.|$|E
25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and <b>oxaliplatin.</b> They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
25|$|Cisplatin {{combination}} chemotherapy is {{the cornerstone}} of treatment of many cancers. Initial platinum responsiveness is high but the majority of cancer patients will eventually relapse with cisplatin-resistant disease. Many mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been proposed including changes in cellular uptake and efflux of the drug, increased detoxification of the drug, inhibition of apoptosis and increased DNA repair. <b>Oxaliplatin</b> is active in highly cisplatin-resistant cancer cells in the laboratory; however, there is little evidence for its activity in the clinical treatment of patients with cisplatin-resistant cancer. The drug paclitaxel may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer; the mechanism for this activity is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Between 30 and 40 {{percent of}} {{patients}} undergoing chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, <b>oxaliplatin</b> and carboplatin. Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, {{is determined by the}} choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the patient already has peripheral neuropathy. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory – pain, tingling, numbness and temperature sensitivity – in some cases motor nerves are affected, and occasionally, also, the autonomic nervous system.|$|E
500|$|Cisplatin, or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) is {{the first}} of a series of square planar platinum(II)-containing {{chemotherapy}} drugs, including carboplatin and <b>oxaliplatin.</b> These compounds are capable of crosslinking DNA, and kill cells by similar pathways to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents.

2500|$|Triplatin tetranitrate (rINN; {{also known}} as BBR3464) is a platinum-based {{cytotoxic}} drug that underwent clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} human cancer.

50|$|<b>Oxaliplatin</b> was {{discovered}} in 1976 at Nagoya City University by Professor Yoshinori Kidani, who was granted U.S. Patent 4,169,846 in 1979. <b>Oxaliplatin</b> was subsequently in-licensed by Debiopharm and developed as an advanced colorectal cancer treatment. Debiopharm licensed the drug to Sanofi-Aventis in 1994. It gained European approval in 1996 (initially in France) and approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002.
