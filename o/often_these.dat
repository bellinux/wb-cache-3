5|$|A few {{jumping spider}} species, {{including}} M. inclemens, {{have been able}} to establish themselves in man-made structures. Most <b>often</b> <b>these</b> spiders are found on outbuildings or structures such as fences, rather than in permanently inhabited houses.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Twenty-fifth Amendment's adoption, a Vice Presidential vacancy {{remained}} {{until the}} start of the next presidential term. The Vice Presidency has been vacant several times due to death, resignation, or succession to the Presidency. <b>Often</b> <b>these</b> vacancies lasted for several years.|$|E
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. <b>Often,</b> <b>these</b> {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E

5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. <b>Often</b> <b>these</b> drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. <b>Often</b> <b>these</b> {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E
5|$|Once in the field, Bond {{frequently}} meets {{up with a}} local ally upon arrival. These can be {{his foreign}} counterparts like Tiger Tanaka in Japan or CIA operatives like Felix Leiter, or his own staff in a secret location. Such characters can also be female, some of whom succumb to Bond's charms. <b>Often</b> <b>these</b> allies will provide Bond either with information to complete his mission, or with additional gadgets from Q. Some allies recur {{through a number of}} instalments, such as the Western-friendly KGB chief, General Gogol, Sir Frederick Gray, the Minister of Defence and René Mathis.|$|E

5|$|The Queen's castle {{was used}} {{prominently}} in the advertising of the film (acting as {{the backdrop of the}} film's poster). Later Disney fairy tales, including Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, feature similarly fantastical castles and palaces, and <b>often</b> <b>these</b> buildings act as centrepieces or backdrops for the movies' posters. A fairy tale castle stands at the centre of each Disney theme park, and the image of the castle is used in the logo for Buena Vista International.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources for}} Urse's life are English {{documents}} such as charters and writs which mention his activities. <b>Often</b> <b>these</b> {{are contained in}} collections of such documents, known as cartularies, which were assembled by monasteries and cathedral chapters to document their landholdings. Cartularies frequently contain documents from landholders surrounding a monastery, which {{is the case with}} many of the documents mentioning Urse. Other sources of information on Urse are Domesday Book, which mentions his landholdings in 1086, and a number of chronicles, including William of Malmesbury's Gesta pontificum Anglorum, Florence of Worcester's Chronicon ex chronicis, and Hemming's Cartulary, a mixed chronicle and cartulary from Worcester Cathedral. There are also mentions of Urse in Norman sources, such as charters for Saint-Georges de Boscherville Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. <b>Often,</b> <b>these</b> newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E

5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Decree on Workers' Control, which {{called on the}} workers of each {{enterprise}} to establish an elected committee to monitor their enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate to the trade unions, which were subordinate to VSNKh; thus, the state's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled all foreign debts and refused to pay interest owed on them. In April 1918, it nationalised foreign trade, establishing a state monopoly on imports and exports. In June 1918, it decreed nationalisation of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although <b>often</b> <b>these</b> were state-owned in name only. Full-scale nationalisation {{did not take place}} until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.|$|E
5|$|In {{these new}} towns, the {{aristocracy}} was allocated the higher areas, {{where the air}} was cooler and fresher and the views finest. The church was allocated the town centre (Illustration 8), for convenience to all, and to reflect the church's global and central position; round the pairing of cathedral and episcopal Palazzo Vescovile were built the convents. The merchants and storekeepers chose their lots on the planned wider streets leading from the main piazzas. Finally, the poor were allowed to erect their simple brick huts and houses in the areas nobody else wanted. Lawyers, doctors, {{and members of the}} few professions including the more skilled artisans - those who fell between the strictly defined upper and lower class - and were able to afford building plots, often lived {{on the periphery of the}} commercial and upper class residential sectors, but equally <b>often</b> <b>these</b> people just lived in a larger or grander house than their neighbours in the poorer areas. However, many of the skilled artists working on the rebuilding lived as part of the extended households of their patrons. In this way Baroque town planning came to symbolize and reflect political authority, and later its style and philosophy spread as far as Annapolis and Savannah in English America, and most notably Haussmann's 19th century re-designing of Paris. The stage was now set for the explosion of Baroque architecture, which was to predominate in Sicily until the early 19th century.|$|E
