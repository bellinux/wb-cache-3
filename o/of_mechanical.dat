40|$|Abstract: In this article, on {{the basis}} of results for mode analysis, the forced {{vibration}} of the drive system to load and voltage excitations is investigated. By dividing load, displacement, voltage, and current into mean values and time-varying ones, the dynamic equations <b>of</b> the <b>mechanical</b> and electrical systems are transformed into the ones for time-varying portion of the displacements or current, respectively. Using the Laplace transformation, the transfer functions <b>of</b> the <b>mechanical</b> and electrical systems are obtained. The transfer functions are used in the study to investigate the forced frequency responses <b>of</b> the <b>mechanical</b> and electrical systems to the load or voltage excitations. The influences of the drive parameters on the forced responses are discussed in detail. It is known that only for the three natural frequencies of the rotational modes, the forced responses <b>of</b> the <b>mechanical</b> system to load excitations occur. In addition, the results are used to simplify the dynamic equations <b>of</b> the <b>mechanical</b> system, and three-degree-of-freedommotion equations <b>of</b> the <b>mechanical</b> system are obtained. Results show that electrical parameters have significant influence on the vibration <b>of</b> the <b>mechanical</b> system and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|We {{theoretically}} study cooling of flexural modes <b>of</b> a <b>mechanical</b> oscillator by Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) atoms (Rb 87) {{trapped in}} a magnetic trap. The mechanical oscillator with a tiny magnet attached on one of its free ends produces an oscillating magnetic field. When its oscillating frequency matches certain hyperfine Zeeman energy of Rb 87 atoms, the trapped BEC atoms are coupled out of the magnetic trap by the mechanical oscillator, flying away from the trap with stolen energy from the mechanical oscillator. Thus the mode temperature <b>of</b> the <b>mechanical</b> oscillator is reduced. The mode temperature of the steady state <b>of</b> a <b>mechanical</b> oscillator, measured by the mean steady-state phonon number in the flexural mode <b>of</b> the <b>mechanical</b> oscillator, is analyzed.

5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle.

This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted <b>of</b> <b>mechanical</b> links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder.
