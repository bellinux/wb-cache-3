25|$|Another {{method of}} {{powering}} some diode lasers {{is the use}} of <b>optical</b> <b>pumping.</b> Optically pumped semiconductor lasers (OPSL) use a III-V semiconductor chip as the gain medium, and another laser (often another diode laser) as the pump source. OPSL offer several advantages over ILDs, particularly in wavelength selection and lack of interference from internal electrode structures.|$|E
25|$|Since {{only a few}} atoms must {{be excited}} into the upper laser level to form a {{population}} inversion, a four-level laser is much more efficient than a three-level one, and most practical lasers are of this type. In reality, many more than four energy levels {{may be involved in}} the laser process, with complex excitation and relaxation processes involved between these levels. In particular, the pump band may consist of several distinct energy levels, or a continuum of levels, which allow <b>optical</b> <b>pumping</b> of the medium over a wide range of wavelengths.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} concerns {{an optical}} amplifier having a signal input for an optical signal to be amplified, a Raman <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> source for generating an <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> signal (P) and an optical amplification medium. Particularly, the Raman <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> source and the optical amplification medium {{are designed to}} cause polarization pulling of the optical signal to be amplified, in said optical amplification medium, towards the <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> signal, by co-propagation of the optical signal to be amplified and the <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> signal in said optical amplification medium so that the polarization state of the amplified optical signal matches the polarization state of the <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> signal at the output of said optical amplification medium...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} ultrafast modulation of {{terahertz radiation}} by unaligned optically pumped single-walled carbon nanotubes. Photoexcitation by an ultrafast <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> pulse induces transient terahertz absorption in nanowires aligned {{parallel to the}} <b>optical</b> <b>pump.</b> By controlling the polarisation of the <b>optical</b> <b>pump,</b> we show that terahertz polarisation and modulation can be tuned, allowing sub-picosecond modulation of terahertz radiation. Such speeds suggest potential for semiconductor nanowire devices in terahertz communication technologies...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} polarization-insensitive {{plasmonic}} photoconductive terahertz emitter {{that uses a}} two-dimensional array of nanoscale cross-shaped apertures as the plasmonic contact electrodes. The geometry of the cross-shaped apertures is set to maximize <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> absorption {{in close proximity to}} the contact electrodes. The two-dimensional symmetry of the cross-shaped apertures offers a polarization-insensitive interaction between the plasmonic contact electrodes and <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> beam. We experimentally demonstrate a polarization-insensitive terahertz radiation from the presented emitter in response to a femtosecond <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> beam and similar terahertz radiation powers compared to previously demonstrated polarization-sensitive photoconductive emitters with plasmonic contact electrode gratings at the optimum <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> polarization...|$|R
25|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the blue}} region of the spectrum became widely {{available to the public}} in 2010 with the release of inexpensive high-powered 445-447nm laser diode technology. Previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through DPSS which are comparatively expensive and inefficient, however these technologies are still widely used by the scientific community for applications including optogenetics, Raman spectroscopy, and particle image velocimetry, due to their superior beam quality. Blue gas lasers are also still commonly used for holography, DNA sequencing, <b>optical</b> <b>pumping,</b> and other scientific and medical applications.|$|E
25|$|Helium-3 nuclei have an {{intrinsic}} nuclear spin of , and {{a relatively high}} magnetogyric ratio. Helium-3 can be hyperpolarized using non-equilibrium means such as spin-exchange <b>optical</b> <b>pumping.</b> During this process, circularly polarized infrared laser light, tuned to the appropriate wavelength, is used to excite electrons in an alkali metal, such as caesium or rubidium inside a sealed glass vessel. The angular momentum is transferred from the alkali metal electrons to the noble gas nuclei through collisions. In essence, this process effectively aligns the nuclear spins with the magnetic field {{in order to enhance}} the NMR signal. The hyperpolarized gas may then be stored at pressures of 10 atm, for up to 100 hours. Following inhalation, gas mixtures containing the hyperpolarized helium-3 gas can be imaged with an MRI scanner to produce anatomical and functional images of lung ventilation. This technique is also able to produce images of the airway tree, locate unventilated defects, measure the alveolar oxygen partial pressure, and measure the ventilation/perfusion ratio. This technique may be critical for the diagnosis and treatment management of chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, cystic fibrosis, and asthma.|$|E
500|$|Nuclei {{of two of}} {{the stable}} {{isotopes}} of xenon, 129Xe and 131Xe, have non-zero intrinsic angular momenta (nuclear spins, suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance). The nuclear spins can be aligned beyond ordinary polarization levels by means of circularly polarized light and rubidium vapor. The resulting spin polarization of xenon nuclei can surpass 50% of its maximum possible value, greatly exceeding the thermal equilibrium value dictated by paramagnetic statistics (typically 0.001% of the maximum value at room temperature, even in the strongest magnets). Such non-equilibrium alignment of spins is a temporary condition, and is called hyperpolarization. The process of hyperpolarizing the xenon is called <b>optical</b> <b>pumping</b> (although the process is different from pumping a laser).Xe ...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} {{terahertz}} (THz) generation by optical rectification using tilted-pulse-fronts is developed. It simultaneously accounts for in two spatial dimensions (2 -D) (i) the spatio-temporal {{variations of the}} <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> pulse imparted by the tilted-pulse-front setup, (ii) the nonlinear coupled interaction of THz and optical radiation, (iii) self-phase modulation and (iv) stimulated Raman scattering. The model is validated by quantitative agreement with experiments and analytic calculations. We show that the <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> beam is significantly broadened in the transverse-momentum (kx) domain {{as a consequence of}} its spectral broadening due to THz generation. In the presence of this large frequency and transverse-momentum (or angular) spread, group velocity dispersion causes a spatio-temporal break-up of the <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> pulse which inhibits further THz generation. The implications of these effects on energy scaling and optimization of optical-to-THz conversion efficiency are discussed. This suggests the use of <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> pulses with elliptical beam profiles for large <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> energies. Furthermore, it is seen that optimization of the setup is highly dependent on <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> conditions. Trade-offs in optimizing the optical-to-THz conversion efficiency on the spatial and spectral properties of THz radiation are discussed to guide the development of such sources...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> power {{on a series of}} charging events of individual quantum dots embedded in a field effect structure. Increasing the <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> powers moves all charging events towards more negative voltages and charged biexciton states in addition to single exciton states are observed. The linear shift in voltage with pump power is explained by the accumulation of photogenerated holes within the structure. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

2500|$|Magnons, {{electron}} spin waves, {{can be controlled}} by a magnetic field. [...] Densities from the limit of a dilute gas to a strongly interacting Bose liquid are possible. Magnetic ordering is the analog of superfluidity. In 1999 condensation was demonstrated in antiferromagnetic TlCuCl3, at temperatures as large as 14 K. The high transition temperature (relative to atomic gases) {{is due to the}} magnons small mass (near an electron) and greater achievable density. In 2006, condensation in a ferromagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet thin film was seen even at room temperature, with <b>optical</b> <b>pumping.</b>|$|E
2500|$|MRI has the {{advantages}} of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging. [...] MRI does have several disadvantages though. [...] First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10−3 mol/L [...] to 10−5 mol/L, which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting. [...] This problem {{stems from the fact}} that the population difference between the nuclear spin states is very small at room temperature. [...] For example, at 1.5 teslas, a typical field strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2 million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength, and hyperpolarization via <b>optical</b> <b>pumping</b> or dynamic nuclear polarization. There are also a variety of signal amplification schemes based on chemical exchange that increase sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|The {{absorption}} of an incident <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> pulse {{sets up a}} local thermal stress near {{the surface of the}} sample. This stress launches an elastic strain pulse that propagates into the sample. The exact depth for the stress generation depends, in particular, on the material involved and the <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> wavelength. In metals and semiconductors, for example, ultrashort-timescale thermal and carrier diffusion tends to increase the depth that is initially heated within the first ~1 ps.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a method for}} diagnosing the electric surface potential of a semiconductor based on THz surface generation. In our scheme, that we name <b>Optical</b> <b>Pump</b> Rectification Emission, a THz field is generated directly on the surface via surface optical rectification of an ultrashort pulse after which the DC surface potential is screened with a second <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> pulse. As the THz generation directly relates to the surface potential arising from the surface states, we can then observe the temporal dynamics of the static surface field induced by the screening effect of the photo-carriers. Such an approach is potentially insensitive to bulk carrier dynamics and does not require special illumination geometries...|$|R
40|$|Progress in the {{terahertz}} (THz) {{region of}} the electromagnetic spectrum is undergoing major advances, with advanced THz sources and detectors being developed at a rapid pace. Yet, ultrafast THz communication is still to be realised, owing to the lack of practical and effective THz modulators. Here, we present a novel ultrafast active THz polarization modulator based on GaAs semiconductor nanowires arranged in a wire-grid configuration. We utilise an <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> [...] terahertz probe spectroscopy system and vary the polarization of the <b>optical</b> <b>pump</b> beam to demonstrate ultrafast THz modulation with a switching time of less than 5 ps and a modulation depth of - 8 dB.

For the simplest case of coherent two-level <b>optical</b> <b>pumping</b> of an atomic species containing a single outer-shell electron, this means that the electron is coherently pumped to a single hyperfine sublevel (labeled [...] ), which is defined by the polarization of the pump laser along with the quantum selection rules.

30|$|However, scalar {{magnetic}} sensor such as <b>optical</b> <b>pumped</b> magnetometer is relatively insensitive to its orientation. In {{the theory of}} <b>optical</b> <b>pumped</b> magnetometer, the angle between {{the direction of the}} optical axis and the direction of the ambient field is called tumble angle q. The sensor can’t be operating only when the optical axis is parallel with the ambient field (q =  0 ° or q =  180 °) or perpendicular to the ambient field (q =  90 °). The <b>optical</b> <b>pumped</b> magnetometer will perform satisfactorily when the angle q within a range, like 10 ° < q <  85 ° or 95 ° < q <  170 ° (CS-L, Scintrex), 6 ° < q <  84 ° or 96 ° < q <  174 ° (G 882, Geometrics). Thus, the measurement value of it is almost not influenced by its orientation in measurement coordinate axes. Therefore, it has a great advantage to assemble an array with scalar {{magnetic sensor}}s. In this paper, we propose a method based on a scalar magnetometer array to track the magnetic target. The position of the target can be obtained by the proposed method in real time. In order to compute in real time, we use the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In addition, we can estimate the magnetic moment of the target after computing its position.|$|R

One of the most well-established techniques for terahertz generation utilises photoconductive antennas driven by ultrafast pulsed or dual wavelength continuous wave laser systems, though some limitations, such as confined <b>optical</b> wavelength <b>pumping</b> range and thermal breakdown, still exist.
