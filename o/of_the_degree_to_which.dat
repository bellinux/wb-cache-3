5|$|The Bonville-Courtenay feud {{is often}} given {{as an example}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> law and order {{and respect for the}} king had broken down in the provinces. As a result, modern historians have often {{considered}} it a cause of the later Wars of the Roses; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud is perhaps most well known for culminating in an armed encounter at Clyst (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near Exeter, which resulted in loss of life.|$|E

25|$|D'Emden v Pedder was a {{significant}} Australian court case decided in the High Court of Australia on 26 April 1904.

For example, {{the crime of}} [...] murder uniquely carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the defendant is morally culpable provided they are legally culpable. To use another example: causing injury by dangerous driving carries a maximum sentence of two years, whereas causing death by dangerous driving carries one of fourteen years.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} a recent focus among urban {{planners}} in some communities to create pedestrian-friendly areas and roads, allowing commuting, shopping and recreation {{to be done on}} foot.

The most similar is Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York. Except for the setting, which is a garden instead of a columned space, it is almost identical. [...] Ainsworth writes aside from differences {{in the folds of}} the saints' dresses they are [...] "virtually identical to type, costume and gesture". [...] Art historians are uncertain when the New York panel was painted; 1480 seems a probably date according to tree ring analysis.|$|E

2500|$|Opponents of children's rights often {{raise the}} {{objection}} that rights must entail responsibilities. The children's rights movement asserts rather {{that children have}} rights which adults, states and the government {{have a responsibility to}} uphold. Overall, a 2008 report stated that there had been no improvement in children's rights in the UK since 2002. Warning that there is a [...] "widely held fear of children and young people" [...] in the UK, the report says: [...] "The incessant portrayal of children as thugs and yobs" [...] not only reinforces the fears of the public but also influences policy and legislation." [...] The report does not address the question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the fear of uncontrolled children in the UK is justified.|$|E
2500|$|A graduand (someone {{about to}} be {{presented}} for a degree) wears the full Cambridge academic dress of the highest status degree that they already hold.

[...] Undergraduates, who do not yet hold a degree, wear their undergraduate gown, with the hood of the degree that {{they are about to}} receive. [...] Thus, for example, an undergraduate graduating to a BA degree wears an undergraduate gown and a BA hood. A holder of a BA from Cambridge graduating to a PhD wears both a BA hood and gown, whereas a graduate of another university graduating to a PhD wears a BA or MA status gown and PhD hood.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Forest Principles" [...] {{adopted at}} The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 {{captured}} the general international understanding of {{sustainable forest management}} at that time.

These were all attempts to codify and provide for independent assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the broader objectives of sustainable forest management are being achieved in practice. In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests.

60|$|One of {{the strangest}} {{examples}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> ordinary life is undervalued is the example of popular literature, the vast mass of which we contentedly describe as vulgar.

60|$|In closing {{this part}} of Holbach's book, while not dissenting from his conclusions, we will only remark how little {{conscious}} he seems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> he empties the notions of praise and blame of {{the very essence of}} their old contents. It is not a modification, but the substitution of a new meaning under the old names. Praise in its new sense of admiration for useful and pleasure-giving conduct or motive, is as powerful a force and as adequate an incentive to good conduct and good motives, as praise in the old sense of admiration for a deliberate and voluntary exercise of a free-acting will. But the two senses are different. The old ethical association is transformed into something which usage and the requirements of social self-preservation must make equally potent, but which is not the same. If Holbach and others who hold necessarian opinions were to perceive this more frankly, and to work it out fully, they would prevent a confusion that is very unfavourable to them in the minds of most of those whom they wish to persuade. It is easy to see that the work next {{to be done in the}} region of morals, is the readjustment of the ethical phraseology of the volitional stage, to fit the ideas proper to the stage in which man has become as definitely the object of science as any of the other phenomena of the universe.|$|E

Verifying absolute satisfaction (true or false) of these requirements is challenging. Instead, we analyse requirements that admit flexible degrees of satisfaction.
