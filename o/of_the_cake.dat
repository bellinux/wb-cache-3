5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice subtle changes, such as the flavor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> changing, and a painting {{given to him by}} Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence that reality has changed, and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg, the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} matches on the under-card was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H {{would have to}} defend the title against the fans' choice of three possible opponents: Chris Benoit, Edge, or Shawn Michaels. At Unforgiven, Raw's previous pay-per-view event, Triple H defeated Randy Orton to capture the World Heavyweight Championship. The following night on Raw, Triple H had a celebration thrown in his honor, complete with women, confetti, streamers and a giant cake. Orton, however, sought revenge by coming out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> and assaulting the three members of Evolution, Triple H's stable with Ric Flair and Batista, which Orton had previously been a part of. On the October 4 episode of Raw, {{it was announced that}} because Orton has not won the opportunity to challenge Triple H, fans would be able to choose between three potential contenders for Triple H's World title at Taboo Tuesday. Chris Benoit and Edge were revealed as two of the candidates. Shawn Michaels, however, competed in a qualifying match, which saw him defeat Christian, to become the third candidate. On the October 18 episode of Raw, a standard match involving three wrestlers, called a Triple Threat match, was scheduled between Benoit, Edge, and Michaels. Edge won the match after he pinned Benoit by using the ring ropes for unfair leverage. During the match, Michaels legitimately injured his left knee, tearing his meniscus.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> biomass {{for fuel}} {{required}} {{understanding of its}} chemical nature and thermal characteristic for maximum and effective utilisation, thus seed cakes of Lagenaria vulgaris, Lagenaria ladle and Cucurbita pepo were analyzed for their thermal and chemical properties. <b>The</b> thermal behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> was determined using thermo-gravimetric method and proximate compositions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> were deduced from the thermogram. <b>The</b> percentage <b>of</b> fixed carbon (FC) were within <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 22. 534 and 37. 009 %, while volatile matter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> were 57. 758 % for Lagenaria ladle, 56. 303 % for Lagenaria vulgaris and 54. 882 % for C. pepo. Major organic elements in <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> were measured using CHNS- 923 elemental analyzer. Calorific values and oxygen required for <b>the</b> combustion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> were quantified using bomb calorimeter and stoichiometric equation respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACTTraditional cakes were {{prepared}} from {{a blend of}} melon and soybean meal. The blended meal contained 10 % and 20 % soybean respectively while unblended meal contained 100 % melon meal which served as control. <b>Cakes</b> obtained from <b>the</b> blends were analysed for proximate composition, amino acid content and organoleptic properties. The moisture content and protein content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> increased significantly (p< 0. 05) as <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> soybean inclusion was increased while the fat, ash and crude fibre contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> decreased significantly (p< 0. 05) as <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> soybean inclusion was increased. Inclusion of as little as 10 % soybean increased <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> amino acids in <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> than <b>the</b> control <b>cake.</b> <b>The</b> organoleptic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> were also acceptable at 10 % level of soybean inclusion...|$|R

25|$|Preparation of pu'erh {{involves}} first separating a well-sized {{portion of}} the compressed tea for brewing. This {{can be done by}} flaking off pieces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> or by steaming the entire cake until it is soft from heat and hydration. A pu'erh knife, which is similar to an oyster knife or a rigid letter opener, is used to pry large horizontal flakes of tea off the cake to minimize leaf breakage. Smaller cakes such as tuocha or mushroom pu'erh are often steamed until they can be rubbed apart and then dried. In both cases, a vertical sampling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> should be obtained since the quality of the leaves in a cake usually varies between the surface and the center.|$|E
25|$|Cake {{thickness}} {{may have}} to be controlled or restricted when cake washing is required or the final cake moisture is a critical parameter. When cake washing time is a dominating factor the maximum filtration rate will occur when the minimum cake thickness for discharge is achieved. The time required for washing is increased by the square of the ratio of cake thicknesses. For example, if the thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> is doubled the washing time will increase roughly by a factor of 4.|$|E
25|$|Bĭng: The tea cake itself. Tea cakes {{or other}} {{compressed}} pu'er {{can be made}} up of two or more grades of tea, typically with higher grade leaves on the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> and lower grades or broken leaves in the center. This is done to improve the appearance of the tea cake and improve its sale. Predicting the grade of tea used on the inside takes some effort and experience in selection. However, the area in and around the dimple of the tea cake can sometimes reveal the quality of the inner leaves.|$|E

25|$|On January 9, the Feast of the Epiphany {{has long}} been an {{important}} celebration in Wales, known there as Ystwyll. In Glamorganshire, a huge loaf or cake was prepared, which was then divided up into three parts to represent Christ, the Virgin Mary and the three Wise Men. A large company of neighbors was invited to be present at the dividing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> in which rings were concealed. Whoever discovered a ring in his piece of cake (or bread) was elected as King or Queen and presided over the day's festivities. January 6 was the old-calendar Christmas Day and many of the festivities connected with it lasted well over a century after the new calendar was introduced in 1752.|$|E
25|$|Where Q0 = {{mass flow}} rate (kg/s), m0 = mass loading (kg/m2), sb = belt speed (m/s) and Lsludge0 = initial width of sludge across the belt (m). Thus to {{maintain}} industrial scale economic throughput at lower belt speed, the mass loading and width of sludge across the belt must be increased. It {{has been found that}} increasing the solids loading slightly decreases the dry solids concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> while significantly increasing the potential for sludge to overflow the belt. Lateral migration of sludge on the belt is a measure of how the sludge spreads across the width of the belt. Increased lateral sludge migration means that sludge is escaping the edge of the belt and overflowing into the filtrate. Therefore, increased lateral sludge migration negatively impacts filtrate quality and dry solids recovery.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} styles of mechanical press, these can range from a simple wooden basket with vertical slats and a capstan providing pressure to large hydraulic presses that can even be enclosed to prevent exposure oxygen. An advantage of this style of press is the usually gentle means that it presses the grape but its disadvantages includes the labor intensiveness of its use, small volumes and tendency to provide uneven pressure to all parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> as well as usually exposing the must to significant amounts of oxygen. Another disadvantage from a time perspective but an advantage in other regards such as gentleness, is that by its nature pressing with a basket press is very slow. Applying too much pressure too rapidly can break the press.|$|E

25|$|The {{input to}} a belt press filter is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} dry solids loading (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m belt width. Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, {{it is also important to}} consider the thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake washing step.|$|E
25|$|Belt press filters have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, {{gravity drainage}} zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake,</b> belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.|$|E
500|$|The old-fashioned {{doughnut}} {{is a type}} of cake doughnut, and {{has been}} described as a [...] "subset" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> doughnut. The cake doughnut itself originated in the United States circa 1829, when the increased availability of pearlash in the U.S., a type of leavener that preceded baking powder, lent to the increase of cake doughnut consumption. It is unclear when the old-fashioned doughnut itself was invented, but this very likely occurred after the cake doughnut was invented. Prior to circa 1829, doughnuts were typically the yeast-risen variety in the U.S. Circa the 1830s, the leaveners baking soda and baking powder began to be available to U.S. consumers, which is around the same time that cake doughnut recipes first appeared in U.S. cookbooks.|$|E
