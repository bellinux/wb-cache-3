5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but on the <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation {{about the idea of}} re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the NFC East and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished on the <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, King {{said that}} Flagg {{had been a}} {{presence}} in his writing {{since the beginning of}} his career, with the idea coming to him in college. He first wrote a poem, [...] "The Dark Man", about a man who rides the rails and confesses to murder and rape; written {{on the back of a}} placemat in a college restaurant, the one-page poem was published in 1969, but the character never left King's mind. To the author, what made Flagg interesting was [...] "the idea of the villain as somebody who was always on the <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in,</b> and hated people who had good fellowship and good conversation and friends".|$|E

50|$|A {{central theme}} to Guo Jian’s art derives from his {{observations}} of the application of propaganda and the arts to both motivate soldiers and sway public opinion.

500|$|In summer 2005, {{the band}} {{received}} a phone call from major label Fueled by Ramen founder John Janick, who wished to see the group perform live. The group had a meeting with Janick, before leaving to record demos in New York City. Eager to hear the material, Janick visited the group while they were recording in late July with Shep Goodman. On November 29, it was announced that the band had signed to Fueled by Ramen. Vocalist Shaant Hacikyan said of the label: [...] "There's such an amazing sense of community about the label. ... From the <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in,</b> I just wanted to be a part of it so bad." [...] In December, the band mentioned that they were writing material for their debut album and were planning to record later in winter.|$|E
500|$|Cagney secured {{his first}} {{significant}} nondancing role in 1925. He played a young tough {{guy in the}} three-act play <b>Outside</b> <b>Looking</b> <b>In</b> by Maxwell Anderson, earning $200 a week. As with Pitter Patter, Cagney went to the audition with little confidence he would get the part. He had no experience with drama at this point. Cagney felt that he only got the role because his hair was redder than that of Alan Bunce, the only other red-headed performer in New York. Both the play and Cagney received good reviews; Life magazine wrote, [...] "Mr. Cagney, in a less spectacular role [...] makes a few minutes silence during his mock-trial scene something that many a more established actor might watch with profit." [...] Burns Mantle wrote that it [...] "...contained the most honest acting now {{to be seen in}} New York." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Will Hermes called Wildflower [...] "a welcome return" [...] {{and wrote}} that [...] "what still sets the Avalanches apart, besides their careful groove pacing, {{attention}} to detail, and {{uncanny ability to}} move you from inside a track to <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in,</b> is their sweet sense of nostalgia." [...] Writing for Exclaim!, Daryl Keating called the album [...] "a real testament to the tenacity of the Avalanches, and one we're truly grateful for." [...] Tim Sendra of AllMusic felt that Wildflower [...] "falls short of expectations, but still ends up being a pretty good album anyway" [...] and considered the abundance of guest performers, {{with the exception of}} Jonathan Donahue, to be unnecessary, concluding that the group [...] "ended up making the best psychedelic Chemical Brothers album ever instead of making another classic Avalanches album." [...] Emily MacKay of NME was less favourable, asking how [...] "something that took so long [...] sound so, well, meh," [...] and ultimately called the album [...] "a faded snapshot of a cosier, very distant-seeming past." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album were written by A.C. Newman and Destroyer {{frontman}} Dan Bejar. Newman recalled that he thought [...] "'How could we lose?' You could just take some interesting elements and put them together. Even taking myself out of the picture, when I looked at the band I just thought, 'This band's got to be great.' I thought, 'Okay, everyone can hate my songs, they can dismiss them.' But I have the most confidence in Dan's songs because I'm totally <b>outside</b> of him, <b>looking</b> <b>in.</b> I'm just a fan of him." ...|$|R
60|$|And as he waited--transfixed, {{he thought}} of that other night when he had stood <b>outside</b> the curtains, <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> at the woman he dared not touch. Then slowly Isabel opened her eyes, saw {{that her husband had}} come; felt that a miracle had {{restored}} his power to love. Renunciation of a dark hour was forgotten in a low, glad cry. Philip held her as never before. The strength of his arms made her dumb with joy. She could not speak. Her husband led her to the divan and she listened to his voice, his words. She heard him entreat her to forgive, to live anew.|$|R

2500|$|David Ansen of Newsweek {{said the}} film [...] "is lushly, impeccably mounted—perhaps too much so. Mendes, a superb stage director, has an {{innately}} theatrical style: everything pops {{off the screen}} a little bigger and bolder than life, but the effect, rather than intensifying the emotions, calls attention to itself. Instead of losing myself in the story, I often felt on the <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in,</b> appreciating the craftsmanship, but one step removed from the agony on display. Revolutionary Road is impressive, but {{it feels like a}} classic encased in amber." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1920s his {{etchings}} began to receive public recognition. They expressed {{some of his}} later themes, as in Night on the El Train (couples in silence), Evening Wind (solitary female), and The Catboat (simple nautical scene). Two notable oil paintings of this time were New York Interior (1921) and New York Restaurant (1922). He also painted two of his many [...] "window" [...] paintings to come: Girl at Sewing Machine and Moonlight Interior, both of which show a figure (clothed or nude) near a window of an apartment viewed as gazing out or {{from the point of}} view from the <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E

Kate says they are going back for her friends.|$|R
5000|$|Meyers {{supports}} gay rights. He {{cites the}} New Testament {{story of the}} evangelist Philip baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8: 26-40 as “the most powerful story in the Bible to argue in favor of full inclusion of all people regardless of sexual orientation into the full sacramental hospitality of the Church” because it contradicts the Old Testament law in Deuteronomy 23:1 that rendered a eunuch an outcast. Meyers also contends that the Prophet Isaiah, whom the eunuch was reading while meeting Philip, “is on record as saying even eunuchs will be welcomed into the reign of God because God’s love is unconditional… it is for everyone {{who is on the}} <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> in”. <b>In</b> the debate about the place of the LGBT community within the Church he describes this story as [...] "the most important and overlooked story in the New Testament". Mayflower Congregational UCC voted unanimously to become an [...] "open and affirming" [...] congregation in 1999. In October 2014 it celebrated 14 wedding ceremonies between same-sex couples on the same day. Meyers told the congregation that [...] "love is a gender-less thing".|$|R

5000|$|Hammonds {{states that}} in order for black women to be free from oppression, black women must reclaim their sexuality. The {{definition}} of black female sexuality was always defined by an <b>outside</b> group <b>looking</b> <b>in,</b> first by white males and then by white females. Black females must define their own sexuality in order to overcome oppression. She states that this repeated silence has become a notion of [...] "invisibility" [...] to describe black females' lives. Even women with prestige in academia are still under invisibility when they are told what issues they can and cannot lecture about. Hammonds continues to extend the [...] "invisibility" [...] of black women to the field of medicine and science. Black women have been oppressed for so many years that negative stereotypes have been formed about black women and now to black women with AIDS. These stereotypes have created a void between black women with AIDS and society. The public continues to hold black women up to the stereotype of hypersexual and black women with AIDS are forced to deal with this oppression.|$|R

In March 1957, {{he and his}} brother, Carlos, {{were part of an}} attack on the Presidential Palace of Fulgencio Batista; his brother, Carlos, was killed in that attack. On January 3 of 1959, Eloy and his troops entered the City of Havana, Cuba and few days before Fidel Castro did and Eloy was hailed as one of the Commanders Of The Revolution. Eloy's own army was absorbed into the army of Fidel Castro but Eloy was permitted to retain the rank of 'Major' which was the highest rank in Cuba at the time. However, Eloy and many of his senior officers were never offered a post in the Castro Administration.
