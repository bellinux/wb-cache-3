He was crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Athelm, who probably designed or organised a new ordo (religious order of service) in which the king wore a crown for the first time instead of a helmet.

5|$|What is {{considered}} the first scholarly discussion of the Leges appeared in 1827 by George Philips, who did not reproduce the entire text in his Englische Reichsund Rechtsgeschichte, but did provide a couple of extracts along with a discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> the work and {{a description of the}} work. In 1840, the Record Commission published an edition of the text that had been edited by Richard Price and Benjamin Thorpe. The next major production of the Leges was Felix Liebermann who produced three volumes of Gesetze der Angelsachsen between 1903 and 1916, with the Leges being one of the legal treatises being reproduced in the Gesetze. A modern translation, with the original Latin text on pages facing the translation, was published in 1972 by the Clarendon Press and edited by L. J.

5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified the locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives {{for the management of}} groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} for diagnosing <b>the</b> original <b>source</b> and {{underlying causes of}} power system disturbances, where voltage and current recordings from different locations of a power system are collected. In the proposed method, disturbances are first pre-classified based on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> transition segments. <b>The</b> spatial zone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> disturbances is coarsely determined from voltage recordings only. Disturbances are then further analyzed and characterized by extracting information from both voltages and currents. Finally more accurate information about <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> disturbances is obtained by different techniques depending on <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> disturbances. Several underlying causes are analyzed and classified by using the proposed features extracted from both voltage and current waveforms. Finally, <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> disturbances is refined once the underlying causes are found. Case studies were performed on a large grid-connected wind farm with disturbances from several underlying causes, including: fault, unit tripping, transformer, capacitor, and cable energizing generated by PSCAD/EMTDC...|$|R
