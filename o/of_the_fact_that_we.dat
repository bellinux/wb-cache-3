25|$|Gestalt Therapy, an {{approach}} created by Fritz Perls, {{was based on}} phenomenology, existentialism and also Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Perls {{spent some time in}} Japanese Zen monasteries and his therapeutic techniques include mindfulness practices and focusing on the present moment. Practices outlined by Perls himself in Ego, hunger and aggression (1969), such as “concentration on eating” (“we have to be fully aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are eating”) and “awareness continuum” are strikingly similar to Buddhist mindfulness training. Other authors in Gestalt Therapy who were influenced by Buddhism are Barry Stevens (therapist) and Dick Price (who developed Gestalt Practice by including Buddhist meditation).|$|E

A few months later, it was {{arranged}} that Allison and the band meet at a rehearsal room to finally begin production on the band's debut album. [...] "They started up playing in the rehearsal room and they really weren't together at all. And I was very honest with them, I just sort of said 'Look, this simply isn't good enough'". Allison adds, [...] "The interesting, the most significant thing that did occur out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> didn't end up starting the album on that day of the rehearsal was that Chris Martin had not written 'Yellow' by that time".|$|E

2500|$|Basically, they [...] {{wanted us}} to re-sign and do a new {{contract}} before our old one was done and we didn't want to do that. We wanted to fulfil our original contract {{and then go on}} from there because {{there were a number of}} labels that were interested in working with us. [...] We were playing hardball back and forth with the label and that's why that record ... it was a difficult period for us. We were all pretty pissed off and angry and that shows in the music. Our budget got slashed for that record just because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had not re-signed. I think it came down to [...] "Well, re-sign now or this is your budget because that's what is says in your contract." [...] You can't argue with that. We didn't re-sign. We didn't buckle under and I think it paid off in the end because we got what we wanted [...] We got everything that we wanted in our new record deal ... everything that we've worked ten fucking years for and deserve, we got. We learned how to play the game and we played it very well.|$|E

6000|$|A tempest of indignation {{swept the}} town. Our clergymen and {{everybody}} else said the [...] "culprit" [...] had not only done an innocent thing, but had done it in an open, manly way, and it was nobody's right or business to find fault with it.

60|$|But speculations on the {{structure}} of the universe also move in quite another direction. The development of non-Euclidean geometry led to the recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can cast doubt on the infiniteness of our space without coming into conflict with the laws of thought or with experience (Riemann, Helmholtz). These questions have already been treated in detail and with unsurpassable lucidity by Helmholtz and Poincaré, whereas I can only touch on them briefly here.|$|E

6000|$|He {{remained}} mournfully grave; I {{could see}} that he was surprised at my rude mirth. But he summoned back a vision of the lady at Folkestone and conscientiously replied: [...] "Even with those things of Mrs. Meldrum's." [...] I begged him not to think my laughter in bad taste: it was only a practical recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had built a monstrous castle in the air. Didn't he see on what flimsy ground the structure rested? The evidence was preposterously small. He believed the worst, but we were utterly ignorant.|$|E
60|$|The chief {{importance}} of knowledge by description {{is that it}} enables us to pass {{beyond the limits of}} our private experience. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can only know truths which are wholly composed of terms which we have experienced in acquaintance, we can yet have knowledge by description of things which we have never experienced. In view of the very narrow range of our immediate experience, this result is vital, and until it is understood, much of our knowledge must remain mysterious and therefore doubtful.|$|E
60|$|Although what {{specially}} concerns us is {{the analysis}} of emotions, we shall find that the more important topic is the physiological causation of emotions. This is a subject upon which much valuable and exceedingly interesting work has been done, whereas the bare analysis of emotions has proved somewhat barren. In view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have defined perceptions, sensations, and images by their physiological causation, {{it is evident that}} our problem of the analysis of the emotions is bound up with the problem of their physiological causation.|$|E

60|$|This {{gesture of}} our comrade's soothed me somewhat, for I began to fancy {{he had a}} plan in his mind to thwart our host if so be he gave token of treachery, and yet I failed to {{understand}} {{how it might be}} done while we remained there much the same as prisoners. In my stupidity I lost sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were absolutely powerless. If this Job Lord was indeed double-faced, then at the moment we ventured out despite his advice, it was only necessary for him to give word to the lobster backs, when we would, perhaps, come upon Silas by being ourselves made prisoners.|$|E

To be sure, he had been quite civil on the occasion of our last call upon him, but the Story Girl had been with us then and had beguiled him into good-humour and generosity by the magic of her voice and personality.
