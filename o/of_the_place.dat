40|$|The etymological {{approach}} generally {{draws attention}} to the research on <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> in Turkey. Words in Turkish always use the latest addition on narrative and meaning structure. As some additions are used as both meaning and narrative structure, they may refer according to grammar. In this article, by an unorthodox approach, names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> that +CA suffix name passes are mentioned and <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> this suffix on <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> that is effective on finding out <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>places</b> is pointed. At the same time, <b>the</b> feature <b>of</b> +CA suffix being derivational affix are showed by <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places.</b> <b>The</b> names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> that are seen in Istanbul, Sakarya, Kocaeli and Düzce provinces form the research material. This kind of studies show that the examining deeply the appendixes with many functions of Turkish like +CA according to their functions by making subject to the monographic studies contributes to solving some kinds of grammatical problems...|$|R

5|$|Before each episode, Steel {{researches}} {{the history}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> {{in which he}} is going to perform. His research interests include local notable people, landmarks, customs and humorous anecdotes. The majority of the research sometimes took place close to the actual recording date. For example, Steel carried out almost no research for his episode in Walsall until ten days before the recording. In Merthyr Tydfil he spent three days in the town, where he carried out research and met locals. He then performs a tailor-made show about the town in front of a local audience. The style of the programme is similar to other shows starring Steel, such as The Mark Steel Lectures, in which Steel presented a humorous lecture about a famous person in history.|$|E
5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} exists as a village, but for {{location}} see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should be noted that 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E

5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>place,</b> as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Walter Lowenfels jokingly {{suggested}} that Aldington should {{produce a new}} Imagist anthology.

The result was the Imagist Anthology 1930, edited by Aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell, who had died, Cannell, who had disappeared, and Pound, who declined. The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of the Imagists in the history of 20th-century poetry.|$|E

During the civil war, {{after the death of}} Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, the forces of the Arab Liberation Army positioned themselves around the police fort and the surrounding villages, to the indifference of the British. They regularly attacked supply convoys heading for Jerusalem.

While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and Dundee, the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view. James Balfour, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he knew it well, recognising the steeple <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where he first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again.|$|E

5|$|The Life is {{difficult}} to follow and extremely vague on any facts. Typically the author takes facts and traditions known to him and transfers them to the saint himself.
