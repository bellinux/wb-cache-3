5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E

5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines in the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from its}} {{unstable}} position, Halos {{would have to}} contend with thousands of meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize or destroy the ring; there is no evidence in the games that the installations project an energy shield to prevent this occurrence. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet's magnetic field. Grazier posits that huge conductive cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, {{observations}} {{in the microwave}} part of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum (0.1–10GHz) led {{to the discovery of}} the Jovian decimetric radiation (DIM) and the realization that it was synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons trapped in the planet's radiation belts. These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> moment and its tilt.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar. This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> moment {{with respect to the}} rotational axis as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small radio pulsar too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E

5|$|Microbats possess magnetoreception, in {{that they}} have a high {{sensitivity}} to Earth's magnetic field, similar to birds.

40|$|A new {{mechanism}} of generation of large-scale magnetic fields in colliding protogalactic clouds and merging protostellar clouds is discussed. Interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colliding clouds produces large-scale shear motions which are superimposed on small-scale turbulence. Generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large-scale <b>magnetic</b> field {{is due to}} a ''shear-current" effect (or "vorticity-current" effect), and the mean vorticity is caused by the large-scale shear motions of colliding clouds. This effect causes <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean <b>magnetic</b> field even in a nonrotating and nonhelical homogeneous turbulence. There is no quenching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonlinear shear-current effect contrary to <b>the</b> quenching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonlinear alpha effect, <b>the</b> nonlinear turbulent <b>magnetic</b> diffusion, etc. During <b>the</b> nonlinear growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean <b>magnetic</b> field, <b>the</b> shear-current effect only changes its sign at some value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean <b>magnetic</b> field which determines <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saturated mean <b>magnetic</b> field.

5|$|The Earth's {{magnetic}} field serves to deflect {{most of the}} solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

5|$|The dipole {{component}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> {{field at}} the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14microteslas (0.14G). The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2T·m3 (14μT·R'N3, where R'N is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune {{may be the result}} of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.|$|E
5|$|Thermoremanent {{magnetization}} is {{the main}} source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> anomalies around ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust {{on both sides of}} the ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.|$|E
