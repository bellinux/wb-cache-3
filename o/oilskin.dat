25|$|One more {{test flight}} was {{conducted}} at the Island Grounds in 1914, when J. W. Madley, a water works engineer, tested an aircraft assembled by him. He flew it over the Red Hills reservoir to inspect works and shot a couple of aerial photographs of the reservoir from the aircraft. This incident kindled an interest in flying among prominent residents of the city, resulting in {{the arrival of a}} set of aviators in 1911 to display the flying machines they had brought with them to India as a marketing initiative. The aviators included Baron de Caters and Jules Tyck. On 15 February 1911, Tyck flew in a Bl√©riot aeroplane in front of the public. The aircraft was wheeled out by eight men with Tyck seated inside the craft wearing an <b>oilskin</b> coat and goggles. The men held the plane till its engine revved up and then let go, and the craft darted forward about 20 yards before rising into the air. In the air, the craft made a straight flight only for about three-quarters of the length of the ground and descended due to poor weather. Tyck flew again the next day, this time reaching a height of 2,400feet, which was witnessed by the then Governor of Madras Sir Arthur Lawley. Two days later, on 18 February, another demonstration was given by Baron de Caters, when he flew his aircraft in public.|$|E

2500|$|On one occasion, Taylor {{disagreed}} with the decision by umpire Bill Klem not to call the game as darkness fell. Taylor returned to the clubhouse and came back onto the field wearing a fireman's <b>oilskin</b> and holding a lit lantern above his head. [...] Klem yelled at Taylor {{to get off the}} field, but Taylor could not hear and continued with his antics until Klem finally called the game.|$|E

5000|$|While {{most modern}} <b>oilskins</b> {{are made of}} {{flexible}} PVC-coated synthetic fabric, advanced materials for extreme conditions such as yacht racing are increasingly employed. Also known as [...] "foul weather gear", contemporary <b>oilskins</b> include such innovations as DWR-coated nylon on their low end and Gore-Tex and other proprietary waterproof membranes on the high.|$|R

2500|$|On 18 October, police {{entered the}} home of a Tauranga {{pensioner}} while he was out and took an old <b>oilskin</b> jacket, a raincoat, a polar-fleece jacket, some magnets and an air rifle leaving behind a 20-page search warrant stating there [...] "is reasonable ground for believing" [...] there were items inside which were an offence relating to either [...] "participating in a terrorist group", or the unlawful possession of firearms or restricted weapons. The occupant of the home told the New Zealand Herald that he had no idea why his home was searched and was [...] "gutted" [...] police had linked him to people potentially involved in terrorist crimes.|$|E
2500|$|Spring-heeled Jack was {{described}} by people {{who claimed to have}} seen him as having a terrifying and frightful appearance, with diabolical physiognomy, clawed hands, and eyes that [...] "resembled red balls of fire". One report claimed that, beneath a black cloak, he wore a helmet and a tight-fitting white garment like an <b>oilskin.</b> Many stories also mention a [...] "Devil-like" [...] aspect. Others said he was tall and thin, with the appearance of a gentleman. Several reports mention that he could breathe out blue and white flames and that he wore sharp metallic claws at his fingertips. At least two people claimed {{that he was able to}} speak comprehensible English.|$|E
2500|$|Leather for chaps is tanned and dyed, and {{the hide}} is usually [...] "split" [...] {{so that the}} leather is supple and can {{be made into a}} garment that allows easy movement. There is a rough side, what is today called suede or [...] "roughout", and a smooth side. [...] Chaps are made in both [...] "roughout" [...] and [...] "smooth out" [...] (smooth side out) designs. [...] Most batwings and chinks are made smooth side out, most {{shotguns}} are suede, or roughout. [...] For horse shows, where fashions may change from year to year and durability is not as great a concern, lighter, synthetic materials such as ultrasuede and vinyl may be used, though leather suede or a smooth split predominates due to durability and proper fit. [...] In Australia, chaps may be made of <b>oilskin</b> rather than leather.|$|E

2500|$|The gang's armour {{was made}} of iron {{a quarter of an}} inch thick, each {{consisting}} of a long breast-plate, shoulder-plates, back-guard, apron and helmet. The helmet resembled a tin can without a crown, and included a long slit for the eyes. The suits' separate parts were strapped together on the body while the helmet was separate and sat on the shoulders, allowing it to be removed easily. Ned Kelly's armour weighed [...] His suit was the only one to have an apron at the back, but all four had front aprons. Padding is only known from Ned's armour and it is not clear if the other suits were similarly padded. Ned wore a padded skull cap and his helmet also had internal strapping so that his head could take some of the weight. After the shootout there were five bullet marks on the helmet, three on the breast-plate, nine on the back-plate, and one on the shoulder-plate. All four men wore <b>oilskin</b> coats over the armour.|$|E
2500|$|Jane Alsop {{reported}} {{that on the}} night of 19 February 1838, she answered the door of her father's house to a man claiming to be a police officer, who told her to bring a light, claiming [...] "we have caught Spring-heeled Jack here in the lane". She brought the person a candle, and noticed that he wore a large cloak. The moment she had handed him the candle, however, he threw off the cloak and [...] "presented a most hideous and frightful appearance", vomiting blue and white flame from his mouth while his eyes resembled [...] "red balls of fire". Miss Alsop {{reported that}} he wore a large helmet and that his clothing, which appeared to be very tight-fitting, resembled white <b>oilskin.</b> Without saying a word he caught hold of her and began tearing her gown with his claws which she was certain were [...] "of some metallic substance". She screamed for help, and managed to get away from him and ran towards the house. He caught her on the steps and tore her neck and arms with his claws. She was rescued by one of her sisters, after which her assailant fled.|$|E

60|$|Cap'n Bill {{reached in}} the pocket of his <b>oilskin</b> coat and took out his pipe. It was still dry, for he kept it in an <b>oilskin</b> pouch with his tobacco. His matches were in a tight tin box, so in a few moments the old sailor was smoking contentedly. Trot knew it helped him to think when he was in any difficulty. Also, the pipe did much to restore the old sailor's composure, after his long ducking and his terrible fright--a fright that was more on Trot's account than his own.|$|E
