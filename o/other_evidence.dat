5|$|Among her {{maternal}} ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields, a slave on Henry Walls Shields' 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia. Melvinia's first son, Dolphus T. Shields, was biracial and {{born into}} slavery about 1860. Based on DNA and <b>other</b> <b>evidence,</b> in 2012 researchers {{said his father}} was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of her master. Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus' father. Dolphus Shields moved to Birmingham, Alabama after the Civil War, {{and some of his}} children migrated to Cleveland, Ohio and Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey Henderson {{writes that}} women {{were present in the}} theatre, citing Plato's Laws and Gorgias as saying that drama was {{addressed}} to men, women and children. Henderson also mentions later stories about Athenian theatre, such as the tale that Aeschylus' Eumenides had frightened women in the audience into miscarrying. <b>Other</b> <b>evidence</b> of the presence of women at the theatre in Athens includes the absence of surviving prohibitions against their attendance and the importance of women in Athenian rituals, especially those associated with Dionysus.|$|E
5|$|Onion domes {{often appear}} {{in groups of}} three, {{representing}} the Holy Trinity, or five, representing Jesus Christ and the Four Evangelists. Domes standing alone represent Jesus. Vasily Tatischev, the first to record such interpretation, disapproved of it emphatically. He believed that the five-domed design of churches was propagated by Patriarch Nikon, who liked to compare the central and highest dome with himself and four lateral domes with four other patriarchs of the Orthodox world. There is no <b>other</b> <b>evidence</b> that Nikon ever held such a view.|$|E

It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators.|$|E

5|$|Wulfred is {{believed}} to have come from Middlesex and to have been a member of a wealthy and important family with considerable landholdings in Middlesex and neighbouring regions.

5|$|A less violent side to Alexander's {{government}} {{is demonstrated by}} <b>other</b> <b>evidence.</b> Over a century after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, {{less than a month}} after Nero's death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, malicious prosecutions and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, and his ability to put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. <b>Other</b> <b>evidence</b> for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{carried out}} before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake found evidence of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic (Old, Middle and New Stone Age), Bronze Age and Iron Age, comprising implements such as stone knives, flint blades {{and the head of}} a mace, along with buildings and graves. <b>Other</b> <b>evidence</b> of occupation from prehistoric times is provided by the henge monument at Stanton Drew, long barrow at Chewton Mendip, and Fairy Toot tumulus at Nempnett Thrubwell. Maes Knoll fort, on Dundry Down in the northern reaches of the valley, is a Scheduled Ancient Monument that dates from the Iron Age; it later served as a terminus for the early medieval Wansdyke earthworks.|$|E
5|$|At Bremerton, on {{the east}} side of the Olympics, the {{measured}} rotations are less, and within the statistical error bounds of being zero; while further north, near Port Townsend, the rotation is slightly counter-clockwise. On Vancouver Island the paleorotations are counter-clockwise, and <b>other</b> <b>evidence</b> shows that the tip of the island has been bent, presumably as a result of the collision of Siletzia. The northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula also shows counter-clockwise rotation, of around 45 degrees. This raises a question of how much of the arcuate shape of the Crescent Formation is due to loss of material from the center after uplift by the Olympic Mountains, and how much reflects oroclinal bending.|$|E
5|$|De re militari, a {{treatise}} on Roman military affairs by Vegetius, a late 4th or early 5th-century writer, contains considerable {{information on the}} late army, although its {{focus is on the}} army of the Republic and Principate. However, Vegetius (who wholly lacked military experience) is often unreliable. For example, he stated that the army abandoned armour and helmets in the later 4th century (offering the absurd explanation that this equipment was too heavy), which is contradicted by sculptural and artistic evidence.
