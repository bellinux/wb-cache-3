Ellis said his catcher Jerry May wore {{reflective}} tape <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> which helped him to see May's signals. Ellis walked eight batters and struck out six, and he was aided by excellent fielding plays from second baseman Bill Mazeroski and center fielder Matty Alou.|$|E

25|$|In August 1969, {{after being}} {{confused}} with another group named Earth (who had minor success in England), the group renamed themselves Black Sabbath. His factory accident affected the Black Sabbath sound; by 1970 Iommi had detuned his guitar from E to E♭ (a minor second down), and from 1971's Master of Reality album, had detuned it further to D♭ (a minor third down), {{to ease the}} tension <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler did the same to match Iommi. Sabbath {{was among the first}} bands to detune, and the technique became a mainstay of heavy metal music. Iommi combined blues-like guitar solos and dark, minor-key riffing with a revolutionary high-gain, heavily distorted tone with his use of power chords, a modified treble-boosting effect-pedal and a Gibson SG.|$|E

25|$|After a solid 9–6 {{performance}} in January 2008, {{in the following}} tournament he produced his best-ever top-division result, a 12–3 score from the rank of maegashira 5, which earned him joint runner-up honours and his second Fighting Spirit prize. However, in the May 2008 tournament he could only manage three wins from the maegashira 1 ranking. Demoted to maegashira 10 for July, he struggled again, winning only five bouts. He was disqualified from his final match against Kimurayama after his was judged to have pulled his opponent's topknot, which is a kinjite, or foul. Kokkai maintained it was accidental as the tape <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> had stuck to Kimurayama's hair. He continued to {{move up and down}} the maegashira rankings in 2009, alternating between 8–7 and 5–10 records.|$|E

500|$|Ingres {{seems to}} have adapted {{elements}} of the approach and technique of Hans Holbein's 1527 Portrait of William Warham, now in the Louvre. Neither artist placed much emphasis on colour, preferring dark or cool tones. The Warham portrait {{seems to have}} informed the indicators of Bertin's aging and the emphasis <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> Jacques-Louis David also explored hyper-realism in his depictions of Cooper Penrose (1802) and Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès (1817). In the later painting, David shows tiny glints of light reflecting on the sitter's chair and painstakingly details [...] "every wayward curl of [...] closely cropped auburn hair." ...|$|E

500|$|By November 1989, the {{estimated}} cost of the overall {{savings and loan crisis}} had reached $500 billion, and the media's coverage often highlighted Keating's role as part of what became a feeding frenzy. Keating and Lincoln Savings became convenient symbols for arguments about what had gone wrong in America's financial system and society, as well as for 1980s greed in general, and were featured in popular culture references. A deck of playing cards would be marketed, called [...] "The Savings and Loan Scandal", that featured on their face Charles Keating holding up his hand, with images of the Keating Five senators portrayed as puppets <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|E
500|$|Keating and Lincoln Savings became {{convenient}} symbols for {{arguments about}} what had gone wrong in America's financial system and society, and were featured in popular culture references.

By spring 1992, a deck of playing cards was being marketed, called [...] "The Savings and Loan Scandal", that featured on their face Charles Keating holding up his hand, with images of the five senators portrayed as puppets <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> Polls showed that most Americans believed {{the actions of the}} Keating Five were typical of Congress as a whole. Political historian Lewis Gould would later echo this sentiment, as well as Cranston attorney Dershowitz's argument, writing that, [...] "the real problem for the 'Keating Three' who were most involved was that they had been caught." ...|$|E
500|$|Rhodes {{believed}} that the 1903–04 tour {{was a turning point}} in his career as a bowler and that afterwards he was never the same. Part of the reason was a change in his bowling style. He had noticed that it was necessary for him to bowl faster in Australia to be effective, and on his return to England he continued with this faster style until the First World War. Rhodes thought that another reason for his relative bowling decline was the development of his batting which took up much of his time. [...] His biographer, Sidney Rogerson, speculates that further deterioration may have been caused by the strain of regular bowling <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> and wrist, and his more robust, muscular frame in his mid-twenties. Rogerson believes that Rhodes was affected by the break-up of the successful Yorkshire team which had peaked between 1900 and 1902. More batting responsibility was placed on his shoulders, and he received less support in the field as the team personnel changed. Consequently, Rhodes scored more runs and moved further up the batting order after 1903, but his bowling gradually declined until the war.|$|E

It wasn't until after that first game that the Rays announced Peña had two fractured fingers and would be out {{for the remainder of the}} season. Peña said that it was a wonder that he didn't pass out from the pain of taking a fastball to the fingers, and that the X-ray of his middle finger looked like [...] "a pencil snapped in half", but upon the realization of having to miss the rest of the year, [...] "hurt more than the hit by pitch itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aged around 18, {{he made a}} {{philosophical}} discovery that opened up to him [...] "a new Scene of Thought", which inspired him [...] "to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it". He did not recount what this scene was, and commentators have offered a variety of speculations. One popular interpretation, prominent in contemporary Hume scholarship, {{is that the new}} [...] "scene of thought" [...] was Hume's realization that Francis Hutcheson's [...] "moral sense" [...] theory of morality could be applied to the understanding as well. Due to this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of ten years reading and writing. He soon came to the verge of a mental breakdown, suffering from what a doctor diagnosed as the [...] "Disease of the Learned". Hume wrote that it started with a coldness, which he attributed to a [...] "Laziness of Temper", that lasted about nine months. Later, some scurvy spots broke out <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> This was what persuaded Hume's physician to make his diagnosis. Hume wrote that he [...] "went under a Course of Bitters and Anti-Hysteric Pills", taken along with a pint of claret every day. Hume also decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning. His health improved somewhat, but, in 1731, he was afflicted with a ravenous appetite and palpitations of the heart. After eating well for a time, he went from being [...] "tall, lean and raw-bon'd" [...] to being [...] "sturdy, robust [...] healthful-like". Indeed, Hume would become well known in his time for his [...] "corpulence", and his fondness for good port and cheese.|$|E
