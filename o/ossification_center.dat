5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory <b>ossification</b> <b>center,</b> osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{peripheral}} leptin on fetal primary <b>ossification</b> <b>centers</b> {{during the early}} phases of bone histogenesis was investigated by administration of leptin to pregnant mice. Fourteen pregnant mice {{were divided into two}} groups. The treated pregnant group was subcutaneously injected in the intrascapular region with supraphysiologic doses (2 mg kg− 1) of leptin (Vinci Biochem, Firenze, Italy) in a volume of 0. 1 mL per 10 g body weight, at the 7 th, 9 th and 11 th day of gestation. The control group was treated with physiological solution in the same manner and same times as the treated group. The new-born mice were killed 1 day after birth and the primary <b>ossification</b> <b>centers</b> were stained with Alizarin Red S after diaphanizing the soft tissues in 1 % potassium hydroxide. The development of both endochondral and intramembranous <b>ossification</b> <b>centers</b> was morphometrically analysed in long bones. The results showed that the <b>ossification</b> <b>centers</b> of mice born by mothers treated with leptin grow more rapidly in both length and cross-sectional area compared with mice born by the untreated mothers. As the development of long bones depends on endochondral ossification occurring at proximal and distal epiphyseal plates as well as on intramembranous ossification along the periosteal surface, it appears that leptin activates the differentiation and proliferation of both chondrocytes and osteoblasts. The role of leptin as a growth factor of cartilage and bone is discussed {{in the light of the}} data reported in the literature...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{order to}} {{determine}} the normal stages of formation in the sequence of ossification of the cranium of Podocnemis expansa in its various stages of development, embryos were collected starting on the 18 th day of natural incubation and were subjected to bone diaphanization and staining. In the neurocranium, the basisphenoid and basioccipital bones present <b>ossification</b> <b>centers</b> in stage 19, the supraoccipital and opisthotic in stage 20, the exoccipital in stage 21, and lastly the prooptic in stage 24. Dermatocranium: the squamosal, pterygoid and maxilla are the first elements to begin the ossification process, which occurs in stage 16. However, <b>ossification</b> <b>centers</b> begin to appear in stage 17 in most of these bone elements, i. e., the frontal, jugal, postorbital, parietal, premaxilla and prefrontal, followed by the palatine and quadratojugal in stage 19 and lastly by the vomer in stage 25. The quadrate bone of the splanchnocranium ossifies in stage 23. The mandible and hyoid apparatus, the dentary, coronoid and supra-angular, show <b>ossification</b> <b>centers</b> in stage 16 and the branchial horn I in stage 17.

50|$|The {{first step}} in {{ossification}} of the cartilage is that the cartilage cells, {{at the point where}} ossification is commencing and which is termed an <b>ossification</b> <b>center,</b> enlarge and arrange themselves in rows.|$|E
5000|$|Zone of cell {{hypertrophy}}. Next, the chondrocytes {{cease to}} divide {{and begin to}} hypertrophy (enlarge), much like {{they do in the}} primary <b>ossification</b> <b>center</b> of the fetus. The walls of the matrix between lacunae become very thin.|$|E
50|$|About {{the time}} of birth in mammals, a {{secondary}} <b>ossification</b> <b>center</b> appears in each end (epiphysis) of long bones. Periosteal buds carry mesenchyme and blood vessels in and the process {{is similar to that}} occurring in a primary <b>ossification</b> <b>center.</b> The cartilage between the primary and secondary ossification centers is called the epiphyseal plate, and it continues to form new cartilage, which is replaced by bone, a process that results in an increase in length of the bone. Growth continues until the individual is about 20 years old or until the cartilage in the plate is replaced by bone. The point of union of the primary and secondary ossification centers is called the epiphyseal line.|$|E
5000|$|Lateral maxillary {{dysplasia}} {{is caused}} by a development failure of the lateral part of the maxillary <b>ossification</b> <b>centers,</b> which also results in secondary clefting of the lip and palate. Clefting of the lateral part of the lower eyelid is typical for lateral maxillary dysplasia.|$|R
5000|$|Chondroblastoma is a rare, benign, locally {{aggressive}} bone tumor {{that typically}} affects the epiphyses or apophyses of long bones.

40|$|Bones of the cranial vault {{are formed}} by the {{differentiation}} of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts on a surface that surrounds the brain, eventually forming mineralized bone. Signaling pathways causative for the cell differentiation include the actions of extracellular proteins driven by information from genes. We assume that the interaction of cells and extracellular molecules which are associated with cell differentiation can be modeled using Turing’s reaction-diffusion model, a mathematical model for pattern formation controlled by two interacting molecules (activator and inhibitor). In this study we hypothesize that regions of high concentration of an activator develop into primary <b>centers</b> of <b>ossification,</b> the earliest sites of cranial vault bone. In addition to the Turing model, we use another diffusion equation to model a morphogen (potentially {{the same as the}} morphogen associated with formation of <b>ossification</b> <b>centers)</b> associated with bone growth. These mathematical models were solved using the finite volume method. The computational domain and model parameters are determined using a large collection of experimental data showing skull bone formation in mouse at different embryonic days in both of normal and defect conditions. The results show that the relative locations of the five <b>ossification</b> <b>centers</b> that form in our model occur at the same position as those identified in experimental data. As bone grows from these <b>ossification</b> <b>centers,</b> sutures form between the bones...|$|R
5000|$|Type 2: Triangular or {{heart-shaped}} ossicle measuring up to 12 mm, {{which represents}} a secondary <b>ossification</b> <b>center</b> {{connected to the}} navicular tuberosity by a 1-2 mm layer of fibrocartilage or hyaline cartilage. Portions of the posterior tibialis tendon sometimes insert onto the accessory ossicle, which can cause dysfunction, and therefore, symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Intramembranous {{ossification}} mainly {{occurs during}} {{formation of the}} flat bones of the skull but also the mandible, maxilla, and clavicles; the bone is formed from connective tissue such as mesenchyme tissue rather than from cartilage.

50|$|Primary bone or {{the primary}} <b>ossification</b> <b>center</b> is the {{beginning}} of the bone building process during the first trimester. Calcificed cartilage is basophilic and new bone being made is more acidophilic. The primary ossification occurs in the diaphysis. In contrast, secondary ossification centers appear later at the epiphyses of the cartilage and develop similarly to the diaphysis.|$|E
25|$|Endochondral {{ossification}} {{occurs in}} long bones {{and most other}} bones in the body; it involves the development of bone from cartilage. This process includes {{the development of a}} cartilage model, its growth and development, development of the primary and secondary <b>ossification</b> <b>centers,</b> and the formation of articular cartilage and the epiphyseal plates.|$|R
40|$|Collagenase- 3 (MMP 13), {{a member}} of the matrix {{metalloproteinase}} (MMP) family of neutral endopeptidases, is expressed in the skeleton during embryonic development and is highly overexpressed in human carcinomas and in chondrocytes and synovial cells in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. To determine the functional roles of Mmp 13, we generated Mmp 13 -null mice that showed profound defects in growth plate cartilage with markedly increased hypertrophic domains as well as delay in endochondral ossification and formation and vascularization of primary <b>ossification</b> <b>centers.</b> Absence of Mmp 13 resulted in significant interstitial collagen accumulation due, in part, to the lack of appropriate collagenase-mediated cleavage that normally occurs in growth plates and primary <b>ossification</b> <b>centers.</b> Cartilaginous growth plate abnormalities persisted in adult mice and phenocopied defects observed in human hereditary chondrodysplasias. Our findings demonstrate a unique role of Mmp 13 in skeletal development...|$|R
30|$|The {{etiology}} of this anomaly is generally accepted as follows: {{there are three}} primary <b>ossification</b> <b>centers</b> in each vertebra: one center in the vertebral body and two in the neural arches [5, 6, 8, 11, 13]. The facet defect is thought to originate from a failure of these ossification processes. However, the true etiology has not been clarified.|$|R
5000|$|UAP {{is caused}} by a {{separation}} from the ulna of the <b>ossification</b> <b>center</b> of the anconeal process. [...] FMCP {{is caused by}} a failure of the coronoid process to unite with the ulna. OCD of the medial epicondyle of the humerus is caused by disturbed endochondral fusion of the epiphysis of the medial epicondyle with the distal end of the humerus, which may in turn be caused by avulsion of the epiphysis.|$|E
50|$|A primary <b>ossification</b> <b>center</b> is {{the first}} area of a bone to start ossifying. It usually appears during {{prenatal}} development in {{the central part of}} each developing bone. In long bones the primary centers occur in the diaphysis/shaft and in irregular bones the primary centers occur usually {{in the body of the}} bone. Most bones have only one primary center (e.g. all long bones) but some irregular bones such as the os coxa (hip) and vertebrae have multiple primary centers.|$|E
50|$|The first {{ossification}} {{centers in}} the area of the future premaxilla appear during the seventh week above the germ of the second incisor on the outer surface of the nasal capsule.After eleven weeks an accessory <b>ossification</b> <b>center</b> develops into the alar region of the premaxilla. Then a premaxillary process grow upwards to fuse with the frontal process of the maxilla; and later expands posteriorly to fuse with the alveolar process of the maxilla.
