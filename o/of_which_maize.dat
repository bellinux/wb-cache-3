40|$|The African streak viruses (AfSVs) are {{a diverse}} group of mastrevirus species (family Geminiviridae) that infect a wide variety of annual and {{perennial}} grass species across the African continent and its nearby Indian Ocean islands. Six AfSV species (<b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>maize</b> streak virus is the best known) have been described. Here we report the full genome sequences of eight isolates of a seventh AfSV species: Urochloa streak virus (USV), sampled from various locations in Nigeria. Despite there being good evidence of recombination in many other AfSV species, we found no convincing evidence that any of the USV sequences were either inter- or intra-species recombinants. The USV isolates, all of which appear to be variants of the same strain (their genome sequences are all more than 98 % identical), share less than 69 % nucleotide sequence identity with other currently described AfSV species. © 2008 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

Parts of the maize plant like its stalk, cobs, kernelsetc have been put to use for the extraction of ethanol. The cellulosic portions of the plant requires essential pretreatment methods in order to efficiently convert the biomass into ethanol.

We investigated inter-annual changes in carbon sequestration, source, footprint, and eco-efficiency from 2004 to 2012 in the agro-ecosystem of suburban Beijing. Our findings indicated that: (1) Carbon sink increased 2. 8 percent annually and the average annual carbon storage amount was 1 058 200 t, with food crops constituting the highest proportion at 80. 4 % of carbon storage in farmland ecosystems, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>maize</b> contributed 68. 5 % as the largest constituent; (2) Carbon emission in the system showed a gradually decreasing trend, with agricultural chemicals as significant contributors. The annual average carbon emission was 276 000 tons in the Beijing farmland ecosystem, and decreased approximately 1. 3 percent per year. The largest amount of carbon emissions came from agricultural chemicals at 85. 4 %, of which nitrogen fertilizer was the biggest contributor at 83. 7 ％; (3) The carbon footprint also showed a decreasing trend along with an ecological surplus of carbon. The average carbon footprint was 5. 71 hm 2 in the Beijing farmland ecosystem with decreasing rate at 5. 5 % annually; however, the carbon surplus showed a downward trend due to reduction in the amount of arable land; (4) Finally, the increasing carbon sink capacity led to higher carbon eco-efficiency, with an annual average of 3. 854 kg C·kg- 1 CE, carbon sequestration was greater than the amount of carbon released. In summary, the agro-ecosystem in suburban Beijing has sustained a relatively high carbon eco-efficiency, and agricultural production continues to have high sustainability potential...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHead smut <b>of</b> <b>maize,</b> <b>which</b> {{is caused}} by Sporisorium reilianum f. sp. zeae (Kühn), is a serious disease in maize. In order to reveal the {{molecular}} mechanism of the resistance to head smut in maize, a microarray containing ∼ 14, 850 probes was used to monitor the gene expression profiles between a disease resistant near isogenic line (NIL) and a highly susceptible inbred line after S. reilianum was injected with an artificial inoculation method. ResultsLevels of expression for 3, 532 genes accounting for 23. 8 % of the total probes changed after inoculation. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes participated in physiological and biochemical pathways. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that plant–pathogen interaction, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and benzoxazinoid biosynthesis pathways play important roles in resistance to head smut. Three head smut resistance-related candidate genes, CLAVATA 1, bassinosteroid insensitive 1 -associated receptor kinase 1 and LOC 100217307 with leucine-rich repeat (LRR) conserved domains were identified, each <b>of</b> <b>which</b> is in <b>maize</b> mapping bin 2. 09, a region previously shown to include a major QTL for head smut resistance.

Other than higher protein levels in immature males than immature females, there were no sexual differences in body mass or levels of lipid, protein, or ash in adults or immatures. Adults were heavier than immatures and had higher levels of ash. There were no sex- or age-related differences {{in the proportion of}} individual food items consumed, 96. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was <b>maize.</b> By foraging on neighbouring agricultural fields, birds were able to spend large portions (80 %) of the day/night in comfort-related activities (preen, loaf, sleep) and little time foraging (8. 8 %) while on ponds.

With exception of primaries and secondaries, birds were moulting moderately to heavily in all feather regions. Agricultural ponds permit whitefaced whistling ducks to overwinter close to breeding areas, while the high availability and energy content of maize enables them to attain higher spring fat levels than birds that overwinter on traditional sites closer to the coast.
