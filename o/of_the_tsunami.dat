5|$|In tsunami prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, {{and this is}} especially true for earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized the risk to the area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for tsunami, especially near Padang. Previous events along the coast of Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate the need for an accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was very light relative to the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> that followed.|$|E

40|$|Adding tsunami data {{reported}} by the U. S. S. R. sources, <b>tsunami</b> magnitude and <b>the</b> source area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis</b> generated in <b>the</b> Hokkaido and Kurile regions {{during the period from}} 1893 to 1978 are re-examined. The source dimension and magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis</b> generated in <b>the</b> Hokkaido region correspords well with the earthquake magnitude. However, <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis</b> in <b>the</b> Kurile region have varied behaviors. <b>The</b> two Kurile <b>tsunamis</b> <b>of</b> Oct. 20, 1963 and June 10, 1975 were especially abnormal in comparison with other tsunamis accompanied by similar earthquake magnitude. In most cases, <b>the</b> initial motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis</b> was observed with upward direction, but <b>the</b> Kurile <b>tsunamis</b> <b>of</b> Aug. 11, 1969 and June 10, 1975 began with a conspicuous downward motion at the Hokkaido and Kurile tide stations. <b>The</b> source areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis</b> that accompanied large earthquakes (M> 8) line up along the continental slope near the Kurile trench and <b>the</b> 1973 Nemuro-oki <b>tsunami</b> was generated in the seismic gap between the 1952 Tokachi-oki and the 1969 Shikotan earthquakes.

40|$|Tsunamis occur quite {{frequently}} following large magnitude earthquakes {{along the}} Chilean coast. Most of these earthquakes occur along the Peru-Chile Trench, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most seismically active subduction zones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. This study aims {{to understand better}} <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis</b> triggered along <b>the</b> Peru-Chile Trench. We investigate <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis</b> induced by <b>the</b> Mw 8. 3 Illapel, the Mw 8. 2 Iquique and the Mw 8. 8 Maule Chilean earthquakes that happened on September 16 th, 2015, April 1 st, 2014 and February 27 th, 2010, respectively. The study involves {{the relation between the}} co-seismic deformation and <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> generation, <b>the</b> near-field <b>tsunami</b> propagation, and <b>the</b> spectral analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recorded <b>tsunami</b> signals in <b>the</b> near-field.

In addition, <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chilean continental margin, that includes <b>the</b> shelf <b>of</b> shallow bathymetry and the continental slope, constrains <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> propagation and <b>the</b> coastal impact.

5|$|In 2003, he {{established}} the Roger Federer Foundation to help disadvantaged {{children and to}} promote their access to education and sports. Since May 2004, citing his close ties with South Africa, including that being where his mother was raised, he began supporting the South Africa-Swiss charity IMBEWU which helps children better connect to sports and social and health awareness. Later, In 2005, Federer visited South Africa to meet the children that had benefited from his support. In 2005, he auctioned his racquet from his US Open championship to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina. At the 2005 Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, Federer arranged an exhibition involving several top players from the ATP and WTA tour called Rally for Relief. The proceeds went to the victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.

5|$|Just as {{with other}} waves, moving into shallow water causes the tsunami to slow but grow in height. Either the trough or the crest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, {{flooding}} all in its path. Much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along. Several tsunamis {{can be caused by}} a single geological event. In such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first, which may not be the biggest or most destructive. Occasionally, in a shallow bay or estuary, a tsunami may transform into a bore.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tsunami.</b> However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} 20 years (1960 - 1979), five tsunamis {{generated}} off Colombia and Peru were observed by tide-gauges in Japan. Based on these tide-gauge records, {{the magnitude and}} behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colombia-Peru <b>tsunamis</b> were investigated. According to the PDE (U. S. A.) reports, <b>the</b> earthquake magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface waves were in <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> Ms= 7. 5 to 7. 9. <b>The</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colombia earthquake on Dec. 12, 1979 was the largest. <b>The</b> aftershock areas <b>of</b> these earthquakes except for the earthguake on May 31, 1970 lay on the continental slope, parallel to the bathymetric contours. <b>The</b> lengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aftershock areas were 120 - 200 km. According to the author's method based on <b>the</b> attenuation <b>of</b> <b>tsunami</b> height with distance, <b>the</b> <b>tsunami</b> magnitudes (Imamura-Iida scale: m) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colombia-Peru <b>tsunamis</b> were determined to be m = 2 to 2. 5. Along <b>the</b> coast <b>of</b> Japan <b>the</b> maximum double amplitudes of these tsunamis averaged about 20 cm.

30|$|If <b>the</b> {{evidence}} regarding <b>tsunamis</b> in folklore {{or historical}} documents is reliable, {{it appears that}} the boulders in this region were moved by past tsunamis. However, we have no data to suggest that the boulders on Lanyu Island were transported by tsunamis. Thus, we conclude that the boulders were moved by storm waves, particularly those associated with typhoons. Based on the numerical simulation, the boulders could not have been moved by <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis,</b> but instead could have been moved by storm waves. This suggests that the boulders moved by tsunamis would be relocated by storm waves, if <b>the</b> runup heights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tsunamis</b> were less than 10 to 15  m, which is almost equal to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> computed <b>tsunamis.</b>|$|R
