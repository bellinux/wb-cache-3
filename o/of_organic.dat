40|$|The present work {{reports the}} {{adsorption}} mechanisms of aniline and toluene in dry and hydrated montmorillonite (MMT-Na and MMT-Na-W) and tetra-methylammonium-cation-modified MMT (MMT-TMA) as determined through density functional theory. These theoretical investigations explicitly demonstrate that cation-pi interactions between Na+/TMA(+) cations and aromatics play the {{key role in}} adsorption <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> over MMT-Na and MMT-TMA. Weak hydrogen bonds between the H atoms <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> and basal O atoms of tetrahedral silicate also stabilize the location <b>of</b> <b>organics.</b> The combination <b>of</b> interactions between water and basal O atoms and between organics and water molecules in hydrated MMT complexes strengthens the adsorption <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> on MMT, resulting in higher formation energies in hydrated organically intercalated MMTs than in the corresponding dry complexes. The adsorption <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> also changes frontier orbital distributions and consequently promotes the preferential occurrence of reactions on the organics {{rather than on the}} MMT layers. These adsorption mechanisms predicted by theoretical investigation can be used to explicate the adsorption <b>of</b> aromatic <b>organics</b> on aluminosilicates with different external environment...|$|R

5|$|Harold Clayton Urey (April 29, 1893 – January 5, 1981) was an American {{physical}} chemist whose pioneering work on isotopes {{earned him the}} Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934 for the discovery of deuterium.

5|$|In chemistry, {{one central}} issue was the {{distinction}} between organic and inorganic substances, especially in the context <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> transformations such as fermentation and putrefaction. Since Aristotle these had been considered essentially biological (vital) processes. However, Friedrich Wöhler, Justus Liebig and other pioneers of the rising field <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> chemistry—building {{on the work of}} Lavoisier—showed that the organic world could often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 Wöhler showed that the organic substance urea could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to vitalism. Cell extracts ("ferments") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with diastase in 1833. By the end of the 19th century the concept of enzymes was well established, though equations of chemical kinetics would not be applied to enzymatic reactions until the early 20th century.|$|E
30|$|In the ASM, {{production}} process <b>of</b> soluble <b>organic</b> materials from dead cell {{is described as}} hydration reaction <b>of</b> solid <b>organics</b> <b>of</b> dead cell. However, {{the results of this}} study suggest that it is also necessary to consider the direct {{production process}} <b>of</b> soluble <b>organics</b> from dead microorganisms. It is understood that this direct process may be important in the case of geological disposal environments where the existence <b>of</b> easy-biodegradable <b>organic</b> materials may be low.|$|R
30|$|The PEC {{degradation}} <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> {{could not}} only {{be affected by the}} type of photocatalyst, the configuration of reactor, but also be affected by the reaction medium [18, 19, 20, 21]. For example, some chemical substances, such as tertiary butyl alcohol, phosphate, and carbonate could inhibit the hydroxyl radical’s activity, so they could further inhibit the PEC degradation <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> [22].|$|R
30|$|The adsorbed organics on {{the surface}} of the TNA {{electrode}} are oxidized by the photogenerated holes in advance as soon as the PEC degradation starts. Considering the adsorption ability varies with the species <b>of</b> <b>organics,</b> there must be competition between two different kinds <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> existing in the solution, resulting inhomogeneous distributions of adsorption {{on the surface}} of TNA electrode.|$|R

5|$|Increased {{experimental}} precision {{combined with}} vastly improved scientific instrumentation was opening up exciting new fields.

40|$|Activated carbon {{is used in}} {{the mining}} {{industry}} for the recovery of precious metals, and {{is used in the}} treatment of waste-waters for the removal of pollutants. During such applications the carbon becomes poisoned by a wide spectrum <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> <b>of</b> which the concentrations and identities are not usually known. A simple mass balance and TGA data can be used to calculate the loading <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> on activated carbon if the residual mass <b>of</b> pyrolysed <b>organics</b> is known; however, this information is not usually known for industrial carbons.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> in {{sulphite pulp}} mill effluent {{and in the}} receiving environment of effluent discharge were investigated to assess {{the basis for the}} persistence or attenuation of colour. Characterization <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> was conducted through determination of SUVA, specific colour, and molecular weight distribution <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> using high performance size exclusion chromatography and by solid-state (13) [*]C cross polarization (CP) NMR. The characteristics <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> from mill wastewater before and after secondary aerobic treatment, followed by lime treatment and from the receiving environment, an enclosed brackish lake were compared. Changes in the character <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> in lake water over a period of 14 years were studied in the context of changes in mill processing and climate impacts. High colour in mill effluent and in receiving waters correlated with high SUVA and specific colour levels, high molecular weight range and aromatic content. Conversely, lake waters with low colour had UV absorbing compounds of much lower molecular weight range and low relative abundance of aromatic compounds. Attenuation of colour and changes in the character <b>of</b> <b>organics</b> in the receiving environment coincided with increased concentrations of metal cations. These increased concentrations appear to be due to the effects of climate change, lake management and their presence in mill effluent, with subsequent discharge to the lake. Attenuation of colour was found to be predominantly through removal of high molecular weight aromatic compounds where the removal processes could be through adsorption and co-precipitation with divalent metals, as well as through dilution processes.
