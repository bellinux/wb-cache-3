40|$|The {{real option}} {{approach}} {{is used to}} value the minimum revenue guarantee (MRG) and the <b>option</b> <b>to</b> abandon in Build-Operate-Transfer infrastructure projects. The <b>option</b> <b>to</b> abandon is formulated under an investment option held by the concessionaire at contract signing and to expire before construction commencement. MRG is formulated {{as a series of}} European style put options in a single option pricing model. When combined with the <b>option</b> <b>to</b> abandon in the pre-construction phase, MRG is reconstructed as a series of European style call <b>options</b> <b>to</b> develop a compound option pricing formula. The Taiwan High-Speed Rail Project is chosen as a numerical case to apply the formulas. The results show both MRG and the <b>option</b> <b>to</b> abandon can create values. When MRG and the <b>option</b> <b>to</b> abandon are combined, they will counteract each other and their values will thus be reduced. Increasing the MRG level will decrease the value of the <b>option</b> <b>to</b> abandon, and, at a certain MRG level, the <b>option</b> <b>to</b> abandon will be rendered worthless.

50|$|For example, say XYZ {{is priced}} at $40 today, {{and has a}} special {{dividend}} of $1. Since call option holders are not entitled to dividends, a holder of an <b>option</b> <b>to</b> buy stock XYZ at $30 will not receive the $1 special dividend. However, after paying the cash dividend, then (all else being equal) XYZ will drop to $39, as it has paid out $1 of its value. However, the <b>option</b> <b>to</b> buy a $39 stock at $30 is worth less than the <b>option</b> <b>to</b> buy a $40 stock at $30. Therefore, option exchanges have formulas to adjust contracts appropriately when special dividends are paid out. In this case, the call <b>option</b> <b>to</b> buy at $30 will be converted <b>to</b> a call <b>option</b> <b>to</b> buy at $29, which will keep the option value roughly the same.|$|R
