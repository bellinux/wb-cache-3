5|$|At least 70 {{people were}} wounded when {{hundreds}} of residents attacked {{the police station}} in Khargah to demand the <b>ouster</b> <b>of</b> a police official who {{had a reputation for}} heavy-handedness. Police then opened fire on the protesters. Authorities said that 11 people had been killed. The United Nations estimated deaths at more than 300.|$|E

Public anger over the Senate vote triggered the EDSA Revolution of 2001, leading to the <b>ouster</b> <b>of</b> Estrada and the accession of Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to the presidency.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Barre's regime had become {{increasingly}} unpopular. The authorities became ever more totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang {{up across the}} country. This eventually led in 1991 to {{the outbreak of the}} civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the <b>ouster</b> <b>of</b> Barre's regime. Armed factions led by United Somali Congress commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.|$|E

5|$|In October 1964 Khrushchev was ousted. Suslov {{played a}} crucial role in the event. Suslov was, {{alongside}} Premier Alexei Kosygin and First Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, one of the most influential Soviet politicians of the 1960s following the <b>ouster</b> <b>of</b> Khrushchev. Having led the opposition against Khrushchev for years, Suslov had acquired and wielded great power within the Central Committee when Brezhnev rose to power. However, Suslov was never interested in becoming the leader of the Soviet Union, and was content to remain the man behind the scenes. During most of his term, Suslov was one of four people who had both a seat in the Secretariat and the Politburo; the three others were Brezhnev, Andrei Kirilenko and Fyodor Kulakov.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli {{returned}} to Syria in 1955, following the <b>ouster</b> <b>of</b> President Adib al-Shishakli {{and during the}} presidency of Hashim al-Atassi. Quwatli entered his candidacy in the August 1955 presidential elections, {{at the age of}} 63. Required to secure a two-thirds majority in the 142-member Syrian Parliament in order to win, Quwatli defeated his main opponent Khalid al-Azm 89 to 42 (a further six votes were cast as invalid) in the first round. This prompted a second round of voting, in which Quwatli won the presidency with 91 votes against Azm's 41 (a further five votes were blank and two invalid.) Quwatli's bid for the presidency was supported by the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, both of which were allied in their opposition to the Baghdad Pact as was Quwatli.|$|E
5|$|By May 1878, {{all three}} Preussen-class ships {{were ready for}} the annual summer {{maneuvers}} of the armored squadron. The three ships were joined by the large armored frigate , and operated {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Batsch. Friedrich der Grosse missed the maneuvers after running aground off Nyborg, leaving Batsch just three vessels. While steaming in the English Channel on 31 May, König Wilhelm accidentally rammed Grosser Kurfürst; the latter quickly sank with the loss of between 269 and 276 men. Her loss spurred a series of investigations into the circumstances of the collision, which ultimately resulted in the acquittal of both Rear Admiral Carl Ferdinand Batsch, the squadron commander, and Count Alexander von Monts, the captain of Grosser Kurfürst. Political infighting over the affair led to <b>ouster</b> <b>of</b> Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner from the navy.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Heard, {{for whom}} the campus's 10-library system (with 3.3 million total volumes) is named, served as {{chancellor}} from 1963 to 1982. During his 20-year tenure, the Owen Graduate School of Management was founded, and Vanderbilt's merger with Peabody College was negotiated. He also survived calls for his <b>ouster</b> because <b>of</b> his accommodating stance on desegregation.|$|R
25|$|In Singapore, {{the state}} of the law {{regarding}} the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>ouster</b> clauses is still unclear. Whereas in the United Kingdom the courts have abolished the distinction between non-jurisdictional and jurisdictional errors of law and affirmed that in general ouster clauses are ineffective against errors of law, Singapore cases seem to adopt the traditional pre-Anisminic approach. The distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law and the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>ouster</b> clauses against non-jurisdictional errors of law is exemplified by the cases of Re Application by Yee Yut Ee (1978), and Stansfield Business International Pte. Ltd. v. Minister for Manpower (1999).|$|R
50|$|In 1956, the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan {{approved}} a constitution that ended Pakistan's status {{of an independent}} Dominion of the British Empire, to create the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Maj. Gen. Iskander Mirza, the last Governor General of Pakistan, simultaneously became the state's first president. However, the new constitution was followed by political turmoil in Pakistan, which saw a succession of four prime ministers - Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar and Sir Feroz Khan Noon - {{in a period of}} two years. There was already a precedent in Governor General Malik Ghulam Muhammad dismissing prime ministers and ruling by decree, and many viewed Mirza as manipulating the constitution and instigating <b>ousters</b> <b>of</b> governments. The One Unit scheme amalgamating the provinces of Pakistan into two wings - West Pakistan and East Pakistan - was politically controversial and proving difficult to administer. The quick succession of prime ministers fostered the view within the military and in the public that Pakistani politicians were too weak and corrupt to govern effectively, and that the parliamentary system was flawed.|$|R
5|$|Through intrigue, Thảo {{also helped}} destabilise and {{ultimately}} unseat two South Vietnamese regimes—Diem's {{and the military}} junta of Khánh. As the Diệm regime began to unravel in 1963, Thảo {{was one of the}} officers planning a coup. His plot was ultimately integrated into the successful plot and his activities promoted infighting which weakened the government and distracted the military from fighting the Viet Cong insurgency. Throughout 1964 and 1965, as South Vietnam was struggling to establish a stable state after the <b>ouster</b> <b>of</b> Diệm, Thảo was involved in several intrigues and coup plots which diverted the government from implementing its programs. In 1965, he went into hiding after a failed attempt to seize power from Khánh and was sentenced to death in absentia. Although this coup also failed, the subsequent chaos forced Khánh's junta to collapse. Thảo died the same year he was forced into hiding; it is believed that he was murdered after a bounty was placed on his head. After Vietnam was reunified {{at the end of the}} Vietnam War, the victorious communists claimed Thảo as one of their own and posthumously made him a one-star general.|$|E

25|$|Further, the {{political}} {{branches of government}} may seek to limit judicial review through the use <b>of</b> <b>ouster</b> clauses. Examples <b>of</b> such clauses include Article18(9) of the Constitution, section8B(2) of the ISA, and section18 of the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act. However, it {{remains an open question}} whether ouster clauses are fully effective or whether, as the House of Lords held in Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1968), they do not apply to the acts and decisions of public authorities that are a nullity. Speaking extrajudicially, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong suggested that any statutory clause attempting to oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts may contravene Article 93, which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the courts.|$|R

5|$|A {{collective}} {{leadership was}} founded immediately after Khrushchev's <b>ouster,</b> consisting <b>of</b> Brezhnev as First Secretary, Kosygin {{as head of}} government, and Anastas Mikoyan (and later Nikolai Podgorny) as head of state. From the beginning, Suslov was a vocal critic of one-man rule such as that seen under Joseph Stalin and Khrushchev. While he condemned Stalin's one-man rule, he equally criticised the individualistic assertiveness of Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. A strong supporter of democratic centralism, Suslov prevented Brezhnev from taking over Kosygin's post as head of government in 1970. Kirilenko, Brezhnev, and Suslov were members of an unofficial Troika within the Communist Party leadership.|$|R
