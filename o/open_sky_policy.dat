The secondary data containing distance between airports (both in Indonesia and in ASEAN), flight frequency, and correlation of Gross Domestic Regional Product (GDRP) for each region in Indonesia are used as inputs to form MST networks.

This research found that the existing airport network in Indonesia does not depict the optimal network connecting all airports with the shortest distance and maximizing the correlation of regional economic potential in the country. This research then suggests the optimal networks and identifies the airports and regions as hubs and spokes formed by the networks.

At present, air traffic has been {{increasing}} since 2004, when the <b>open</b> <b>sky</b> <b>policy</b> was introduced. Unfortunately, the dynamics of year to year growth is getting lower. In 2014 Polish airports operated more than 25 million passengers. Polish Civil Aviation Authority forecasts the growth of air traffic by 2020. It is possible to predict that in 2020 in Poland 38 over million passengers will be traveling by plane. The flight operations {{and the rate of}} population mobility will increase. Polish government as well as local authorities and regions have to prepare a strategy of air transport development. This strategy should be realized for the central airport in Warsaw, major regional airports, small regional airports, and local and business aviation. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} identify opportunities for Polish airports in the new perspective of European funds for 2014 – 2020. The main problems of the issue will be presented from various points of view. The first problem focuses on the development of Polish air transport area. Moreover, the paper concentrates on the availability of European funds for air transport. Finally, the paper presents the analysis of selected investments in air transport area: infrastructure, capital and operations. These investments and regional strategies as well as individual programs and the concept of Central airports for Poland will be determining the model of the Polish air transport system until 2020.

This arrangement gives the highest role of state in controlling air transportation based on state sovereignty principles. The concept of airspace sovereignty faced challenges {{with the introduction of}} International air transportation liberalization through deregulation provisions. Such liberalization policy is later known as ‘open sky policy 2 ̆ 7. Such <b>open</b> <b>sky</b> <b>policy</b> includes the establishment of single market such as Single European Sky dan ASEAN Single Aviation Market. The liberalization led to a situation where sovereignty concept has been regarded from a different perspective. It is widely argued that the smooth operation of new forms of International cooperation requires a more flexible perception of sovereignty. This study wants to analyze the concept of Indonesia airspace sovereignty. A theory of Indonesia airspace sovereignty that ever born is the "Teori Kedaulatan Nusantara" by Priyatna Abdurrasyid in the 1970 s. "Teori Kedaulatan Nusantara" based on two doctrines i. e. the doctrine of necessity and doctrine of right of self-preservation that is the core of military/security aspect. In the other hand, what has become clear in the last few decades is that the economic aspects of airspace sovereignty have dominated change. This paper argues that there is a continuing trend away from the absolute airspace sovereignty regime towards something less. It is submitted that preservation theory cannot be sustained in the Indonesia airspace sovereignty doctrine.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{outcomes}} of <b>open</b> <b>skies</b> <b>policies</b> {{is the importance of}} service frequency in the competition between airlines. To keep load factors high while offering high frequency service, airlines tend {{to reduce the size of}} the aircraft used. On short-haul routes this phenomenon is even more apparent, especially on routes between hub airports, even though these routes and airports are often congested. This choice of service frequency and aircraft size must have important environmental consequences that this paper aims to evaluate and quantify. The analysis considers local air pollution, climate change and noise impacts and aims to evaluate whether the competitive environment that drives airlines to offer high frequency service carries an environmental penalty. The analysis showed that increasing aircraft size and adjusting the service frequency to offer similar seating capacity will increase local pollution but decrease climate change impact and noise pollution. When local pollution and climate change impacts are monetized and aggregated the analysis showed that environmental benefits will result from increasing aircraft size. But these benefits, in monetary terms, were found to be relatively small and sensitive to the assumptions made. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This paper reviews hierarchy of air transport system, the entry of low cost carriers {{and their impact on}} upper class rail travel pattern. The paper also highlights the importance of feeder and short haul air transport network from passengers and regional economic point of view and high degree of multiple effects attached to it. The access and egress facilities to and from airports are extremely important because it is common in feeder and short haul routes that the ratio of airtime to total journey time to accomplish the travel is very small and less attraction to the users. This paper presents the accessibility infrastructure to airports with reference to the current status and bottlenecks associated with it. The need to improve connectivity in terms of capacity and rapid access to existing and new airports with alternative urban transport technologies like Metro Rail, Light Rail, and Monorail has been emphasized in this paper considering the rapid expansion of civil aviation and also from the perspective of ever increasing urban traffic congestion/ pollution levels due to vehicular traffic.
