DeLorean was sharply critical of the direction GM had taken by the start of the 1970s, saying [...] "There's no forward response at General Motors to what the public wants today."

2500|$|In Nintendo's year-end {{report for}} its 2016 fiscal year (ended March 31, 2017), the company {{stated that they}} had sold 2.74 million Switch units worldwide. Distribution of {{shipments}} included 1.2 million units in North and South America, 600,000 in Japan, and 940,000 in all other regions including Europe and Australia.

Retailer GameStop reported that initial sales of the Switch were [...] "phenomenal" [...] and on track to surpass the Wii U based on their historical sales data, with merchandising director Eric Bright saying the Switch has had [...] "one of the highest attach rates of software and accessories to a device that we've {{seen in a long}} time". Due to the strong sales, Nintendo has expanded its production capacity for the Switch, with anticipation of selling at least 10 million Switch consoles during the 2017 fiscal year. Kimishima stated that having a Switch user base of 10 million [...] "will give publishers and the rest <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>business</b> partners a sense that the future of Nintendo Switch is more promising" [...] and spur further games development for the platform. Kimishima said that a key goal in their production ramp up will be to make sure they have enough Switch inventory near the end of 2017 for holiday sales, as to avoid the issue with Wii shortages that occurred during its first holiday-season period, while balancing the near-term high demand. According to Kimishima, Nintendo now believes that if they can realize 10 million in Switch sales in 2017, they expect that the Switch will have lifetime sales that are comparable to the Wii, which had sold over 100 million units in its lifetime.|$|E
