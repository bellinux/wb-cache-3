In late 1776 or early 1777, he invented a self-winding mechanism for pocket watches using an <b>oscillating</b> <b>weight</b> inside the watch that moved up and down.

50|$|In 1948, Eterna {{advanced}} self-winding watch {{technology with}} the development of the Eterna-matic automatic movement. The use of five strategically placed ball bearings made the movement very efficient and significantly reduced friction and resistance on the <b>oscillating</b> <b>weight</b> that wound the mainspring. This reduced the wear and tear on internal parts, increasing the watch’s accuracy and useful life. The new watch became popular soon, is probably the most famous Eterna watch and may be one of Eterna’s greatest designs.

40|$|We discuss two {{problems}} in complexified auxiliary fields in fermionic effective models, the auxiliary sign problem {{associated with the}} repulsive vector-field and {{the choice of the}} cut for the scalar field appearing from the logarithmic function. In the fermionic effective models with attractive scalar and repulsive vector-type interaction, the auxiliary scalar and vector fields appear in the path integral after the bosonization of fermion ilinears. When we make the path integral well-defined by the Wick rotation of the vector field, the <b>oscillating</b> Boltzmann <b>weight</b> appears in the partition function. This "auxiliary" sign problem can be solved by using the Lefschetz-thimble path-integral method, where the integration path is constructed in the complex plane. Another serious obstacle in the numerical construction of Lefschetz thimbles is caused by singular points and cuts induced by multivalued functions of the complexified scalar field in the momentum integration. We propose a new prescription which fixes gradient flow trajectories on the same Riemann sheet in the flow evolution by performing the momentum integration in the complex domain.

The time between releases depended on the rate of flow, which decreased with water pressure {{as the level of}} water in the source container dropped. The development of mechanical clocks depended on the invention of an escapement which would allow a clock's movement to be controlled by an <b>oscillating</b> <b>weight.</b> Unlike the continuous flow of water in the Chinese device, the medieval escapement was characterized by a regular, repeating sequence of discrete actions and the capability of self-reversing action: ...|$|E

Steam was supplied and exhausted through the trunnions. The oscillating motion of the cylinder was usually used to line up ports in the trunnions to direct the steam feed and exhaust to the cylinder at the correct times. However, separate valves may be provided, controlled by the oscillating motion. This allows the timing to be varied to enable expansive working. (As, for example, the engine in the paddle ship PD Krippen.) This compromises the advantage of simplicity but still retains the advantage of compactness.|$|R

40|$|Time-resolved photoemission {{experiments}} {{can reveal}} fascinating quantum dynamics of correlated electrons. However, the thermalization {{of the electronic}} system is typically so fast that very short probe pulses are necessary to resolve the time evolution of the quantum state, and this leads to poor energy resolution due to the energy-time uncertainty relation. Although the photoemission intensity can be calculated from the nonequilibrium electronic Green functions, the converse procedure is therefore difficult. We analyze a hypothetical time-resolved photoemission experiment on a correlated electronic system, described by the Falicov-Kimball model in dynamical mean-field theory, which relaxes between metallic and insulating phases. We find that the real-time Green function which describes the transient behavior during the buildup of the metallic state cannot be determined directly from the photoemission signal. On the other hand, the characteristic collapse-and-revival oscillations of an excited Mott insulator can be observed as <b>oscillating</b> <b>weight</b> {{in the center of}} the Mott gap in the time-dependent photoemission spectrum.

3000|$|Importantly, these {{gestures}} {{differ in}} {{the complexity of the}} relations represented. In particular, whole system gestures summarize an entire system over time—not just a single relation such as an increase—and thus would be expected to be more spatially complex. To examine this possibility, we analyzed the type of stroke involved in the different gesture types. The stroke is the part of the gesture that is meant to represent what is being described (McNeill, 1992). The canonical gesture stroke is simple in that it involves a single movement phase proceeding in a single direction, but gesture strokes can also be more complex in several ways. In the case of concrete iconic gestures, complex gesture strokes might occur, for instance, when someone traces the outline of a square, shows a repetitive action such as hammering, or depicts alternating action such as two <b>weights</b> <b>oscillating</b> on a scale (for discussion of different stroke types, see McNeill, 1992, p. 308; Kita, Van Gijn, & Van der Hulst, 1998, 2014).

Some strokes were unclear with respect to complexity; for those gestures that both coders considered codable (97 % of gestures analyzed), agreement as to whether the stroke was simple or complex was 96 % (N[*]=[*] 137, PABAK[*]=[*] 0.91). 2 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Anurans {{are well}} known for their jumping abilities, making use of their strong hindlimbs. In contrast, the {{function}} of the forelimbs during take-off has rarely been studied. We measured the ground reaction forces exerted by forelimbs and hindlimbs during short jumps in the Dybowski's frog Rana dybowskii. Take-off occurred in two phases. Phase one (from the initial time until the forelimbs took off), which lasts a relatively long time (63. 2 [*]±[*] 4. 1 % of the total take-off phase, N[*]=[*] 20), provides sufficient time for the forelimbs to elevate the body to a suitable posture to deliver the best take-off angle. Phase two (from the forelimbs lift-off until hindlimbs lift-off) was dominated by the hindlimbs which provided a constant and fast elevation. The force angle (angle of the resultant vector from fore-aft and normal force components towards the plane of the substrate) of the hindlimbs and body trajectory was variable before the forelimbs lifted off of the substrate and then primarily followed the direction of the line from the foot-substrate point to the center of mass (COM). The preparation angle adopted when the forelimbs lifted off of the substrate was a good predictor of the take-off angle. The total normal force <b>oscillated</b> around body <b>weight</b> (BW) before the forelimb normal force peaked. The BW shifted from the hindlimbs to the forelimbs during the initial phase of take-off.

40|$|Elementary {{approximate}} formulae for numerical {{integration of}} functions containing oscillating factors {{of a special}} form with a parameter have been proposed in the paper. In this case general quadrature formulae can be used only at sufficiently small values of the parameter. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} consider in advance presence of strongly oscillating factors in order to obtain formulae for numerical integration which are suitable in the case when the parameter is changing within wide limits. This can be done by taking into account such factors as weighting functions. Moreover, since the parameter can take values which cannot always be predicted in advance, approximate formulae for calculation of such integrals should be constructed {{in such a way that}} they contain this parameter in a letter format and they are suitable for calculation at any and particularly large values of the parameter. Computational rules with such properties are generally obtained by dividing an interval of integration into elementary while making successive approximation of the integral density at each elementary interval with polynomials of the first, second and third degrees and taking the <b>oscillating</b> factors as <b>weighting</b> functions. The paper considers the variant when density of the integrals at each elementary interval is approximated by a polynomial of zero degree that is a constant which is equal to the value of density in the middle of the interval. At the same time one approximate formula for calculation of an improper integral with infinite interval of the function with oscillating factor of a special type has been constructed in the paper. In this case it has been assumed that density of the improper integral rather quickly goes to zero when an argument module is increasing indefinitely. In other words it is considered as small to negligible outside some finite interval. Uniforms in parameter used for evaluation of errors in approximate formulae have been obtained in the paper and they make it possible to calculate integrals with the required accuracy. </p...|$|R
40|$|In modern life, human {{have become}} {{dependent}} on portable electronics, such as cell phones, MP 3 and handheld computers, {{most of which are}} powered by batteries. Although the performance of batteries is being continuously improved, the limited energy storage and service life constrain the lasting use of these mobile electronics. Therefore it is desirable to find alternative or supplementary methods to solve this problem from its root cause. It is known that human body contains rich chemical energy, part of which is converted to mechanical energy up to 200 W when in motion, so it is ideal to harvest {{a small fraction of the}} human kinetic energy to power mobile electronic devices. In this thesis, first, the previous work done by other researchers on energy harvesting from human motion, especially from unintentional human motion, such as arm swing and leg moving, is reviewed. Then the fundamental principles to mechanically harvest motion energy are discussed, including the mechanical oscillating mechanisms and electromagnetic transduction. Derived from the general harvesting model, four different devices are designed and analyzed. Shoe is important for human, one of which functions is to serve as shock-absorber to protect foot from the large impact force. As the foot strikes the ground, the shoe is subject to not only large force but also large displacement in the heel. The third new device is designed to insert in the shoe heel to harvest the kinetic energy from foot strike, and at the same time to function as a shock absorber for foot. Considering the stability and efficiency, a spring-slider-crank mechanism is used in this harvester to covert the up-down foot strike motion into unidirectional rotation to drive an AC generator. The spring and slider compose an oscillating system to absorb the foot strike motion, and crank and slider make up the conversion mechanism to transfer the bi-directional translation into unidirectional rotation. A set of gear is used to speed up the rotation. The kinematical performance of the harvester is also analyzed. The first one is the automatic winding mechanism of mechanical movement. It consists of an <b>oscillating</b> <b>weight,</b> a ratchet mechanism, a gear set and a mainspring. The mechanism can be modeled as a double pendulum when worn on a user's wrist. Its kinematical performance is analyzed with experimental validation. This thesis discusses the feasibility of mechanical power generators driven by human motion, with the focus on their architecture design and performance analysis. The main objective is to develop effective power generators for harvesting the energy from human motion, and use it to power portable electronic devices. To directly convert the human arm motion to electricity, the second novel energy harvester is designed, analyzed and simulated. It mainly consists of an eccentric rotor made of permanent magnet, and a set of coils as a stator. The eccentric rotor, as a simple pendulum, acts as the kinetic energy harvester which absorbs the motion from human body in motion. With the permanent magnets on the rotor, the moving rotor produces a changing magnetic field, from which the stator induces electricity. In this design, a torsion spring is also added onto the rotor so that the harvester works even when the motion is on horizontal plane. When foot strikes the ground, a large acceleration is produced. The fourth new energy harvester uses dual-oscillating mode. It contains two oscillating mechanisms: one is spring-mass oscillator to absorb the vibration from footstep motion, and the other is cantilever beam using the tip mass to amplify the vibration. Analysis shows that the dual-oscillating mechanism can be more effectively harvest the foot step motion. The energy conversion sub-mechanism is based on the electromagnetic induction, where the coils fixed at the tip end of the cantilever beam serves as the slider, and the fixed permanent magnets and yoke produce the changing magnetic field. Mathematical analysis and simulation are included. Xie, Longhan. Adviser: Ruxu Du. Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 72 - 04, Section: B, page:. Thesis (Ph. D.)
