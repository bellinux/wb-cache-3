500|$|In the 2011 {{video game}} , when the Joker's {{interview}} tapes are found, Joker retells his origin from The Killing Joke. In this version, he {{reveals that the}} two thugs worked for Carmine Falcone. At {{the end of the}} tapes, Joker apparently blames Batman for what happened to him. Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What can I say? I like to keep things interesting. A wise man <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if {{you have to have an}} origin story, you're better off making it multiple choice".|$|E
500|$|The {{audience}} became angrier still when in {{the following}} episode, [...] "Eye For An Eye", MacLeod made love to Immortal Annie Devlin. Abramowitz explained the creative decision of his staff by saying that [...] "...someone <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> death was an aphrodisiac. It's a thing that pushes you to life and the greatest thing in life, that's 'seize life', is sex." [...] Lineberger wrote in his review of [...] "Eye For An Eye", [...] "This one caused an uproar— one I feel is justified. [...] gave a defense (in my opinion a weak one) (...) I have a high tolerance for insensitive guy stuff, but this got to me. When Duncan rolled into Annie's arms, part of me smirked in appreciation of Duncan's magnetic charm. But the rest of me found his actions cruel to the viewers." [...] Abramowitz confirmed that [...] "...the fans hated it. And the women wanted to string me up. I was a 'cad' and a 'card'..." [...] Paul also reported an angry reaction from the audience after the seventh episode, [...] "The Return of Amanda", in which MacLeod sleeps with Amanda.|$|E
2500|$|Film critic Betsey Sharkey agrees, {{adding that}} [...] "he was a maestro {{of one or}} two takes years before Clint Eastwood would turn it into a {{respected}} specialty." [...] Sharkey recalls, [...] " [...] Dunaway <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Lumet worked so fast {{it was as if he}} were on roller skates. A racing pulse generated by a big heart." ...|$|E

50|$|Lucas: You <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> Ben, <b>that</b> {{the world}} belongs {{to those who}} bring it the most hope. Do you still believe that, Ben? Well, seaQuest {{is part of that}} hope again. I love you, man, youre my friend. Let me take you home.|$|R

"They {{had thought}} of staying {{a long time in}} the country, perhaps till after Thanksgiving, for they had become {{attached}} to their place; but now they suddenly agreed to go back to New York at <b>once.</b> She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> as soon as they agreed she felt a tremendous longing to be gone that instant, as if she must go to escape from something, some calamity, and she felt, looking back, that there was a prophetic quality in her eagerness." ...|$|R
2500|$|Salman Ahmed {{while talking}} about his latest project at Asia Talk on BBC said, [...] "For almost a decade, Junaid has always asked me not to bring guitar or {{to ask him to}} sing. When you are friends with {{somebody}} you always have to transcend differences and I respect Junaid's views. Junaid <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> his biggest regret was not {{to be a part of}} Jazba Junoon's recording. So when we came up with 'Naya Pakistan', I asked him that this is the chance that's not going to come again so finally Junaid accepted the offer with the condition that he will sing only the opening lines with no music at all." [...] and further added [...] "it signifies the metaphor for unity as we have to compromise for unity in hope of Naya Pakistan." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don’t mind him," [...] said Miss Vickers. [...] "I’m half sorry I let him join, now. A {{man that}} {{used to work for}} him <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he was only half a gentleman, but he’d never seen that half." ...|$|E
50|$|I am a {{child of}} the Universe. As child of this Universe, I {{believe that there is a}} calling beyond what the eyes can see, but within the range of where the soul can feel. I trust {{everyday}} that the Universe will guide. I know that I don't know, and therefore my mind remains exposed to new possibilities. There is not a single word I found yet <b>that</b> can describe <b>me</b> in totality. But as someone <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> maybe <b>that</b> word is Choc'late.|$|R
6000|$|... "About a {{mile and}} a half farther out, sir. If you want horses I should think that you had better go on at <b>once,</b> for he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he had sold sixty yesterday, but that very few of them were {{anything}} like as good horses as these." ...|$|R
500|$|Nevertheless, [...] {{with the}} {{primitive}} facilities {{available at the}} time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations {{that led to a}} satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years, continued through the cold war, and still exists. Otto Frisch remembered Ulam as [...] "a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At <b>once</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he was a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I notice," [...] she remarked, [...] "that {{there is}} {{generally}} an 'only' {{about people who}} have spent week-ends at Bristow. They play cards there, don't they, until daylight? Some one <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they kept a professional croupier for roulette!" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. MARCHMONT. [Brightening to {{a look of}} real pleasure.] I am so glad to {{hear you}} say that. Marchmont and I have been married for seven years, and he has never <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I was morbid. Men are so painfully unobservant! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} told that--that your father--is alive." [...] He looked down upon her and could see that her face was red up to her very hair. [...] "Your mother <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{she had never been}} certain of his death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd find {{it harder}} to do without breakfast and supper, which is what may happen very soon," [...] Blake rejoined. [...] "One can eat the tripe de roche which grows upon the stones, but I don't {{know where to look}} for it, and a North-West Police trooper who <b>once</b> tried it <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it made him very ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did it, oh She," [...] she answered, drawing {{herself up}} to the full of her stately height, and {{throwing}} back the panther skin from her head, [...] "because my love is stronger than the grave. I did it because my life without this man whom my heart chose would be but a living death. Therefore did I risk my life, and, now that I {{know that it is}} forfeit to thine anger, yet am I glad that I did risk it, and pay it away in the risking, ay, because he embraced <b>me</b> <b>once,</b> and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he loved <b>me</b> yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why--er--I can't say as to that. He didn't {{say much}} about himself, that I can remember. <b>Once</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about <b>that</b> child, but--but it's hazy--I can't think! Oh, it drives me crazy when I try to think! The roar of the sea gets in my ears, and {{the light from the}} {{lighthouse}} fires my brain!" [...] And the old tar began to pace the floor in a rolling gait.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} {{tell the whole}} truth," [...] objected Anne. [...] "You only tell the disagreeable part of the truth. Now, you've told me a dozen times that my hair was red, but you've never <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had a nice nose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll drop music, then," [...] {{she said}} hastily. [...] "Books? But I {{remember}} you <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you had never read anything except detective novels, {{and that you}} didn't care for poetry. Sports? I adore tennis and I am rather good at golf." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{speak as}} though that were unusual," [...] Douglas laughed, [...] "but I was just {{thinking}} that every one here {{seems to be in}} the same state. Some one <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> London was a city of sadness. Who could watch the people here and say so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were about}} to be married, she and I, when some black chance threw him across our path. I do not know by what base deceptions he lured her away from me. I have heard that she was only one of many, and that he was an adept at the art. It was done before ever I knew the danger, and she was left with her broken heart and her ruined life to return to that home into which she had brought disgrace and misery. I only saw her <b>once.</b> She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> her seducer had burst out a-laughing when she had reproached him for his perfidy, and I swore to her that his heart's blood should pay <b>me</b> for <b>that</b> laugh.|$|R
40|$|This is the ‘Fox Temple’ {{close to}} the ‘Small River Bank’ at Moukden [Shenyang] where our Kun Kwang School, Hospitals & medical college are. ❧ The Chinese regard the fox as having supernatural qualities, & thus raise temples, & make votive offerings to the fox. At {{the same time the}} fox skins are valuable, & so most Chinese seem to have no {{objection}} to shooting foxes, & selling their furs. ❧ White foxes (rather rare) are supposed to have extra special powers. I knew a man <b>once</b> who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he had <b>once</b> had the temerity to shoot at a white fox, & to his horrified surprise, he saw the bullet stot off the animal’s shin, & fall harmless to the ground. He was quite annoyed when I laughed at this tall story. ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have another}} parent, Venetia,' said Cadurcis, {{in a tone}} of almost irresistible softness, 'the best and {{greatest}} of men! <b>Once</b> you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> his sanction was necessary to your marriage. I will obtain it. O Venetia! be mine, and we will join him; join that ill-fated and illustrious being who loves you with a passion second only to mine; him who has addressed you in language which rests on every lip, and has thrilled many a heart that you even can never know. My adored Venetia! picture to yourself, for one moment, a life with him; resting on my bosom, consecrated by his paternal love! Let us quit this mean and miserable existence, which we now pursue, which never could have suited us; let us shun for ever this dull and degrading life, that is not life, if life be what I deem it; let us fly to those beautiful solitudes where he communes with an inspiring nature; let us, let us be happy!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You forget, mamma, {{that there}} are three names in the business. The {{inscription}} over the door in Main Street is Wagner, Keller, and Engelman. Fritz <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the office here in Frankfort was only the small office--and the grand business was Mr. Wagner's business in London. Am I right, Mr. David?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Benson <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{when the}} ghost walked, {{it was a}} sure sign of a coming death in the family. Is that true?" [...] asked Rose, whose curiosity was excited by the {{expression}} of Octavia's face, and a certain uneasiness in Sir Jasper's manner in spite of his merry mood.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] she said, [...] "that {{this man}} is full of queer contradictions. Some one <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he was {{enormously}} wealthy; {{that he had been}} to an English public school and changed his name out in America. Rubbish, I expect. [...] . Run and find Lily, there's a dear boy. We are going in now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Remembering what Grace <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I fancied <b>that</b> an {{expression}} of unutterable relief smoothed out the wrinkles of anxiety on the legatee's brow, but I may have been mistaken in this. There was a curious look in Ormond's face, and I understood {{the depth of his}} loyalty to Grace. It struck me with a shock that Ormond, in spite of his apparent carelessness, realized how far matters had drifted, and hoped to spare her the painful discovery. Then he lay back struggling for breath, when, after the will was signed, at a signal from the doctor the others withdrew. Perhaps an hour passed while I kept watch alone before he spoke again, saying very faintly: ...|$|R
60|$|Enough! I hated Kerner, {{and one day}} I met him and {{we became}} friends. He was young and gloriously melancholy because his spirits were so high and life had so much in store for him. Yes, he was almost riotously sad. That was his youth. When a man begins to be hilarious in a sorrowful way you can bet a million that he is dyeing his hair. Kerner's hair was {{plentiful}} and carefully matted as an artist's thatch should be. He was a cigaretteur, and he audited his dinners with red wine. But, most of all, he was a fool. And, wisely, I envied him, and listened patiently while he knocked Velasquez and Tintoretto. <b>Once</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he liked a story of mine {{that he had come}} across in an anthology. He described it to me, and I was sorry that Mr. Fitz-James O'Brien was dead and could not learn of the eulogy of his work. But mostly Kerner made few breaks and was a consistent fool.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure that}} he would be glad to know. I need not say where you are living. I will say that you have charged me to keep it secret, and he will forbear {{questioning}} me. But I {{am sure that}} it will give him deep pleasure to know that I have seen you, to learn how you look, how you are living, how you occupy yourself, and how you think of him. It cannot but be a trial to him to know nothing of one he so loves. More than <b>once</b> he has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he wondered whether you had entered a convent, whether you were in health, how you bore yourself, and other matters." ...|$|R
60|$|What I {{want to know}} {{is whether}} your art (or {{whatever}} you call it) can get at my diseased mind, through my healthy body. You have more than <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> medicine can do this. The time has come for doing it. I am in a bad way, and a bad end may follow. My only medical friend, deliver me from myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] I answered. [...] "A {{wise man}} <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if {{one who is}} blind can but {{come face to face}} with a spirit, he sees it and thereby regains his sight. If you would know the truth, that is why I have wandered so far from my own country to find some land where ghosts may be met." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{gentleman who}} saw me was {{particularly}} suave in manner, but uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having <b>once</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the Piccadilly house, which throughout our interview {{he called a}} [...] "mansion," [...] was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I asked who had purchased it, {{he opened his eyes}} a thought wider, and paused a few seconds before replying, [...] "It is sold, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{your father}} {{asked them to}} stay there, that he might judge of her, and wrote to Sir Guy {{that she was a}} little, gentle, childish thing, capable of being moulded to anything, and {{representing}} the mischief of leaving them to such society as that of her brother, who was actually maintaining them. That letter was never answered, but about ten days or a fortnight after this terrible accident, Colonel Harewood wrote to entreat my brother to come to Redclyffe, saying poor Sir Guy had eagerly caught at the mention of his name. Of course he went at <b>once,</b> and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he never, in all his experience as a clergyman, saw any one so completely broken down with grief.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Donington Park {{marked the}} race debut of Honda's pneumatic-valve engine, which only Hayden was using initially. In {{the next round}} at Assen, Hayden ran 3rd from the start and was set to finish there until {{he ran out of}} fuel at the final corner, due to an {{electrical}} system problem which prevented accurate fuel monitoring. Colin Edwards captured Hayden's 3rd place podium moments before Hayden coasted over the line with no power, to finish 4th place. A heel injury sustained in a motocross crash put him out of two rounds. Relations within the team had already deteriorated, and there was further friction when Pedrosa switched tire suppliers midseason (from the struggling Michelin to the dominant Bridgestone) without Hayden being consulted. Hayden stated [...] "I've never been put in the conditions to choose. <b>Once</b> they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I would have just wasted my time had I even only thought about asking for Bridgestone tires...I'm not surprised they've given them to him. Besides, at Misano I didn't even have the same fork Dani had... No way would I think they'd let me try the new tires".|$|R
6000|$|... “We shall float down as before, señor. It is a flat {{country for}} the next fifty miles, and the great inundations will rob the river of its power. We shall have several more rapids to pass, but I do not {{think they will be}} worse than these. Then we shall get to the falls. There are several small ones, round which we shall have to carry our boats, and there is a great one where the whole river leaps down a hundred feet in a mass. On still nights you can hear it, I am told, nigh a hundred miles away. It is the {{greatest}} fall in South America, though a traveller I <b>once</b> met <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in North America there was a fall that was higher, but that there was nothing like the same quantity poured over it as over this at flood-time. Once beyond that there remain no more falls or rapids, and a ship can sail up there from the Amazon. Good-sized craft do come up sometimes, for there is a mission-station there, and the fathers carry on a trade with the Indians, who come from the lower districts to purchase goods.” ...|$|R
