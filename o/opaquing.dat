40|$|Restoration of a Class IV {{defect in}} the {{aesthetic}} zone in combination with a direct resin veneer can be a considerable challenge for clinicians, especially when striv-ing to emulate the natural dentition. Shade-matching is a particular concern in achieving a natural-looking aesthetic result. Value enamels {{can also be used}} over selective areas of a Class IV restoration as needed to modify the perception of the chroma of underlying layers of artificial dentin and body enamel. This second and concluding part provides a discussion of how an advanced polychromatic com-posite layering technique can be used to meet the patient’s aesthetic expectations. Learning Objectives: This article discusses how an advanced polychromatic composite layering technique is used to restore a Class IV/direct veneer/diastema. Upon reading this article, the reader should: • Become familiar with how to properly select an <b>opaquing</b> agent, composite dentin, and enamel shades that elicit correct color value when performing a direct veneer on a discolored tooth substrate. • Be able to integrate a large Class IV restoration with a direct veneer while closing a midline diastema through multilayered polychromatic stratification...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} previously that cohabitation with an adult male induces precocial puberty in female mice and, furthermore, that {{a factor in the}} male’s urine is only in part responsible for this phenomenon. The present four sets of experiments had as their objective a more precise determination of the male’s relevant cues. Exposure of immature females of a particular body weight to intact male urine for 54 h yielded a small but consistent level of uterine growth. Cohabitation with a castrated male for the same length of time resulted in no uterine growth. Simultaneous exposure to intact male urine and the presence of a castrated male, on the other hand, yielded uterine growth of a magnitude similar to that obtained by cohabitation with an intact male. Further experiments using wire mesh barriers, <b>opaquing</b> the eyes and/or occluding the ear canals verified that the second type of cue was tactile and, by extension, that castrated males showed the necessary tactile responses. Thus the relevant cues of the male are pheromonal and tactile and these cues act synergistically to induce precocial puberty in young females...|$|E

40|$|An <b>opaque</b> {{product is}} a product where the {{retailer}} hides one or more attributes of the product until {{after it has been}} sold. Historically, <b>opaque</b> products have been used in the hotel and airline industries where customers can purchase a room or flight without knowing the brand name. In this work, we show that using <b>opaque</b> products in the retail industry, where there are nonperishable goods and supply chain costs, may also be beneficial. Although <b>opaque</b> products have traditionally been used as a vehicle for price discrimination, we show that <b>opaque</b> products can also be used as a vehicle for inventory management and therefore lower supply chain costs. In our model, customers arrive dynamically and choose between two substitutable products and an <b>opaque</b> product, which is sold at a discount. Customers that purchase the <b>opaque</b> product will be allocated one of the two substitutable products at the discretion of the retailer. For serving demand, joint replenishment and holding costs are incurred by the retailer. We prove that offering an <b>opaque</b> product can strictly improve the profit of the retailer, even without altering the prices of the original products. We also provide a simple method to estimate demand in an <b>opaque</b> selling environment based on the demand without an <b>opaque</b> product, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we analytically show that using <b>opaque</b> products to balance inventory has dramatic cost advantages, even when the amount of <b>opaque</b> products sold is relatively small.

50|$|Next to the {{dimorphism}} and {{the first}} described high frequency switching system C. albicans undergoes another high frequency switching process called white to <b>opaque</b> switching, which is another phenotypic switching process in C. albicans. It was the second high-frequency switching system discovered in C. albicans. The white to <b>opaque</b> switching is an epigenetic switching system. Phenotypic switching {{is often used to}} refer to white-opaque switching, which consists of two phases: one that grows as round cells in smooth, white colonies (referred to as white form) and one that is rod-like and grows as flat, gray colonies (called <b>opaque</b> form). This switch from white cells to <b>opaque</b> cells is important for the virulence and the mating process of C. albicans as the <b>opaque</b> form is the mating competent form, being a million times more efficient in mating compared to the white type. This switching between white and <b>opaque</b> form is regulated by the WOR1 regulator (White to <b>Opaque</b> Regulator 1) which is controlled by the mating type locus (MTL) repressor (a1-α2) that inhibits the expression of WOR1. Besides the white and <b>opaque</b> phase there is also a third one: the gray phenotype. This phenotype shows the highest ability to cause cutaneous infections. The white, <b>opaque</b> and gray phenotypes form a tristable phenotypic switching system. Since {{it is often difficult to}} differentiate between white, <b>opaque</b> and gray cells phloxine B, a dye, can be added to the medium.|$|R

40|$|Recently, a {{porcelain}}-fused-to-metal <b>opaque</b> porcelain {{was introduced}} {{that does not}} require a separate firing before application of the body porcelain.

The properties studied included flexural strength, linear firing shrinkage, coefficient of thermal expansion, powder particle size, and ability to bond to body porcelain and dental alloys. Sintering of this <b>opaque</b> porcelain was complete when fired at 1760 [deg] F (960 [deg] C) with a linear firing shrinkage of 13. 1 % +/- 0. 2 %. No boundary between the <b>opaque</b> and body porcelains could be found with a scanning electron microscope after firing at 1760 [deg] F (960 [deg] C). The mean flexural strengths were 99 +/- 7 and 101 +/- 8 MPa respectively, for this <b>opaque</b> porcelain and a conventional <b>opaque</b> porcelain, and were not significantly different as assessed with Student's t-test (p = 0. 548).

40|$|Modes {{of sexual}} {{reproduction}} in eukaryotic organisms are extremely diverse. The {{human fungal pathogen}} Candida albicans undergoes a phenotypic switch from the white to the <b>opaque</b> phase {{in order to become}} mating-competent. In this study, we report that functionally- and morphologically-differentiated white and <b>opaque</b> cells show a coordinated behavior during mating. Although white cells are mating-incompetent, they can produce sexual pheromones when treated with pheromones of the opposite mating type or by physically interacting with <b>opaque</b> cells of the opposite mating type. In a co-culture system, pheromones released by white cells induce <b>opaque</b> cells to form mating projections, and facilitate both opposite- and same-sex mating of <b>opaque</b> cells. Deletion of genes encoding the pheromone precursor proteins and inactivation of the pheromone response signaling pathway (Ste 2 -MAPK-Cph 1) impair the promoting role of white cells (MTLa) in the sexual mating of <b>opaque</b> cells. White and <b>opaque</b> cells communicate via a paracrine pheromone signaling system, creating an environment conducive to sexual mating.

40|$|SummaryTo mate, Candida albicans must undergo homozygosis at {{the mating}} type-like locus MTL [1, 2], then switch {{from the white}} to <b>opaque</b> {{phenotype}} [3, 4]. Paradoxically, when <b>opaque</b> cells are transferred in vitro to 37 °C, the temperature of their animal host, they switch en masse to white [5 – 7], suggesting that their major niche might not be conducive to mating. It {{has been suggested that}} pheromones secreted by <b>opaque</b> cells of opposite mating type [8] or the hypoxic condition of host niches [9, 10] stabilize <b>opaque</b> cells. There is, however, an additional possibility, namely that CO 2, which achieves levels in the host 100 times higher than in air [11 – 13], stabilizes the <b>opaque</b> phenotype. CO 2 has been demonstrated to regulate the bud-hypha transition in C. albicans [14, 15], expression of virulence genes in bacteria [16], and mating events in Cryptococcus neoformans [14, 17]. We tested the possibility that CO 2 stabilizes the <b>opaque</b> phenotype, and found that physiological levels of CO 2 induce white-to-opaque switching and stabilize the <b>opaque</b> phenotype at 37 °C. It exerts this control equally under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. These results suggest that the high levels of CO 2 in the host induce and stabilize the <b>opaque</b> phenotype, thus facilitating mating...|$|R

40|$|Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a ubiquitous, gram-negative marine {{bacterium}} that undergoes {{phase variation}} between <b>opaque</b> and translucent colony morphologies. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the factor(s) responsible for the <b>opaque</b> and translucent phenotypes and to examine cell organization within both colony types. Examination of thin sections of ruthenium red-stained bacterial cells by electron microscopy revealed a thick, electron-dense layer surrounding the <b>opaque</b> cells that was absent in preparations from translucent strains. Extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) material was extracted from both <b>opaque</b> and translucent strains, and the <b>opaque</b> strain was shown to produce abundant levels of polysaccharide, in contrast to the translucent strain. Compositional analysis of the EPS identified four major sugars: glucose, galactose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine. Confocal scanning laser microscopy was used to investigate cell organization within <b>opaque</b> and translucent colonies. Cells within both types of colonies exhibited striking organization; rod-shaped cells were aligned parallel to one another and perpendicular to the agar surface throughout the depth of the colony. Cells within translucent colonies appeared more tightly packed than cells in <b>opaque</b> colonies. In addition, a dramatic difference in the structural integrity of these two colony types was observed. When colonies were perturbed, the cell organization of the translucent colonies was completely disrupted while the organization of the <b>opaque</b> colonies was maintained.

Causal decision theory, as well as attempts to rework evidential decision theory, lead to ambiguous prescriptions. These decision theories produce different prescriptions given different commitments about free will. We should prefer avoiding decision theories that lead to ambiguities whenever there is a decision theory that does not produce ambiguities. We have just such a decision theory: Jeffrey's original formulation of evidential decision theory does not require one to accept a particular position on free will to generate unambiguous prescriptions.
