5|$|<b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{released}} on September 12, 1995, on Warner Bros. Records. The worldwide {{success of the}} band's previous album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), caused guitarist John Frusciante to become uncomfortable with their status, eventually quitting mid-tour in 1992.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute was a {{commercial}} disappointment despite producing three hit singles and reaching number four on the Billboard 200 chart. It sold {{fewer than half}} as many copies as Blood Sugar Sex Magik and received much less critical acclaim. Navarro was ultimately fired from the band in 1998 due to creative differences.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{life-threatening}} drug addiction that developed {{after leaving the}} Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante made a full recovery after a month of drug rehabilitation during {{the early months of}} 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the Red Hot Chili Peppers. After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio.|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute was {{the only}} album that guitarist Dave Navarro {{recorded}} with the band. His presence altered the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound considerably. It contains fewer sexual themes than previous records and explores darker subject matters, such as drug use, depression, anguish, and grief. It also re-integrated use of heavy metal guitar riffs. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis, who had resumed addictions to cocaine and heroin in 1994 after being sober {{for more than five}} years, approached his lyricism with a reflective outlook on drugs and their harsh effects.|$|E

25|$|Pythagoras of Samos (c. 560–480 BC) speculated {{about the}} notion of a spherical earth with a central fire at its core. He is {{sometimes}} incorrectly credited with the introduction of a model that divides a spherical earth into five zones: <b>one</b> <b>hot,</b> two temperate, and two cold—northern and southern. This idea, known as the zonal theory of climate, is more likely to have originated at the time of Aristotle.|$|E
25|$|The band, with Frusciante back on guitar, {{began writing}} new songs {{during the summer}} of 1998 in Flea's garage. He and Kiedis were less {{confident}} in writing the album after the disappointing results of <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute. Flea had also recently broken up with his girlfriend of two years, Marissa Pouw, causing him to enter a state of depression which was only lifted when his daughter, Clara, comforted him after several weeks of crying.|$|E
25|$|Flea {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by electronica during the writing and recording of Californication (1999) and he attempted to emulate this when writing bass lines for the album. Californication took {{less than two weeks}} to record; by contrast, <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute took over a year. When Californication was released on 8 June 1999 it received overwhelmingly positive critical reviews and sold fifteen million copies worldwide– more than Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The Chili Peppers played Woodstock 1999, with Flea playing completely naked– something he would do again at the Reading and Leeds Festivals the same year as well as several other Californication tour concerts.|$|E

25|$|An alpha Stirling {{contains}} two power pistons in separate cylinders, <b>one</b> <b>hot</b> and one cold. The hot cylinder is situated inside the high temperature heat exchanger {{and the cold}} cylinder is situated inside the low temperature heat exchanger. This type of engine has a high power-to-volume ratio but has technical problems because of the usually high temperature of the hot piston and the durability of its seals. In practice, this piston usually carries a large insulating head to move the seals away from the hot zone {{at the expense of}} some additional dead space. The crank angle has a major effect on efficiency and the best angle frequently has to be found experimentally. An angle of 90° frequently locks.|$|E
25|$|Months went by, {{and only}} {{small amounts of}} {{material}} were written leading Chad Smith to publicly announce that Kiedis was suffering from writer's block (something Kiedis denied). The rest of the recording was completed within the next month and their sixth album <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute was released in September 1995, featuring the band's new guitarist Dave Navarro. The album was met with mixed reviews and was a major departure from the band's funk-rock sound. The tour to support the album was also met with mixed results. Chad Smith broke his arm prior to {{the launch of the}} U.S. tour in 1995 so it was delayed until early 1996. Near the tour's end, Kiedis was involved in a motorcycle accident which left him with a broken arm. The tour ended with the band's final set being cut short due to a massive typhoon. 1997 was dubbed by the band the year of nothing.|$|E

He appears only in the first and fourth segments, and in a cameo in the third. In the first part, The Perfect Word, Beast and Belle have a bitter falling out at dinner when the Beast demands that Cogsworth open the windows to cool him down, despite the fact that he is the only <b>one</b> <b>hot</b> and there is a cold wind, and angrily strikes his servant, Webster, a long-tongued dictionary. Despite Lumiere and Cogsworth's pleas, Beast refuses to apologise for his behaviour, until Webster, Crane and LePlume forge a letter of apology from the Beast to Belle. All is settled, until the Beast realises that it was a forgery. He furiously banishes Webster, Crane and LePlume from the castle, but Belle brings them back from the woods, and the Beast soon learns to forgive them, as their intentions were good.|$|E

25|$|On the 14 and 16 July the Soviet Fleets landed more {{forces behind}} Dietl. LG 1's Ju 87s were shifted back {{to support the}} Mountain Corps. On 20 July the Soviet {{destroyer}} Stremitelnyy was sunk along with the patrol ship SKR-20/Shtil in the Kola Bay by LG 1. Just days later it was moved back to support the offensive at Salla. The unit was treated like a fire-brigade, rushing from <b>one</b> <b>hot</b> spot to another. IV(St)./LG 1's Ju 87s suffered {{more than any other}} Stuka unit in 1941, lsoing 25 of its 36 aircraft. Badly depleted, it could not support a breakthrough to isolate the Kola Peninsula, nor could it support the capture of Murmansk by Dietl. The advance halted 64 kilometres short of the Kirov railway, and three years of positional warfare set in. It did succeed in relieving pressure on the Mountain troops in the far north, when it was able to appear in strength. The greatest success of the Axis in the north came not against the Soviets, but the British Royal Air Force (RAF).|$|E
25|$|After a {{successful}} worldwide tour {{in support of}} Mother's Milk the band released their debut for Warners, 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magik which was hugely successful upon its release peaking at number three on the Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. It went on to be nominated and win several awards and is listed on many critics lists of the best albums of the year. Shortly into the tour for the album, Frusciante quit the band in 1992 and was replaced by Arik Marshall {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Marshall was fired following the tour and briefly replaced by Jesse Tobias who was let go in favor of Dave Navarro in 1994. With Navarro intact, the band would release 1995's <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute. Navarro too would end up being fired in 1998 following the tour to support the album and replaced with a returning John Frusciante. With Frusciante back, the band released 1999's Californication, their biggest selling album to date. That album was followed by 2002's By the Way and 2006's Stadium Arcadium, the band's first number one album in the United States. Frusciante again quit the band in 2008 and was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer in 2009. With Klinghoffer, the band released their tenth studio album (and Smith's seventh with the band), I'm with You in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The band {{began its}} tour for <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute in Europe on September 27, 1995 and played 16 shows. A US tour was to follow but was {{postponed}} after Chad Smith broke his wrist. The band considered carrying {{on with the}} tour even at one point considering Jack Irons {{as a replacement for}} Smith but there just was not enough time to rehearse with anyone new and the dates were rescheduled for early 1996. The band spent most of 1996 playing shows in the United States and Europe. By 1997, for the first time, the band cancelled many shows. Most of this was again due to problems within the band. Flea at that point was exhausted, tired of playing the same songs each night and was seriously talking about quitting the band while Kiedis had recently been involved in a motorcycle accident which left one arm in a sling and created yet another drug relapse due to his use of painkillers. Even Navarro was back to using drugs. 1997 saw the band playing just one show. This was at the very first Fuji Rock Festival on July 26, 1997. A massive typhoon hit that day but the band played anyway. They played through an 8-song set before having to cut the show short due to the storm. This would be the final show with Navarro and due to Flea's previous comments left many speculating if {{it was the end of}} the band.|$|E

25|$|After two {{temporary}} guitarists, Dave Navarro {{joined the}} group in 1993 and played on their subsequent album, <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than {{half as much as}} its predecessor. Navarro was fired from the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 16 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number-one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band in 2009 to focus on his solo career. Klinghoffer, who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, replaced him. The band's tenth studio album, I'm with You, was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries. The band released their eleventh studio album, The Getaway, in 2016. The album was produced by Danger Mouse, marking the first time since 1989's Mother's Milk that the Red Hot Chili Peppers had not worked with Rubin, and topped the charts in ten different countries.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{started off}} as a [...] "funk-punk band, driven by Kiedis's exuberant rapping and Flea's manic slap-bass" [...] (Sanneh, 2002). Guitarist John Frusciante left the band {{in the middle of}} a 1992 tour that {{promoted}} their critically acclaimed album Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It took over a year for the band to find a new guitarist with whom to record officially. Dave Navarro, formerly of Jane's Addiction, was invited to join the Chili Peppers after Arik Marshall, who had finished the remaining tour dates for Blood Sugar Sex Magik, was fired. Navarro influenced the band's ensuing album, <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute, by incorporating various elements of heavy metal and psychedelic rock, which was something that the Chili Peppers had not previously been notable for. Compared to Blood Sugar Sex Magik, <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute was a commercial disappointment, selling only half of what Blood Sugar Sex Magik had originally sold. Critics dismissed the album, claiming it was weak and unfocused. Shortly after the release of <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute, Navarro was fired due to internal differences.|$|E
500|$|During {{the tour}} for <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute, all {{songs from the}} album except “One Hot Minute”, “Tearjerker” and “Falling Into Grace” were played. Those three songs have never been played live by the band. As of 2016, “Pea” and “Aeroplane” are the only songs from <b>One</b> <b>Hot</b> Minute that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have played in full since Dave Navarro left the band. The band however did tease [...] "My Friends", “Let's Make Evil” and [...] "Walkabout" [...] during the I'm With You World Tour. Chad Smith was asked by fans during a February 2014 online {{interview}} about the band's reasons behind not performing the songs and he responded by saying [...] "We don't really feel that connected to that record anymore.
