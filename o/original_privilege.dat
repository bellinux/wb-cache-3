In 1643 Adam Zarzebski, the chief architect of King Władysław IV, mentioned a stone building on the Old Market Square as the seat of the Exchange, probably a part of the Old Town Hall. The securities trading minutes of the Warsaw merchants in the Old Town Hall have been recorded since 1757. The legal framework for the trading in securities was first codified by the Polish Sejm in 1775. As one of the first Polish corporations Kompania Manufaktur Welnianych issued its first 120 shares in 1768. The first Polish bonds were issued in 1782 by King Stanisław August.|$|R

50|$|Catania {{was under}} the Islamic emirate of Sicily until 1072, when it fell to the Normans of Roger I of Sicily. Subsequently, the city was ruled by a bishop-count. In 1194-1197 the city was sacked by German {{soldiers}} during after the conquest of the island by emperor Henry VI. In 1232 it rebelled to the former's son, Frederick II, who later built a massive castle, Castello Ursino and also made Catania a royal city, ending {{the dominance of the}} bishops. Catania {{was one of the main}} centers of the Sicilian Vespers revolt (1282) against the House of Anjou, and was the seat of the incoronation of the new Aragonese king of Sicily, Peter I. In the 14th century it gained importance as it was chosen by the Aragonese as a Parliament and Royal seat. Here, in 1347, it was signed the treaty of peace that ended the long War of the Vesper between Aragonese and Angevines. Catania lost its capital role when, in the early 15th century, Sicily was turned into a member of the Crown of Aragon, and kept its autonomy and <b>original</b> <b>privileges</b> specially during the period from 1282 to 1410.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we can find}} three {{privileges}} granted by Fernando III {{to the city of}} Ubeda, in the province of Jaen, after its conquest All of them are written in Latin, and, the <b>original</b> <b>privileges</b> are in the he Municipal Archive of that city. We publish here the Latin text and the Spanish translation. In the first document, dated in Valladolid the 14 th February 1235, the city of Ubeda is ceded and especially to sixty gentlemen of the council, a place called Olvera with all its possessions, {{on the banks of the}} river Guadalimar ???now a small hamlet about 20 i km. from Ubeda???. This was done in order that those gentlemen would build a castle here, and repopulate the area; in this way, they could the continuous attacks from the Moors who held a great part of High Andalucia, and had become very strong in the realm of Granada. The second document is like a supplement to the first one and it has the same political and socio-economic character. Dated in Burgos the 20 th August 1235, it establishes the close relationship in limits, pasture and tilling, among the councils of Ubeda., Santisteban del Puerto and Iznatoraf (all these cities are in the province of Jaen). The third privilege is of a juridical type, because its aim is just to fix and confirm the boundary stones in the limit between the councils of Ubeda and Baeza. This document is dated in Cordoba, the 7 th June 1236 and here, King Fernando III confirms the official limits of the lands which belonged to each one of those councils; it had been done before by the royal limits...|$|R

He took care, however, {{to stress the}} clauses about maintaining the Catholic religion outside the provinces of Holland and Zeeland, that the States General had attempted to [...] "fudge." [...] The States General then accepted him as the legitimate governor-general, and even agreed to pay the arrears of the royal troops (the refusal of which had arguably been {{the cause of the}} problems with the mutineers). This agreement was enshrined in the Edict of 1577. However, that Edict seemed to provide for a return to the status quo ante in which the States General would not be permanently in session. Holland and Zeeland protested against this arrangement and refused to submit to it. Neither would they give up the fortresses they had occupied, as provided for in the Pacification. The relations between the new governor-general and the States General also soon deteriorated. The States General even appointed their own governor-general, the Archduke Matthias. In 1579, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma, became royalist Governor General of the Netherlands and he immediately offered the southern Catholic nobles their <b>original</b> <b>privileges</b> back. With the Spanish army under control and their local liberties returned, the Walloon nobles and Southern provinces no longer had any reason to rebel. However, the Northern, Calvinist-controlled provinces were as unwilling to give up their religion as Philip II was to allow them to practice it. The French-speaking provinces thereupon concluded the Union of Arras, which the other provinces immediately answered with their own Union of Utrecht. The Habsburg Netherlands split up.|$|R

40|$|Philosophers and {{cognitive}} scientists have recently argued that perception is enactive (e. g., Varela, Thompson, 2 ̆ 6 Rosch 1991; Noe, 2004; Di Paolo, 2009). 1 To put it simply, perception is action-oriented. When I perceive something, I perceive it as actionable. That is, I perceive {{it as something}} I can reach, or not; something I can pick up, or not; something I can hammer with, or not, and so forth. Such affordances (Gibson, 1977, 1979) for potential actions (even if I am not planning to take action) shape the way that I actually perceive the world. One can find the roots {{of this kind of}} approach in the pragmatists (e. g., Dewey, 1896), but also in phenomenologists like Edmund Husser!, Martin Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Merleau-Ponty (1962) is most often cited in this regard, but Merleau-Ponty himself points back to Husserl 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of the 2 ̆ 2 I can 2 ̆ 2 in Jdeen II (Husser! 1952), and to his analysis of the correlation between kinesthesia and perception (1973 b; see Zahavi, 1994 and Gallagher 2 ̆ 6 Zahavi, 2008 for further discussion). With this enactive view in mind, we revisit Husserl 2 ̆ 7 s account of time-consciousness. In his analysis, the very basic temporal structure, protention-primal impression-retention, is said to characterize perception, as the most basic form of cognition as well as consciousness in general. As such, the temporal structure of perceptual consciousness should in some significant way reflect or enable its enactive character. Our question is this: if perception is enactive, then at a minimum, shouldn 2 ̆ 7 t its temporal structure be such that it allows for that enactive character? In {{the first part of this}} essay, we provide a brief account of Husserl 2 ̆ 7 s classical analysis. We then proceed to focus on the concept of primal impression by considering various objections that have been raised by Jacques Derrida and Michel Henry, who basically argue in opposite directions. Derrida emphasizes the relationality of time-consciousness and downplays the importance of the primal impression, whereas Henry emphasizes the irrelationality of time-consciousness and downplays the importance of protention and retention. In a further step, we consider some of Husserl 2 ̆ 7 s later manuscripts on time, where he revises his <b>original</b> <b>privileging</b> of the primal impression. In the final section, we turn to the question of an enactive temporal structure...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reflects}} on the Lettres sur l'Architechure of Viel de Saint-Maux, published in Paris in 1787. This period represents a crisis point at which classical architechure and a traditional means of relating-to-the-world had exhausted themselves. In the Lettres, St. -Maux <b>privileges</b> <b>original</b> agrarian societies who worship the natural force of fecundity and the agricultural bounty that results from it. He claims that this worship supplied the radical base for their iconographic and symbolic forms as applied to architecture. Viel de St. -Maux's privileging of the generative forces of nature as a site for sacred imagining and ritual constructions of the agricultural environment belie a relation to the methodology and epistemology of Natural History as formulated by the Comte de Buffon. Viel de Saint-Maux sought to resist the threat of an overweening rationality by valuing the wonderment cast by the discoveries of Science. He put his faith in natural science and applied this same compulsion to the ancient primitives who, he believed, knew divinely how to propitiate Nature and its fecundity. Fecundity and Agriculture become metaphors for cultural harmony, enlightenment and a re-fusion {{of the mystery of}} vitality into everyday life...|$|R
40|$|Critical {{evaluations}} of audio mash-ups and remixes tend to congregate around two poles. On the one hand, these often clever recombinations of recorded music are celebrated as innovative and creative interventions {{in the material}} of bland commodity culture. On the other hand, they are often reviled as derivative, inauthentic, and illegal because they do nothing more than appropriate and reconfigure the intellectual property of others. This essay does not side with either position but identifies and critiques the common understanding and fundamental assumptions that make these two, opposed positions possible in the first place. The investigation of this matter {{is divided into two}} main parts. The first considers the traditional understanding of technologically enabled reproduction and the often unquestioned value it invests in the concept of originality. It does so by beginning with a somewhat unlikely source, Plato's Phaedrus—a dialogue that, it is argued, originally articulates the original concept of originality that both determines and is reproduced in the theories and practices of sound recording. The second part of the essay demonstrates how the audio mash-up deliberately intervenes in this tradition, advancing a fundamental challenge to the <b>original</b> understanding and <b>privilege</b> of originality. In making this argument, however, the essay does not endeavor to position the mash-up as anything unique or innovative. Instead, it demonstrates how mash-ups, true to their thoroughl...|$|R

Undoubtedly every translation must be more or less defective, and we by no means value our work so highly as that we would set aside one more perfectly executed by another hand.

We might indeed have clothed many passages in more elegant German, but, without being in bondage to words, we have been governed throughout by the thought that the faithful rendering of the original text outweighs every other consideration; and the more so because we believe with the very fullest conviction the divine inspiration of the holy scriptures as the revelation of the infinite wisdom of God, and the expression of His gracious character in Jesus Christ. But since no one is able to grasp the whole expanse of this revelation, and often a meaning beyond the comprehension of the translator lies hidden in a sentence, which would be lost in a free translation but may be found in a more literal one, through deeper teaching of the Holy Spirit—it is evidently necessary to reproduce the original text as in a mirror." ...|$|R
40|$|In all fifty United States and the District of Columbia, police Requests for Re-examination (RRE) {{concerning}} fitness to driver {{are accepted}} by licensing agencies. This study assessed licensing outcomes of senior drivers, ≥ 75 years of age, who had RREs {{submitted to the}} Medical Advisory Board (MAB) of a Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration from March 2005 through April 2007. RRE traffic event information (including crashed, did not crash), driver demographic information, initial MAB recommendations (suspension vs no suspension), driving occupational therapists assessments, and drivers’ pursuit of continued licensure were entered into a database. During the period of study, 475 RREs were referred to the MAB. The percent of referred senior drivers (n= 240, 50. 4 %) {{was similar to that}} of younger drivers (n= 235, 49. 5 %). A higher percentage of senior drivers retired from driving compared to younger drivers; being, 57. 1 % vs 23. 8 % (p <. 01), respectively. Further analyses limited to the 240 senior drivers found: 139 (57. 9 %) were men, 150 (62. 5 %) were 75 – 84 years of age, 119 (49. 5 %) were noted to be disoriented at the traffic scene, 141 (58. 8 %) were involved in a crash, and 127 (52. 9 %) were initially suspended as the result of MAB review. The following factors were significantly related to retiring from driving, initial MAB suspension and greater age. Of the 127 drivers who were initially suspended, 82 (64. 6 %) retired from driving, and 45 (35. 4 %) pursued further licensure (p < 0. 01). In contrast, the percentage of non-suspended drivers who did or did not pursue further licensure was similar; being 48. 7 % vs 51. 3 %. Among drivers ≥ 85 years of age, 68. 9 % retired from driving, compared with 50 % of the drivers who were 75 to 84 years of age (p < 0. 01) While not statisically significant, higher percentages of driving retirement were noted for the following: sex - a greater percentage of men compared to women (61. 9 % vs 49. 5 %); confusion at the traffic scene (confused, 57. 1 % vs non-confused, 42. 9 %); and crash involvement (56. 7 % who crashed, retired vs 43. 3 % of those who did not crash, retired). Overall, the most important finding {{of this study is that}} as a result of police referral, only one-fifth (20. 4 %) of senior drivers 75 years of age or older, continued to maintain their driving privilege. However, only 40 drivers (16. 7 %) retained their <b>original</b> driving <b>privilege</b> without added restrictions. The data suggest that senior drivers who are not medically fit to drive may be identified by police referrals to a licensing agency. Driving occupational therapy assessments and training, and additional driving restrictions are recommended to facilitate continuation of the driving privilege for some drivers...|$|R
40|$|I {{examine the}} role of context as a rhetorical trope. As a rhetorical trope, context tends to fix complex {{practices}} in single places, which allows for {{the celebration of the}} authentic or <b>original.</b> Further, it <b>privileges</b> production while masking complex practices of circulation and consumption while simultaneously constraining seemingly infinite possibilities into finite frames that then become static and naturalized. These practices need to be examined in order to understand how power is being enacted via the trope of context for the purposes of control and limitation. I argue throughout that these power dynamics need to be addressed [...] that the ethics of context need to consider who or what is empowered, who or what is disempowered, and decide whether such a situational power dynamic is acceptable or should be changed. I move through the dissertation by first presenting the metaphors of context [...] maps, frames, and landscapes [...] discussing the ways in which each of these metaphors control and limit context and therefore control and limit the text. I then analyze the textual and rhetorical context traditions to illuminate the ways in which these two prevalent traditions assume a static and constant original context to which a text belongs. The constant appeal to an origin, I argue, invests a text or artifact with historical aura, which is often used to obscure and limit other critical engagements with a text thus controlling a text's or artifact's possible meanings and transformative power. Following this exploration, I turn my attention to contexts as consumable commodities. I argue that contexts as rhetorical tropes are divorced from the dialectical process of meaning making from a text and can therefore exist as its own entity. As such, contexts can be marketed to and consumed by people. An ethics of context, I conclude, would challenge the god term that context has become in order to expose the power and ideological control that is exerted via a deployment of rhetorical contexts. Such an ethics would address, again, the dialectical formation of texts and contexts [...] texts define contexts; contexts define texts; they are inseparable...|$|R
40|$|Nearly {{a century}} and a half after its adoption, debate {{continues}} to rage over the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantees of basic rights. Of the three clauses in the second sentence of Section One, the latter two (the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses) loom very large in modern Supreme Court decisions, while the first (the Privileges or Immunities Clause) is of minimal importance, having been invoked only once to strike down a state law. Originalists—those who hold that the Constitution should be interpreted according to its original meaning—have often deplored this state of affairs. Many have argued that from the perspective of <b>original</b> meaning, the <b>Privileges</b> or Immunities Clause is not the least important but rather “the most important Clause in the Amendment. ” On this view, many of the constitutional rights today associated with the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses were originally understood to be protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause. For example, many originalists have criticized the substantive due process doctrine as oxymoronic. Any protection of substantive rights, they insist, must be found in the Privileges or Immunities Clause, as the Due Process Clause is about procedure only. Originalists have also argued that the Privileges or Immunities Clause, not the Due Process Clause, is the most plausible vehicle for the application of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the states. Likewise, many originalists have maintained that the Privileges or Immunities Clause, not the Equal Protection Clause, is the most important general mandate of legislative equal treatment, as the Equal Protection Clause requires only equality in the provision of the protective functions of government (which are principally executive and judicial), not in all legislative classifications. The Supreme Court’s current narrow reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause dates back to its very first decision interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment, the Slaughter-House Cases, handed down only five years after the Amendment was ratified. In McDonald v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court declined an invitation to overrule Slaughter-House and restore what the plaintiffs contended was the original meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause. This Article argues that the intractable ambiguities surrounding the historical meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment made the Court’s retreat from originalism in McDonald all but inevitable. This is due to the Amendment’s ambiguous text and history, resulting in no consensus among scholars and historians regarding the original meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause and hence of the Fourteenth Amendment as a whole. This Article focuses on the most prominent recent originalist interpretations, divided into two broad methodological groups: Historical Originalism and Abstract Originalism. This Article concludes that the absence of a clear original meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause (or of Section One as a whole) is a strong reason for rejecting originalism as a theory of constitutional interpretation...|$|R
