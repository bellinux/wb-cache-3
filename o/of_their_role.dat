5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>role.</b> The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results {{in a range of}} dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from North Africa, No. 6 Commando {{became part of}} the 1st Special Service Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat. The grouping of the commandos into brigades underneath the divisional-sized Special Service Group headquarters was part of the general reorganisation that took place in late 1943 as the evolution <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>role</b> from raiding to assault infantry was formalised. This saw a change in the individual unit establishments, with the addition of organic transport assets, as well as an increase in the allocation of indirect and direct fire support weapons at commando level. Further support units were added at brigade level, including administration, transport, logistics and signals.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 {{a militant}} named Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga {{broke out of}} prison. He remobilised local Mai Mai militias and formed the Mai Mai Kata Katanga to achieve secession. Conflict in the region {{dramatically}} worsened, and in mid-2012 several UN humanitarian agencies began allocating numerous resources to help the civilian population. The United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (known as MONUSCO under its French name) provided logistical and advisory assistance to local government officials, police, and the military. Many Katangese people hoped that the UN would, in light <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>role</b> in ending the original secession, help resolve the situation. Kyungu {{and many of his}} forces surrendered in October 2016 to seek a peaceful solution.|$|E

5|$|The player {{character}} is a prisoner being led to an Imperial execution in Helgen. Alduin unexpectedly interrupts the procession, destroying the town before the player can be executed. The player escapes in the chaos and journeys {{to the city of}} Whiterun to request aid against the dragon threat. After slaying a different dragon that attacks nearby, the player absorbs the dragon's soul which grants them the ability to perform a shout. The city's guards inform the player that they must be Dragonborn. The player is summoned to meet with the Greybeards, an order of monks who live in seclusion. The Greybeards train the player in using shouts and inform the player <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>role</b> in stopping Alduin. The player learns that Skyrim's civil war is the last in a sequence of prophetic events foretold by the Elder Scrolls, which also predicted the return of Alduin.|$|E

Qualitative data sources informed our analysis of the ways people made sense <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> in a mentoring relationship and provided participants' perspectives on involvement in group conversations about mentoring. Implications include: (1) mentoring as jumping ina; (2) conscious collaboration in learning to teach; and (3) mutual mentoring...|$|R
25|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOC) - VOCs are a well-known outdoor air pollutant. They are categorized as either methane (CH4) or non-methane (NMVOCs). Methane {{is an extremely}} efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced global warming. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>role</b> in creating ozone and prolonging the life of methane in the atmosphere. This effect varies depending on local air quality. The aromatic NMVOCs benzene, toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged exposure. 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound often associated with industrial use.|$|E
25|$|During complex situations, {{communication}} between health professionals {{must be at}} its best. There are several techniques, tools, and strategies used to improve communication. Any team should have a clear purpose and each member should be aware <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>role</b> and be involved accordingly. To increase the quality of {{communication between}} people involved, regular feedback should be provided. Strategies such as briefings allow the team to be set on their purpose and ensure that members not only share the goal but also the process they will follow to achieve it. Briefings reduce interruptions, prevent delays and build stronger relationships, resulting in a strong patient safety environment.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) is {{a storage}} module {{attached}} to the Tranquility node. The three NASA Space Shuttle MPLM cargo containers—Leonardo, Raffaello and Donatello—were built for NASA in Turin, Italy by Alcatel Alenia Space, now Thales Alenia Space. The MPLMs were provided to NASA's ISS programme by Italy (independent <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>role</b> as a member state of ESA) and {{are considered to be}} US elements. In a bartered exchange for providing these containers, the US gave Italy research time aboard the ISS out of the US allotment in addition to that which Italy receives as a member of ESA.

500|$|Carpentier's {{portrayal}} of Christophe {{has been considered}} [...] "hollow" [...] and one-sided, representing an archetypal tyrant at his most deteriorated state, seen only {{through the eyes of}} Ti Noel. This goes against the principle of historical accuracy, which should present a faithful portrait of society with characters who are fully conscious <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>role</b> in history. Carpentier portrays Henri Christophe, like most leaders, as a pompous fool, since the cycle of history continues regardless of his presence: his influence on the lives of people like Ti Noel is minimal. On the other hand, Christophe has also been seen as a representation of man's potential, rising from cook to soldier to king, reaching extremes of extravagance that exceed that of the previous French rulers, and ultimately falling pathetically.|$|E
