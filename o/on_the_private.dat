5|$|Surf {{damage was}} {{reported}} throughout the Hawaiian islands. 120people were treated for injuries, though most were minor. An estimated 500people throughout Hawaii were left homeless {{due to the}} hurricane. Damage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> island of Niihau was severe. An aerial survey indicated 20 homes were destroyed and 160 were damaged, indicating that the hurricane affected {{nearly all of the}} island's 226 residents. Reportedly no one was injured on Niihau. At the time, Hurricane Iwa was the costliest storm to hit the state of Hawaii, with damage totaling $312million (1982USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|There remains some {{uncertainty}} {{whether the}} source test or nature test {{ought to be}} the determining test. It appears, though, that the impact of Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be the determining factor. It is also worth noting that the effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers. Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> law side of the public–private divide, making the decision not amenable to judicial review.|$|E
5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan {{was that}} he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of The New Yorker, although Narayan's writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the context of his subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} the frieze may be sought in the Attic relief {{sculpture}} of the late fifth century; this resonance also may be discovered to some degree in the public works of the Hephaisteion frieze and the Nike Athena balustrade, where the imagery of the seated deities and the sandal-binder respectively, likely owes a debt to the Parthenon. There also are traces found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> commissions of grave stelae from the period, for example, the “cat stele” from Aegina bears a distinct similarity to figures N135–6. As does the Hermes of the four-figure relief known from a Roman copy. Later classicizing art of the Hellenistic and Roman eras also looked to the frieze for inspiration as attested by the Lycian Sarcophagus of Sidon, Phoenicia, the Ara Pacis Augustae, the Gemma Augustea, and many pieces of the Hadrianic generation.|$|E
