5|$|The median plates (m, m') {{are also}} sclerites {{that are not}} so {{definitely}} differentiated as specific plates as are the three principal axillaries, but nevertheless they are important elements of the flexor apparatus. They lie in the median area of the wing base distal to {{the second and third}} axillaries and are separated from each other by an <b>oblique</b> <b>line</b> (bf) which forms a prominent convex fold during flexion of the wing. The proximal plate (m) is usually attached to the distal arm of the third axillary and perhaps should be regarded {{as a part of the}} latter. The distal plate (m') is less constantly present as a distinct sclerite and may be represented by a general sclerotization of the base of the mediocubital field of the wing. When the veins of this region are distinct at their bases, they are associated with the outer median plate.|$|E
25|$|The {{broad and}} narrow {{portions}} above alluded to {{are separated by}} an <b>oblique</b> <b>line,</b> which runs from the axillary border, downward and backward, to meet the elevated ridge: to it is attached a fibrous septum which separates the Teres muscles from each other.|$|E
25|$|Ramus {{fractures}} {{are said}} to involve a region inferiorly bounded by an <b>oblique</b> <b>line</b> extending from the lower third molar (wisdom tooth) region to the posteroinferior attachment of the masseter muscle, and {{which could not be}} better classified as either condylar or coronoid fractures.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 10 mm. The forewings are deep olive buff with black reticulations forming <b>oblique</b> <b>lines</b> from the costa and apex towards the lower termen. The hindwings are citrine drab with faded blackish reticulations (a net-like pattern) forming <b>oblique</b> <b>lines</b> from the inner margin towards the tornus.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{attempts}} to understand constructional apraxia have {{moved away from}} anatomical functions towards a cognitive neuropsychological approach. Both adults and children alike experience difficulty reproducing <b>oblique</b> <b>lines.</b> Some feel that these deficiencies {{may be attributed to}} planning since it is easier to plan horizontal and vertical <b>lines</b> than <b>oblique</b> <b>lines.</b> Research indicates that both adults and children are more able to draw squares than diamonds, although as children grow into adults they are more accurately able to depict diamonds.|$|R
25|$|The {{angle of}} the {{mandible}} refers to the angle created by {{the arrangement of the}} body of the mandible and the ramus. Angle fractures are defined as those that involve a triangular region bounded by the anterior border of masseter muscle and an <b>oblique</b> <b>line</b> extending from the lower third molar (wisdom tooth) region to the posteroinferior attachment of the masseter muscle.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{symptoms}} include pain, refusing to walk or bear weight and limping -bruising and deformity are absent. On clinical examination, {{there can be}} warmth and swelling over the fracture area, as well as pain on bending the foot upwards (dorsiflexion). The initial radiographical images may be inconspicuous (a faint <b>oblique</b> <b>line)</b> and often even completely normal. After 1–2 weeks however, callus formation develops. The condition can be mistaken for osteomyelitis, transient synovitis or even child abuse. Contrary to CAST fractures, non-accidental injury typically affect the upper two-thirds or midshaft of the tibia.|$|E

40|$|This {{developmental}} {{study was}} designed to assess the accuracy with which patterns of straight lines of various orientations were copied {{as a function of the}} degree of motor planning required. Six-, 7 -, 8 -, and 10 -year-old children, and adults, copied one of three types of patterns in both oblique, and horizontal-vertical orientations. The findings support those reported previously (Broderick & Laszlo, 1987 1988), and extend their validity to a variety of patterns comprising these lines. The copying performance for oblique patterns was less accurate than for others. Increasing motor planniing demands affected the accuracy of obliquely orientated patterns detrimentally, without significantly affecting horizontal-vertical orientated patterns, and there was a gradual developmental improvement for patterns comprising <b>oblique</b> <b>lines.</b> Connected units of <b>oblique</b> <b>lines</b> were more accurately copied than discrete units of <b>oblique</b> <b>lines</b> for most age levels. Implications for the teaching of handwriting skills are considered...|$|R
500|$|The phalanx {{formation}} used by Greek armies had {{a distinct}} tendency to veer {{to the right}} during battle, [...] "because fear makes each man do his best to shelter his unarmed side with the shield of the man next him on the right". Traditionally, a phalanx therefore lined up for battle with the elite troops on the right flank to counter this tendency. Thus, in the Spartan phalanx at Leuctra, Cleombrotus and the elite 'Spartiates' were on the right, while the less experienced Peloponnesian allies were on the left. However, needing to counter the Spartans' numerical advantage, Epaminondas implemented two tactical innovations. Firstly, he took the best troops in the army, and arranged them 50 ranks deep (as opposed to the normal 812 ranks) on the left wing, opposite Cleombrotus and the Spartans, with Pelopidas and the Sacred Band on the extreme left flank.* Davis, 100 Decisive Battles, 24; Gabriel, The Great Armies of Antiquity, 182183 [...] Secondly, recognizing, {{that he could not}} have matched the width of the Peloponnesian phalanx (even before the deepening the left flank), he abandoned all attempts to do so. [...] Instead, placing the weaker troops on the right flank, he [...] "instructed them to avoid battle and withdraw gradually during the enemy's attack". The tactic of the deep phalanx had been anticipated by Pagondas, another Theban general, who used a 25 man deep formation at the Battle of Delium.* Kagan, The Archidamian War, 283 However, the reversing of the position of the elite troops, and an <b>oblique</b> <b>line</b> of attack were innovations; it seems that Epaminondas was therefore responsible for the military tactic of refusing one's flank.* Davis, 100 Decisive Battles, 24; Gabriel, The Great Armies of Antiquity, 182; Hanson, The Soul of Battle ...|$|E

Fibres at the back of the muscle cross the mandible, some being inserted into the bone below the <b>oblique</b> <b>line,</b> others into the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the lower part of the face.

2500|$|Ouranosaurus had a skull [...] long. The {{head was}} very {{elongated}} and flat, {{and carried a}} much longer snout than its relative Iguanodon: this rostrum was not curved but straight, off-set {{from the back of}} the skull in an <b>oblique</b> <b>line.</b> The snout was toothless and covered in a horny sheath during life, forming a very wide beak together with a comparable sheath on the short predentary bone at the extreme front of the lower jaws. However, after a rather large diastema with the beak, there were large batteries of cheek teeth on the sides of the jaws: the gaps between the teeth crowns were filled by the points of a second generation of replacement teeth, the whole forming a continuous surface. Contrary to the situation with some related species, a third generation of erupted teeth was lacking. There were twenty-two tooth positions in both lower and upper jaw, for a total of eighty-eight.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 97-102 mm. Females {{are larger}} than males. It is a very variable species in terms of size and degree of development of the <b>oblique</b> <b>lines</b> of the forewing upperside.

The abdomen has three dorsal lines, the median line is usually the most distinct but may be absent and the lateral lines are sometimes reduced to rows of dots. The forewing upperside is either {{with or without a}} dark cloud distal to discal cell. There are seven <b>oblique</b> <b>lines</b> present of which the third is the heaviest.|$|R

His copper-colored, repulsive visage compelled fear; it breathed vindictiveness and malignity. A singular action of his was that he always, in what must have been his arrogant vanity, turned his profile to those who watched him, and it was a remarkable one; it sloped in an <b>oblique</b> <b>line</b> from the top of his forehead to his protruding chin, resembling somewhat the carved bowl of his pipe, which was of flint and a famed inheritance from his ancestors. From it he took his name. One solitary eagle plume, its tip stained vermilion, stuck from his scalp-lock. It slated backward on a line with his profile.|$|E
