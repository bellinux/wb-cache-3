50|$|In humans {{treated with}} <b>Oprelvekin</b> {{on a daily}} base a twofold {{increase}} in fibrinogen levels occurred. Healthy volunteers displayed an increase in von-Willebrand-factor (vWf) activity. Isolated molecules formed under <b>Oprelvekin</b> {{were found to have}} exact the same multimere structure as the 'normal' factor and were therefore fully functioning. These increases in coagulation factors may {{contribute to the development of}} stroke (see under side-effects), but a precise association cannot be made at this stage.|$|E
50|$|Interleukin 11 is {{manufactured}} using recombinant DNA {{technology and}} is marketed as a protein therapeutic called <b>oprelvekin,</b> {{for the prevention}} of severe thrombocytopenia in cancer patients.|$|E
5000|$|Patients {{with severe}} or decompensated heart failure {{should not be}} treated, because <b>Oprelvekin</b> may cause {{excessive}} fluid retention with edema and cardiac decompensation. Patients with compensated heart disease should be treated with caution and under permanent clinical supervision.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oprelvekin</b> is {{recombinant}} interleukin eleven (IL-11), a thrombopoietic {{growth factor}} that directly stimulates {{the proliferation of}} hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocyte progenitor cells and induces megakaryocyte maturation resulting in increased platelet production. It is marketed under the trade name Neumega.|$|E
5000|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>Oprelvekin</b> {{has not been}} systematically studied in patients receiving chemotherapy regimes of more than 5 days duration/each cycle or in those regimes containing agents that induce delayed thrombocytopenia (e.g. nitrosoureas, mitomycin C. Neumega should not be given in these cases.|$|E
5000|$|IL-11 is a {{multifunctional}} cytokine first {{isolated in}} 1990 from bone marrow-derived stromal cells. It {{is a key}} regulator of multiple events in hematopoiesis, most notably the stimulation of megakaryocyte maturation. [...] It is also known under the names adipogenesis inhibitory factor (AGIF) and <b>oprelvekin.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{studies with}} rats and rabbits treated chronically, <b>Oprelvekin</b> showed embryo- and fetotoxicity (early death of embryos and {{reduction}} of number of fetus, fetal malformations etc.). There is no sufficient human data available. Pregnant women {{should only be}} treated, if the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the unborn.|$|E
5000|$|In {{animal studies}} <b>Oprelvekin</b> also has non-hematopoetic activities. This {{includes}} {{the regulation of}} intestinal epithelium growth (enhanced healing of gastrointestinal lesions), the inhibition of adipogenesis, the induction of acute phase protein synthesis (e.g., fibrinogen), and inhibition of macrophageal released pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, pathologic changes, some also seen in humans, have been noticed: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Oprelvekin</b> is {{produced}} in Escherichia coli (E. coli) by recombinant DNA technology. The protein has a molecular mass of approximately 19,000 g/mol, and is non-glycosylated. The polypeptide is 177 amino acids in length (the natural IL-11 has 178). This alteration has not resulted in measurable differences in bioactivity either in vitro or in vivo.|$|E
50|$|In {{a variety}} of {{clinical}} studies upon which FDA approval is based, Neumega showed effectivity in reducing thrombocytopenia in oncologic patients treated with myelosuppressant chemotherapeutic drugs as measured by significantly decreased need of platelet transfusions. Neumega is manufactured and sold by Wyeth. The drug is formulated in single-use vials containing 5 mg of <b>oprelvekin</b> (specific activity approximately 8 Ã— 106 Units/mg) as a sterile, lyophilized powder. The FDA approved the drug in 1997.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oprelvekin</b> {{also has}} caused quite often fluid retention, ranging from {{peripheral}} edema (approximately 40% of patients) to dyspnea and full developed lung edema {{with or without}} cardiac decompensation (see contraindications and precautions). These symptoms have led to some deaths. Fluid retention my also lead to dilutional anemia (in 10 to 15% of patients). Hypokalemia my also result. Symptoms of fluid retention have been observed more often in patients following myeloablative chemotherapy (see contraindications). Severe arrhythmias (atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation) as well as fatal cardiac arrest have also been seen {{which may or may}} be not attributed to fluid retention/increased volume. Isolated cases of stroke have been noted, those patients with previous transient ischemic attacks or partial/minor strokes may be at particular risk.|$|E
40|$|Thrombocytopenia in {{patients}} with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major problem. The pathophysiology is multifactorial, with auto-immunogenicity, direct bone marrow suppression, hypersplenism, decreased production of thrombopoietin and therapeutic adverse effect all contributing to thrombocytopenia in different measures. The greatest challenge {{in the care of}} chronic HCV patients with thrombocytopenia is the difficulty in initiating or maintaining IFN containing anti-viral therapy. Although at present, it is possible to avoid this challenge {{with the use of the}} sole Direct Antiviral Agents (DAAs) as the primary treatment modality, thrombocytopenia remains of particular interest, especially in cases of advanced liver disease. The increased risk of bleeding with thrombocytopenia may also impede the initiation and maintenance of different invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. While eradication of HCV infection itself is the most practical strategy for the remission of thrombocytopenia, various pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic options, which vary in their effectiveness and adverse effect profiles, are available. Sustained increase in platelet count is seen with splenectomy and splenic artery embolization, in contrast to only transient rise with platelet transfusion. However, their routine use is limited by complications. Different thrombopoietin analogues have been tried. The use of synthetic thrombopoietins, such as recombinant human TPO and pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMDGF), has been hampered by the development of neutralizing antibodies. Thrombopoietin-mimetic agents, in particular, eltrombopag and romiplostim, have been shown to be safe and effective for HCV-related thrombocytopenia in various studies, and they increase platelet count without eliciting any immunogenicity Other treatment modalities including newer TPO analogues- AMG- 51, PEG-TPOmp and AKR- 501, recombinant human IL- 11 (rhIL- 11, <b>Oprelvekin),</b> recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO), danazol and L-carnitine have shown promising early result with improving thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia in chronic HCV infection remain a major problem, however the recent change in DAAs without IFN, as the frontline therapy for HCV, permit to avoid the dilemmas associated with initiating or maintaining IFN based anti-viral therapy...|$|E
