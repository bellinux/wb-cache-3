5|$|On 23 October 1940, the German Military Administration adopted anti-Jewish {{legislation}} {{for the first}} time. The new laws, similar to the Nuremberg Laws adopted in Germany in 1935, coincided with the adoption of similar legislation in the Netherlands and in France. The laws of 28 October forbade Jews to practice certain professions (including the civil service) and forced Jews to register with their local municipality. On the same date, the German administration announced a definition <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> regarded as Jewish. Jewish-owned shops or businesses had to be marked by a sign in the window, and Jewish-owned economic assets had to be registered. From June 1940, a list of Jewish businesses had already been drawn up in Liège.|$|E
5|$|The Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship was {{originally}} {{created in the}} late 1960s or early 1970s by Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL; who would change their name to CMLL around 1990) as a secondary title to the Mexican National Tag Team Championship, which was the promotion's top tag team title at the time. Records of champions from that era are sparse with no records <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> the first champion; nor are there any records of exactly when the title was abandoned in the 1980s. Due to sparse record keeping of local wrestling in Mexico between the 1960s and early 1980s no clear history exists from that time, it has been verified that Los Villanos (Villano I and Villano II), Kung Fu and Kato Kung Lee, and the team of Dios Rojo and Dios Negro all held the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship due to references to the teams defending the championship at an EMLL show.|$|E
5|$|There are {{conflicting}} accounts <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} choice {{for the role of}} the itinerant prostitute, Suzy. By some accounts, Rodgers and Hammerstein attempted to get Julie Andrews, only to find that she had just signed a two-year contract to appear in a musical by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, tentatively titled My Lady Liza. Andrews's role, as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady, would launch her to stardom. Another candidate was Janet Leigh, whom Rodgers admired greatly, but the actress proved to be unavailable. The producers settled on Judy Tyler, auditioned after Rodgers spotted her on television while watching The Howdy Doody Show, in which she appeared as Princess Summerfall Winterspring.|$|E

5|$|While {{both the}} Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that persons {{with three or}} more Jewish {{grandparents}} would be classed as being Jewish and those with only one (Mischlinge of the second degree) would not, a debate arose as {{to the status of}} persons with two Jewish grandparents (Mischlinge of the first degree). The NSDAP, especially its more radical elements, wanted the laws to apply to Mischlinge of both the first and second degree. For this reason Hitler continued to stall, and did not make a decision until early November 1935. His final ruling was that persons with three Jewish grandparents were classed as Jewish; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse. The supplementary decree outlining the definition <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date. Jews were no longer German citizens and did {{not have the right to}} vote. Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote in Reichstag elections or the Anschluss. Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out of their jobs on this date. A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state-regulated professions such as medicine and education.|$|E
5|$|Within {{some of the}} {{destroyed}} suburbs, {{a limited}} postal system between various Robinson groups was established. Dawid Landau {{had served as a}} bodyguard to the courier of the Polish government in exile, Jan Karski, while Karski secretly entered the ghetto to gather information for a report on the extermination of Polish Jews by Nazi Germany for the Western allies, in 1943. Later, Landau fought in both of the Warsaw uprising as part of Żydowski Związek Wojskowy (Jewish Military Union, ŻZW) and afterward decided to stay in the ruins. In his memoirs he reports that the post functioned through the use of empty electrical socket boxes. Various groups would leave notes for others informing them <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> alive and in hiding, news from the front that had been obtained, as well as requests for special forms of assistance. According to Landau, the most common pleas were for doctors or other forms of medical help.|$|E

25|$|The {{effective}} {{assimilation of}} Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent into their Gentile (and Christian) surroundings made matters {{much more complicated}} than the Nazis had anticipated; widespread corruption, and lack of ethical moorings among many Nazi leaders, frequently gave way to bribery, extortion, and other subterfuges concerning documentation <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was,</b> or was not, a Jew.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{collaborative}} nature of sculpture in this period, {{it is difficult}} to determine exactly how much of this innovation can be credited to Unkei personally. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> responsible, this new style was adopted by Unkei's followers and descendants, including his sons Tankei, Kōun, Kōben, and Kōshō, and carried on until the mid-Kamakura period. Kōben and Kōshō especially would take Unkei's style to new extremes.|$|E

25|$|The Nazi antisemitic program quickly {{expanded}} {{beyond mere}} speech. Starting in 1933, repressive laws were passed against Jews, {{culminating in the}} Nuremberg Laws which removed most {{of the rights of}} citizenship from Jews, using a racial definition based on descent, rather than any religious definition <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> a Jew. Sporadic violence against the Jews became widespread with the Kristallnacht riots, which targeted Jewish homes, businesses and places of worship, killing hundreds across Germany and Austria.|$|E

25|$|In 1769, Cambodia was {{in turmoil}} again, {{due to the}} rivalry for the throne by two royal brothers, the elder <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> King Ramraja (Non). Having {{suffered}} defeat {{at the hands of}} his brother (Ton) who was aided by Annamite troops, he sought shelter in Siam. Prince Ton proclaimed himself as King Narairaja. This struggle afforded an opportunity to King Taksin to resuscitate Thai suzerainty over Cambodia as in the days of Ayutthaya. An army was dispatched to assist the ex-King Ramraja to regain his power, but met with no success.|$|E
25|$|People {{removing}} {{items from}} the shoreline for their own use could have been faced with prosecution, according to police at the time. Eight extra police were brought over to Scilly from mainland Cornwall to assist, taking notes <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> removing goods.

Later the Empress Mother Thượng Dương and her 76 imperial maids were imprisoned in the Thượng Dương palace; they ultimately were killed and buried in the tomb of Lê Thánh Tông.|$|E

25|$|World War I is {{especially}} memorable in Falls Church history for knitting together {{the last vestiges of}} separation left {{from an earlier}} war. At the close of the American Civil War the northern-born and southern-born residents of Falls Church each kept to themselves, with long memories <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> who. This ended during World War I, as the village formed a home defense league, the Colonial Rifles, which was active throughout the war. The ensuing sense of patriotism united these two groups in a sense of neighborliness and common cause they had not shared since 1860.|$|E
25|$|Van Voorst {{states that}} {{although}} the question <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> referred to in various points in the Talmud remains subject to debate among scholars, {{in the case of}} Sanhedrin 43a (generally considered the most important reference to Jesus in rabbinic literature), Jesus can be confirmed as the subject of the passage, not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it, and {{there is little doubt that}} it refers to the death of Jesus of Nazareth. Christopher M. Tuckett states that if it is accepted that death narrative of Sanhedrin 43a refers to Jesus of Nazareth then it provides evidence of Jesus' existence and execution.|$|E
25|$|The final college {{football}} {{game of the}} marathon bowl season that had taken three weeks and had thirty-one prior contests was the Tostitos 2007 BCS National Championship Game, played on January 8 at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

Florida settled the issue <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> the champion of NCAA Division I Bowl Subdivision football. Ohio State opened {{the game with a}} 93-yard TD return by Ted Ginn, Jr., who injured his foot in the mass celebration following the play and did not return.
