50|$|Rabbits {{such as the}} Angora, American Fuzzy Lop, and Jersey Wooly produce wool. However, {{since the}} American Fuzzy Lop and Jersey Wooly are both dwarf breeds, only the much larger Angora breeds such as the English Angora, Satin Angora, Giant Angora, and French Angoras are used for {{commercial}} wool production. Their long fur is sheared, combed, or plucked (gently pulling loose hairs from the body during molting) and then spun into yarn {{used to make a}} variety of products. Angora sweaters can be purchased in many clothing stores and is generally mixed with other types of wool. In 2010, 70% <b>of</b> <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit</b> wool was produced in China.

40|$|Abstract Angora rabbit fiber, {{a luxury}} animal hair fiber is {{obtained}} from Angora rabbit. It has some distinct properties like warmness, fineness, whiteness and softness; however its utilization {{in the conventional}} textile clothing is restricted due to its scale structure and ladder type medulla. Medulla, an air occupied area {{in the middle of}} the fiber reduces the flexibility and scales are responsible for reducing inter-fiber cohesion during mechanical processing of hair. Due to these demerits, Angora rabbit hair is generally used to develop some specialty products through traditional hand spinning and hand loom. To utilize this hair with other textile fibers, either physical or chemical methods are used, that increase the value as well as performance of the final products. This paper overviews various novel approaches involved in finishing <b>of</b> <b>angora</b> <b>rabbit</b> hair for improvement of value and performance of products...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{attempt was}} made to study the effect of {{incorporation}} of Dried Brewers ’ Grains (DBG) as a source of fibre on the growth performance <b>of</b> <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit.</b> Forty Angora rabbits of eight month age were selected, sheared and grouped into four body weight categories namely Low Weight (LW), Medium Low Weight (MLW), Medium Heavy Weight (MHW) and Heavy Weight (HW) groups, each with 10 rabbits. There were five treatments, namely, T (Control with 40 % Dehydrated Lucerne Meal (DLM) as a major fibre source), 1 T (Equal parts of DLM and DBG as major fibre sources) T (40 % DBG as a major fibre source without DLM), 2, 3 T (Ricebran extraction as a major fibre source without DLM), T (DLM and sunflower cake as major 4 5 fibre source). Two rabbits from each body weight category were randomly allotted to all the treatments (8 rabbits in all) such that average initial weight was uniform under all dietary treatments. All rabbits were fed ad libitum and weighed once a week. The rabbits had an average body weight of 2. 83, 2. 97, 2. 97 and 3. 05 kg with mean gain in body weight as 12. 7, 13. 3, 8. 8 and 9. 8 g per day showed the feed efficiency of 11. 8, 12. 2, 20. 8 and 15. 3 under LW, MLW, HW and MHW groups respectively, among which feed efficiency of first three were statistically similar (p = 0. 01) within themselves whereas, LW and MLW category were significantly different (p = 0. 01) from HW category.

50|$|The <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit</b> (Ankara tavşanı) is {{a variety}} of {{domestic}} rabbit bred for its long, soft wool. The <b>Angora</b> is one <b>of</b> the oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara (historically known as Angora), present day Turkey, along with the Angora cat and <b>Angora</b> goat. The <b>rabbits</b> were popular pets with French royalty in the mid-18th century, and spread {{to other parts of}} Europe {{by the end of the}} century. They first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long Angora wool, which may be removed by shearing, combing, or plucking. There are many individual breeds <b>of</b> <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbits,</b> four <b>of</b> which are recognized by American Rabbit Breeders' Association (ARBA); they are English, French, Giant, and Satin. Other breeds include German, Chinese, Swiss, Finnish, Korean, and St. Lucian.|$|R
50|$|Most breeds <b>of</b> <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbits</b> moult {{with their}} natural growth cycle about every four months. Many {{producers}} of the fibre pluck the fur of these breeds. Plucking is, in effect, pulling out the moulted fur. Plucking ensures a minimum of guard hair, and the fur is not as matted when plucked as when it is collected from the rabbit's cage. However, plucking a rabbit is time consuming, so some producers shear the rabbit instead. While this results in slightly lower quality fleece, as the guard hairs are included, it does take less time and results in more fleece. Also, not all breeds <b>of</b> <b>Angora</b> moult, and if the rabbit does not naturally moult, it cannot be plucked. German Angoras do not moult.|$|R
50|$|Other animal {{textiles}} {{which are}} made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, vicuña wool, llama wool, and camel hair, generally used {{in the production of}} coats, jackets, ponchos, blankets, and other warm coverings. Angora refers to the long, thick, soft hair <b>of</b> the <b>angora</b> <b>rabbit.</b> Qiviut is the fine inner wool of the muskox.|$|R

60|$|The skull <b>of</b> the <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit,</b> {{like the}} latter five skulls, is {{intermediate}} in general proportions, {{and in most}} other characters, between those of the largest lop-eared and wild rabbits. It presents only one singular character: though considerably longer than the skull of the wild rabbit, the breadth measured within the posterior supra-orbital fissures is nearly a third less than in the wild. The skulls of the silver-grey, and chinchilla and Himalayan rabbits are more elongated than in the wild, with broader supra-orbital plates, but differ little in any other respect, excepting that {{the upper and lower}} notches of the occipital foramen are not so deep or so well developed. The skull of the Moscow rabbit scarcely differs at all from that of the wild rabbit. In the Porto Santo feral rabbits the supra-orbital plates are generally narrower and more pointed than in our wild rabbits.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} our {{research}} {{to analyze the}} efficiency of an experiment of divergent selection in French <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit.</b> Objectives <b>of</b> the experiment were a) to assess genetic parameter estimatesfor total fleece weight and correlated trait and b) to get an experience on management of a population <b>of</b> <b>angora</b> <b>rabbits</b> under selection with overlapping generations. This thesis is also the last research project of INRA after nearly 30 years of research on this animal. We present {{an overview of the}} genetic and non-genetic factors of quantitative and qualitative traits influencing fibre production. Among fixed effects, number of harvest was the most important. The genetic parameters and genetic trends were analysed using a BLUP animal model. For estimation of genetics parameters the repeatability model was used in which wool harvests from third until 12 th have been considered as a repeated trait. Results showed that selection for high and low total fleece weight was successfully performed and a divergence of three genetic standard deviations was observed between the high and low lines after eight years of selection. Selection for total fleece weight significantly increased bristle length, secondary to primary follicle ratio and comfort factor and decreased compression, resilience, bristle diameter, and average fibre diameter. These changes resulted from moderate to high genetic correlations between total fleece weight and bristle length, and between fibre dimensions and secondary to primary follicle ratio, comfort factor, compression and resilience. Thus, selection for increasing total fleece weight results in an increase of both quantitative and qualitative traits of wool production in the French <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit.</b> Measurement <b>of</b> total fleece weight is simple and easy at the farm level. Selection for this trait has positiveeffects on fleece characteristics such as bristle length, follicle population and fibre diameter. This thesis also contains new genetic parameters Angora fibres resulting from measurements by Optical Fibre Diameter Analyser that we provide a rapid method for measuring the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>Angora</b> fibre. Some <b>of</b> these measurements are interesting because of having a high genetic correlation with follicle traits of skin. The OFDA methodology is an interesting alternative to evaluate important characteristics such as fibre diameter, CV of fibre diameter and bristle content through measuring of comfort factor. We describe the demography and genealogy of the studied population. In addition, we study differential of selection for total fleece weight and body weight. The main characteristic of our approach is the use of new method for description of differential of selection in candidates of selection, parent and theoretical parents. Description of demography and the genetic structure in this study showed that in the two divergent lines, the similar management of reproducers has been done successfully during 8 years of selection. Our work contributes to the research in two areas that are estimation of genetic parameters with multivariate models of best linear unbiased prediction of breeding value and theoretical investigation of selection in populations with overlapping generations. This thesis is also of practical interest for <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit</b> breeders for knowledge of effects of selection for total fleece weight and correlated traits...|$|R

6000|$|I have {{previously}} remarked that, {{if we had}} possessed many domestic rabbits of the same average size with the wild rabbit, {{it would have been}} easy to compare the capacity of their skulls. Now the Himalayan, Moscow, and <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbits</b> (Nos. 11, 12, 13 of Table 3) are only a little larger in body and have skulls only a little longer, than the wild animal, and we see that the actual capacity of their skulls is less than in the wild animal, and considerably less by calculation (column 7), according to the difference in the length of their skulls. The narrowness of the brain-case in these three rabbits could be plainly seen and proved by external measurement. The Chinchilla rabbit (No. 14) is a considerably larger animal than the wild rabbit, yet the capacity of its skull only slightly exceeds that of the wild <b>rabbit.</b> The <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit,</b> No. 13, offers the most remarkable case; this animal in its pure white colour and length of silky fur bears the stamp of long domesticity. It has a considerably longer head and body than the wild rabbit, but the actual capacity of its skull is less than that of even the little wild Porto Santo rabbits. By the standard of the length of skull the capacity (see column 7) is only half of what it ought to have been! I kept this individual animal alive, and it was not unhealthy nor idiotic. This case <b>of</b> the <b>Angora</b> <b>rabbit</b> so much surprised me, that I repeated all the measurements and found them correct. I have also compared the capacity of the skull <b>of</b> the <b>Angora</b> with that <b>of</b> the wild rabbit by other standards, namely, by the length and weight of the body, and by the weight of the limb-bones; but by all these standards the brain appears to be much too small, though in a less degree when the standard of the limb- bones was used; and this latter circumstance may probably be accounted for by the limbs of this anciently domesticated breed having become much reduced in weight, from its long-continued inactive life. Hence I infer that in the Angora breed, which is said to differ from other breeds in being quieter and more social, the capacity of the skull has really undergone a remarkable amount of reduction.] ...|$|R
