40|$|Abstract In {{contrast}} to traditional Markov random field (MRF) models, we develop a Steerable Random Field (SRF) {{in which the}} field potentials are {{defined in terms of}} filter re-sponses that are steered to the local image structure. In particular, we use the structure tensor to obtain deriva-tive responses that are either aligned with, or orthogonal to, the predominant local image structure, and analyze thestatistics of these steered filter responses in natural images. Clique potentials are defined <b>over</b> <b>steered</b> filter responses using a Gaussian scale mixture model and are learned fromtraining data. The SRF model connects random field models with anisotropic regularization and provides a statisticalmotivation for the latter. We demonstrate that steering the random field to the local image structure improves imagedenoising and inpainting performance compared with traditional pairwise MRFs. 1...|$|R

40|$|Production {{cars are}} {{designed}} to understeer and rarely do they <b>over</b> <b>steer.</b> If a car could automatically compensate for an understeer/over steer problem, the driver would enjoy nearly neutral steering under varying operating conditions. Four-wheel steering is a serious {{effort on the part}} of automotive design engineers to provide near-neutral steering. Also in situations like low speed cornering, vehicle parking and driving in city conditions with heavy traffic in tight spaces, driving would be very difficult due to vehicle’s larger wheelbase and track width. Hence there is a requirement of a mechanism which result in less turning radius and it can be achieved by implementing four wheel steering mechanism instead of regular two wheel steering. Our 4 Wheel Steering System gives 39. 56 % reduction in turning circle radius of a hatchback which is reduced from 4. 6 m to 2. 78 m, considering Maruti Suzuki ALTO 800 as a standard car for our calculationswhich gives much better maneuverability and control on the car even while driving at high speed...|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} of bulls compared with steers in production efficiency, performance, and carcass leanness {{have been well}} documented. However, {{it has also been}} well documented that meat obtained from bulls is darker in color and less tender than meat produced by steers. It may be concluded that the superiority in production performance of bulls <b>over</b> <b>steers</b> has not been exploited largely due to meat characteristics that differ from those of steers. Postmortem (after slaughter) muscle color is directly associated with antemortem (pre-slaughter) muscle glycogen content, postmortem muscle pH decline, and ultimate muscle pH, which, in tum, is affected by live animal physiological stress. In several mammalian species, depletion of muscle glycogen by exercise was followed by repletion to greater content of muscle glycogen than observed before exercise. In a lab study, starvation for 48 h followed by 48 h of refeeding rats a 65 percent glucose diet resulted in an increase and 2 ̆ 2 overshoot 2 ̆ 2 in the activities of muscle glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, and muscle glycogen content.

40|$|Based on the {{advantages}} of the electric motor such as fast and precise torque response, the performance of the electric vehicle (EV) can be improved. During braking or driving on the cornering, the vehicle will <b>over</b> <b>steer</b> or under steer if a car turns by more or less than the amount commanded by the driver. To improve the stability of the small EV with four in-wheel motors, the differential regenerative braking torque control is proposed. In this system, the regenerative braking torque at each wheel will be controlled individually based on the value of slip ratio. If the slip ratio is greater than the optimum value, the regenerative brake will turn off. In this situation, the electric motor will not produce the regenerative braking torque. Conversely, if the slip ratio lower than the optimum value, the regenerative brake will turn on and the electric motor will generate the regenerative braking torque. In the numerical analysis, to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the road condition is set to an icy road on the left tire and dry asphalt on the right tire. From the simulation results, the differential regenerative braking torque control can prevent the tire from lock-up and avoid the vehicle from skidding...|$|E

Because of that reason, writer {{want to know what}} is the influences of carrying a cargo on roof rack to the stability and safety of the vehicle when cornering at high speed on a climbing road or a down road. The stability of a vehicle could be discovered when it’s cornering, because at that time the resultant of Central Gravity Vehicle will transpose into a new position in order to the influences of a centrifugal force that work at the body.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of producing bulls {{as opposed to}} steers in production efficiency, performance, and carcass leanness have been well documented. However, it also has been observed that bulls have darker colored lean and lower carcass quality grades than steers. In all studies summarized in a literature review, meat obtained from bulls was less tender when compared with meat from steers. Consequently, the superiority of bulls <b>over</b> <b>steers</b> in performance and carcass cutability have been largely countered by the inferior carcass quality of bulls. Production of beef by bulls, therefore, has not been widely undertaken in the United States. Recent technological advances in meat processing may enhance bull beef quality. A review indicates that electrical stimulation of prerigor carcasses will improve tenderness and enhance lean color and marbling of beef. Improvement in tenderness by electrical stimulation was greatest when control samples had higher shear force requirements. High temperature, early postmortem carcass conditioning may also improve palatability characteristics of meat from bulls. Improvement in visual appeal and palatability of bull beef would certainly {{be in the best}} interest of the beef industry. The objective of this study was to examine postmortem treatments that could lead to improved meat quality of beef obtained from bulls. Methods studied were carcass electrical stimulation and high temperature conditioning...|$|R

50|$|The general {{assumption}} is that reduced snow cover and sea ice reflect less sunlight and therefore evaporation and transpiration increases, which in turn alters the pressure and temperature gradient of the polar vortex, causing it to weaken or collapse. This becomes apparent when the jet stream amplitude increases (meanders) over the northern hemisphere, causing Rossby waves to propagate farther to the south or north, which in turn transports warmer air {{to the north pole}} and polar air into lower latitudes. The jet stream amplitude increases with a weaker polar vortex, hence increases the chance for weather systems to become blocked.

40|$|Castration of {{the male}} in meat-producing animals {{has long been a}} {{traditional}} practice in the production of commercial livestock. Numerous research studies have indicated that intact bovine males grow more rapidly, utilize feed more efficiently, and produce a higher yielding carcass than castrates. Even though young bulls have obvious growth and leanness advantages <b>over</b> <b>steers,</b> their meat is usually lower and more variable in tenderness than steers. These differences in tenderness have been attributed to differences in fatness or differences in connective tissue. Factors influencing the amount and strength of intramuscular collagen have been linked to animal age, sex, and breed. The literature strongly indicates that collagen solubility decreases significantly with animal age and that most of these changes take place from birth to about 2 years of age. Results have illustrated that the age-related changes in tenderness are significantly more pronounced in bulls than in steers and heifers, particularly in muscles high in collagen. These findings suggest that age-related changes in the cross-linking of collagen might be related to the sex of the animals. Several workers reported an increase in collagen content in young bulls at about 12 months of age. Others have suggested that the increase in collagen content at this age, which was accompanied by an increased solubility, was due to an increase in collagen synthesis related to the hormonal changes occurring during puberty in young bulls. The objective of this phase of our research was to investigate the influence of animal age, breed, and sex condition (bull vs steer) on the content and solubility of intramuscular collagen using muscle biopsies in the longissimus muscle...|$|R

Super single tyres are sometimes used on tri-axle trailers. The suspension is designed with travel limiting, which will hold the rim off the road for one blown or deflated tyre for each side of the trailer, so a trailer can be driven at reduced speed to a safe place for repair.

In Exp. 1, there were no MT x EO interactions for finishing performance and carcass characteristics. Feeding MT resulted in a 3. 9 % improvement in G:F compared to steers fed no MT. Feed efficiency was not different between steers fed EO and those not fed EO. In Exp. 2, EO dose (0, 75, 150, 225, or 300 mg/steer daily of EO) was evaluated. Increasing EO dose linearly decreased DMI, but ADG was not different among treatments. Feed efficiency linearly increased as EO dose increased. Feeding EO at 225 and 300 mg/steer daily improved G:F 4. 4 and 3. 8 % compared to steers fed 0 EO. In Exp. 3, concentration of EO (0, 16. 5, 33. 1, or 49. 6 mg/kg of EO) was evaluated.
