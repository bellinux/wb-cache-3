40|$|Introduction: In {{addition}} to conventional radiography, several other {{techniques such as}} stereoradiography have so far been proposed to determine the position <b>of</b> <b>impacted</b> maxillary canines. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the diagnostic value of panoramic radiography and stereoradiography for determining the position <b>of</b> <b>impacted</b> maxillary canines. Materials and Methods: This was a prognostic, cross sectional study. A total <b>of</b> 30 <b>impacted</b> maxillary canines in 23 patients candidated for surgery were included. Four well coordinated observers separately determined the position <b>of</b> <b>impacted</b> maxillary canines using both panoramic radiography and stereoradiography. In the next phase, the exact position <b>of</b> <b>impacted</b> canines were determined through surgical exploration. Mc-Nemar and kappa index were applied for statistical data analysis. (α = 0. 05). Results: The rate of correct diagnosis in stereoradiography and conventional radiography was 93. 35 % and 60. 82 % respectively which demonstrated a statistically significant difference. With each method, there were no significant differences among observers. Sensitivity and specificity with stereoradiography were calculated 91. 98 % and 94. 78 % respectively. With conventional radiography however these values dropped to 49. 90 % and 74. 11 % respectively. Conclusion: Stereoradiography seems quite reliable for determining the position <b>of</b> <b>impacted</b> maxillary canines. On the contrary, conventional radiography per se does not look precise enogh to determin the position <b>of</b> <b>impacted</b> maxillary canines.

40|$|The fatigue {{behavior}} of the wood fiber cell wall under mechanical treatment in refining was simulated dynamically using a finite element method. The effect of the amplitude and frequency <b>of</b> <b>impacts</b> on the mechanical breakdown of the fiber wall structure was examined. The proposed model of the fiber cell wall was constructed from elementary microfibrils in various orientations embedded in isotropic lignin. The fatigue of the cell wall was simulated under normal refiner mechanical pulping conditions.
