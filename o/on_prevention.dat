25|$|The Greens {{base their}} health {{policies}} <b>on</b> <b>prevention,</b> and claim to consider health {{in areas such}} as organic agriculture, active transportation, urban planning, and education.

Policies on health care include expanding the Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) system, increasing support for multidisciplinary clinics (those with doctors, nurses, psychologists, dieticians, and other health care professionals), and increasing support for midwifery, along with a number of administrative reforms. GPO policy emphasizes a reduction in health care costs through avoidance of illness and expansion of alternative access models (such as CCACs), rather than simply closing facilities or increasing expenditures.|$|E
