The radio frequency capacitively coupled plasma (air, argon, argon then allylamine, argon containing ammonia and argon with <b>octafluorocyclobutane)</b> was used. Modified surface of PB- 1 was characterized by contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The surface hydrophilization by air and argon with ammonia plasmas was evaluated as most sufficient. Oppositely, a high level of hydrophobicity of PB- 1 surface was reached by combination of argon with <b>octafluorocyclobutane</b> plasma. Upon plasma modification, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of treated surfaces remained stable within three days under air atmosphere and then values of contact angle slowly recovered to those of unmodified PB- 1. However, morphology and surface chemical composition of plasma-modified samples remained generally unchanged during observed time. Changes in surface hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of plasma-treated PB- 1 were attributed to variance of conformation of the surface molecules. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Fluorocarbon {{coatings}} {{have been}} deposited on micron-sized silica particles {{by means of}} atmospheric pressure plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The silica particles have a diameter in the range between 40 and 70 ?m. They are fluidized at atmospheric pressure in a circulating fluidized bed combined with a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. Four coatings have been produced with four different precursors, respectively, <b>octafluorocyclobutane</b> (C 4 F 8), hexafluoropropylene (C 3 F 6), trifluorethanol (C 2 H 3 OF 3) and hexafluoro- 2 -propanol (C 3 H 2 OF 6). The Ar filamentary discharges are sustained with a plasma power of 150 W at 25 kHz. The chemical and morphological features of the coatings are investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray microanalysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). All coatings have a flake-like morphology and variable thickness. The F/C ratio, also called "Teflon" parameter, has the following values: 1. 37, 1. 09, 0. 30 and 1. 45 {{for each of the}} four precursors, respectively. The coating produced with trifluorethanol is highly cross-linked, but has relatively poor fluorinated surface. The highest surface fluorination is achieved, when <b>octafluorocyclobutane</b> is used as a precursor.

40|$|Application {{of surface}} wave plasma {{technology}} for effective abatement of environmentally harmful gases such as perfluorocompounds and chlorofluorocarbons is investigated. Perfluorocompounds (PFCs) are gases {{that contribute to}} forced global warming and have been favored for wafer etch and chamber clean applications in the semiconductor industry. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are ozone depleting gases that were used as refrigerants for commercial and domestic condensers and air conditioners, but current reserves still pose threats to environmental sustainability. Increased average global temperatures and further destruction {{of the ozone layer}} have prompted proposal of international initiatives such as the Montreal Protocols and the Kyoto Agreement to curtail emissions of such fugitive gases into the environment. These have increased the need for effective abatement technologies to control such emissions and include surface wave plasma abatement, the subject of this dissertation. Surface wave plasmas are considered high frequency non-equilibrium traveling wave discharges in contrast to the more frequently used standing wave discharges. The use of surface wave plasmas have the advantages of a variety of discharge vessel shapes, reproducibility of application, numerous operating conditions and large plasma volumes which ultimately produce low, molecular weight byproducts that are associated with high effective electron temperatures but low heavy particle temperatures. For these reasons, surface wave plasma abatement technology was developed for the destruction and removal of PFCs and CFCs. Results include final destruction and removal efficiencies (DREs) for <b>octafluorocyclobutane</b> greater than 99. 8 %, dichlorodifluoromethane greater than 99. 995 % and trichlorofluoromethane greater than 99. 999 % using moderate applied microwave powers of less than 2000 watts with the production of low molecular weight byproducts, such as CO 2, CO, HF and HCl, that prevent environmentally harmful process emissions from entering the atmosphere.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{relates the}} results of the preliminary investigation into the catalytic interaction of PTFE with various inorganic materials, with the primary goal of find catalysts that will greatly increase the yield of the high value pyrolysis products, most notably hexafluoropropylene and <b>octafluorocyclobutane.</b> This dissertation is divided into three parts, viz. : A review on the literature concerning PTFE pyrolysis; a brief description of facilities built for this research; and {{the results of}} the experimental work. The experimental work was conducted with a hyphenated TGA-FTIR system in which samples of commercial PTFE mixed with catalyst were pyrolysed. Some sulfates, fluorides and common oxides of the fourth period- and group 13 metals were used as catalysts. It was found that the fluorides of the fourth period metals Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe and Mn are generally inert with respect to reformation of the gas phase. The sulfates of these metals produced mixed results with NiSO 4 increasing the yield of hexafluoropropylene whilst CuSO 4 and CoSO 4 produced unidentified side products and the rest being inert. The oxides also produced mixed results with CuO readily oxidising PTFE to CO 2. Among the group 13 metals, the fluoride, sulphate, and common oxide of aluminium gave the best results, converting the PTFE pyrolysates almost completely to hexafluoropropylene and hexafluoroethane. Reaction mechanisms for the conversion of the pyrolysates on Al 2 O 3 are proposed. No impact was noticed on the yield of <b>octafluorocyclobutane</b> or the yield of the octafluorobutene isomers. Research recommendations include: Metal oxides examined here should be tested further by examination of the metals in their 3 + and 2 + oxidation states, where the applicable oxide has not been covered; the phosphates of the metals examined here should also be studied to determine if the presence of a phosphorous atom will affect the reactivity; and ab initio work should be conducted to gain insight as to which crystal surfaces are responsible for the catalytic effects of the relevant materials.

In this work, aluminum-induced crystallization (AIC) of amorphous silicon (a-Si) was used to produce nano-textures on copper (Cu) substrates. A study was performed {{to examine the effects}} of changing the annealing conditions and a-Si thickness on nano-texture formation. The creation of various nano-topographies and chemically modifying them using <b>octafluorocyclobutane</b> (C 4 F 8) was performed to control hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, and oil affinity of nano-textured surfaces. A video-based contact angle measurement system was used to measure the surface wetting properties.

Scratch testing was performed using a TriboIndenter to assess the potential of the nano-textured Cu substrates to lower the coefficient of friction (COF). It was found that the thicker a-Si layer generated larger textures overall which contributed to water contact angle (CA) results ranging between superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic, as well as increased oil affinity of Cu substrate.

The effects of feed gases used, discharge pressure, rf power, substrate positions and discharge modes (pulsed or cw) on the deposited films are examined.

Feed gases used, discharge pressure, rf power, substrate positions and discharge modes strongly affect the morphology of the resulting film, as revealed by atomic force microscopy. Optical emission spectrometry measurements were performed to in-situ characterize the gas-phase compositions of the plasmas and radicals' emission intensities during film deposition. Correlations between film properties, gas-phase plasma diagnostic data, and film growth processes were discussed. The film growth in pulsed or downstream plasmas was controlled by the surface migration of radicals, such as CF 2 towards nucleation centers, which result in the deposition of FC films with less cross-linked nature and rougher surfaces.

40|$|The {{manipulation}} of the water wetting properties of heat exchangers into dropwise condensation {{by the use of}} microstructured surfaces promises an enhanced heat transfer. In order to design a hydrophobic surface geometry, different theoretical models have been introduced in the past. While these models describe the surface-drop-interaction of sessile drops reasonably well, nucleation and droplet growth in dropwise condensation are not considered. Modifications of roughness based models have been introduced as quantitative surface structure design guidelines. The theory of local energy barriers has been contrived and dependencies on the bond number and solid-liquid fraction have been found. This study aims at validating these theoretical models and their applicability for the design of hydrophobic surfaces used for dropwise condensation. To gain deeper understanding of the underlying mechanism of dropwise condensation silicon-nanopillars of five microns height, different diameter (several hundred nanometers) and pillar distance (below two microns) were fabricated in a cryogenic deep reactive-ion etching process. The influence of material properties on the wetting behavior was simulated by using coatings with different intrinsic contact angles (silicon dioxide, Parylene C, <b>octafluorocyclobutane)</b> on the microstructures.

Electron-molecule collision cross sections are especially important, affecting both electron transport and the generation of reactive fragments by dissociation and ionization. Because the supply of cross section data is small and measurements are difficult, computational approaches may make a valuable contribution, provided they can cope with the significant challenges posed. In particular, a computational method must deal with the full complexity of low-energy electron-molecule interactions, must treat polyatomic molecules, and must be capable of computing cross sections for electronic excitation. These requirements imply that the method will be numerically intensive and thus must exploit high-performance computers to be practical. We have developed an ab initio computational method, the Schwinger multichannel (SMC) method, that possesses the characteristics just described, and we have applied it to compute cross sections for a variety of molecules, with particular emphasis on fluorocarbon and hydrofluorocarbon etchants used in the semiconductor industry. A key aspect of this work has been an awareness that cross section sets, validated when possible against swarm data, are more useful than individual cross sections. To develop such sets, cross section calculations must be integrated within a focused collaborative effort. Here we describe electron cross section calculations carried out within the context of such a focused effort, with emphasis on fluorinated hydrocarbons including CHF 3 (trifluoromethane), c-C_(4) F_(8) (<b>octafluorocyclobutane),</b> and C_(2) F_(4) (tetrafluoroethene) ...|$|E
40|$|Air samples {{collected}} at Cape Grim, Tasmania between 1978 and 2008 and during {{a series of}} more recent aircraft sampling programmes have been analysed to determine the atmospheric abundance and trend of <b>octafluorocyclobutane</b> (-C 4 F 8 or PFC- 318). c-C 4 F 8 has an atmospheric lifetime in excess of 3000 yr and a global warming potential (GWP) of 10 300 (100 yr time horizon), {{making it one of}} the most potent greenhouse gases detected in the atmosphere to date. The abundance of c-C 4 F 8 in the Southern Hemisphere has risen from 0. 35 ppt in 1978 to 1. 2 ppt in 2010, and is currently increasing at a rate of around 0. 03 ppt yr − 1. It is the third most abundant perfluorocarbon (PFC) in the present day atmosphere, behind CF 4 (~ 75 ppt) and C 2 F 6 (~ 4 ppt). The origin of c-C 4 F 8 is unclear. Using a 2 -D global model to derive top-down global emissions based on the Cape Grim measurements yields a recent (2007) emission rate of around 1. 1 Gg yr − 1 and a cumulative emission up to and including 2007 of 38. 1 Gg. Emissions reported on the EDGAR emissions database for the period 1986 – 2005 represent less than 1 % of the top-down emissions for the same period, which suggests there is a large unaccounted for source of this compound. It is also apparent that the magnitude of this source has varied considerably over the past 30 yr, declining sharply in the late 1980 s before increasing again in the mid- 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} details research {{aimed at}} designing a small batch distillation column to purify tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene from a mixture containing tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and <b>octafluorocyclobutane.</b> As no vapour-liquid equilibrium {{data are available}} for these chemicals in this mixture, new vapour-liquid equilibrium data were experimentally generated and modelled {{for use in the}} design of the batch distillation column. The data were fitted to the Peng-Robinson equation of state, utilizing the Mathias-Copeman alpha function. The model was used with the Wong- Sandler mixing rules alongside the NRTL alpha function. The model was fitted with mean relative deviations lower than 1. 2 %, indicating an acceptably accurate description of the VLE data gathered by the model. The experimental data and the model also passed the thermodynamic consistency test for all the systems and isotherms. The design simulations were completed by means of the Aspen Batch Distillation, a module of the Aspen Technologies package. The results show that the optimum design for recovering high-purity products requires six equilibrium stages in the column. The batch column should consist of a still pot, also functioning as a reboiler, a packed column section and a total condenser. The total condenser and the reboiler both count as equilibrium stages. Using this design, a TFE product purity of 99. 999 % is predicted with a recovery of 96 %. An HFP product purity of 99 % is predicted at a recovery of 68 %. The recovery of the HFP product can be increased, but entails a significant loss of product purity. The minimum column diameter required to achieve the flow rates suggested in the simulation is 29 mm. The column diameter was selectedas 1 ¼ ″ (or 31. 75 mm) on the basis of the standard pipe diameters available in the industry. Pall ring packing is suggested for use in the column, with an estimated maximum HETP of 0. 5 m. As there are five equilibrium stages in the column itself, the column has to be at least 2. 5 m high.

40|$|Paper and {{cellulosic}} materials hold a good {{promise of}} being candidates for flexible packaging materials provided suitable barrier properties {{such as water}} repellence and grease resistance are imparted to them. One of the methods to achieve these objectives is to surface modify paper/cellulose by applying thin fluorocarbon coatings on the surface. Fluorocarbon thin films produced by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) offer several advantages over the films produced by conventional polymerization means. Plasma deposited films are pinhole-free, chemically inert, insoluble, mechanically tough, thermally stable and highly coherent and adherent to variety of substrates. In this work, we investigate the use of PECVD technique to produce barrier films on paper and cellulosic materials. These films, with composition and properties {{not much different from}} PTFE, repel water and act as a good barrier to lipophilic materials. Two different monomers, pentafluoroethane (PFE; CF 3 CHF 2) and <b>octafluorocyclobutane</b> (OFCB; C 4 F 8), were investigated and compared in terms of deposition rates and final film properties. Various analytical techniques (XPS, FT-IR, SEM, Ellipsometry, Contact Angle Goniometry, etc.) were used to characterize the fluorocarbon films. The fluorocarbon coated paper exhibited hydrophobic character as evidenced by high water contact angles. Although the films allow water vapor diffusion, the films are hydrophobic and are not wetted when liquid water contacts these layers. Based on various thickness of these films deposited on surface of cellulose, there was a minimum PFE film thickness required to achieve a stable hydrophobic behavior. The fluorocarbon films investigated in this work also exhibited good resistance to lipophilic materials (e. g. oils, fatty acids, etc.). While techniques such as oleic acid penetration and TAPPI "oil-kit" test are commonly used in paper industry to qualitatively test the grease barrier properties of paper/cellulose, this work attempts to quantify the grease barrier properties of fluorocarbon coated paper using techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Finally, the feasibility of deposition of dual layer films by PECVD was investigated using PFE and n-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAM) as precursors for applications in barrier packaging and printing. Ph.
