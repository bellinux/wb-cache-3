25|$|In {{the first}} half of 1799 Blanckmann, in Anacréon, was highly {{successful}} as a privateer. He would hang on the flanks of convoys, pick of stragglers, and escape before the convoy's escorts could reach him. In one three-day period he captured six large merchantmen.

In the short prose story The Sound of Breaking Glass, it is revealed that Rodimus too was working with Prowl to keep Overlord <b>on</b> board <b>The</b> Lost Light.

25|$|To the South, the Samnites had a {{reputation}} for martial ferocity unrivalled in the peninsula. Tough mountain-dwelling pastoralists, they are believed to have invented the manipular fighting unit adopted by the Romans. Like the Romans, their national symbol was a wolf, but a male wolf <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>prowl,</b> not a she-wolf suckling babies. All graves of male Samnites contain weapons. Livy several times describes the barbarity of their raids into Campania. Their military effectiveness was greatly enhanced by the formation of the Samnite League by the four Samnite tribal cantons (the Caudini, Hirpini, Caraceni and Pentri). This brought their forces under the unified command of a single general in times of crisis. It took the Romans three gruelling wars (the Samnite wars, 343–290 BC), during which they suffered many severe reverses, to subjugate the Samnites. Even after this, the Samnites remained implacable enemies of Rome, seizing every opportunity to throw off the Roman yoke. They rebelled and joined both Pyrrhus and Hannibal when these invaded Italy (275 and 218 BC respectively). In the Social War (91–88 BC), the Samnites were the core of the rebel coalition, and Samnite generals led the Italian forces.|$|E
500|$|At {{secondary}} sites {{he would}} remove and later burn the victim's clothing, or {{in at least}} one case (Cunningham's) deposit them in a Goodwill Industries collection bin. Bundy explained that the clothing removal was ritualistic, but also a practical matter, as it minimized the chance of leaving trace evidence at the crime scene that could implicate him. (A manufacturing error in fibers from his own clothing, ironically, provided a crucial incriminating link to Kimberly Leach.) He often revisited his secondary crime scenes to engage in acts of necrophilia, and to groom or dress up the cadavers. Some victims were found wearing articles of clothing they had never worn, or nail polish that family members had never seen. He took Polaroid photos of many of his victims. [...] "When you work hard to do something right," [...] he told Hagmaier, [...] "you don't want to forget it." [...] Consumption of large quantities of alcohol was an [...] "essential component", he told Keppel, and later Michaud; he needed to be [...] "extremely drunk" [...] while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>prowl</b> in order to [...] "significantly diminish" [...] his inhibitions and to [...] "sedate" [...] the [...] "dominant personality" [...] that he feared might prevent his inner [...] "entity" [...] from acting on his impulses.|$|E

500|$|Of the {{multiple}} music critics who {{commented on the}} song, the majority praised [...] "Skins musical structure and Rihanna's vocal performance. Apart from writing about the song's composition, Daw called the ballad [...] "smoldering" [...] and compared the last minute of the song to Sades [...] "No Ordinary Love" [...] for the song's sensual content, but noted that Adu's song is not as lyrically graphic as [...] "Skin". Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that Rihanna's sensuality in the song is evoked though her use of sexually suggestive moaning and heavy breathing, adding to the [...] "slow, torrid buildup". Colin Gentry of 4Music noted that Rihanna appears to be transitioning from singing songs about partying and dancing in clubs to singing about her sexual fantasies and desires, writing [...] "Rihanna swaggers through the album as a woman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>prowl,</b> taking her conquests from the clubs to the bedroom. Demanding to know 'why are you standing over there with your clothes on?' on sultry track Skin, the Barbadian clearly means business."

2500|$|He (Rousseau's tiger) {{is derived}} from a motif found in the {{drawings}} and paintings of Eugène Delacroix. It was claimed, either by Rousseau himself or by his friends and admirers, that he had experienced life in the jungle during his time in Mexico in 1860, where he {{had served as a}} regimental bandsman. In fact he never left France, and it is thought that his inspiration came from the botanical gardens of Paris, such as the Jardin des Plantes (which included zoological galleries with taxidermy specimens of exotic animals), and from prints and books. The fin de siècle French populace was captivated by exotic and dangerous subjects, such as the perceived savagery of animals and peoples of distant lands (Morris & Green, 49–60). Tigers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>prowl</b> had been the subject of an exhibition at the 1885 École des Beaux-Arts. Emmanuel Frémiet's [...] of 1887 depicting a gorilla carrying a woman exuded more savagery than anything in Rousseau's canvases, yet was found acceptable as art; Rosseau's poor immediate reception therefore seems the result of his style and not his subject matter [...] (Morris & Green, 143).|$|E
2500|$|By October 2008, Palin's {{usage of}} the bear metaphor to {{describe}} herself was reported in a New York Times article, [...] "Provoking Palin's Inner Bear," [...] which quotes her as saying that negative media coverage about her children makes, [...] "the mama grizzly bear in me [...] out, {{makes me want to}} rear up on my hind legs and say, ‘Wait a minute.’" [...] Soon, other media outlets began picking up on Palin's self-description. In January 2009, Margery Eagan of the Boston Herald penned a column, [...] "Unbearable Mama Grizzly clawing way to Oval Office" [...] in which she noted that a YouTube interview of Palin had nearly three quarters of a million views, proving [...] "that mama 'grizzly,' as she called herself, remains irresistible." [...] The Vancouver, Washington newspaper, The Columbian, commented in January 2009 that, [...] "Sarah Palin is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>prowl,</b> snorting that when the media poke fun at her family, it brings out the mama grizzly in her." [...] The connection between Palin and [...] "mamma grizzly" [...] was made internationally in July 2009 when the New Delhi, India-based Hindustan Times reported on a Palin tweet describing mama grizzly bears in Alaska. In August 2009, an opinion piece in The Columbian suggested that Sarah Palin could serve as a Mama Grizzly head of a third or a fourth U.S. political party.|$|E
