500|$|The {{portion of}} the {{environmental}} debate with the biggest symbolic impact took place when discussing the pipeline's impact on caribou herds. Environmentalists proposed that the pipeline would {{have an effect on}} caribou similar to the effect of the U.S. transcontinental railroad on the American Bison population of North America. Pipeline critics said the pipeline would block traditional migration routes, making caribou populations smaller and making them easier to hunt. This idea was exploited in anti-pipeline advertising, most notably when a picture of a forklift carrying several legally shot caribou was emblazoned with the slogan, [...] "There is more than <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> caribou across the Alaska Pipeline". The use of caribou {{as an example of the}} pipeline's environmental effects reached a peak in the spring of 1971, when the draft environmental statement was being debated.|$|E
500|$|Imagination is {{generally}} thought of by historians {{of science fiction}} {{as one of the}} weaker magazines of the 1950s, despite its relative longevity. Donald Tuck, in his Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, dismissed the novels it published, saying, [...] "not many were noteworthy, most being in the interplanetary/space opera/adventure field", and Brian Stableford, a science fiction writer and critic, described it as dealing [...] "primarily in routine space opera." [...] James Blish, writing under the pseudonym [...] "William Atheling, Jr.", which he used for some of his critical writing, remarked that it was a [...] "widely unread" [...] magazine. Hamling's editorial policy was consciously slanted against intellectualism. In the November 1951 issue he commented that [...] "science fiction was never meant to be an educational tour de force. The so-called adult story is nothing more than an attempt to show the reader how dumb he is and how smart the editor is." [...] Imaginations approach, he said, was to publish entertainment: [...] "What we need is a little relaxation. And entertaining reading is <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it." [...] Some readers agreed with Hamling; a 1952 issue of Rhodomagnetic Digest, a fanzine, contains approving commentary on Hamling's editorial by Gregg Calkins, a fan of the period.|$|E
