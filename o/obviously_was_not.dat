2500|$|Cuvier's {{claim that}} new fossil forms appear {{abruptly}} in the geological record and then continue without alteration in overlying strata {{was used by}} later critics of evolution to support creationism, to whom the abruptness seemed consistent with special divine creation (although Cuvier's finding that different types made their paleontological debuts in different geological strata clearly did not). The lack of change {{was consistent with the}} supposed sacred immutability of [...] "species", but, again, the idea of extinction, of which Cuvier was the great proponent, <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Chuck Jones, Pepé's creator, {{wrote that}} Pepé was based (loosely) on the {{personality}} of his Termite Terrace colleague, writer Tedd Pierce, a self-styled [...] "ladies' man" [...] who reportedly always assumed that his infatuations were reciprocated. [...] Pepé's voice, provided by Mel Blanc, was based on Charles Boyer's Pépé le Moko from Algiers (1938), a remake of the 1937 French film Pépé le Moko. Eddie Selzer, animation producer—and Jones' bitterest foe—at Warners then once profanely commented {{that no one would}} laugh at those cartoons. [...] However, this did not keep Selzer from accepting an award for one of Pepé's pictures several years later. There have been theories that Pepé was based on Maurice Chevalier. However, in the short film, Chuck Jones: Memories of Childhood, Jones says Pepé was actually based on himself, but that he was very shy with girls, and Pepé <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> <b>not.</b> A prototype Pepé appears in 1947's Bugs Bunny Rides Again, but sounds similar to Porky Pig.|$|E
2500|$|Pforzheim is {{situated}} in a valley and also spread out across the adjacent hill slopes. On the northern slope there is a level, narrow plateau that is about 100meters wide and about 2kilometers in length. The railway facilities, including the main station and {{what used to be}} the freight loading facilities, are located on this plateau. This is the only level space that can possibly be used for railway facilities there. If the RAF would have been only aiming at destroying the railway facilities, a few aircraft would have sufficed to finish this job in a short time. There was no need to bomb an area that was wider than one kilometer (...) and had a length of more than three kilometers (...) using more than 360 Lancasters, as was the case in the big raid on 23 February. The existence and size of the plateau on the northern slope can be verified by examining any topographic map featuring the Pforzheim city area, and the map showing the destroyed city area. (refer to References Map of destroyed town area). And besides that, the area bombardment <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> even effective in destroying the railway facilities, because less than one month after the big raid in mid-March the railway facilities were bombed again several times by the USAF, this time focussing mainly on the suspected military target, not civilian estates (refer to References Pforzheimer Zeitung of 4 March 2005).|$|E

He slept very little now; but for several nights past instead of reading--or only sitting, with Mrs. Gould's silver spectacles on his nose, before the open Bible, he had been prowling actively all about the island with his old gun, on watch over his honour.|$|E

Half-breed women with black shawls round their heads looked up at her from beside their tiny {{charcoal}} cooking fires, and she saw dark eyes flash with hostility as her escort passed. Here and there a woman of pure Spanish blood stood on a balcony and glanced down with shocked prudery at the bold American, but Evelyn smiled at this. She distrusted Gomez, who <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a favorite with the poorer citizens, but as a traveling companion she did not find much fault with him.|$|E

50|$|The series {{itself was}} a {{spin-off}} of Most Outrageous Game Show Moments, a series of specials showcasing outtakes and funny moments from television game shows, Hosted by Bob Eubanks, Jim Lange, Wink Martindale, Peter Marshall & Ben Stein and later Eubanks' co-host was Chuck Woolery. Since this particular series depended exclusively on stock footage, Outrageous Moments used laugh tracks and applause carts to provide audience responses, and, <b>obviously,</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> presented before a live studio audience.|$|E

It was a working farm with few amenities. The Hopkins {{decided to build}} their new house on a knoll slightly north and east of the original farmhouse. They built a late Victorian clapboard farmhouse, with both Gothic Revival and Italianate features. The simple gable roof included a small cross-gable at the front. The house featured Venetian style shuttered windows {{on the second floor}} which were covered with brightly striped awnings. It was surrounded by porches and the porches were bedecked with hanging and potted plants, helping to merge the indoors with the outdoors. Painted with contrasting trim on windows, and doors, it was a striking example of the Victorian farmhouse as impressive country home.|$|E

5000|$|The {{hotel was}} built in an Italianate Victorian {{architecture}} style designed by architect John Bennes, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property within the Baker Historic District.

According to Oregon Encyclopedia, Bennes made [...] "modifications" [...] to the hotel and didn't arrive in Baker until 1900.

According to the Oregonian newspaper, Mr. Geiser bought the hotel in 1900 and in 1901 planned [...] "another story" [...] (which <b>obviously</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> built), a reconstructed interior, and the installation of all the latest conveniences and appliances.
