5|$|The {{fourth and}} final launch from an M-21 on 30 July ended in disaster. Unlike the three {{previous}} launches this one was performed straight and level, not in an <b>outside</b> <b>loop</b> {{to assist in the}} separation of the drone from the aircraft. The D-21 suffered engine problems and struck the M-21's tail after separation, leading to the destruction of both aircraft. The two crew ejected and landed at sea. The pilot, Bill Park, survived, but the Launch Control Officer, Ray Torick, drowned.|$|E
25|$|The flux {{through the}} portion of the path from the brush at the rim, through the <b>outside</b> <b>loop</b> and the axle {{to the center of the}} disc is always zero because the {{magnetic}} field is in the plane of this path (not perpendicular to it), no matter what is rotating, so the integrated emf around this part of the path is always zero. Therefore, attention is focused on {{the portion of}} the path from the axle across the disc to the brush at the rim.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, one {{can enter}} {{inverted}} flight by performing half an inside loop or half an <b>outside</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Outside</b> <b>loops</b> {{generally}} {{require more}} power and a higher control input than inside loops to perform because the lift force is in an outwards direction, thus tending to pull the aircraft out of the loop.|$|R

50|$|Therefore, if the {{aircraft}} starts in a normal, upright flight position, then an <b>outside</b> <b>loop</b> {{will be performed}} by inputting down elevator and progressing down below the original line of flight before executing a circular path {{to return to the}} original position. This is sometimes referred to as a 'bunt'.|$|E

50|$|Howard began {{air show}} flying in 1933. In 1938, {{he became the}} first pilot to fly an <b>outside</b> <b>loop</b> in a light plane, flying a 37½ {{horsepower}} Piper Cub. He {{went on to win the}} National Lightplane Aerobatic Championships in three consecutive years from 1939 to 1941, and eventually became one of the best known air show pilots in the country. Since his primary occupation was running the many aspects of his company (Hawthorne Aviation), flying airshows became an avocation and he flew many exhibitions for charity or cost such as the show where he was killed.|$|E
5000|$|One of Dorothy's {{specialties}} {{during her}} performance was the <b>outside</b> <b>loop,</b> which she learned from Tex Rankin. She {{became the first}} woman to perform this maneuver on June 30, 1930. [...] Later that year at the Omaha Air Show, she set a world record for flying 56 inverted snap rolls as well as 69 consecutive outside loops, 62 of which were deemed perfectly rounded by observers from the National Aeronautic Association (NAA). Her record of 62 outside loops remained unbroken until July 13, 1989, when it was broken at the North Bend (Ore.) Air Show by stunt pilot Joann Osterud. Stenzel had encouraged Osterud to break the record.|$|E

40|$|Reducing {{memory accesses}} is {{particularly}} important for DSP applications since they are widely used in embedded systems {{and need to be}} executed with high performance and low power consumption. In this paper, we focus on optimizing loops which are the most critical sections for DSP applications. We propose a machine-independent intermediate-code-level loop memory access optimization technique, REALM (REdundAnt Load Exploration & Migration), to explore hidden redundant loads and migrate them <b>outside</b> <b>loops</b> based on loop-carried data dependence analysis. In REALM, we first build up a data-flow graph to describe the inter-iteration data dependencies among memory operations. Then we perform code transformation by exploiting these de-pendencies with registers to hold the values of unnecessary loads and migrating these loads <b>outside</b> <b>loops.</b> Dif-ferent from the previous work based on data-flow-analysis, our data-flow-graph-based approach is easy to be implemented and more suitable for optimizing loop kernels of DSP applications that have simple control-flow structure. We implement our technique into the IMPACT compiler [24] and conduct experiments using a set of benchmarks from DSPstone [28] on the cycle-accurate VLIW simulator of Trimaran [1]. The experimental results show that our technique significantly reduces the number of memory accesses. ...|$|R
40|$|The S-matrix {{is known}} to be {{independent}} of the gauge fixing parameter to all orders in perturbation theory. In this paper by employing the pinch technique we prove at one loop a stronger version of this independence. In particular we show that one can use a gauge fixing parameter for the gauge bosons inside quantum loops which is different from that used for the bosons <b>outside</b> <b>loops,</b> and the S-matrix is independent from both. Possible phenomenological applications of this result are briefly discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{first flight}} of the XP6M-1 came on 14 July 1955, but early tests showed that the engines were mounted {{too close to the}} {{fuselage}} and scorched it when afterburners were used, leading to angling the engines slightly outward in subsequent aircraft. Flight testing was initially successful, but, on 7 December 1955, a control system fault destroyed the first prototype with the loss of all aboard. The first prototype, BuNo 138821, c/n XP-1, disintegrated in flight at 5000 ft due to the horizontal tail going to full up due to a control malfunction, subjecting the airframe to 9 g stress as it began an <b>outside</b> <b>loop,</b> crashing into the Potomac River near the junction of St. Mary's River, killing four crew members.|$|E
50|$|Soon after, at the Muncie Fair, another tragedy {{occurs with}} the Dillhoefer Circus when Ezra (flying {{in place of}} the {{grounded}} Waldo) attempts the <b>outside</b> <b>loop</b> in the monoplane. He crashes on his third attempt, and the crowd rushes out of the stands to see the wreckage. Some of the spectators are smoking as they watch Waldo struggle to free Ezra. One of the cigarettes is flicked into gas leaking from the aircraft, igniting it. Waldo, helpless against the flames, kills Ezra with a piece of lumber. Because no one helped Waldo try to save him, Waldo goes on a rampage, jumps in one of Dillhoefer's aircraft and begins buzzing the crowd away from the wreckage and ends up crashing into a carnival area, which leads to his permanent grounding.|$|E
50|$|In April 1926, Doolittle {{was given}} {{a leave of absence}} to go to South America to perform {{demonstration}} flights. In Chile, he broke both ankles, but put his P-1 Hawk through aerial maneuvers with his ankles in casts. He returned to the United States, and was confined to Walter Reed Army Hospital for his injuries until April 1927. Doolittle was then assigned to McCook Field for experimental work, with additional duty as an instructor pilot to the 385th Bomb Squadron of the Air Corps Reserve. During this time, in 1927 {{he was the first to}} perform an <b>outside</b> <b>loop</b> previously thought to be a fatal maneuver. Carried out in a Curtiss fighter at Wright Field in Ohio, Doolittle executed the dive from 10,000 feet, reached 280 miles per hour, bottomed out upside down, then climbed and completed the loop.|$|E
50|$|Loop-invariant code motion: If a {{quantity}} is computed inside a loop during every iteration, and its value {{is the same}} for each iteration, it can vastly improve efficiency to hoist it <b>outside</b> the <b>loop</b> and compute its value just once before the loop begins. This is particularly important with the address-calculation expressions generated by loops over arrays. For correct implementation, this technique must be used with loop inversion, because not all code is safe to be hoisted <b>outside</b> the <b>loop.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It {{was at an}} airshow on July 13, 1989 in North Bend, Oregon, that Joann did set {{her first}} world flight record, flying 208 <b>outside</b> <b>loops</b> in her Sorrell Biplane Supernova. The plane was 21 feet long with a 23 foot wingspan, and topped out at 170 MPH. It had a 230 {{horsepower}} engine and a nitrous oxide injection system for an extra boost. Osterud modified it with straps to hold her feet to the pedals, and she trained for the time upside down with a special harness that allowed her to hang upside down {{for long periods of}} time. Previous record holder Dorothy Stenzel set the record of 62 <b>outside</b> <b>loops</b> in 1931 and, after seeing Joann perform at an airshow, encouraged her to break her record. Stenzel commented to Sports Illustrated “I believed it was well past time the record was broken… She’s a smooth flyer and I didn’t think she’d tear her wings off.” [...] The 208 <b>outside</b> <b>loops</b> took her 2 hours, 4 minutes, 38 seconds, and not only broke Stenzel’s record of 62 <b>outside</b> <b>loops,</b> but also the unofficial men’s record of 180 <b>outside</b> <b>loops,</b> which was set by Hal McClain in the 1980s. Osterud also used the record breaking stunt to raise money for United Way of Southeastern Oregon, allowing people to sponsor individual loops. She raised $1364.67, and would have quit at 200 loops, but one of her favorite Eagles songs was playing, so she kept going. Osterud next set two records at once on July 24, 1991, for both the longest flight upside down and the longest flight upside down in one stretch, flying for 4 hours and 38 minutes over 658 miles in her Ultimate 10-300S biplane between Vancouver BC and Vanderhoof BC. [...] She was scheduled to perform in the 1990 Vanderhoof Air Show, so decided to try her hand at breaking ’s 1933 record. She had previously attempted the flight in 1990, but had to end the flight early due to an engine oil leak. Burcham flew 4 hours, 5 minutes, 22 seconds flying upside down from Long Beach to San Diego and back in a Boeing 100 where he had inverted the engine. [...] The records were part publicity stunt for the Vanderhoof Air Show, partly to fundraise for the Canadian Air Cadets, and also to prove that she could do it. [...] Osterud upgraded her biplane with six fuel tanks, specialized oil and electrical systems, special seat belts and also drinking tubes, the last two for making the long flight more comfortable for her. She had the same problems she always did with her body on her inverted flights: painful leg cramps, facial swelling, eyes swelling, and head congestion. During the record-setting flight, she was accompanied by five other planes, including an official observer from the Canadian Federation Aeronautique Internationale and another to navigate for her. [...] "The world looks real weird upside down," [...] she said. [...] "The normal points of reference just aren't there." [...] As of 1991, she was flying 20-25 airshows a year as well as flying for United Airlines, and compared {{the difference between the two}} types of planes as [...] "the difference between driving a Cadillac and riding a dirt bike." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{calculation}} [...] and [...] can {{be moved}} <b>outside</b> the <b>loop</b> since within they are loop-invariant code, so the optimized code will be something like this: ...|$|R
