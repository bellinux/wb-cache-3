Essential to any governing bodies, institutions etc. this paper’s forte is to specifically assess the politics phenomenon in the academic institutions of higher education.

Politics can be liberal and conservative depending on the individuals running and other perceiving it, which gives birth to the argumentative dialogues, {{in order to gain}} power and authority to run the given regime. The survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to the leading higher education universities of Pakistan. There were 3000 respondents (faculty, staff, middle management and top-management). The testing endeavoured to quantify aspects of politics judgment in terms of contribution, appreciation, goals and values, interests, performance, quit, salary, comparison, emotional grudges/cushion for other work colleagues, communication, compensation, gossip, spying, back-biting, professional jealousy, self-esteem, job targets and ethics at academic-oriented work space. <b>One</b> <b>samples</b> <b>T-test</b> and KW test analyzed that staff level employees 50 % disagree with the top-management control due to the strong inside and outside political influence over all categories of management. Politics has suppressed the environment and welfare of sound universities, which lay their foundation on transparency, honesty and ethical grounds. It is an alarming situation for universities, which have bad control of politics ruining the administration and overall productivity at work. Policy makers must assess the mal-use of politics in the higher educational sector universities to avoid major fallout of large establishments over a decade, which is creating speculation and dearth of consistent and right administrative and governing systems. ...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{abnormal}} DNA methylation in {{the progression of}} disease is a growing area of research that relies upon the establishment of sound statistical methods. The common method for declaring there is differential methylation between two groups at a given CpG site, as summarized by the difference between proportions methylated db=b 1 -b 2, has been through use of a Filtered Two <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test,</b> using the recommended filter of 0. 17 (Bibikova et al., 2006 b). In this dissertation, we performed a re-analysis of the data used in recommending the threshold by fitting a mixed-effects ANOVA model. It was determined that the 0. 17 filter is not accurate and conjectured that application of a Filtered Two <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test</b> likely leads to loss of power. Further, the Two <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test</b> assumes that data arise from an underlying distribution encompassing the entire real number line, whereas b 1 and b 2 are constrained on the interval. Additionally, {{the imposition of a}} filter at a level signifying the minimum level of detectable difference to a Two <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test</b> likely reduces power for smaller but truly differentially methylated CpG sites. Therefore, we compared the Two <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test</b> and the Filtered Two <b>Sample</b> <b>t-test,</b> which are widely used but largely untested with respect to their performance, to three proposed methods. These three proposed methods are a Beta distribution test, a Likelihood ratio test, and a Bootstrap test, where each was designed to address distributional concerns present in the current testing methods.
