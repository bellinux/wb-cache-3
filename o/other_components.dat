5|$|In {{addition}} to the photosphere, six <b>other</b> <b>components</b> of Betelgeuse's atmosphere have now been identified.

5|$|Whether prions cause {{disease or}} are merely a symptom {{caused by a}} {{different}} agent is still debated by a minority of researchers.

5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 {{because it}} did not have enough engineers to handle the number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and <b>other</b> <b>components,</b> and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E
5|$|Breathing quality gases do not {{normally}} deteriorate during storage in steel or aluminium cylinders. Provided there is insufficient water content to promote internal corrosion, the stored gas will remain unchanged for years if stored at temperatures within the allowed working range for the cylinder, usually below 65°C. If {{there is any}} doubt, a check of oxygen fraction will indicate whether the gas has changed (the <b>other</b> <b>components</b> are inert). Any unusual smells would be {{an indication that the}} cylinder or gas was contaminated at the time of filling. However some authorities recommend releasing most of the contents and storing cylinders with a small positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} motherboards, the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the <b>other</b> <b>components</b> did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the headphone jack {{was moved to the}} bottom of the device, preventing the headphone wire from draping across the screen.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{nutritional}} {{significance of these}} components is defined not only by their structure or macronutrient category, {{but also by the}} physiological role that each nutrient serves. As a quantitatively minor presence within milk, MFGM likely contributes little to energy production, but its constituents may confer structural and functional benefits. Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within the gut, brain, and elsewhere in the body; the functions of <b>other</b> <b>components</b> are still being elucidated.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to making secretory proteins, the rough ER makes membranes that grows in place from {{the addition of}} proteins and phospholipids. As polypeptides intended to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are inserted into the ER membrane itself and are kept there by their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER also produces its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes built into the ER membrane assemble phospholipids. The ER membrane expands and can be transferred by transport vesicles to <b>other</b> <b>components</b> of the endomembrane system.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is {{a complex}} structure comprising a bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause, magnetotail, magnetodisk, and <b>other</b> <b>components.</b> The magnetic field around Jupiter emanates {{from a number of}} different sources, including fluid circulation at the planet's core (the internal field), electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and the currents flowing at the boundary of the planet's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is embedded within the plasma of the solar wind, which carries the interplanetary magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|On 15 May 2003, AgustaWestland {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Bell Helicopter to undertake final assembly of the US101 in the U.S. Under the pact, AgustaWestland would produce the main rotor blades and main fuselage sections at its Yeovil, UK, facility. The company would also manufacture <b>other</b> <b>components,</b> including the gearbox, at its Cascina Costa, Italy facility; this represents a work share of 36 per cent. The remaining 64 per cent work share was split between Lockheed Martin (31 per cent) and Bell Helicopter (27 per cent) and other firms (6 per cent).|$|E
5|$|Plutonium–uranium, {{with about}} 15–30mol.% plutonium, {{can be used}} as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors. Its {{pyrophoric}} nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self-igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with <b>other</b> <b>components.</b> Addition of aluminium, carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly, zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well. Addition of titanium and/or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy.|$|E
5|$|Speaking is {{the default}} {{modality}} for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and <b>other</b> <b>components</b> of the vocal apparatus, {{the ability to}} acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language. The study of the genetic bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is FOXP2, which may cause a kind of congenital language disorder if affected by mutations.|$|E

5|$|The Special Commission for Name Change (Ad Değiştirme İhtisas Komisyonu) {{was created}} under the {{supervision}} of the Ministry of the Interior. It brought together professors, politicians, generals, linguists, and academicians throughout Turkey to take up the task of official name changing. Among the commission's participants were members of the Office of the General Staff, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Education, and history and geography professors from Ankara University. The initiative proved successful, as approximately 28,000 topographic names were changed, including 12,211 village and town names and 4,000 mountain, river, and other topographic names. This figure also included names of streets, monuments, quarters, neighborhoods, and <b>other</b> <b>components</b> that make up certain municipalities.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria {{was widely}} {{used as an}} entheogen {{by many of the}} {{indigenous}} peoples of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking peoples of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of A.muscaria use among the Tungusic and Turkic peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of A.muscaria was not practised by these peoples. In western Siberia, the use of A.muscaria was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, A.muscaria was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously. In eastern Siberia, the shaman would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine. This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the A.muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for <b>other</b> <b>components</b> in the mushroom.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{increase}} in the domestic manufacturing industry {{there was still a}} significant shortfall in many items. In part this was due to the priority that military consumption and production necessarily had over civilian, however, there was also a considerable scarcity of raw materials and <b>other</b> <b>components</b> required for manufacturing. This was due both to the lack of shipping available from the United Kingdom, as well as the limitations placed upon the flow of such goods from Britain due to their own increased requirements. The result of this was inflationary. Domestic prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased considerably.|$|E
