25|$|Saffron {{contains}} more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also has many nonvolatile active components, {{many of which are}} carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, lycopene, and various α- and β-carotenes. However, saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of α-crocin. This crocin is trans-crocetin di-(β-D-gentiobiosyl) ester; it bears the systematic (IUPAC) name 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin. Crocins themselves are a series of hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin. Crocetin is a conjugated polyene dicarboxylic acid that is hydrophobic, and thus <b>oil-soluble.</b> When crocetin is esterified with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are sugars, a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant α-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may comprise more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make α-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.|$|E

50|$|Two {{formulations}} of different dispersing agents for oil spills, Dispersit and Omni-Clean, are shown below. A key {{difference between the}} two is that Omni-Clean uses ionic surfactants and Dispersit uses entirely non-ionic surfactants. Omni-Clean was formulated for little or no toxicity toward the environment. Dispersit, however, was designed as a competitor with Corexit. Dispersit contains non-ionic surfactants, which permit both primarily <b>oil-soluble</b> and primarily water-soluble surfactants. The partitioning of surfactants between the phases allows for effective dispersion.|$|E
50|$|Surfactants {{are usually}} organic {{compounds}} that are amphiphilic, meaning they contain both hydrophobic groups (their tails) and hydrophilic groups (their heads). Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or <b>oil-soluble)</b> component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse {{in water and}} adsorb at interfaces between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.|$|E
5000|$|Aioli is, like mayonnaise, an {{emulsion}} or {{suspension of}} small globules {{of oil and}} <b>oil-soluble</b> compounds in water and water-soluble compounds.

50|$|Antistatic {{agents are}} also added to some {{military}} jet fuels, and to nonpolar organic solvents, to impart electrical conductivity {{to them and}} avoid buildup of static charge {{that could lead to}} sparks igniting fuel vapors. Stadis 450 is the agent added to some distillate fuels, commercial jet fuels, and to the military JP-8. Stadis 425 and Dorf Ketal's SR 1795 are similar compounds, for use in distillate fuels. Statsafe products are used in non-fuel applications. Antis DF3, similar to Stadis 425, is an amber-colored liquid composed of polyamine and polysulfone. <b>Oil-soluble</b> sulfonic acids, e.g. dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, can be also used as part of some antistatic additives.|$|E
50|$|Decoction is {{a method}} of {{extraction}} by boiling herbal or plant material to dissolve the chemicals of the material, which may include stems, roots, bark and rhizomes. Decoction involves first mashing the plant material to allow for maximum dissolution, and then boiling in water to extract oils, volatile organic compounds and other various chemical substances. Decoction {{can be used to}} make herbal teas, leaf teas, coffees, tinctures and similar solutions. Decoctions and infusions may produce liquids with differing chemical properties as the temperature and/or preparation difference may result in more <b>oil-soluble</b> chemicals in decoctions versus infusions. The process can also be applied to meats and vegetables to prepare bouillon or stock,though the term is typically only used to describe boiled plant extracts, usually for medicinal or scientific purposes.|$|E
50|$|In {{organic solvent}} extraction, {{aromatic}} compounds {{as well as}} other hydrophobic soluble substances such as wax and pigments are also obtained. The extract is subjected to vacuum processing, which removes the solvent for re-use. The process can last anywhere from hours to months. Fragrant compounds for woody and fibrous plant materials are often obtained in this matter as are all aromatics from animal sources. The technique {{can also be used to}} extract odorants that are too volatile for distillation or easily denatured by heat. The remaining waxy mass is known as a concrete, which is a mixture of essential oil, waxes, resins, and other lipophilic (<b>oil-soluble)</b> plant material, since these solvents effectively remove all hydrophobic compounds in the raw material. The solvent is then removed by a lower temperature distillation process and reclaimed for re-use.|$|E
5000|$|C16 - C18 linear olefins {{find their}} primary {{application}} as the hydrophobes in <b>oil-soluble</b> surfactants and as lubricating fluids themselves. C16 - C18 alpha or internal olefins {{are used as}} synthetic drilling fluid base for high value, primarily off-shore synthetic drilling fluids. The preferred materials for the synthetic drilling fluid application are linear internal olefins, which are primarily made by isomerizing linear alpha-olefins to an internal position. The higher internal olefins appear to form a more lubricious layer at the metal surface and are recognized as a better lubricants. Another significant application for C16 - C18 olefins is in paper sizing. Linear alpha olefins are, once again, isomerized into linear internal olefins are then reacted with maleic anhydride to make an alkyl succinic anhydride(ASA), a popular paper sizing chemical.|$|E

50|$|The {{drying process}} is {{accelerated}} by certain metal salts, especially derivatives of cobalt, manganese, or iron. In technical terms, these oil drying agents are coordination complexes that function as homogeneous catalysts. These salts {{are derived from}} the carboxylates of lipophilic carboxylic acids, such as naphthenic acids to make the complexes <b>oil-soluble.</b> These catalysts speed up {{the reduction of the}} hydroperoxide intermediates. A series of addition reactions ensues. Each step produces additional free radicals, which then engage in further crosslinking. The process finally terminates when pairs of free radicals combine. The polymerization occurs over a period of days to years and renders the film dry to the touch. Premature action of the drying agents causes skinning of the paint, this undesirable process is suppressed by the addition of antiskinning agents such as methylethyl ketone oxime, which evaporate when the paint/oil is applied to a surface.|$|E
50|$|Drug Delivery Solutions Limited, the Leatherhead {{daughter}} {{company of}} MC2 biotech, {{has developed a}} new method for drug formulation and delivery.

40|$|Introduction. A {{possible}} {{therapeutic effect}} of diagnostic tubal patency testing has been debated {{in the literature}} for half a century.

Historically a variety of agents {{have been used to}} “flush” the fallopian tubes, although tubal flushing does not currently form part of routine practice in the treatment of fertility delay. Target of the study. To evaluate the effect of flushing a woman's fallopian tubes with oil- or water-soluble contrast media on subsequent pregnancy outcomes in couples with infertility. Materials and methods. Eight randomised controlled trials were identified and included in this review. A further one randomised controlled trial is ongoing. All trials were assessed for quality criteria. The studied outcomes were pregnancy, live birth (and ongoing pregnancy), miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, treatment complications including pain, intravasation of contrast medium, infection and haemorrhage, and image quality. Results. Tubal flushing with <b>oil-soluble</b> media versus no intervention was associated with {{a significant increase in the}} odds of pregnancy (OR 3. 57, 95 %CI 1. 76 - 7. 23). There were no data from RCTs to assess tubal flushing with water-soluble media versus no intervention. Tubal flushing with <b>oil-soluble</b> media was associated with a significant increase in the odds of live birth versus tubal flushing with water-soluble media (OR 1. 49, 95 %CI 1. 05 - 2. 11) but the odds of pregnancy showed no significant difference (OR 1. 23, 95 %CI 0. 95 - 1. 60) and there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity for these two outcomes. The addition of <b>oil-soluble</b> media to flushing with water-soluble media (water-soluble plus <b>oil-soluble</b> media versus water- soluble media alone) showed no significant difference in the odds of pregnancy (OR 1. 16, 95 %CI 0. 78 - 1. 70) or live birth (OR 1. 06, 95 %CI 0. 64 - 1. 77). Conclusions. There is some evidence of effectiveness of tubal flushing with <b>oil-soluble</b> contrast media in increasing the odds of pregnancy versus no intervention. The limited evidence of an increase in the odds of live birth from tubal flushing with <b>oil-soluble</b> contrast media versus water-soluble contrast media must be interpreted cautiously. Further robust randomised trials, comparing <b>oil-soluble</b> versus water-soluble media and comparing each versus no intervention, are required to provide convincing evidence as to whether the technique should be accepted into widespread clinical practice.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{possible}} {{therapeutic effect}} of diagnostic tubal patency testing has been debated {{in the literature}} for half a century. Further debate surrounds whether <b>oil-soluble</b> or water-soluble contrast media might have the bigger fertility-enhancing effect. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of flushing a woman's fallopian tubes with oil- or water-soluble contrast media on subsequent fertility outcomes in couples with infertility. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's specialised register of trials (searched 31 January 2007), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstract and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised trials comparing tubal flushing with <b>oil-soluble</b> contrast media or tubal flushing with water-soluble media or with no treatment in women with subfertility. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials. MAIN RESULTS: Twelve trials involving 2079 participants were included. Tubal flushing with <b>oil-soluble</b> media versus no intervention {{was associated with a}} significant increase in the odds of live birth (Peto OR 2. 98, 95 % CI 1. 40 to 6. 37) and of pregnancy (Peto OR 3. 30, 95 % CI 2. 00 to 5. 43). For the comparison of tubal flushing with <b>oil-soluble</b> media versus tubal flushing with water-soluble media, the increase in the odds of live birth for tubal flushing with <b>oil-soluble</b> versus water-soluble media (Peto OR 1. 49, 95 % CI 1. 05 to 2. 11) was based on two trials where statistical heterogeneity was present and the higher quality trial showed no significant difference; there was no evidence of a significant difference in the odds of pregnancy (Peto OR 1. 21, 95 % CI 0. 95 to 1. 54). The addition of <b>oil-soluble</b> media to flushing with water-soluble media showed no evidence of a significant difference in the odds of pregnancy (Peto OR 1. 28, 95 % CI 0. 92 to 1. 79) or live birth (Peto OR 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 64 to 1. 77). There were no serious adverse event reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence of effectiveness of tubal flushing with <b>oil-soluble</b> contrast media in increasing the odds of pregnancy and live birth versus no intervention.
