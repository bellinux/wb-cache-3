40|$|The {{semantics}} of OCL <b>operation</b> <b>specifications</b> {{is discussed}} from a model theoretic perspective. It {{is argued that}} the semantics of <b>operation</b> <b>specifications</b> as defined in the OCL 2. 0 proposal is not compatible with the view of <b>operation</b> <b>specifications</b> as contracts between a client and a supplier. As a solution, a semantics of OCL <b>operation</b> <b>specifications</b> based on standard model theory is presented. This semantics introduces {{the concept of a}} model over a UML class signature — which is a labelled transition system with output — together with a notion of the satisfiability of an OCL <b>operation</b> <b>specification</b> w. r. t. a model. The models respect the OCL features for methods with and without results, constructors, and queries. Regarding inheritance, the combination of several OCL <b>operation</b> <b>specifications</b> is introduced based on a lattice structure on models with respect to generalisation and refinement. Satisfiability is parametric in the underlying signature, and thus the notion can be transferred from UML class signatures to signatures including invariants. ...|$|R

In 1998, ARI moved to John Wayne/Orange County Airport (SNA) in Irvine, California. During this period, ARI grew into a well-respected aircraft management company, operating heavy and midsize jets (including such models as G-II, G-III, and G-IV from Gulfstream, the Challenger 601 from Bombardier, and the Hawker 800/700 from Hawker Beechcraft). As its fleet expanded to include heavy jets, ARI obtained World Wide <b>Operations</b> <b>Specifications</b> and, thus, created a foundation for global expansion.|$|E

5000|$|Aircraft {{maintenance}} {{checks are}} periodic inspections {{that have to}} be done on all commercial/civil aircraft after {{a certain amount of time}} or usage; military aircraft normally follow specific maintenance programmes which may or may not be similar to those of commercial/civil operators. Airlines and other commercial operators of large or turbine-powered aircraft follow a continuous inspection program approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States, or by other airworthiness authorities such as Transport Canada or the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Under FAA oversight, each operator prepares a Continuous Airworthiness Maintenance Program (CAMP) under its <b>Operations</b> <b>Specifications</b> or [...] "OpSpecs".The CAMP includes both routine and detailed inspections. Airlines and airworthiness authorities casually refer to the detailed inspections as [...] "checks", commonly one of the following: A check, B check, C check, or D check.

Due to growth in commercial, financial, and Internet-based applications, decimal floating point arithmetic is now attracting more attention and hardware support for decimal operations is being considered by various computer manufacturers. In order to standardize decimal number formats and <b>operations,</b> <b>specifications</b> for decimal floatingpoint arithmetic {{have been added to}} the draft revision of the IEEE- 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE- 754 R). This paper presents an efficient arithmetic algorithm and hardware design for decimal floating-point square root. This design uses an optimized piecewise linear approximation, a modified Newton-Raphson iteration, a specialized rounding technique, and a modified decimal multiplier. Synthesis results show that a 64 -bit (16 -digit) implementation of decimal square root, which is compliant with IEEE- 754 R, has an estimated critical path delay of 0. 95 ns and a maximum latency of 210 clock cycles when implemented using a sequential multiplier and LSI Logic’s 0. 11 micron Gflx-P standard cell library. ...|$|E

The multiple-criteria analysis is an effective methodology for helping foresters decide what system to apply depending on their <b>operations</b> <b>specifications.</b> Four harvesting methods were compared in Western Australian Eucalypt plantations including cut-to-length (CTL), in-field chipping using a delimbing and debarking flail integrated with the chipper (IFC-DDC), in-field chipping using a chipper with a separate flail machine for delimbing and debarking (IFC-F/C) and whole tree to roadside (WTR). The decision criterions consisted of total operating cost (from stand to mill gate), yield per ha, harvesting residues, fuel consumption and bark content of the chips. The Promethee method {{was used to evaluate}} the alternatives using Decision Lab software. Based on the results, the IFC-DCC was the best harvest method while WTR method was the worst harvesting alternative in the case study area.

40|$|Today, {{the threat}} {{perception}} is changing. Not only for countries {{but also for}} defence organisations like NATO, new threat perception is pointing terrorism. Many countries ’ air forces become responsible of fighting against terorism or Counter-Insurgency (COIN) Operations. Different from conventional warfare, alternative weapon or weapon systems are required for such operatioins. In counter-terrorism operations modern fighter jets are used as well as helicopters, subsonic jets, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), turboprop aircraft, baloons and similar platforms. Succes and efficiency {{of the use of}} these platforms can be determined by evaluating the conditions, the threats and the area together. Obviously, each platform has advantages and disadvantages for different cases. In this research, examples of turboprop aircraft usage against terrorism and with a more general approach, turboprop aircraft for Close Air Support (CAS) missions from all around the world are reviewed. Đn this effort, a closer look is taken at the countries using turboprop aircraft in CAS missions while observing the fields these aircraft are used in, type of <b>operations,</b> <b>specifications</b> of the aircraft, cost and the maintenance factors. Thus, an idea about the convenience of using these aircraft in such operations can be obtained. A SWOT analysis of turboprop aircraft in CAS operations is performed. This study shows that turboprop aircraft are suitable to be used in counter-terrorism and COIN operations in low threat environment and is cost benefical compared to jets...|$|E
40|$|IFR) traffic, Air Traffic Control (ATC) {{must rely}} on pilots to use charted airport {{sketches}} and diagrams as well as standard instrument departures (SIDs) and obstacle departure procedures (ODPs). While many charted (and uncharted) departures are based on radar vectors, the bulk of IFR departures in the NAS require pilots to navigate out of the terminal environment to the en route phase. IFR takeoffs and departures are fast-paced phases of flight, and pilots often are overloaded with critical flight information. During takeoff, pilots are busy requesting and receiving clearances, preparing their aircraft for departure, and taxiing to the active runway. During IFR conditions, they are doing this with minimal visibility, {{and they may be}} without constant radio communication if flying out of a non-towered airport. Historically, takeoff minimums for commercial operations have been successively reduced through a combination of improved signage, runway markings and lighting aids, and concentrated pilot training and qualifications. Today at major terminals, some commercial operators with appropriate equipment, pilot qualifications, and approved <b>Operations</b> <b>Specifications</b> (OpsSpecs) may takeoff with visibility as low as runway visual range (RVR) 3, or 300 feet runway visual range. One of the consequences of takeoffs with reduced visibility is that pilots are challenged in maintaining situational awareness during taxi operations. SURFACE MOVEMENT SAFETY One of the biggest safety concerns in aviation is the surface movement accident. As a direct result, the FAA has rapidly expanded the information available to pilots including the addition of taxiway and runway information in FAA publications, particularly the IFR U. S. Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP) booklets and Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) volumes. The FAA has also implemented new procedures and created educational and awareness programs for pilots, air traffic controllers, and ground operators. By focusing resources to attack this problem head on, the FAA hopes to reduce and eventually eliminate surface movement accidents.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I introduce SpecDB, {{a database}} created to represent and host software specifications in a machine-readable format. The specifications represented in SpecDB {{are for the}} purpose of unit testing database operations. A structured representation aids in the processes of both automated software testing and software code generation, based on the actual software specifications. I describe the design of SpecDB, the underlying database that can hold the specifications required for unit testing database <b>operations.</b> <b>Specifications</b> can be fed directly into SpecDB, or, if available, the formal specifications can be translated to the SpecDB representation. An algorithm that translates formal specifications to the SpecDB representation is described. The Z formal specification language has been chosen as an example for the translation algorithm. The outcome of the translation algorithm is a set of machine-readable formal specifications. To demonstrate the use of Sp ecDB, two automated tools are presented. The first automatically generates database constraints from represented business rules in SpecDB. This constraint generator gives the advantage of enforcing some business rules at the database level for better data quality. The second automated application of SpecDB is a reverse engineering tool that logs the actual execution of the program from the code. By Automatically comparing the output of this tool to the specifications in SpecDB, errors of commission are highlighted that might otherwise not be identified. Some errors of commission including coding unspecified behavior together with correct coding of the specifications cannot be discovered through black box testing techniques, since these techniques cannot observe what other modifications or outputs have happened in the background. For example, black box, functional testing techniques cannot identify an error if the software being tested produced the correct specified output but mor e over, sent classified data to insecure locations. Accordingly, the decision of whether a software application passed a test depends on whether it coded all the specifications and only the specifications for that unit. Automated tools, using the reverse engineering application introduced in this dissertation, can thus automatically make the decision whether the software passed a test or not based on the provided specifications...|$|E

40|$|The {{large scale}} of China’s {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{industry and the}} great policy support by the Chinese government make it necessary to scientifically evaluate PV industry policy. This study designed an evaluation framework for China’s PV industry policy from four dimensions (policy measure, policy type, policy strength, and policy issuing department) to categorize and quantify China’s 307 PV industry policies from 1994 to 2016. Furthermore, the historical evolution and realistic effect of the policies on the PV industry in China were examined. The results show that, currently, grid support, <b>operation</b> <b>specification,</b> and <b>operation</b> supervision are the main policy measures, while a low-level notice is the main type of policy. The policy issued strength is generally low. The enforcement strength of regional policy presents descending trend from the northern to the southern provinces, and a similar trend from coastal provinces to inland provinces. The policy for grid support, <b>operation</b> <b>specification,</b> and technical specification has had the best effect. The most effective policy types are the sector-specific notices and announcements, and the best policy-issuing department is the National Energy Administration.
