5|$|I am now {{satisfied}} that the documents are authentic; {{that the history of}} their wanderings since 1945 is true; and that the standard accounts of Hitler's writing habits, <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality,</b> and even, perhaps, of some public events may, in consequence, have to be revised.|$|E
5|$|Across all his {{bands and}} projects, Townsend has {{released}} twenty-three studio albums and three live albums. Townsend's trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked , {{has been compared}} to the styles of Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. His versatile vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an opera-esque singing, and his songwriting is similarly diverse. Townsend's musical style is rooted in metal, and his albums are written to express different aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality</b> and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E
50|$|Total Drama: Revenge of the Island {{features}} Mike, a teen {{with multiple}} <b>personalities.</b> One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personalities</b> is an adventurous treasure hunter called Manitoba Smith, {{who is a}} direct parody of Indiana Jones, from their first names being locations, to the fedora both characters wear.|$|R

5|$|If Mussorgsky's {{compositions}} {{are destined}} to live unfaded for fifty years after their author's death (when all his works will become the property of any and every publisher), such an archeologically accurate edition will always be possible, as the manuscripts went to the Public Library on leaving me. For the present, though, there was need of an edition for performances, for practical artistic purposes, for making his colossal talent known, {{and not for the}} mere studying <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality</b> and artistic sins.|$|E
5|$|Todd was {{initially}} a short-term villain, but his popularity {{with the audience}} and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison, like most soap operas had done with rapists in the past. While keeping aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality</b> dark or violent, they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion. They took steps to redeem him and made him {{an integral part of}} OLTL canvas, despite Howarth's objections to a redemption storyline. With the use of literary techniques for the redemptive arc, the writers borrowed from nineteenth-century melodrama and Gothic traditions, and literature such as Frankenstein. Todd became the product of an affair between his father, Victor Lord, and his mother, Irene Manning, which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters, including his sisters, Tina and Victoria Lord. An important aspect of the character became his appearance, most notably the scar on his right cheek, which emerged as synonymous with him and served to remind him of his past misdeeds against Marty. Music and the use of humor were also key to Todd's development. Although he formed many relationships (including with his wives, Blair Cramer and Téa Delgado), and fathered children, a defining characteristic <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality</b> was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy.|$|E
5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality.</b> According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
50|$|The Duck Man {{speculates that}} Andrews {{was once a}} mild-mannered person of a psychic {{disposition}} who was mentally overwhelmed by the other souls. He is generally {{regarded as one of}} the most consistently sane of the group, as at least five <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personalities</b> are capable <b>of</b> holding a sensible conversation with other people. <b>His</b> <b>personalities</b> 'voted' to decide whether to act as street vendors of The Ankh Morpork Times (in The Truth) and Andrews held up five fingers to indicate the outcome <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personalities' decision.|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{influence}} on events, {{it was more}} than Napoleon's personality that took effect. He reorganized France itself to supply the men and money needed for wars. He inspired his men—Wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers, for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals. He also unnerved the enemy. At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806, King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000; however, when he was told, mistakenly, that Napoleon was in command, he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout. The force <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality</b> neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with Napoleon in charge they would surely win.|$|E
5|$|In the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Beveridge liked Sasuke's personality, {{particularly}} {{as it was}} presented during his dialogue with Naruto. Reviewing the anime adaptation, Sam Stewart from IGN was particularly impressed by the scenes between Sasuke and Sarada, most notably because of changes in Sasuke's characterization. He highlights that despite acting coldly towards his daughter, he ends up using his body as a shield {{to protect her from}} his enemy. Ken Iikura from Anime Now agreed, pointing out that Sasuke has become a loving husband and father in Boruto, despite retaining some of the dark aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality.</b> Ikikura noted that Sasuke and Sarada's meeting in Boruto significantly developed both characters. McNulty disliked the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series, because she felt it was initially an one-sided crush on Sakura's part, but she believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden expanded on the bond between the two and their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Stewart praised Sasuke's portrayal as a flawed parent rather than an effortlessly good one, noting that his farewell to Sarada demonstrated his difficulty with being a good father. Another writer from Anime Now, Sarah Nelkin, noted that these episodes helped to develop Sasuke as both a father and a husband, especially when he explains to Sarada that she creates a bond between him and Sakura that persists despite his being frequently absent {{as a result of his}} mission.|$|E
5|$|Zack {{had only}} a small role in the {{original}} Final Fantasy VII. He is first mentioned by name in Gongaga, his hometown, where his parents are oblivious as to what became of him after he left to join SOLDIER, and are worried for his safety after not hearing from him for years. It {{is at this point}} that Aerith explains Zack was her first love. Cloud later realizes that some of his memories and even aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality</b> were actually Zack's, and not his own. Flashbacks reveal that both Zack and Cloud battled Sephiroth after he burned the town of Nibelheim upon discovering he {{was the result of a}} scientific experiment. After Cloud defeated Sephiroth, both Zack and Cloud were taken to be used in experiments by Shinra. Eventually, Zack woke up and was able to escape with a semi-conscious Cloud to the city Midgar, but on the edge of the city, he was gunned down by Shinra troops. While Zack's and Cloud's flashback escape is optional in the North American and European releases of Final Fantasy VII and the Japanese International version, it was originally planned to be shown once Cloud discovered the results of Shinra's experiments.|$|E

Grahf is beaten and subsequently sacrifices himself to merge with the Zohar and delay the awakening of Deus, allowing Fei and party to escape and prepare for the final battle.|$|R

25|$|During {{the early}} 1980s the band began having {{increasing}} trouble working {{together as a}} cohesive unit. According to Gene Simmons' book Kiss and Make-Up, Van Halen approached Simmons in 1982 about possibly joining Kiss to replace Ace Frehley, chiefly because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality</b> conflicts with Roth. Simmons and Alex persuaded Eddie to remain in Van Halen, while Kiss replaced Frehley with Vinnie Vincent.|$|E
25|$|Namco's staff created Luke to be {{a flawed}} person who, despite being unlikable because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality,</b> would mature across the game. He was {{designed}} by Kōsuke Fujishima who wanted his appearance to show his laziness, a sense of fashion, {{as well as the}} fact he practises martial arts. He has been voiced in Japanese by Chihiro Suzuki and in English by Yuri Lowenthal.|$|E

25|$|Barks, {{with a note}} of {{skepticism}} often found in his stories, explained the zombie as a living person who has never died, but has somehow gotten {{under the influence of}} a sorcerer. Although some scenes of the story were intended as a parody of Bela Lugosi's White Zombie, the story is the first to not only focus on Scrooge's past but also touch on the darkest aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} of the King of France and the claims he made against the Pope give an indication of his power, but also <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality</b> and of the methods {{he was willing to}} use. After the withdrawal of his ambassador from Rome, he expelled the papal nuncio in France, proceeded to annex the French papal territories of Avignon with the Comtat Venaissin, and threatened to invade Rome if AlexanderVII failed to apologize and bow to his wishes.|$|E
25|$|Mickey {{generally}} appears {{alongside his}} girlfriend Minnie Mouse, his pet dog Pluto, his friends Donald Duck and Goofy, and his nemesis Pete, among others (see Mickey Mouse universe). Though originally {{characterized as a}} mischievous antihero, Mickey was rebranded over time as an everyman, usually seen as a flawed, but adventurous hero. In 2009, Disney began to rebrand the character again by putting less emphasis on his pleasant, cheerful side and reintroducing the more mischievous and adventurous sides <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality,</b> beginning with the video game Epic Mickey.|$|E

25|$|Ögedei was {{considered}} to be his father's favorite son, ever since his childhood. As an adult, he was known for his ability to sway doubters in any debate in which he was involved, simply by the force <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality.</b> He was a physically big, jovial, and very charismatic man, who seemed mostly to be interested in enjoying good times. He was intelligent and steady in character. His charisma was partially credited for his success in keeping the Mongol Empire on the path that his father had set.|$|E
25|$|Marshall had charm, humor, a quick intelligence, and {{the ability}} to bring men together. His sincerity and {{presence}} commanded attention. His opinions were workmanlike and not especially eloquent or subtle. His influence on learned men of the law came from the charismatic force <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality</b> and his ability to seize upon the key elements of a case and make highly persuasive arguments. Together with his vision of the future greatness of the nation, these qualities are apparent in his historic decisions and gave him the sobriquet, The Great Chief Justice.|$|E
25|$|Cavendish was a shy man who {{was uncomfortable}} in society and avoided it when he could. He conversed little, always dressed in an old-fashioned suit, and {{developed}} no known deep personal attachments outside his family. Cavendish was taciturn and solitary and regarded by many as eccentric. He only communicated with his female servants by notes. By one account, Cavendish had a back staircase added to his house {{in order to avoid}} encountering his housekeeper because he was especially shy of women. The contemporary accounts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>personality</b> have led some modern commentators, such as Oliver Sacks, to speculate that he had Asperger syndrome, though he may merely have been anthropophobic.|$|E
