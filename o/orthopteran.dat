5|$|The abdomen is {{the largest}} tagma of the insect, which {{typically}} consists of 11â€“12 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated {{from each other and}} from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward {{reduction in the number of}} the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6. The <b>orthopteran</b> family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented abdomen.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} mating on female fitness may vary {{depending}} upon the kind of benefit that the females receive from males through of their choices. Direct benefits include nutritional resources {{to be used by}} females, donation of foods to mates, males offering prey to the female, seen in scorpion flies and dance flies. Several <b>orthopteran</b> species, butterflies, flies, and beetle males can donate secretions or nutritional substances to the females which are transferred in the ejaculate or produced by male glands which can contribute to increase female fecundity. In the green-veined white (Pieris napi), a virgin male can transfer an ejaculate containing 14% nitrogen by dry mass. Females utilize the nutrients transferred from the male in order to increase their nutrients. These nutrients essentially contribute to ensure successful egg production. A positive relationship between the amount of ejaculate material received and lifetime reproductive output, as male-transferred material increases female longevity. Male-transferred material also increases female longevity. In some insect species, males can donate some body parts to females such as the leg spurs or the fleshy hindwings of jumped-winged crickets, or they may be completely cannibalized, as occurs in mantis and some dipterous, as well as in some Arachnida scorpions and spider species.|$|E

50|$|They subsist on {{an insect}} diet, which {{consists}} mainly of <b>orthopterans,</b> beetles and ants. Their full diet encompasses various orders (10 recorded) of arthropods. They also eat millipedes, which other lizard taxa tend to avoid. Gut contents reveal many ants (92% of items) and some beetles (4%). A {{large volume of}} <b>orthopterans</b> is consumed (27%), followed by beetles (26%) and ants (18%).

2500|$|Amber {{specimen}} JZC Bu116 has {{a larger}} number of workers than JZC Bu1814, with a total of twelve workers belonging to two genera. [...] Eleven of the ants are G. spiralis and the remaining worker is from the haidomyrmecine species Haidomyrmex zigrasi. [...] The amber is broken into two portions and has been polished. [...] The original amber piece that the specimen was from was likely larger, and the twelve ants are only a minimum number for what the grouping was. [...] A large number of other arthropods are preserved in the amber with the ants, including several other hymenopteran families, a dermapteran, an <b>orthopteran,</b> seven dipterans, two arachnids, a myriapod, and a large blattodean. [...] The blattodean is central to four of the ants, three G. sprialis and the H. zigrasi worker, suggesting the roach may have been either a potential food source, or one being actively foraged on. [...] Due to a lack of orientation to the roach however, the possibility that the other eight G. sprialis were recruited to the prey blattodean is not clear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{relationship}} between <b>orthopterans</b> and humanity has multiple faces. They are excellent {{subjects of research}} {{in all areas of}} biology, but they may be from a mild nuisance to formidable enemies {{as in the case of}} plague locusts. However, many species have been since long ago, providers of aesthetic pleasure, nutrition and folk medicine practices.

50|$|Lizards in the Xenosaurus genus are {{exclusively}} {{found in}} crevices. Such a lifestyle {{suggests that the}} diets of these lizards might be opportunistic, and they eat whatever crawls or flies past or into their crevice. Their diet consists primarily of insects, but occasional lizard prey are taken. Their most frequent prey includes coleopterans (beetles), dipterans (flies), <b>orthopterans</b> (insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, weta, and locusts), and myriapods (terrestrial arthropods such as millipedes and centipedes). On the basis of number, they consume the most dipterans, but {{on the basis of}} volume, they consume the most <b>orthopterans.</b>|$|R
