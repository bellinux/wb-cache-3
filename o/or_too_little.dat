Fruit bodies change their geotropic response three times during their development, which helps ensure that the teeth ultimately point downward for optimum spore release. The pure culture, cell division and the ultrastructure of A.vulgares hyphae and mycelia have been studied and described in search of potentially useful characters for phylogenetic analysis. When grown in culture, the fungus can be induced to produce fruit bodies under suitable conditions.|$|E
5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, too much <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.|$|E

Skin may either appear lighter, or darker than normal, or lack pigmentation at all; there may be blotchy, uneven areas, patches of brown to gray discoloration or freckling. Apart from blood-related conditions such as jaundice, carotenosis, or argyria, skin pigmentation disorders generally occur because the body produces either too much <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> melanin.|$|E

Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl) and is used in food for both preservation and flavor. Sodium ions are needed in small quantities by most living things, as are chloride ions. Salt is involved in regulating the water content (fluid balance) of the body. The sodium ion itself is used for electrical signaling in the nervous system.|$|E

However, like all essential elements and nutrients, too much <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> nutritional ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.|$|E
25|$|A {{reason that}} our galaxy is {{considered}} rare by Rare Earth {{is because it}} appears to have suffered fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, and its peaceful history may have made it more hospitable to complex life than galaxies which have suffered more collisions, and consequently more supernovae and other disturbances. The level of activity of the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way may also be important: too much <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> and the conditions for life may be even rarer. The Milky Way black hole appears to be just right. The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with a period of 226 Ma (1 Ma=1 million years), one closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in gravitationally aligned orbits, so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years. Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.|$|E

2500|$|Workability is {{the ability}} of a fresh (plastic) {{concrete}} mix to fill the form/mold properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of hydration) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or segregation of aggregates (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork, <b>or</b> which has <b>too</b> few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, <b>or</b> using <b>too</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>too</b> much sand for the same reason, <b>or</b> using <b>too</b> <b>little</b> water, <b>or</b> <b>too</b> much cement, <b>or</b> even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles.

500|$|Neonatal {{circumcision}} {{is generally}} safe when done by an experienced practitioner. The most common acute complications are bleeding, infection and {{the removal of}} either too much <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> foreskin. [...] These complications occur in approximately 0.12% of procedures, and constitute the vast majority of all acute circumcision complications in the United States. [...] Minor complications are reported to occur in three percent of procedures. Severe complications are rare. A specific complication rate is difficult to determine due to scant data on complications and inconsistencies in their classification. Complication rates are greater when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or when the child is at an older age. Significant acute complications happen rarely, occurring in about 1 in 500 newborn procedures in the United States. Severe to catastrophic complications, including death, are so rare that they are reported only as individual case reports. Other possible complications include buried penis, chordee, phimosis, skin bridges, urethral fistulas, and meatal stenosis. These complications may be avoided with proper technique, and are most often treatable without requiring a hospital visit.|$|E

500|$|Evidence {{supports}} that male circumcision {{reduces the risk}} of HIV infection among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the WHO recommends considering circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention program in areas with high rates of HIV such as sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence for a health benefit against HIV for {{men who have sex with}} men is less clear. Likewise, the effectiveness of using circumcision to prevent HIV in the developed world is also unclear. Circumcision is associated with reduced rates of cancer causing forms of human papillomavirus (HPV), UTIs, and cancer of the penis. Prevention of those conditions is not a justification for routine circumcision of infants. Studies of its potential protective effects against other sexually transmitted infections have been unclear. A 2010 review found circumcisions performed by medical providers to have a typical complication rate of 1.5% for babies and 6% for older children, with few cases of severe complications. Bleeding, infection, and the removal of either too much <b>or</b> <b>too</b> <b>little</b> foreskin are the most common complications cited.
