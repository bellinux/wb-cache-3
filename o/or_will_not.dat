5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> interbreed.|$|E
25|$|Looking for {{mutations}} in the ATM gene of an unrelated person (for example, the spouse of a known A-T carrier) presents significant challenges. Genes often have variant spellings (polymorphisms) {{which do not}} affect function. In a gene as large as ATM, such variant spellings are likely to occur and doctors cannot always predict whether a specific variant will <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> cause disease. Genetic counseling can help family members of an A-T patient understand what can or cannot be tested, and how the test results should be interpreted.|$|E
25|$|Bonsai are {{sometimes}} marketed or promoted as house plants, {{but few of}} the traditional bonsai species can thrive or even survive inside a typical house. Most bonsai are located out of doors. The best guideline to identifying a suitable growing environment for a bonsai is its native hardiness. If the bonsai grower can closely replicate the full year's temperatures, relative humidity, and sunlight, the bonsai should do well. In practice, this means that trees from a hardiness zone closely matching the grower's location will generally be the easiest to grow, and others will require more work <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be viable at all.|$|E

25|$|Statistical {{discrimination}} in the workplace is unintentional discrimination based on the presumed probability that a worker will <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> remain with the company {{for a long period}} of time. Specific to women, since employers believe that women are more likely to drop out of the labor force to have kids, or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for upward mobility to begin with based on these same stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|Red {{blood cells}} {{may be given}} {{as part of a}} blood transfusion. Blood may be donated from another person, or stored by the {{recipient}} at an earlier date. Donated blood usually requires screening to ensure that donors do not contain risk factors for the presence of blood-borne diseases, <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> suffer themselves by giving blood. Blood is usually collected and tested for common or serious Blood-borne diseases including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV. The blood type (A, B, AB, or O) or the blood product is identified. This relates to the presence of antigens on the cell's surface. After this process, the blood is stored, and within a short duration is used. Blood can be given as a whole product or the red blood cells separated as packed red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|The bus {{functions}} as a convenient form of public transportation for the wizard or witch who cannot <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> choose another means of transportation. The riders are seemingly {{picked up by the}} bus from all over in-universe Great Britain, bringing passengers to the destinations of their choice with seemingly no set route. It bolts through the streets entirely invisible to Muggles and causes other objects to dodge it (instead of the other way around) for short distance-travel. For longer distances, the Knight Bus makes hundred-mile (160km) leaps, accompanied by a great bang and jolt. The interior of the bus changes depending on the time of day, having seats by day and beds by night. It is also highly uncomfortable, according to Ron and Harry. Its only mentioned limitation in travelling is that it is unable to voyage through water.|$|E

25|$|In Shakespeare's version, Lear, King of Britain, {{is growing}} old, {{and decides to}} divide his kingdom among his three daughters – Goneril, wife of the Duke of Albany, Regan, wife of the Duke of Cornwall, and the {{youngest}} daughter, Cordelia, sought in marriage by the Duke of Burgundy and the King of France. The King decides that he will give {{the best part of}} the kingdom to the daughter who loves him most, and asks his three daughters to state how much they love him. Goneril and Regan make hypocritical, flattering speeches, and are rewarded with a third each; Cordelia, however, cannot <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> stoop to false flattery for gain, and tells her father that she loves him as much as she should, and that she will love her husband as well if she marries. Enraged, the King disinherits and disowns his once-favourite child, and divides her portion between her two elder sisters. The loyal Earl of Kent speaks up boldly to defend Cordelia, and is banished by the furious King. The Duke of Burgundy withdraws his suit on finding Cordelia deprived of a dowry, but the King of France gladly accepts her as his bride.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the program}} {{received}} widespread support in Congress, Treasury officials opposed it. In a letter, Treasury secretary W.Michael Blumenthal wrote, [...] "I {{do not believe}} the U.S. Government should permit the erroneous impression to be created that it cannot <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> take the necessary steps to combat inflation and that the public therefore needs to buy gold as a hedge against inflation." [...] Blumenthal also believed that if the government were to sanction the striking of gold medallions, the public would believe that the Treasury was actively encouraging investment in gold. Despite these objections, the bill was attached to the bank omnibus bill, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law on November 10, 1978.|$|E

500|$|After the 1966 smog, [...] "the {{consequences}} of state inaction were apparent {{to the naked}} eye," [...] public outcry intensified, {{and the demand for}} federal intervention increased. New Jersey passed several new air-pollution laws in 1967. Nevertheless, traffic and drifting polluted air from New Jersey remained a major contributor to New York City's pollution problem. Edward Teller — the physicist known for his role in developing the hydrogen bomb and an advisor to Mayor Lindsay on pollution and energy issues—advocated for New York state to adopt stricter sulfur fuel standards than the city. A leader of the advocacy group Citizens for Cleaner Air criticized the local and state governments at a state public hearing, calling the city's enforcement [...] "in a state of collapse" [...] and, saying the city acting alone [...] "cannot <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> enforce any standard or rule," [...] demanded that the state government increase its role.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{had given}} the American teams {{until the end of}} January 1996 to decide whether they would return for the 1996 season. By then, sources were stating that four of the five American teams had [...] "either folded, have no stadiums to play in <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be {{permitted}} {{to be part of the}} CFL in 1996". Only the Stallions appeared to be able to take the field in some form for the 1996 season. Of the American owners, Anderson was the most amenable to retaining an American-based team in 1996. While he initially stated that the league needed at least three other American teams for the Texans to be viable, he was willing to bring the Texans back for 1996 if the Stallions moved to Houston, since this would have not only ensured two American teams but also an intrastate rivalry. The proposal would have meant a return to the league's traditional East-West divisional alignment, with San Antonio and Houston both being placed in the East. [...] Anderson estimated that if there was even one other American team in the league, he could withstand annual losses of US$2 million indefinitely. However, that scenario looked less and less likely, as Speros—under prodding from Smith—had begun serious discussions with officials in Montreal.|$|E
500|$|Hoshino {{has been}} highly praised for her art and {{character}} designs. Leroy Douresseaux of Coolstreak Cartoons called Hoshino a [...] "wonderful visualist" [...] and commented that her [...] "highly stylish" [...] art resembled {{the works of}} Joe Madureira, Kelley Jones, and Chris Bachalo. Douresseaux describes the backgrounds as eerie and Lovecraftian and says that Hoshino [...] "makes practically every page a delightful surprise of gothic style and beguiling violence". However, {{he believes that the}} character designs are the [...] "most visually striking" [...] element and comments that the designs and the action scenes are highly imaginative, worth even just an occasional look. The reviewer Charles Tan from ComicsVillage.com feels the art deserves less praise, saying that it is done competently enough to distinguish characters while still providing flashy scenes with the common themes of a shōnen series. Ben Leary, a reviewer from Mania.com, felt even less positive toward the action scenes than Tan. Leary believes that Hoshino simply cannot <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> draw physical combat and instead chooses to rely on energy blasts, swirling wind, and impact bursts. Casey Brienza of Anime News Network agrees. She said that [...] "the battles, even as late in the game as volume twelve, remain practically unintelligible" [...] and {{that it is difficult to}} tell [...] "who is doing what to whom and when." [...] All that could be discerned from Hoshino's [...] "cryptic layouts" [...] is that the characters are fighting. Brienza, however, is positive toward the rest of the art, going as far as to call it [...] "some of the best artwork in the business". She describes Hoshino's drawing style as the [...] "aesthetic yet dynamic, superbly beautiful yet super-violent" [...] style made famous by female manga artist who arose from dōjinshi subculture during the late-80s and early-90s, citing Clamp and Yun Kōga as prominent examples. Brienza also praises Hoshino's character designs, which she claims are [...] "especially lovely and pitched to satisfy fans of both sexes". When asked about how the D.Gray-man could end in poetic justice, Hoshino found this difficult as she believes it should end in a fight unlike other series influence by this style.|$|E
