25|$|The listed train {{shed roof}} which is 105 metres wide between {{platforms}} 1 and 12, has four spans, two spans 185 metres in length over {{the eastern part}} of the station date from the 1860s while the other two at the western side measuring 150 metres long were built in the early 1880s. The roof is supported by masonry walls with round-headed windows alongside platforms 1 and 12 and rows of cast iron columns. The roof spans have wrought iron trusses with cast iron struts on girders between the columns. The original roof was covered with slates with some glazing. The slates were subsequently replaced with boarded felt.

6000|$|I {{never saw}} such an awkward people, with machinery; you see, they were totally unused to it. The miller-gun {{was a little}} double-barreled tube <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass,</b> with a neat little trick of a spring to it, which upon {{pressure}} would let a shot escape. But the shot wouldn't hurt anybody, it would only drop into your hand. In the gun were two sizes--wee mustard-seed shot, and another sort that were several times larger. They were money. The mustard-seed shot represented milrays, the larger ones mills. So the gun was a purse; and very handy, too; you could pay out money in the dark with it, with accuracy; and you could carry it in your mouth; or in your vest pocket, if you had one. I made them of several sizes --one size so large that it would carry {{the equivalent of a}} dollar. Using shot for money was {{a good thing for the}} government; the metal cost nothing, and the money couldn't be counterfeited, for I was the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower.

Yes, and I knew it would still be passing men's lips, away down in the nineteenth century, yet none would suspect how and when it originated.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>toughening</b> <b>glass</b> and ceramics by {{addition of}} a piezoelectric particulate secondary phase {{is the focus of}} current research. It is hypothesised that stress concentrations at the tip of an advancing crack can re-orient piezoelectric domains within the reinforcement {{in the direction of the}} stress field around the crack, thus dissipating energy which contribute to fracture toughness increment of the composite. Previous work has focussed on producing glass/piezoelectric inclusion composites by conventional sintering. This process is accompanied by extended porosity formation, as well as Pb depletion in the PZT phase. In several cases, the long processing times required to fully sinter the glass matrix lead to glass-PZT reactions and to loosing the stoichiometry of the PZT inclusions. In this study, the novel production of new glass matrix composites reinforced with piezoelectric inclusions by using microwave heating was investigated. Specifically, lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) particles in lead silicate and borosilicate glass matrices were considered. Mixtures of glass and PZT powders were prepared and used to fabricate powder compacts by uniaxial cold-pressing. In order to achieve densification, the compacts were subsequently heated in a single mode applicator, connected to a generator operating at the 2. 45 GHz ISM frequency. ...|$|R
50|$|The drops {{are named}} after Prince Rupert of the Rhine, who {{brought them to}} England in 1660, {{although}} they were reportedly being produced in the Netherlands earlier in the 17th century and had probably been known to glassmakers for much longer. They were studied as scientific curiosities by the Royal Society and the unravelling {{of the principles of}} their unusual properties probably {{led to the development of}} the process for the production <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass,</b> patented in 1874. Research carried out in the 20th and 21st centuries shed further light on the reasons for the drops' contradictory properties.|$|E
50|$|The new chassis {{consisted}} of a platform braced with box members bounded by reversed U channelling {{the full length of}} each side. The body was then bolted, not welded, alternately to {{the top and bottom of}} that channelling. The forward end was strengthened by diagonal bracing and the centre given extra strength by the tunnel over the transmission. Windows were <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b> The cylinder head was now aluminium for high compression and output now 32 bhp at 4,000 rpm. Shock absorbers were now hydraulic and of the double acting piston type. Bumpers were now given over-riders, lighting was 12-volt.|$|E
50|$|The {{process for}} the {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> by quenching was probably inspired by {{the study of the}} drops, as it was patented in England by Parisian Francois Barthelemy Alfred Royer de la Bastie, in 1874, just one year after V. De Luynes had published accounts of his experiments with them. It has been known since at least the 19th century that formations similar to Prince Rupert's Drops are produced under certain conditions in volcanic lava. More recently researchers at the University of Bristol and the University of Iceland have studied the glass particles produced by explosive fragmentation of Prince Rupert's drops in the laboratory to better understand magma fragmentation and ash formation driven by stored thermal stresses in active volcanoes.|$|E
50|$|If {{the liquid}} is {{hazardous}} or under pressure, more sophisticated arrangements must be made. In {{the case of}} a boiler, the pressure of the water below and the steam above is equal, so any change in the water level will be seen in the gauge. The transparent tube (the “glass” itself) may be mostly enclosed within a metal or <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> shroud to prevent it from being damaged through scratching or impact and offering protection to the operators in the case of breakage. This usually has a patterned backplate to make the magnifying effect of the water in the tube more obvious and so allow for easier reading. In some locomotives where the boiler is operated at very high pressures, the tube itself would be made <b>of</b> metal-reinforced <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b> It is important to keep the water at the specified level, otherwise the top of the firebox will be exposed, creating an overheat hazard and causing damage and possibly catastrophic failure.|$|R

50|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{to other}} classes of material. Naturally brittle materials, such as glass, are {{not difficult to}} toughen effectively. Most such techniques involve one of two mechanisms: to deflect or absorb {{the tip of a}} propagating crack, or to create carefully controlled residual stresses so that cracks from certain predictable sources will be forced closed. The first principle is used in laminated glass where two sheets of glass are separated by an interlayer of polyvinyl butyral, which as a viscoelastic polymer absorbs the growing crack. The second method is used in <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> and pre-stressed concrete. A demonstration <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>toughening</b> is provided by Prince Rupert's Drop. Brittle polymers can be toughened by using metal particles to initiate crazes when a sample is stressed, a good example being high-impact polystyrene or HIPS. The least brittle structural ceramics are silicon carbide (mainly by virtue of its high strength) and transformation-toughened zirconia.|$|R

50|$|Early {{windshields}} {{were made}} of ordinary window glass, but {{that could lead to}} serious injuries {{in the event of a}} crash. A series of crashes led up to the development of stronger windshields. The most notable example of this is the Pane vs. Ford case of 1917 that decided against Pane in that he was only injured through reckless driving. They were replaced with windshields made <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> and were fitted in the frame using a rubber or neoprene seal. The hardened glass shattered into many mostly harmless fragments when the windshield broke. These windshields, hovever, could shatter from a simple stone chip. In 1919, Henry Ford solved the problem of flying debris by using the new French technology of glass laminating. Windshields made using this process were two layers of glass with a cellulose inner layer. This inner layer held the glass together when it fractured. Between 1919 and 1929, Ford ordered the use of laminated glass on all of his vehicles.|$|E

30|$|A {{new method}} for {{improving}} glass strength {{has been proposed}} and investigated based {{on the surface and}} subsurface conditions of different glass substrates. For borosilicate glasses, 750 -nm-deep nanostructures enhanced the bending strength by 118  % (from 0.28 to 0.61  GPa), and 500 -nm-deep nanostructures enhanced the bending strength by 48  % (from 0.23 to 0.34  GPa) for aluminosilicate glasses. In addition, these nanostructures increased the Weibull modulus of the substrates, which confirmed the usefulness of this method. The nanostructured fused silica with artificial defects that were 4 -μm-deep exhibited nearly the same bending strength as plain fused silica but with a higher Weibull modulus. The number of fragments was higher during fracture, which is consistent with suppression of the artificial defect. Failure <b>of</b> scratch-resistant and <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> is very common in the presence of surface defects, and this newly developed method may improve the performance of all glass types despite different defect densities or the presence of dominant surface flaws.|$|R

A small audience of press and collectors witnessed the burning, and, in one instance, helped Hudson burn his art. The next morning, Holt appeared on BBC Radio to discuss the event. Hudson intended to capture the timeline of the work, some 1000 years since its conception. This was the average total of years since the paintings were done, multiplied by the number of works.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{introduction}} <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> {{into the}} construction industry has had several significant consequences. For the first time, glass panels can be used without continuous edge supports, {{and as a result}} can be used as load-bearing element. An excellent and very common example of the use of glass as structural element is a freestanding glass balustrade. During an undergraduate investigation, a number of impact tests were performed on continuous supported freestanding glass balustrade panels at the University of Stellenbosch [6]. It was observed that none of the balustrade panels complied with the guidelines for impact loading stipulated in the SABS [7] loading standards. The failure to meet the loading requirements highlighted the need to investigate the design of glass balustrades. This thesis describes the investigation undertaken to determine the static- and dynamic loading capacity of freestanding glass balustrades. Following a review of South African and international design standards, the static- and dynamic material properties <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> was established by means of a laboratory test series. The laboratory test series consisted of both a destructive laboratory test series and finite element analysis, the outcome of which determined the static- and dynamic material properties <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b> The series also included the influence of different connection types. A second phase employed the identified material properties <b>of</b> <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> to determine the loading capacity of full-scale balustrades. Using finite elements each balustrade set-up was loaded as required by the relevant South African loading standards. The finite element analyses identified which balustrade set-ups could resist the required imposed loads. Finally, a second laboratory test series was undertaken, the aim of which was to verify the finite element results. The successful resistance of the tested balustrade set-ups confirmed the finite element model. Recommendation to the existing design- and loading standards are made {{based on the results of}} the thesis...|$|E

The new and aged toughened glass insulators' power spectrums are compared to obtain the desired result. The level of confidence for the obtained result is determined by using statistical analysis. It is found that the fundamental, third, fifth and seventh harmonic components have positive results (i. e. the power consumed by these harmonic components increases with the age of the toughened glass insulator).
