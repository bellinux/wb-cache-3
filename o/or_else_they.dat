5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, {{a space station}} located near a stable {{wormhole}} between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy. In this episode, Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) plays a 1960s secret agent alongside Garak (Andrew Robinson) in a holosuite. After a transporter accident makes several other crew members appear as characters in the program, the duo must prevent any of them from dying in the game <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>they</b> will be killed in real life.|$|E
5|$|Slalom is a single-player game {{in which}} players race {{downhill}} {{in a series of}} slalom races. There are 24downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains. Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on difficulty: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts. The goal for each run is to reach the finish line within the allotted time. Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>they</b> will tumble and lose time. With enough momentum, players can jump over these obstacles. Players must ski around flags to maintain their speed. If they ski {{on the wrong side of}} the flag, the racer will snowplow and slow down.|$|E
5|$|Bashir is {{startled to}} see Kira appear as a Russian spy, who {{introduces}} herself as Colonel Anastasia Komananov, KGB. She has no idea who Major Kira is. Eddington informs Bashir and Garak that they can't shut down the program or let the characters die <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>they</b> will lose the patterns of the other crew members. Komananov explains that a scientist called Dr. Noah is planning {{to take over the}} world using lasers to cut into the Earth's crust resulting in the shrinking of the tectonic plates sinking and causing global flooding. Bashir's orders are to rescue Professor Honey Bare (Dax) from Noah. Falcon (O'Brien) attempts to assassinate Bashir, who must stop Komananov from killing him or else O'Brien's pattern will be lost. Bashir, Garak and Komananov go to a casino in Paris to speak to Duchamps (Worf), an associate of Noah. Bashir manages to buy his way into a meeting with Noah after winning the money at cards but the trio are knocked out by Duchamps using a powdered drug.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century English chivalric {{ideas of}} selfless {{service to the}} king had been corrupted. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in {{individual}} estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through {{the support of his}} nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>they</b> might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.|$|E
5|$|As American forces {{continued}} to approach Luzon, the Japanese Imperial High Command ordered that all able-bodied POWs be transported to Japan. From the Cabanatuan camp, over 1,600 soldiers were removed in October1944, leaving over 500sick, weak, or disabled POWs. On January6, 1945, {{all of the}} guards withdrew from the Cabanatuan camp, leaving the POWs alone. The guards had previously told prisoner leaders {{that they should not}} attempt to escape, <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>they</b> would be killed. When the guards left, the prisoners heeded the threat, fearing that the Japanese were waiting near the camp and would use the attempted escape as an excuse to execute them all. Instead, the prisoners went to the guards' side of the camp and ransacked the Japanese buildings for supplies and large amounts of food. Prisoners were alone for several weeks, except when retreating Japanese forces would periodically stay in the camp. The soldiers mainly ignored the POWs, except to ask for food. Although aware of the consequences, the prisoners sent a small group outside the prison's gates to bring in twocarabaos to slaughter. The meat from the animals, along with the food secured from the Japanese side of the camp, helped many of the POWs to regain their strength, weight, and stamina. In mid-January, a large group of Japanese troops entered the camp and returned the prisoners to their side of the camp. The prisoners, fueled by rumors, speculated that they would soon be executed by the Japanese.|$|E

25|$|The Ma'alot {{massacre}} in May 1974 involved a two-day hostage-taking of 115 people {{which ended in}} the deaths of over 25 hostages. It began when three armed members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) entered the Netiv Meir Elementary School, where they took more than 115 people (including 105 children) hostage on May 15, 1974, in Ma'alot. The hostage-takers soon issued demands for the release of 23 Palestinian militants from Israeli prisons, <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>they</b> would kill the students. On {{the second day of the}} standoff, a unit of the Golani Brigade stormed the building. During the takeover, the hostage-takers killed the children with grenades and automatic weapons. Ultimately, 25 hostages, including 22 children, were killed and 68 more were injured.|$|E
25|$|Fellowships (including {{those found}} in raids) can use the Fellowship Manoeuvre system to perform special group moves. Fellowship Manoeuvres occur {{randomly}} and require that the target be stunned or knocked down, in any group encounter with a 'signature' or higher enemy. Burglars and Guardians also have special skills that can initiate FMs when triggered. When the FM is initiated, every player within the area will get a color wheel on their screen to choose one of four skill contributions. These skill contributions are Ent's Strength, which deals direct damage, Stallions Spirit, which restores power, Spider's Guile, which deals direct and periodic damage, and Eagle's Cry, which restores lost morale. Every player can select one of these four contributions when a Fellowship Manoeuvre has been engaged, and the effect upon the target(s) intensifies the more {{that it has been}} selected. There are also Fellowship Manoeuvres which can be selected by a fellowship leader or assistant which confer unique bonuses. There are dozens of these unique FM combinations, which are designed for different situations and fellowship sizes. These Manoeuvres must be followed as they are designated <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>they</b> will not be utilized.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{created the}} size of each robot with {{the size of}} their vehicle mode in mind, {{supporting}} the Transformer's rationale for their choice of disguise on Earth.

This reflected a desire to move to a more alien look, away from the [...] "blocky" [...] Transformers. Another major influence in the designs was samurai armor, returning full-circle to the Japanese origins of the toy line.

500|$|This {{production}} {{was met with}} negative attention by film critics. A reviewer in the The Moving Picture News wrote, [...] "There isn't {{a lot to the}} story, but the acting is of the class which still finds favor with the public. The pictures taken in Chinatown do not go quite far enough in depicting East Side conditions; the photography of these particular scenes is not the ideal of Thanhouser productions..." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was more moderate in its criticism by identifying specific faults with the portrayal, but found that the story to be good and the parts well-acted. The Morning Telegraph offered similar criticism, [...] "The story of this picture is fairly good, but the details are wrong. In the first place, the producers evidently never were in a sweatshop, <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>they</b> would not have representing a sweatshop a store like a custom tailor shop, doing a thriving business. The people who are supposed to be Hebrews hardly resemble them. The next objection is when the settlement worker falls into a faint, the girl is very slow in picking him up. The story tells of a poor immigrant Hebrew girl who {{falls in love with a}} settlement worker, who returns her affection, which finally results in their marriage." [...] Some advertisements would bill the production as seeing the other side of New York City life.|$|E
500|$|The Kikuuiki album {{sessions}} {{were influenced by}} the commercial success of [...] "Aruku Around", where the band considered what sorts of songs they wanted to make, {{and what sort of}} music they should present to their new audience for the audience to understand what songs Sakanaction create other than [...] "Aruku Around"-style ones. The band did not want to make an album full of songs identical to [...] "Aruku Around", and instead wanted to express to their listeners the breadth of musical inspirations that they could mix together. Yamaguchi felt {{that it was important to}} not release a second similar song immediately after [...] "Aruku Around", as he saw that music consumers in the 2010s were acting as critics on their own Mixi or Twitter accounts. For these people, he believed it was important to exhibit different aspects of the band. He felt this was important for growing Sakanaction as a band, to break the cycle of a musical act becoming popular, then continuing to release the same style of music that made them popular until people grew tired of them. Even before the single's success, the band planned to feature songs on the album that would go against listeners expectations of what Sakanaction was as a band. On the other hand, the band attempted to keep a commercial sound, the same goal of Shin-shiro, <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>they</b> felt that their efforts would have been wasted. This led the band trying to create pop art music, blending art with commercialism.|$|E
500|$|It took a {{month for}} the project to be {{completely}} storyboarded before any programming work started on it. While the game's design evolved over time, its original plot remained largely intact. Several revisions resulted in some of the already made some graphics and other content being cut from the game, in particular in the final area of the castle's interior (which at first was intended to be much longer and to feature monsters that would guard it, but in the end was reduced to a small area with the task basically limited to finding a secret chamber). The game's story and elements were partially inspired by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , The Snow Queen, and Disney animated films, and relies heavily on surreal humor and slapstick. It contains several Easter egg pop culture references, including the shop called [...] "Benn's Costume Shop" [...] (complete with a costume of Batman), a band named [...] "The Slugs" [...] (consisting of four humanoid slugs), getting into a frozen realm through a wardrobe, and encountering the wreck of Marie [...] Celeste. Curse of Enchantia was described by Stuart Campbell as [...] "a funny version of Lure of the Temptress with a different plot." [...] He {{was not the only one}} who noted the both games' similarities to each other. Its working title was initially Zeloria, which later caused some confusion as several video game magazines continued to use [...] "Zeloria" [...] as the name of the world in the game (some other magazines also incorrectly assumed Enchantia to be the name of the game's antagonist, who is actually unnamed). Some articles featured an earlier and slightly different version of the plot, which involved a castle of three witches, who needed to drink a special potion every hundred years <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>they</b> would turn to dust, and the protagonist Brad's original task involved a rescue of his captured sister Jenny.|$|E
