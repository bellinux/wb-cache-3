60|$|On the 18th I left Benares for Ghazepore, {{a pretty}} town {{situated}} on the north bank of the river, celebrated for its manufacture of rose-water, the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, and a site of the Company's stud. The Rose gardens surround the town: they are fields, with low bushes of the plant grown in rows, red with blossoms in the morning, all of which are, however, plucked long before midday. The petals are put into clay stills, with twice their weight of water, and the produce exposed to the fresh air, for a night, in <b>open</b> <b>vessels.</b> The unskimmed water affords the best, and it is often twice and even oftener distilled; but the fluid deteriorates by too much distillation.

6000|$|In {{a little}} while the wind began to blow with dreadful violence, and to shift about in such manner as to baffle all seamanship. Unable to reach Veragua, the ships were obliged to put back to Puerto Bello, and when they would have entered that harbor, a sudden veering of the gale drove them from the land. For nine days they were blown and tossed about, {{at the mercy of}} a furious tempest, in an unknown sea, and often exposed to the awful perils of a lee-shore. It is {{wonderful}} that such <b>open</b> <b>vessels,</b> so crazed and decayed, could outlive such a commotion of the elements. Nowhere is a storm so awful as between the tropics. The sea, according to the description of Columbus, boiled at times like a caldron; at other times it ran in mountain waves, covered with foam. At night the raging billows resembled great surges of flame, owing to those luminous particles which cover {{the surface of the water}} in these seas, and throughout the whole course of the Gulf Stream. For a day and night the heavens glowed as a furnace with the incessant flashes of lightning; while the loud claps of thunder were often mistaken by the affrighted mariners for signal guns of distress from their foundering companions. During the whole time, says Columbus, it poured down from the skies, not rain, but as it were a second deluge. The seamen were almost drowned in their <b>open</b> <b>vessels.</b> Haggard with toil and affright, some gave themselves over for lost; they confessed their sins to each other according to the rites of the Catholic religion, and prepared themselves for death; many, in their desperation, called upon death as a welcome relief from such overwhelming horrors. In the midst of this wild tumult of the elements, they beheld a new object of alarm. The ocean in one place became strangely agitated. The water was whirled up into a kind of pyramid or cone, while a livid cloud, tapering to a point, bent down to meet it. Joining together, they formed a vast column, which rapidly approached the ships, spinning along the surface of the deep, and drawing up the waters with a rushing sound. The affrighted mariners, when they beheld this water-spout advancing towards them, despaired of all human means to avert it, and began to repeat passages from St. John the evangelist. The water-spout passed close by the ships without injuring them, and the trembling mariners attributed their escape to the miraculous efficacy of their quotations from the Scriptures. [153] ...|$|E
5000|$|Fishing {{vessels are}} a subset of {{commercial}} vessels, but generally small in size and often subject to different regulations and classification.

40|$|Closed-pressurised and <b>open</b> <b>vessel</b> {{digestion}} {{procedures for}} the mineralisation of small amounts (similar to 100 mg) of peat samples have been developed and evaluated. The two trace elements As and Sb were quantified in the diluted digests by flow injection-hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrometry (FI-HC-AAS). Optimisation of the analytical procedures was carried out with two bulk peat materials {{one of which was}} prepared as internal reference material. Both peat specimens were additionally characterised by instrumental neutron activation analysis with respect to their concentrations of As and Sb. Good agreement between instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) results and concentrations determined by HG-AAS were obtained. The use of adequate reference materials during the course of all experiments guaranteed precise and accurate results. Various acid mixtures with and without hydrofluoric acid were tested, because preliminary experiments revealed that HF in the digestion mixture leads to the formation of the gaseous AsF 5 resulting in diminished recoveries of As when <b>open</b> <b>vessel</b> digestion procedures are employed. Avoiding HF for mineralisation of peat led to low recoveries for Sb because distinct amounts of Sb are associated with silicates. Closed-pressurised vessel digestion proved to be less effective compared to <b>open</b> <b>vessel</b> mineralisation. For successful quantification of both elements, two digestion procedures are needed, one without HF for As and another one with HF to liberate Sb from the silicates. The optimised <b>open</b> <b>vessel</b> digestion procedure was applied to the determination of ancient peat samples dating back to 9300 calendar years before present. Concentrations of both elements showed a broad spread with values ranging from 18 to 1500 and 300 to 5700 ng g(- 1) for Sb and As, respectively. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

50|$|Cooking of {{the grape}} juice {{is carried out}} in <b>open</b> <b>vessels</b> {{directly}} heated by fire for 12 - 24 hours reducing the grape juice by about 50%. The production regulations require starting from a grape must with 15Â°Bx at least to reach {{at the end of}} cooking 30Â°Bx for TBVRE; for TBVM, the lower limit is not specified. It is possible to find cooked musts with sugar concentration beyond 50Â°Bx. The operation allows profound chemical and physical modifications affecting the end quality of TBV. Cooking stops all enzymatic browning reactions that rapidly occur inside fresh grape musts by polyphenol oxidase and progressively promotes grape must discoloration due to the heat-induced deactivation of proteins including browning enzymes. In addition, cooking promotes nonenzymatic browning chemical reactions involving sugar conversion, formation of high molecular weight melanoidins and furanic compounds such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Water vaporization induces the concentration of sugars, organic acids, and polyphenols concentration, resulting in the increase of density, viscosity, and refractive index (Brix degree), and, conversely, the lowering of water activity and pH value.|$|E
