40|$|Metal Oxide surge arresters {{are used}} to protect medium and high voltage systems and {{equipment}} against lightning and switching overvoltages. Measurements of the <b>residual</b> <b>voltage</b> of the metal oxide surge arrester indicate dynamic characteristics, and specifically, the <b>residual</b> <b>voltage</b> increases as the current front time descends and the <b>residual</b> <b>voltage</b> reaches its maximum before the arrester current reaches its peak. For these reasons, the metal oxide surge arresters cannot be modeled by only a non-linear resistance, since its response depends on the magnitude {{and the rate of}} rise of the surge pulse. Several frequent dependent models have been proposed, in order to simulate this dynamic frequency-dependent behavior. In the current work three modes - IEEE, Pinceti-Gianettoni and Fernadez-Diaz - are examined using PSCAD.

40|$|Lightning {{arrester}} in a {{power system}} is categorized as a device, which operates in transient conditions. Therefore, {{the performance of the}} arrester must be analyzed in transient circumstances. Some particular considerations such as physical (grounding installation) and electrical (impulse current) aspects must be taken. Hence, this research aims {{to take into account the}} effect of nonlinear characteristics of the grounding impedance on the <b>residual</b> <b>voltage</b> of the lightning protection system in different discharge conditions. In this issue, the lightning protection system consisting of ZnO and grounding model was adjusted to yield the accurate results in EMTP. For this purpose, IEEE dynamic model of ZnO arrester was adjusted such that the manufacturer's performance test results are achieved. The arrester was connected to the improved circuit model of the grounding electrode system. To analyze the performance of the lightning protection system with different grounding configurations, the system was subjected to the three groups of lightning impulse currents. For this purpose, CIGRE standard, Berger, and 8 / 20 (µs/µs) standard lightning currents were applied as impulse currents.

40|$|Rapid {{wind power}} {{development}} {{has led to}} a shift from small generators to large generators and from single distributed units to large centralised clusters of generators commonly known as wind farms. This substantial structural difference has invoked power system stability issues related to wind power. Large, centralised power plants of conventional types have always been forced by regulation to stay online and support the grid during voltage dips, but for wind farms no such regulation have historically existed. In 2005, the Swedish transmission system operator (TSO) acknowledged the forthcoming need for regulation and issued a new grid code including connection requirements for wind power generation. The new grid code describes different fault scenarios in the high voltage network which generators are supposed to ride through without disconnection. The new grid code applies to all facilities commissioned or rebuilt after 2006. In this study, the grid code scenarios are simulated, and the resulting wind power dynamic behaviour is examined to establish the implications of the grid code for wind farm grid connections in Sweden. HS Kraft’s planned wind farm at Linderödsåsen in southern Sweden is considered to be of relevant proportions (90 MW) and is chosen as a real case study. A PSS/E model of the wind farm is subjected to the fault scenarios described in the grid code, and the resulting voltages at the different busses in the test system are monitored along with wind turbine generator (WTG) active and reactive power response. The two dominating WTG technologies, doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), are compared and evaluated both from a wind farm developer perspective, and from a grid owner/TSO perspective. Additionally, low voltage ride through (LVRT) settings from three large WTG manufacturers are compared with the simulated <b>residual</b> <b>voltages</b> at the WTG transformer high side to determine their degree of compliance with the grid code. All simulation results show WTG high side <b>residual</b> <b>voltages</b> that are within the LVRT capabilities of the wind turbines at offer for the planned wind farm investigated. A wind farm consisting of PMSG turbines run in reactive power injection mode experience higher <b>residual</b> <b>voltages</b> at the transformer high side than a farm consisting of DFIG turbines. But the DFIG turbine farm experience higher <b>residual</b> <b>voltage</b> than normal mode run PMSG-turbine farm. Both DFIG and PMSG technologies deliver more reactive current when operating at low speeds due to the limited current carrying capabilities of the DC-link converters. The collector network layout is of minor importance to the <b>residual</b> <b>voltage</b> level at the wind turbine transformer high side, and the DFIG LVRTactions cause considerable stress to its mechanical drive train...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{additive}} of Al(NO 3) 3 {{has been}} doped into ZnO varistors {{in order to}} reduce their <b>residual</b> <b>voltages.</b> However, the leakage currents of samples always increase at the same time. Generally, it is recognized that some of doped Al 3 + ions enter the ZnO grains and reduce their resistivity, which results in lower <b>residual</b> <b>voltages</b> of varistor samples. On the other hand, the remnant Al 3 + ions appear in the grain boundaries and also reduce their resistivity, which results in larger leakage currents. In this paper, the electrical properties of ZnO varistor samples with various amounts of Al(NO 3) 3 dopant were measured. The experimental data are compared with the numerical simulation results, which reveals that the increased leakage currents of ZnO varistors with Al(NO 3) 3 dopant are not only due to the decreased resistivity of grain boundaries, but also the increased donor density of ZnO grains...|$|R

If {{this is followed}} on reconnection by switching surges of reverse polarity, it can impose severe response requirements on the arresters. High-amplitude voltage reversal can also arise from restriking transients in circuit breakers. Direct voltage working stress with superimposed surges is also clearly present in HVDC systems.
