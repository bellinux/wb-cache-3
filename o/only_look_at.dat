25|$|Face: The face {{category}} is about {{who has a}} classically beautiful face. Judges examine the eyes, the nose, the teeth, the lips {{and the structure of}} the face. While the category may call for an effect, ultimately the judges will <b>only</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the face of a competitor, which should not have much makeup and should appear flawless.|$|E
25|$|Staring {{at others}} is {{generally}} discouraged by most nudist and naturist groups, and {{could result in}} eviction if someone complains that it made them uncomfortable. In {{the early days of}} naturism in the U.S. (1930s-1950s), the rules at many resorts stipulated that when conversing, you must <b>only</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> each other face to face. On the other hand, staring has been acceptable at the largely abandoned female beauty contests (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{standards}} {{are intended to}} reduce acceleration to (and within) the head due to impact, as a stiff liner made of expanded polystyrene is crushed against the head. However, both the CPSC and the EN 1078 standards <b>only</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> linear accelerations and ignore rotational accelerations. The rotational accelerations that arise in bicycle accidents can {{be large enough to}} cause concussions, diffuse axonal injury and subdural haematoma. A few new helmets are designed to reduce rotational accelerations in accidents.|$|E

25|$|In March 2004, Target Corporation {{announced}} that they planned to put the Mervyn's and Marshall Field's divisions up for sale to focus on Target stores. Target Corporation was approached by many buyers for both stores {{but many of the}} potential buyers saw value only in the real estate. Target refused to sell to the groups which wanted to buy the property only, and said they would <b>only</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> deals that would not close the company and put the then 30,000 employees out of work. In July 2004, Target Corporation {{announced that}} Mervyn's had been sold to a group of investors that included private investment firm and turnaround specialist Sun Capital Partners, Cerberus Capital Management, and real estate investment company Lubert-Adler Management Inc. Rick Leto was named the new president and chief merchandising officer in January 2005.|$|E
500|$|Joshua Shaw {{designed}} costumes for {{characters in}} the season. Petrie stated that more layers {{were added to the}} series' atmosphere to keep the season dark but provide more clarity to the viewer, an issue that occurred in the first season. Petrie also talked about the costumes for characters such as Elektra, noting that they had to not <b>only</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the comics and [...] "what looks cool", but also [...] "what would you really fight in? What would protect you?...will people be wearing kick ass costumes in this show? At some point, everybody does. We promise. But, that said, we want to make them feel as organic and grounded as possible.|$|E
500|$|English cuisine in {{the twentieth}} century {{suffered}} from a poor international reputation. Keith Arscott of Chawton House Library comments that [...] "at one time people didn't think the English knew how to cook and yet these [...] female writers were at the forefront of modern day cooking." [...] English food was popularly supposed to be bland, but English cuisine has made extensive use of spices since the Middle Ages; introduced curry to Europe; and makes use of strong flavourings such as English mustard. It was similarly reputed to be dull, like roast beef: but that dish was highly prized both in Britain and abroad, and few people could afford it; the [...] "Roast Beef of Old England" [...] lauded by William Hogarth in his 1748 painting celebrated the high quality of English cattle, which the French at the [...] "Gate of Calais" [...] (the other name of his painting) could <b>only</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> with envy. The years of wartime shortages and rationing certainly did impair the variety and flavour of English food during the twentieth century, but the nation's cooking recovered from this with increasing prosperity and the availability of new ingredients from soon after the Second World War.|$|E

500|$|Limbaugh's {{appearance}} in the episode has drawn both praise and criticism from news outlets, including Daniel Foster of National Review who commented, [...] "It is to Mr. Limbaugh's credit that he can make fun of himself. But Seth MacFarlane, the whiskey-soaked Dada creator of Family Guy, is responsible for more sophomoric cartooning than the combined patrons of America’s truck stop and dive bar bathrooms." [...] Foster went on to add, [...] "I can <b>only</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Limbaugh-MacFarlane mash-up with a wary eye." [...] Columnist Matt Lewis of Politics Daily also questioned Limbaugh's appearance on Family Guy, citing his support for former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, whose daughter, Bristol Palin, has openly criticized MacFarlane and called the show's writers [...] "heartless jerks." [...] In contrast, John Nolte of Andrew Breitbart's Big Hollywood wrote, [...] "What MacFarlane’s doing fits exactly into our template. He’s entitled to his opinion, {{worked very hard to}} reach the top of the most difficult business there is to succeed in, and in turn uses that forum to further his own agenda— that’s how it’s supposed to work. But {{at the same time he}} doesn’t completely shut us out." [...] Prior to the episode's official broadcast on television in the United States, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called Limbaugh's guest {{appearance in}} the episode [...] "genuinely funny," [...] and David Weigel of Slate commented, [...] "I'm not at all surprised that Limbaugh would embrace the show and answer its mockery of conservatives; the plotline [...] is a perfect conservative narrative." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{governments of}} major {{developing}} countries must play {{a large part}} in designing and carrying out new strategies. For proof, one need <b>only</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the radically different international responses to the locally initiated New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) (which was embraced) and the Bush administration's Greater Middle East Initiative (which was not)." [...] Reconfigured, the G-20 (i.e., members of the G8 and major emerging markets such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa) could {{play a vital role}} in brokering consensus on a wide range of intractable political and security issues. The G-20 has already established itself as a key voice in global economic policy, and with an elevated profile it could address political and security affairs as well.|$|E
