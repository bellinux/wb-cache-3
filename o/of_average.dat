3000|$|First, {{we discuss}} Fig. 8, where all {{interference}} power is different. For nItr = 0, the detection rate <b>of</b> <b>Averaging</b> {{is higher than}} that of Proposed. This improvement <b>of</b> <b>Averaging</b> is because <b>of</b> <b>averaging</b> residual powers in both time and frequency domains. As introduced in [17], the residual powers |r(t,l)| 2 are averaged in time domain to mitigate the variance of residual powers among subcarriers superposed by the same interference. In addition, moving <b>average</b> <b>of</b> the obtained |r(l)| 2 is taken in frequency domain for further mitigation of the variance. Therefore, with respect to the detection in Eq. (19), which is based on a threshold, the detection <b>of</b> <b>Averaging</b> is more accurate than that of Proposed. In contrast, the detection rate of Proposed exceeds that <b>of</b> <b>Averaging</b> for nItr ≥ 1.

Despite finishing the game, Kesler was forced to undergo surgery to repair the damage and missed the remainder of the playoffs. In the off-season, the Canucks re-signed Kesler to a three-year, $5.25-million contract extension on May 24, 2007.

5|$|Hobbs' {{success was}} based on fast footwork, an ability to play many {{different}} shots, and excellent placement of the ball. Among the first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers, he adapted his technique to meet the new styles of bowling that arose early in his career; he mixed classical shots with an effective defence. He was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting. An opening batsman, Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships; with Tom Hayward and Andy Sandham for Surrey and with Wilfred Rhodes and Herbert Sutcliffe for England. His partnership with Sutcliffe remains in 2016 the most effective for the first wicket, in terms <b>of</b> <b>average</b> partnership, in Test history.
