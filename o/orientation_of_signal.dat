When real motion signals were added to sequences of noisy Glass patterns they exerted an influence on apparent speed that increased with motion signal strength but was independent of pattern signal strength.

They {{contribute to the}} stop-translocation of a polypeptide translocating through the translocon and to determine the <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> sequences penetrating the membrane. Here we analyzed the function of these positively charged residues during stop-translocation in vitro. Surprisingly, the positive charges facilitated membrane spanning of a marginally hydrophobic segment, even when separated from the hydrophobic segment by 70 residues. In this case, the hydrophobic segment was exposed to the lumen, and then the downstream positive charges triggered the segment to slide back into the membrane. The marginally hydrophobic segment spanned the membrane, but maintained access to the water environment.

Using recombinant and mutant proteins, also length and hydrophobicity of the apolar segment were shown to affect the orientation: translocation of the N-terminus {{was found to be}} favored by long hydrophobic sequences, and translocation of the C-terminus, by short ones. Here, we tested the physiological significance of this phenomenon by mutagenesis of the hydrophobic portion of two natural signals with unusual flanking charges. Extending the hydrophobic domain of the short, cleaved Ncyt/Cexo signal of pre-provasopressin-neurophysin II and shortening that of the Nexo/Ccyt signal anchor of microsomal epoxide hydrolase resulted in a significant fraction of polypeptides inserting in the opposite orientation to that of the wild-type proteins. The topogenic contribution of the hydrophobic domain is thus important for the correct and uniform orientation of natural proteins and can explain the behavior of some of the signals with unusual flanking charges...|$|E

40|$|It is {{believed}} that one or more basic residues at the extreme amino terminus of precursor proteins {{and the lack of}} a net positive charge immediately following the signal peptide act as topological determinants that promote the insertion of the signal peptide hydrophobic core into the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli cells with the correct orientation required to initiate the protein export process. The export efficiency of precursor maltose-binding protein (pre-MBP) was found to decrease progressively as the net charge in the early mature region was increased systematically from 0 to + 4. This inhibitory effect could be further exacerbated by reducing the net charge in the signal peptide to below 0. One such MBP species, designated MBP- 3 /+ 3 and having a net charge of - 3 in the signal peptide and + 3 in the early mature region, was totally export defective. Revertants in which MBP- 3 /+ 3 export was restored were found to harbor mutations in the prlA (secY) gene, encoding a key component of the E. coli protein export machinery. One such mutation, prlA 666, was extensively characterized and shown to be a particularly strong suppressor of a variety of MBP export defects. Export of MBP- 3 /+ 3 and other MBP species with charge alterations in the early mature region also was substantially improved in E. coli cells harboring certain other prlA mutations originally selected as extragenic suppressors of signal sequence mutations altering the hydrophobic core of the LamB or MBP signal peptide. In addition, the enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) fused to a predicted cytoplasmic domain of an integral membrane protein (UhpT) increased significantly in cells harboring prlA 666. These results suggest a role for PrlA/SecY in determining the <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> peptides and possibly other membrane-spanning protein domains in the cytoplasmic membrane...|$|E

It is well known that guided neuronal growth on the level of single cells as well as for populations of neurons with well-defined connectivity and polarity is inalienable for the formation of functional networks. To investigate factors that affect the development of networks of neurons, we search for geometric parameters influencing the connectivity among populations within the networks. Our approach is to design small building blocks that facilitate information processing in vitro. Here, we focus on the impact on functionality and signal propagation induced by sculpting populations of neurons. We introduce a method to pattern dissociated embryonic cortical rat neurons in geometrically confined populations. Therefore microstructuring techniques were used to transfer substrate-bound protein patterns consisting of a mixture of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and laminin onto a hydrophobic glass surface. Calcium imaging with Fluo- 4 AM enables us to optically investigate signal propagation within and among adjacent neuronal populations after 15 to 24 days in vitro. Furthermore, the effect of geometric constraints on the development of neuronal populations was determined by immunofluorescence experiments. Stainings were performed against MAP 2 (somatodendritic marker) and the axon specific marker Anti- 200 kD neurofilament Heavy. Additionally, the PLL was FITC labeled to visualize neuronal outgrowth with respect to the pattern. Results from stainings show that the cell density within one population as well as properties of neuronal growth between adjacent populations can be tuned by choosing the right geometric parameters. Our optically recorded spontaneous network activity follows the pattern that was predicted by biomolecular morphology found in the immunofluorescence study. The shape of the junction between two adjacent populations has a major impact on the direction of signal propagation. Controlling the <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> propagation among adjacent populations of neurons provides a multiplicity of applications.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} investigated {{the extent to which}} the spatial <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>signal</b> line affects discrimination of its trajectory from the random trajectories of background noise lines. The <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>signal</b> line was either parallel (iso-) or orthogonal (ortho-) to its motion direction and it was identical in all respects to the noise (orientation, length and speed) except for its motion direction, rendering the signal line indistinguishable from the noise on a frame-to-frame basis. We found that discrimination of ortho-trajectories was generally better than iso-trajectories. Discrimination of ortho-trajectories was largely immune to the effects of spatial jitter in the trajectory, and to variations in step size and line-length. Discrimination of iso-trajectories was reliable provided that step-size was not too short and did not exceed line length, and that the trajectory was straight. The new result that trajectory discrimination in moving line elements is modulated by line orientation suggests that ortho- and iso-trajectory discrimination rely upon two distinct mechanisms: iso-motion discrimination involves a ‘motion-streak’ process that combines motion information with information about orientation parallel to the motion trajectory, while ortho-motion discrimination involves extended trajectory facilitation in a network of receptive fields with orthogonal orientation tuning...|$|R

40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, hydrophobic signal {{sequences of}} newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins target {{them to the}} Sec 61 translocon in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The translocon forms a hydrophilic pore, in its idle state closed by a lumenal plug domain and a hydrophobic constriction ring. Within the Sec 61 channel, transmembrane segments of proteins achieve their proper orientation (topology) and are laterally released into the lipid bilayer. <b>Orientation</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> sequences in the ER membrane is determined by charged residues flanking the hydrophobic core of the signal, hydrophobicity of the signal, the size and folding properties of the N-terminal domain preceding the signal and, in some cases, {{the length of the}} C-terminus. In Part I of this thesis we compared the insertion process of N-terminal versus internal signal-anchors of single-spanning membrane proteins and determined the effect of the N-terminal hydrophilic domain on protein topogenesis. We showed that insertion of these two types of signals occurs via different mechanisms. Transition from N-terminal to internal signals, achieved by extension of the N-domain with hydrophilic residues, was accompanied by loss of C-terminal length dependence and insensitivity to increased hydrophobicity of the signal. It indicated that, in contrast to N-terminal signals, signal-anchors localized internally cannot undergo reorientation within the pore. Furthermore, hydrophilic N-terminal domains sterically hinder N-translocation. In Part II we analyzed the insertion process of proteins with conflicting signal sequences: type I cleavable hemagglutinin (HA) signal and a type II signal-anchor of H 1. We showed that proteins with wild-type HA and H 1 signals, connected by a 40 -amino acid linker compete for the preferred orientation in the translocon, manifested by a rapid inversion of a fraction of the polypeptides, triggered by the signal-anchor. The process could be slowed down by increasing the hydrophobicity of the H 1 signal or manipulating its flanking charges. Under such conditions, topogenesis was interrupted upon termination of translation, like previously observed for N-terminal signal-anchors. In contrast to single-spanning membrane proteins, the topogenesis window is not a constant of the translocation machinery, but rather appears to be substrate-specific. In Part III we tested the function of the apolar core of the Sec 61 translocon. We mutated the ring residues of yeast Sec 61 p to more hydrophilic, bulky, or even charged amino acids (alanines, glycines, serines, tryptophans, lysines, or aspartates). The translocon turned out to be surprisingly tolerant even to the charge mutations in the constriction ring, since growth and translocation efficiency were not drastically affected. Ring mutants altered the integration of hydrophobic sequences into the lipid bilayer, which indicated that the translocon does not simply catalyze the partitioning of potential transmembrane segments between an aqueous environment and the lipid bilayer, but that it plays an active role in setting the hydrophobicity threshold for membrane integration. ...|$|E

Previous studies with agonist and antagonist peptides have indicated that ZAP 70 might respond differently to different structures of the TCR-CD 3 complex induced by bound peptides. The roles of membrane proximity and <b>orientation</b> in activation <b>of</b> ZAP 70 <b>signaling</b> were explored using synthetic ligands and their binding proteins designed to produce different architectures of membrane-bound complexes composed of ZAP 70 fusion proteins. Transient membrane recruitment of physiological levels of ZAP 70 with the membrane-permeable synthetic ligand FK 1012 A leads to rapid phosphorylation of ZAP 70 and activation of the ras/MAPK and Ca 2 +/calcineurin signaling pathways. ZAP 70 SH 2 domains are not required for signaling when the kinase is artifically recruited to the membrane, indicating that the SH 2 domains function solely in recruitment and not in kinase activation. Using additional synthetic ligands and their binding proteins that recruit ZAP 70 equally well but orient it at the cell membrane in different ways, we define a requirement for a specific presentation of ZAP 70 to its downstream targets. These results provide a mechanism by which ZAP 70, bound to the phosphorylated receptor, could discriminate between conformational changes induced by the binding of different MHC-peptide complexes to the {{antigen receptor}} and introduce an approach to exploring the role <b>of</b> spatial <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> complexes in living cells...|$|R

Cleavage in vitro by the RAG 1 and RAG 2 proteins can occur at individual signals when the reaction buffer contains Mn 2 +, but cleavage {{is restricted to}} substrates containing two signals when Mg 2 + is the divalent cation. By using a novel V(D) J cleavage substrate, we show that while the RAG proteins alone establish a moderate preference for a 12 / 23 pair versus a 12 / 12 pair, a much stricter dependence of cleavage on the 12 / 23 signal pair is produced by the inclusion of HMG 1 and competitor double-stranded DNA. The competitor DNA serves to inhibit the cleavage of substrates carrying a 12 / 12 or 23 / 23 pair, {{as well as the}} cutting at individual signals in 12 / 23 substrates. We show that a 23 / 33 pair is more efficiently recombined than a 12 / 33 pair, suggesting that the 12 / 23 rule can be generalized to a requirement for spacers that differ from each other by a single helical turn. Furthermore, we suggest that a fixed spatial <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> is required for cleavage. In general, the same signal variants that can be cleaved singly can function under conditions in which a signal pair is required. However, a chemically modified substrate with one noncleavable signal enables us to show that formation of a functional cleavage complex is mechanistically separable from the cleavage reaction itself and that although cleavage requires a pair <b>of</b> <b>signals,</b> cutting does not have to occur simultaneously at both. The implications of these results are discussed with respect to the mechanism of V(D) J recombination and the generation of chromosomal translocations...|$|R

We have recently shown, however, that spatial pooling <b>of</b> motion <b>signals</b> is better characterized {{in terms of}} optimal decoding of neuronal populations rather than image statistics (Webb et al., 2007). Here we ask which computations guide the spatial and temporal pooling <b>of</b> local <b>orientation</b> <b>signals</b> in human vision. The observers’ task was to discriminate which of two texture patterns had a more clockwise global orientation. Standard textures had a common orientation; comparison textures were chosen independently from a skewed (asymmetrical) probability distribution with distinct spatial or temporal statistics. We simulated observers’ performance using different estimators (vector average, winner-takes-all and maximum likelihood) to decode the orientation-tuned activity of a population of model neurons. Our results revealed that the perceived global <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> texture patterns coincided with the mean (or vector average read-out) <b>of</b> <b>orientation</b> <b>signals</b> accumulated over both space and time. To reconcile these results with our previous work on direction pooling, we varied stimulus duration.

This viscoelastic plasma membrane, which allows lateral diffusion while restricting the <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> molecules within the plane of a phospholipid bilayer, is uniquely well suited {{to make sense of}} the myriad biochemical, mechanical, and spatial cues that constantly stimulate receptors on the cell surface. The chemical basis for the cell membrane, a fluid phospholipid bilayer, can be used to create a supported membrane that retains these properties while allowing precise control over the physical and chemical aspects <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> molecules on the supported membrane surface. Cell communication is critical for proper maintenance of multicellular organisms, and tumorigenesis can occur when communication is not properly controlled. Cancerous cells often display a vastly altered array of cell surface receptors compared to normal cells, and the abnormal signaling that these receptors trigger has grave consequences for the fate of the cell and the organism as a whole. The dynamics by which these receptors bind to ligands within the environment are not well understood because the cell membrane is a chemically heterogeneous and physically irregular surface that is difficult to study in vivo. Here we recapitulate signaling events that occur in live cancer cells using the supported membrane to present laterally mobile ligands to receptor-expressing human breast cancer cells. This platform allows for precise control of the spatial organization <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> molecules on the supported membrane surface, as well as a detailed examination of subsequent changes in signaling events within living cells.

As an application, a simple and efficient point-of-interest operator is presented and it is compared to the Plessey detector...|$|R
40|$|In signal processing, the {{approach}} <b>of</b> the analytic <b>signal</b> is a capable and often used method. For <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> finite length, quadrature filters yield a bandpass filtered approximation <b>of</b> the analytic <b>signal.</b> In the case <b>of</b> multidimensional <b>signals,</b> the quadrature filters {{can only be}} applied {{with respect to a}} preference direction. Therefore, the orientation has to be sampled, steered or orientation adaptive filters have to be used. Up to now, there has been no linear approach to obtain an isotropic analytic signal which means that the amplitude is independent <b>of</b> the local <b>orientation.</b> In this paper, we present such an approach using the framework of geometric algebra. Our result is closely related to the Riesz transform and the structure tensor. It is seamless embedded in the framework of Clifford analysis. In a suitable coordinate system, the filter response contains information about local amplitude, local phase and local <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> intrinsically one-dimensional <b>signals.</b> We have tested our filters on two- and three-dimensional signals...|$|R
40|$|The element which mediates the {{deletion}} of the CK {{gene segment}} (abbreviations ref. 1) in human lambda light chain producing B-cells {{was found to}} be located 24 kb downstream of CK. The kappa deleting element is flanked by hepta- and nonanucleotide recognition sequences similar to the ones adjacent to the JK gene segments. Complementary recognition sequences with a 30 bp spacer were found in the JK-CK intron. For the first time the two partners of a recombination event in a mammalian immunoglobulin gene system have been linked on a physical map. The <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> the recombination <b>signals</b> <b>of</b> the intron and the Kde sequences allows a joining by a simple deletion mechanism. Similarities and possible differences to the mechanism of V-J joining are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{orientation}} and temperature dependence (4. 2 - 2. 5 K) of {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR) power saturation and spin-lattice relaxation rate, and the <b>orientation</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> linewidth, were measured in single crystals of the aquo complex of ferric sperm whale skeletal muscle myoglobin. The spin-packet linewidth {{was found to be}} temperature independent and to vary by a factor of seven within the heme plane. An analysis is presented which enables one to arrive at (a) hyperfine component line-widths and, from the in-plane angular variation of the latter, at (b) the widths of distributions in energy differences between low-lying electronic levels and (c) the angular spread in the in-plane principal g-directions. The values of the energy level distributions in crystals obtained from the measurements and analysis reported here are compared with those obtained by a different method for the same protein complex in frozen solution. The spread in the rhombic energy splitting is significantly greater in solution than in the crystal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} for image reconstruction from local phase vectors in the monogenic scale space. The local phase vector contains {{not only the}} local phase but also the local <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> the original <b>signal,</b> which enables the simultaneous estimation of the structural and geometric information. Consequently, the local phase vector preserves a lot of important information <b>of</b> the original <b>signal.</b> Image reconstruction from the local phase vectors can be easily and quickly implemented in the monogenic scale space by a coarse to fine way. Experimental results illustrate that an image can be accurately reconstructed based on the local phase vector. In contrast to the reconstruction from zero crossings, our approach is proved to be stable. Due to the local <b>orientation</b> adaptivity <b>of</b> the local phase vector, the presented approach gives a better result when {{compared with that of}} the Gabor phase based reconstruction. ...|$|R
