50|$|The genetic {{mutation}} {{that leads to}} Becker muscular dystrophy is an in-frame deletion. This means that, out of the 79 exons that code for dystrophin, one or several in the middle may be removed, without affecting the exons that follow the deletion. This allows for a shorter-than-normal dystrophin protein that maintains a degree of functionality. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the {{genetic mutation}} is <b>out-of-frame.</b> <b>Out-of-frame</b> mutations cause a premature stop in protein generation - the ribosome is unable to “read” the RNA {{past the point of}} initial error - leading to a severely shortened and completely non-functional dystrophin protein.|$|E

On a standard test, the 6-minute walk test, patients whose performance had been declining instead improved, from 385 meters to 420 meters. DMD may result from mRNA that contains <b>out-of-frame</b> mutations (e.g. deletions, insertions or splice site mutations), resulting in frameshift or early termination so that in most muscle fibers no functional dystrophin is produced (though some revertant muscle fibers produce some dystrophin).

50|$|Unlike {{the more}} {{familiar}} coordinate velocity v, proper velocity is synchrony-free (does not require synchronized clocks) and is useful for describing both super-relativistic and sub-relativistic motion. Like coordinate velocity and unlike four-vector velocity, it resides in the three-dimensional slice of spacetime defined by the map frame. As shown below and in the example figure at right, proper-velocities even add as three vectors with rescaling of the <b>out-of-frame</b> component. This makes them more useful for map-based (e.g. engineering) applications, and less useful for gaining coordinate-free insight. Proper speed divided by lightspeed c is the hyperbolic sine of rapidity η, just as the Lorentz factor γ is rapiditys hyperbolic cosine, and coordinate speed v over lightspeed is rapiditys hyperbolic tangent.|$|E

The barmaid functions {{as the voice of}} reason when criticising the Abrahamic religions or religion in general. Other times, Jesus or Mo may act as the voice of reason depending on which religion a particular comic aims to criticise.

50|$|All {{of these}} {{processing}} events {{result in an}} antigen-binding region that is highly variable, even when the same gene segments are recombined. V(D)J recombination allows for the generation of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors to antigens that neither the organism nor its ancestor(s) need to have previously encountered, allowing for an adaptive immune response to novel pathogens that develop or to those that frequently change (e.g., seasonal influenza). However, a major caveat to this process is that the DNA sequence must remain in-frame {{in order to maintain}} the correct amino acid sequence in the final protein product. If the resulting sequence is <b>out-of-frame,</b> the development of the cell will be arrested, and the cell will not survive to maturity. V(D)J recombination is therefore a very costly process that must be (and is) strictly regulated and controlled.|$|E
5000|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} cause {{one form of}} {{familial}} hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. [...] A deficiency is associated with 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. Mutations also cause 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. There are {{a wide variety of}} mutations that have been identified to cause this disease. Among them are missense mutations (A40T, P258L, D57G, Y226H) and nonsense mutations (R236X) in the protein, and splicing mutations (261+1G>A, 710-2A>G) and some small deletions (587delC) in the cDNA. One mutation, 636+471G>T in the HADH gene, was shown to create a cryptic splice donor site and an <b>out-of-frame</b> pseudoexon. Most of the described cases have homozygous mutations. This disease has fairly homogenous clinical presentation across cases. The symptoms first appear in early life, between 1.5 hours post birth and 3 years of age, and the most common symptoms are hypoglycemia and seizures/convulsions directly related to the hypoglycemia. There are other clinical presentations that have been identified, namely: myoglobinuria, dicarboxylic aciduria, feeding difficulties in infancy, muscular hypotonia, hepatic steatosis, growth delay, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, hepatic necrosis, and fulminant hepatic failure. The disorder may be diagnosed by either the analysis of the molecular genetics of the individual, or by detection of abnormal metabolite levels in blood and/or plasma. Individuals with this deficiency have an elevated amount of 3-hydroxyglutarate excreted through the urine; a heightened level of C4-OH acylcarnitine in the blood plasma is also a characteristic of this FAO disorder. Most documented cases thus far have shown that individuals are responsive to diazoxide treatment, and highlight the need for diagnosis and treatment administration as early as possible in order to correct hypoglycemia and avoid irreversible brain damage.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} media arts theory {{focusing on}} sound, the moving {{image and the}} relationship between the audible and the visible, there has been scant research into how the <b>out-of-frame</b> creates a sense of meaning in media art. The thesis argues that the <b>out-of-frame</b> can be conceptualised as an out-offield that creates a novel sense of meaning, in both linear and non-linear media works. It explores the expressive possibilities of the <b>out-of-frame</b> to create such a notion of meaning through the still image, the moving image and meta-data, and thence via a series of media art works that employ a floating frame in their treatment and layering of media assets. It also investigates the possibilities when these notions take place over time. Focusing upon media artworks that are almost exclusively narrative-based, the thesis investigates the representation of an emergent <b>out-of-frame,</b> evaluating the capacity of these works to test the use of an <b>out-of-frame</b> to expressively address such meaningful peripheries. Whilst media arts theory and practice almost exclusively focus on events within the frame, this thesis argues that a critical part of the media experience is that of the unseen but represented, whether it be a place or character. This is an allusive reference, much as the use of motif can be an evocation of narrative elements both seen and unseen in temporal spaces. The thesis proposes that recent digital media technologies offer a revolutionary shift in the expression of the <b>out-of-frame,</b> realisations that will impact on users of media technologies in the future. It explores this hypothesis in a number of ways. Firstly, it investigates how mise-en-scène and montage relate to each other beyond traditional concepts as a basis for understanding the <b>out-of-frame.</b> Secondly, it investigates areas not historically associated with mise-en-scène and montage, but are now interrelated due to their inclusion and convergence in recent media technologies and the <b>out-of-frame.</b> Thirdly, it attempts to understand this concept through an examination of a number of case studies that explore the <b>out-of-frame,</b> in the precinematic, the cinematic, and post-cinematic. Fourthly, the thesis explores two experimental media art works, entitled Eavesdrop and Conversations, undertaken collaboratively as part of the doctoral research, that focus on the <b>out-of-frame.</b> Finally, it will examine a number of current and future media technologies and how the <b>out-of-frame</b> is reflected in digital media and the post-cinema media landscape...|$|E
40|$|Human {{alternative}} open reading frames (HAltORF) is {{a publicly}} available and searchable online database referencing putative products of <b>out-of-frame</b> alternative translation initiation (ATI) in human mRNAs. <b>Out-of-frame</b> ATI {{is a process}} by which a single mRNA encodes independent proteins, when distinct initiation codons located in different reading frames are recognized by a ribosome to initiate translation.

40|$|Human {{intestinal}} {{lamina propria}} plasma cells {{are considered to}} be the progeny of chronically stimulated germinal centers located in organized gut-associated lymphoid tissues such as Peyer’s patches and isolated lymphoid follicles. We have sampled human colonic lamina propria plasma cells and naive and memory B cell subsets from human Peyer’s patches by microdissection of immunohistochemically stained tissue sections and used PCR methods and sequence analysis to compare IgV�J � rearrangements in the plasma cell and B cell populations. Rearrangements that were either in-frame or <b>out-of-frame</b> between V and J were compared. Usage of IgV � families in the in-frame rearrangements from the plasma cells resembled that observed in the mantle cells, suggesting that antigenic selection for cellular specificity does not dramatically favor any particular V � segment. However, in marked contrast, <b>out-of-frame</b> rearrangements involving V� 1 and V� 2 families are rarely observed in intestinal plasma cells, whereas rearrangements involving V� 5 are increased. This resulted in significantly biased ratios of in-frame:out-of-frame rearrangements in these V � families. <b>Out-of-frame</b> rearrangements of IgV�J � from plasma cells, including those involving the V� 5 family, have a significant tendency not to involve J� 1, consistent with the hypothesis that this population includes rearrangements generated by secondary recombination events.

40|$|The genome of the {{defective}} interfering (DI) mouse hepatitis virus DI-a {{carries a}} large {{open reading frame}} (ORF) consisting of ORF 1 a, ORF 1 b, and nucleocapsid sequences. To test whether this fusion ORF is important for DI virus replication, we constructed derivatives of the DI-a genome in which the reading frame was truncated by a nonsense codon or a frameshift mutation. In vitro-transcribed DI RNAs were transfected into mouse hepatitis virus-infected cells followed by undiluted passage of the resulting virus-DI virus stocks. The following observations were made. (i) Truncation of the fusion ORF was not lethal but led to reduced accumulation of DI RNA. (ii) When pairs of nearly identical in-frame and <b>out-of-frame</b> DI RNAs were directly compared by cotransfection, DI viruses containing in-frame genomic RNAs prevailed within three successive passage even when the <b>out-of-frame</b> RNAs were transfected in 10 -fold molar excess.

40|$|Phagemid-based {{expression}} of cloned genes fused to the gIIIP coding sequence and rescue using helper phages, such as VCSM 13, {{has been used}} extensively for constructing large antibody phage display libraries. However, for randomly primed cDNA and gene fragment libraries, this system encounters reading frame problems wherein only one of 18 phages display the translated foreign peptide/protein fused to phagemid-encoded gIIIP. The elimination of phages carrying <b>out-of-frame</b> inserts is vital {{in order to improve}} the quality of phage display libraries. In this study, we designed a novel helper phage, AGM 13, which carries trypsin-sensitive sites within the linker regions of gIIIP. This renders the phage highly sensitive to trypsin digestion, which abolishes its infectivity. For open reading frame (ORF) selection, the phagemid-borne phages are rescued using AGM 13, so that clones with in-frame inserts express fusion proteins with phagemid-encoded trypsin-resistant gIIIP, which becomes incorporated into the phages along with a few copies of AGM 13 -encoded trypsin-sensitive gIIIP. In contrast, clones with <b>out-of-frame</b> inserts produce phages carrying only AGM 13 -encoded trypsin-sensitive gIIIP. Trypsin treatment of the phage population renders the phages with <b>out-of-frame</b> inserts non-infectious, whereas phages carrying in-frame inserts remain fully infectious and can hence be enriched by infection. This strategy was applied efficiently at a genome scale to generate an ORF-enriched whole genome fragment library from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in which nearly 100 % of the clones carried in-frame inserts after selection.

40|$|The random {{nature of}} T-cell receptor-β (TCR-β) {{recombination}} needed to generate immunological diversity dictates {{that two-thirds of}} alleles will be <b>out-of-frame.</b> Transcripts derived from nonproductive rearrangements are cleared by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, {{the process by which}} cells selectively degrade transcripts harboring premature termination codons. Here, we demonstrate that the fetal thymus in transgenic mice that ubiquitously express a dominant-negative form of Rent 1 /hUpf 1, an essential trans-effector of NMD, shows decreased cell number, reduced CD 4 CD 8 double-positive thymocytes, diminished expression of TCR-β, and increased expression of CD 25, suggesting a defect in pre-TCR signaling. Transgenic fetal thymocytes also demonstrated diminished endogenous Vβ-to-DβJβ rearrangements, whereas Dβ-to-Jβ rearrangements were unperturbed, suggesting that inhibition of NMD induces premature shut-off of TCR-β rearrangement. Developmental arrest of thymocytes is prevented by the introduction of a fully rearranged TCR-β transgene that precludes generation of <b>out-of-frame</b> transcripts, suggesting direct mRNA-mediated trans-dominant effects.

Two cDNA clones (5 - 1 cDNA 1 and 5 - 1 cDNA 2) derived from the transcripts of the mu-expressed allele were cloned and sequenced. Sequencing analysis of 5 - 1 cDNA 1 revealed that the VH 7183 -DSP 2 -JH 3 sequence jointed to the CH 1 exon at 136 bp, 3 ' from the 5 ' end of the CH 1 exon, resulting in the change of the reading frame from <b>out-of-frame</b> to in-frame. On the other hand, sequencing analysis of 5 - 1 cDNA 2, which appeared to have derived from intron-containing premature mRNA, revealed that the J-C intron sequence joined to the CH 1 exon at 110 bp 3 ' from the 5 ' end of the CH 1 exon, indicating the deletion of 109 bp including the 3 ' splice site of the CH 1 exon. These results demonstrate that the deletion of the authentic 3 ' splice site of the CH 1 exon induced activation of the cryptic splice site within the CH 1 exon. This was followed by splicing of the variable region to the CH 1 exon at the cryptic splice site at 136 bp 3 ' from the 5 ' end of the CH 1 exon, resulting in the change of the reading frame from <b>out-of-frame</b> to in-frame, followed by the truncated mu-chain production...|$|E

Furthermore, a genomic deletion elsewhere does not cause interference since preS 2 deletion variants exhibit no influence on wild-type HBV replication. Consistent with the natural occurrence of HBV CID variants, we recently identified CID variants of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) in natural infection. However, unlike HBV CID variants, functional characterization of WHV CID variants using a human hepatoma cell line has not revealed any interference in tissue culture. In summary, defective interference is a general phenomenon for both in-frame and <b>out-of-frame</b> HBV CID variants...|$|E

The role played by context in influencing the nature of <b>out-of-frame</b> activity is noted through comparison with another published study of simulations (Linell and Thunqvist 2003). While in general sustaining a role-playing frame that involved an orientation to exact mimicry of clinical situations, the interactional work done to sustain this appearance of ‘authenticity’ at certain moments was revealed by <b>out-of-frame</b> utterances. One participating doctor in particular used humor to exploit the ambiguous realism of the role-playing frame. The success of this doctor in acquiring and applying new communication behaviors problematizes the view that ‘realism’, achieved through mimicry, is solely responsible for the success of training interventions. The implications for studying other kinds of simulated encounters, including an outline for a program of research into the sociolinguistics of acting tasks in general, are outlined. Sociolinguistic researchers involved in observational studies of talk would benefit from adopting the view that role-played, rehearsed, and even scripted talk of the sort used in dramatic performance is a variety of naturally occurring data and therefore worthy of study...|$|E

In two-thirds of cases, recombination between variable segments induces a frameshift in the open reading frame and generates a premature termination codon. In B cells harboring biallelic V(D) J rearrangement of Ig genes, transcription is known to occur on both the functional and nonfunctional alleles, generating considerable amounts of primary transcripts with <b>out-of-frame</b> V regions. In this study, we analyzed in cell lines and primary B cells the RNA surveillance of nonfunctional Igkappa transcripts arising from nonproductive rearrangement. We demonstrated that splicing inhibition, nonsense-mediated decay and nonsense-altered splicing each have an individual partial effect that together associate into an efficient surveillance machinery, downregulating nonfunctional Igkappa mRNA. Moreover, we provide evidence that the RNA surveillance efficiency increases throughout B cell development. Whereas splicing inhibition remains constant in most cell lines, differences in nonsense-mediated decay and nonsense-altered splicing are responsible for the higher RNA surveillance observed in plasma cells. Altogether, these data show that nonfunctionally rearranged alleles are subjected to active transcription but that multiple RNA surveillance mechanisms eradicate up to 90 % of <b>out-of-frame</b> Igkappa mRNA...|$|E
