40|$|Coal miner’s ankle ’ in a child: {{bilateral}} malleolar bursitis A systemically well 11 -year-old girl {{presented with}} a long history of bilateral ankle swelling (figure 1). Palpation revealed soft, well circumscribed masses anterior to each of the lateral malleoli, accompanied by smaller swellings over the fifth meta-tarsal heads. Gait and range of movement were unaffected. Investigations were largely unremarkable, but ultrasound of the affected areas demonstrated mixed echogenic areas clearly sep-arate from the local tendons and muscles. On review of her history, it emerged that the patient spent protracted periods of time sitting crossed-legged. Adoption of her sitting position (figure 2) elegantly demonstrated that each area of swelling directly <b>overlay</b> <b>contact</b> points with the floor. This pattern is consistent with an adventitious malleolar bur-sitis which is more usually associated with restrictive footwear, such {{as in the case of}} professional ice skaters. 1 However, in this case, the association with crossed-legged sitting is more con-cordant with a historic pattern of bursitis recognised in coal miners who commonly sat in this manner in the restricted height environment of coal seams. 2 In the absence of impaired function or sepsis, lateral malleo-lar bursitis will normally respond well to conservative manage-ment, with lifestyle advice to avoid pressure on the affected areas...|$|E
40|$|While in land {{spatial data}} {{processing}} or application, spatial relationship of land data features should be carefully checked {{to guarantee the}} data quality. For land use data or cadastral data, lots of spatial relation rules need GIS query functions to find the overlay or disjoint feature errors, for example, all the land use patches must conform to combine a non-overlay, non-repetition and continuous area. Currently, there are many types of spatial relationship like equality, contain, intersect, disjoint, <b>overlay,</b> <b>contact</b> etc, which can be utilized in GIS systems. Though each of them can find different data errors, they require in turn examining every pair of features separately and will be very time-consuming, especially when land use data contains large number of features or lots of the feature shapes are complicated, so for land spatial data management system, a fast algorithm is needed to systematically check variant data errors in a short time. In this paper, a new land data checking algorithm of overlay, repetition and disjoint errors is proposed. The main concept and detail steps of this algorithm are introduced and illustrated. Then an experiment on comparing this algorithm and a common algorithm which uses spatial query functions of GIS software in checking overlap, repetition, and disjoint errors for land use data is carried out. Results show that this algorithm has high efficiency than the other one...|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{this layer}} handles all {{communication}} between GiGi-MR clients and the overlay network. All messages {{received from the}} upper layers are sent to the network. The <b>overlay</b> <b>contacts</b> this layer whenever there is a message meant for the node related to resource updates. Finally, all changes to the node’s neighbour set (e.g., remote node leaving) are reported. The Resource Discovery layer deals with those changes appropriately.|$|R

A 2 % RO frequency change due to gate focus variations, a three-four nm overlay error, a 20 % increase in RO frequency per 1 um increase in length of diffusion (LOD), and a 3 % speed-up per 0. 3 um change in STI width are measured.

50|$|The Smalfjord diamictite, Birganjagga Tillite or Reusch's Moraine is a diamictite in Finnmark, {{northern}} Norway. The {{rock was}} first {{identified as a}} tillite by Hans Reusch in 1891, hence its name. The tillite <b>overlays</b> sandstone whose <b>contact</b> surface is striated. Reusch's Moraine belong to the Smalfjord Formation, a geological formation of Neoproterozoic age. The tillite possibly formed during the Sturtian glaciation in connection to a global glaciation.|$|R
30|$|Similar to Chord, to join SHAM, node u {{contacts}} a bootstrapping server {{that holds}} the IP addresses of nodes already situated in the system. The bootstrapping server responds with a list containing the IP addresses of nodes that had recently joined the system. Discovering and contacting a node in the system engages procedures outside of the <b>overlay,</b> i.e., <b>contacting</b> a web-server that is known to provide the addresses of nodes in SHAM. This server is simply a Rendezvous host that is not attached in anyway to overlay [17]. Hence, it does not impinge on the functionality of the mechanism such as node and key handling since its role is limited to providing addresses of available nodes.|$|R

40|$|Medical device {{standards}} recommend {{using both}} a polar and non-polar solvent to extract materials prior to in vitro testing. Testing lipophilic extract in cell culture systems {{is limited by}} the toxicity of the lipophilic solvents used in extraction. Use of agar <b>overlay</b> and direct <b>contact</b> methods do not directly address the problem of testing for highly lipophilic leachates from device or material extracts. This particular problem was approached by 1) use of hydrotropes, and 2) by sealing the suspended cells in dialysis tubing and placing it directly in oil or media. The use of hydrotropes to eliminate micelle formation and increase the solubility of lipophilic compounds was not useful as the hydrotropes themselves were toxic to the cells at concentrations that significantly increased analyte solubility. Diffusion of hydrophobic compounds from either peanut oil or cell culture media into the dialysis tubing where the test cells in media reside was significantly higher for the cell culture media than the peanut oil. There were significant differences in toxicity for cells in dialysis tubing from devices extracted between peanut oil and media. This study illustrates the importance of examining if cell toxicity due to micelle formation versus that of soluble chemicals for lipophilic extracts. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} regular {{magnetic}} {{field in the}} galaxy M 51 {{on the basis of}} a new interpretation of polarization angles observed at the wavelengths 2. 8, 6. 2, 18. 0 and 20. 5 cm. We found a magneto-ionic halo in M 51 with a radial extent of about 10 kpc. The regular magnetic fields in the disk and the halo have different structures. The regular magnetic field in the halo is axisymmetric and horizontal. Its field lines are spirals pointing inwards and generally opposite to those in the disk. The azimuthal structure of the magnetic field in the disk is neither axisymme- tric nor bisymmetric but can be represented by a superposition of these two basic harmonics with about equal weights. Magnetic lines of the regular field in the disk are spirals generally directed outwards. They are well aligned with the optical spiral arms as traced by the dust lanes. The regular magnetic field strength averaged in 3 kpc wide rings is about 5 - 10 muG in the disk and 3 muG in the radial range 3 [...] 6 kpc in the halo. These values are in good agreement with independent estimates from the synchrotron emission. The general features of the magnetic patterns revealed in the disk and the halo seem to be in agreement with predictions of dynamo theory. Our results are also based on an analysis of the magneto-ionic medium in M 51. For a range of radii in the galactic disk, we estimated the scale heights of synchrotron and thermal disks, electron densities and filling factors as well as the amount of depolarization.
