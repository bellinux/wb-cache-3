40|$|In this study, the {{relationship}} between the risk factors of perfectionism and depression and <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptomatology was examined. A sample of female undergraduates completed the following three measures: the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), and the Questionnaire for Eating Disorder Diagnoses (Q-EDD). Results indicated that perfectionism is significantly positively correlated with depression. Higher levels of perfectionism were also associated with the presence <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms, whereas lower levels of perfectionism were associated with the absence <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms.

50|$|Another study {{specifically}} investigated {{whether a}} parental's <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> could predict <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> in their children.

40|$|Objective: To examine {{relationships}} between exercise behaviour, eating-disordered behaviour {{and quality of}} life in a community sample of women. Method: Self-report measures of frequency of exercise, obligatoriness of exercise and motivation for exercise, and <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology {{and quality of life}}, were completed by 169 women aged 18 - 45 who engaged in regular exercise. Results: Exercising to improve appearance or body tone, and feelings of guilt following the postponement of exercise, were the exercise variables most strongly associated with elevated levels <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology and, in turn, reduced quality of life. There was no association between exercise behaviour and quality of life independent of the effects <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology. Conclusions: Operational definitions of excessive exercise might usefully include reference to the use of exercise to improve appearance or body tone and the experience of guilt following postponement of exercise. Inclusion of such information in prevention programmes for <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> may also be of benefit. 'Excessive exercise' is unlikely to be associated with impairment in psychosocial functioning in the absence <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology...|$|R
25|$|Emotional abuse {{includes}} minimising, threats, isolation, public humiliation, unrelenting criticism, constant personal devaluation, repeated stonewalling and gaslighting. Stalking is {{a common}} form of psychological intimidation, and is most often perpetrated by former or current intimate partners. Victims tend to feel their partner has nearly total control over them, greatly affecting the power dynamic in a relationship, empowering the perpetrator, and disempowering the victim. Victims often suffer from depression, putting them at increased risk <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse.|$|E
25|$|The issues {{surrounding}} body image can be examined through, body negativity, and body positivity. Negative body image {{consists of a}} disoriented view of one’s shape; whereby they often feel self-conscious or feel ashamed, and assume others are more attractive. Aside from having low self-esteems, suffers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> isolation, and mental illnesses. Positive body image on the other hand, {{is described as a}} clear true perception of one’s figure. In addition to celebrating and appreciating the body, it also requires an understanding that an individual’s appearance does not reflect their character or self worth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract“Eating {{disorder}} NOS” is {{the most}} common <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> encountered in outpatient settings yet it has been neglected. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS, establish its severity, and determine whether its high relative prevalence might be due to the inclusion of cases closely resembling anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. One hundred and seventy consecutive patients with an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> were assessed using standardised instruments. Operational DSM-IV diagnoses were made and <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS cases were compared with bulimia nervosa cases. Diagnostic criteria were then adjusted to determine the impact on the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS. Cases <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS comprised 60. 0 % of the sample. These cases closely resembled the cases of bulimia nervosa in the nature, duration and severity of their psychopathology. Few could be reclassified as cases of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. The findings indicate that <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS is common, severe and persistent. Most cases are “mixed” in character and not subthreshold forms of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. It is proposed that in DSM-V the clinical state (or states) currently embraced by the diagnosis <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS be reclassified as one or more specific forms <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|R

Results: Participants who reported recurrent bulimic episodes had significantly higher levels <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology and functional impairment {{than those who did}} not and this was the case whether the episodes were objective or subjective. Similarly, participants who reported the use of extreme weight control behaviors had higher levels <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology and functional impairment {{than those who did not}}, and this was the case whether purging or nonpurging behaviors were employed. The combination of bulimic episodes and extreme weight control behaviors was associated with particularly high levels <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology and functional impairment. Conclusion: The combination of bulimic episodes, objective or subjective, and extreme weight control behaviors, purging or nonpurging, is significant in terms of impairment in psychosocial functioning among individuals affected by <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> not meeting formal diagnostic criteria for BN. The combination of SBEs and extreme weight control behaviors, in particular, warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Randomized trials {{provide support}} for the Body Project, an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> {{prevention}} program wherein young women with body image concerns critique the thin ideal, which putatively reduces pursuit of this unrealistic ideal {{as a result of}} dissonance-induction. Despite medium to large effects, some Body Project participants subsequently develop an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> during 3 -year study follow-up, suggesting intervention or recruitment procedures could be improved. This study was the first to delineate the heterogeneous pathways <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptom trajectories among Body Project versus control group participants during 3 -year study follow-up. This study also investigated the predictive role of baseline risk factors on qualitatively distinct developmental pathways <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptomology, helping to explain contributing factors to suboptimal Body Project response. Existing data from three randomized controlled trials were combined to examine response trajectories of prevention intervention versus control participants through 3 -year follow-up. Group-Based Trajectory Modeling distinguished distinct response trajectories and the impact of prevention on mitigating the developmental course <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms. The three-group solution for control participants produced the strongest model fit. The resulting trajectories were those of low-stable, moderate-stable, or high-variable levels <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptom courses. Dietary restraint and negative affect predicted increased likelihood of membership in the high-risk trajectory. The optimal solution for Body Project participants was a two-group trajectory model with low-decreasing or high-decreasing trajectories, with the moderate-level risk group observed in the control group seemingly deflected by prevention effects. This study also determined the predictive role of risk factors on qualitatively distinct developmental pathways <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptomology, confirming the hypothesized impact of thin-ideal internalization, negative affect, and dietary restraint on sub-optimal prevention response.

25|$|Less {{is usually}} {{known about the}} {{pressures}} models in the industry face, but striving hard {{to meet the requirements}} of their agency or brand is a main facet. Among the group, 69% were told to tone up, while 62% cited that their agencies required them to lose weight or change their body shape. Another 54% of models; however, revealed that they would be dropped by their agencies if they failed to comply.  Hence, models habitually weigh themselves under the healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) level. A study published in the International Journal <b>of</b> <b>Eating</b> <b>Disorders,</b> discovered that a majority of models had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.41, which qualifies for anorexia. In the past twenty years, runway models have also transformed from a typical size 6-8 to 0-2. The average weight of a typical model in the United States was also recorded to be twenty-three percent less than an average woman in society. This phenomenon has caused countless of models to suffer from illness such as eating disorders and anorexia nervosa. In extreme cases, some models have died due to complications caused by eating disorders. In 2006, the fashion industry came under fire due to the untimely death of two models; Luisel Ramos, and Ana Carolina Reston. Both girls suffered complications from their eating disorders, and were severely underweight. Owing to the intensifying burdens, an high number of models are therefore willing to participate in intensive exercise regimes, diets, fasts, and detoxes; in order to maintain or lose weight. In addition, 17% have admitted to stimulant abuse, while another 8% frequently engaged in self-induced vomiting.|$|E
25|$|With {{the aim of}} {{protecting}} models and projecting a healthier body image, Spain, Italy, Brazil, and Israel, “passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5”. The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models, {{and the need for}} a medical certificate to verify their health. This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18. France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements. However, some argue that these laws may not be effective as, majority of individuals are already aware of digital retouching techniques, and may even use it themselves. Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; Kering and LVMH, recently “announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2”. Not only will this improve the working conditions of models, both companies hope it may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry is moving in the right direction, it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming. For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to “send the message that super slim body types is the ‘ideal’”.|$|E

Whereas levels <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology and functional impairment were markedly elevated among BED cases with extreme weight or shape concerns, BED cases who did not report extreme weight or shape concerns resembled obese non-binge eaters in most respects.

2500|$|Gastrointestinal diseases: {{people with}} {{gastrointestinal}} disorders {{may be more}} risk of developing disorders eating practices than the general population, principally restrictive eating disturbances. An association of anorexia nervosa with celiac disease has been found. The role that gastrointestinal symptoms play in the development <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> seems rather complex. Some authors report that unresolved symptoms prior to gastrointestinal disease diagnosis may create a food aversion in these persons, causing alterations to their eating patterns. Other authors report that greater symptoms throughout their diagnosis led to greater risk. It has been documented that some people with celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease who are not conscious {{about the importance of}} strictly following their diet, choose to consume their trigger foods to promote weight loss. On the other hand, individuals with good dietary management may develop anxiety, food aversion and eating disorders because of concerns around cross contamination of their foods. Some authors suggest that medical professionals should evaluate the presence of an unrecognized celiac disease in all people with eating disorder, especially if they present any gastrointestinal symptom (such as [...] decreased appetite, abdominal pain, bloating, distension, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation), weight loss, or growth failure; and also routinely ask celiac patients about [...] weight or body shape concerns, dieting or vomiting for weight control, to evaluate the possible presence <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> especially in women.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{different}} standards of beauty {{for men and}} women, men are often not diagnosed as anorexic. Generally men who alter their bodies do so to be lean and muscular rather than thin.

[...] Men and women athletes are often overlooked as anorexic.

For athletes, ritualized activities such as weigh-ins place emphasis on weight, which may promote the development <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> among them. [...] While women use diet pills, which is an indicator of unhealthy behavior and an eating disorder, men use steroids, which contextualizes the beauty ideals for genders.

40|$|Background: {{although}} {{cases of}} early onset anorexia nervosa have been described, {{there has been}} no systematic comparison of early onset cases with classic cases of later onset, or with other forms <b>of</b> early onset <b>eating</b> disturbance. Method: a consecutive series of patients referred to two specialist child and adolescent <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> services with a clinical diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> (N = 126) was systematically assessed using a child version of the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) and the K-SADS interview. Results: of 86 patients with a diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> early onset, 38 received a clinical diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN). The remainder were mainly diagnosed as having food avoidance emotional disorder (25 patients) and selective eating (17 patients). Six received other diagnoses (bulimia nervosa, or functional dysphasia). These 48 patients were combined to form a group of early onset non-AN eating disturbance. In terms <b>of</b> specific <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology and general psychopathology, the early onset AN group was very similar to the late onset AN sample.
