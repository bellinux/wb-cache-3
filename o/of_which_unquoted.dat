40|$|Discount {{volatility}} {{is generally}} {{an important component}} of total risk for closed-end funds but there is considerable cross-sectional variation in the magnitude of this discount volatility. These are interesting aspects of the closed-end fund discount puzzle which have received little attention in the literature, particularly as regards UK investment trusts. This paper seeks to explain the cross-sectional variation in discount volatility for the UK investment trust sector. The sample consists of 59 UK conventional investment trusts in continuous operation over the five years from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1996. Discount volatility is calculated using monthly intervals. Four explanatory variables are highly significant - trust share turnover, standard deviation of NAV return, market value and percentage <b>of</b> underlying assets <b>which</b> are <b>unquoted.</b> There is no evidence that either small investor sentiment or UK specific sentiment has any impact on discount volatility...|$|R
30|$|In other words, {{according}} to the analysis proposed by Maier, FID is a direct discourse where some elements of the quoted discourse are <b>unquoted.</b> <b>Which</b> elements in the sentence get unquoted {{is a matter of}} pragmatics. It is still poorly understood which pragmatic principles govern the availability of the unquotation mechanism. What needs be done—in Maier’s view—is a case-by-case analysis of the pragmatic factors that motivate the limited amount of unquotations in FID.|$|R

A "close company" is defined in the statutes as a company or an economic association in which a small number of people, directly or indirectly, own shares representing more than 50 % of the voting rights. Close companies are subject to special tax regulations in order to prevent the exploitation of the possibility to conclude a contract between a close company and its shareholders. Since 1997, shares in unquoted companies have been subjected to limited relief, at the shareholder level, from economic double taxation...|$|R
