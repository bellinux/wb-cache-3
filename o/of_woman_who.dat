500|$|After divorcing Ike in 1978, Tina abstained {{from serious}} {{relationships}} {{for a long}} time, as she set on bringing her career back on track. In 1986 she said, [...] "People {{have to realize that}} I just got out of a very difficult marriage. I'm not the type <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> needs to jump back into another. I liked my freedom when I got out of that one. I've had a few love affairs, but nothing important." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Guillaera" [...] (Attitude), a {{duet with}} Gran Omar, {{explains}} what type of man she does and does not desire. According to Kalefa Sanneh of The New York Times, [...] "Drama" [...] sets her [...] "rapid-fire monologue atop a sublime, head-nodding hip-hop beat." [...] On [...] "Tuya Soy", (I'm Yours) she explains [...] "the story <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> suspects her husband of infidelity", a controversial theme which has been prominent in Queen's lyrical content. [...] "Bésame", (Kiss Me) is an evocative theme, expressing the {{need to go to}} the dance floor with the guy she like. [...] "Me Acostumbré" [...] (I Got Accustomed) and [...] "Dile Que Ya" [...] (Tell Him Okay) are [...] "hip-hop ballads". [...] "Alerta" [...] (Alert) features [...] "choppy rhythms, handclaps, and vaguely nefarious horns, plus an ingratiating synth line played by a one-fingered android".|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{struggled to}} cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence—" [...] has immense energy, huge energy, {{and is the}} kind <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> could do all {{the kind of things}} Jessie could do—you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth [...]" [...] Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." [...] Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having [...] "a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before.

500|$|Walt Disney himself first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1940s. However, the filmmaker's efforts were never fully realized because the fairy tale was considered too [...] "small". In 2008, co-directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided to enlarge the film's scale in order to transform it into a [...] "big event" [...] in order {{for it to be}} successful. Meanwhile, the character Mother Gothel was developed into a much more complex villain than the witch upon whom she is based, conceiving her as [...] "a very lonely woman who really {{did not know how to}} have a relationship of any kind". Little else had been determined about the character at the time, who was simply described as [...] "the type <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> ... envisioned herself in the spotlight." [...] A departure from traditional Disney villains, Mother Gothel is not a witch or a sorceress. Because she lacks supernatural powers, the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, charm, intellect and charisma, a conscious decision made by Greno and Howard. However, in the Brothers Grimm's original fairy tale, Gothel is very much depicted as a typical witch-like character, an idea that was modified for the Disney film adaptation in favor of having Gothel's agelessness instead be [...] "derive ... from Rapunzel's hair." ...|$|E

2500|$|Experts {{attribute}} high {{mortality rates}} and under nutrition amongst infants to the decreasing number <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> breastfeed. This delay in breastfeeding initiation {{increases the risk}} of neonatal mortality. Experts suggest breastfeeding within the first day of birth until the infant is 6-months old. [...] Promotion of breastfeeding during this period could potentially reduce the mortality rates by 16% if infant was breast fed since day one and 22% if the infant was breastfed within the first hour. Rates of breastfeeding initiation vary with ethnicity and socioeconomic situations. Studies suggest that college educated women over their 30 are more likely to initiate breastfeeding in comparison to other women who have different levels of educational attainment.|$|E

Queen {{noted that}} she sang the song without rapping to prove {{she is a}} complete musician {{and not just a}} rapper. [...] "Me Acostumbré" [...] ("I Got Accustomed") and is a [...] "hip-hop ballad". [...] "Rebulera", composed in minor-key song, has Queen asserting that she is [...] "queen" [...] in the genre of reggaetón. The track features synthesizers and strings, and is influenced by reggae and Afro-Latin music. [...] "Mi Barrio" [...] ("My Hood") criticizes [...] "the problems present in Añasco, Puerto Rico". Queen compared the song to [...] "Corazones" [...] by Daddy Yankee from his album, Barrio Fino (2004). On [...] "Tuya Soy", ("I'm Yours") she explains [...] "the story <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> suspects her husband of infidelity", a controversial theme which has been prominent in Queen's lyrical content.|$|E
2500|$|The {{songs on}} Faultlines cover {{a variety of}} topics, and {{although}} she has claimed at live performances {{that they are all}} quite depressing, many have an uplifting aspect. This is particularly evident in [...] "The Sun's Comin' Over The Hill" [...] (which won Best Original Song at the BBC Folk Awards 2005) which tells the story <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> reacts to the death of her partner through a period of depression, drink and drugs, but has a more optimistic chorus, with the narrator foreseeing an end to this period. There are exceptions to this: [...] "Waterlily" [...] — the tale of a man whose lover is killed during the war in Yugoslavia, based on the book Cold Night Lullaby by Colin Mackay — offers no such comfort. [...] "Only One Way", on the other hand, is an upbeat song with a strong political theme and some biting humour.|$|E

The Army Ranger Wing [...] "Tactical Town" [...] or [...] "Tac Town" [...] in the Curragh Camp, County Kildare is also routinely used by the ERU, and operators receive further specialised training at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Academy in Quantico, Virginia in the United States. An officer's journey into the ranks of the ERU begins with a notorious two-week initiation dubbed [...] "hell week", where candidates are both physically and mentally assessed. Examinations include tasks to be completed within a set amount of time both on land and in water. Failure during the recruitment process is extremely high (95%), but those that complete the tests successfully are then put through a number of more specific, rigorous exercises, where their suitability for the unit is determined. Aspiring ERU officers must have at least 4 years experience as a uniformed Garda with an unblemished disciplinary record before attempting to join the unit. The unit is admittedly male dominated, but there are understood to be a number <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> have worked and work in the ERU.|$|E
2500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Xan Brooks of The Guardian, {{who gave the}} film one star, {{describing}} it as [...] "a primped and simpering folly, the turkey that dreamed it was a peacock. Brooks predicted that the film [...] "may even surpass 2008's Filth and Wisdom, Madonna's calamitous first outing as a film-maker. Her direction is so all over the shop that it barely qualifies as direction at all." [...] Pointing out a scene, he added that [...] "Madonna has Wallis bound on stage to dance with a Masai tribesman while Pretty Vacant blares on the soundtrack. But why? What point is she making? That social-climbing Wallis-Simpson was the world's first punk-rocker?" [...] Todd McCarthy from The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film resembled a documentary of a woman out on a shopping expedition. McCarthy felt that the storyline was especially dreary during the portrayal of the love affair between Wally and Evgeni. [...] "For the audience, Wally, despite Cornish's gentle and warm presence, offers very little in terms of personal interest or as a key {{into the world of}} one of the last century's most discussed couples." [...] However, McCarthy praised cinematographer Hagen Bogdaski's work. Oliver Lyttelton of indieWire also slammed the film stating that [...] "the use of music is horrible" [...] and [...] "We’ve never looked forward to Madonna going back on tour more, if only because it means that we’ll know, for certain, that she won’t be using that time to direct another movie." [...] Emma Pritchard from Grazia added that [...] "Wallis Simpson was the kind <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> was accused of being more style than substance– and that, alas, is what Madonna has recreated on screen with W.E." [...] Mark Adams of Screen Daily singled out Riseborough's performance as a [...] "highlight", but overall felt that the film was disappointing. Leslie Felperin from Variety was disappointed in the film, saying that it is [...] "burdened with risible dialogue and weak performances". Felperin felt that the reason for the film's downfall was its script, which attended to the costumes and fashion more than the actual story, which she felt had much potential, but was unused.|$|E
