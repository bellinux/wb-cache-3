60|$|As {{she herself}} was {{dropping}} off Daffy became aware of an <b>odd</b> <b>sound,</b> somehow familiar, and yet surprising and disconcerting.|$|E
60|$|Another <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> floated {{over the}} wire, {{and there was}} a moment of silence before Ginger found himself able to resume.|$|E
60|$|Then an <b>odd</b> <b>sound,</b> a sobbing panting, {{that grew}} faster and fainter. Yet another silence, and then dim sounds and the {{grunting}} of some animal.|$|E
5000|$|At the debut, {{the song}} [...] "Eclipse" [...] {{was nothing more}} than lyricless {{extension}} of [...] "Brain Damage" [...] that devolved into various <b>odd</b> <b>sounds.</b> The version with lyrics and music as found on the album debuted at Bristol on 5 February.|$|R
5000|$|... "Dead Center," [...] {{a rarity}} from a promotional single, was {{distinguished}} by a [...] "freaky opening" [...] which featured [...] "layered voices, <b>odd</b> <b>sounds,</b> and snatches of bandmember interviews" [...] that foreshadowed the experimentalism of the band's 1987 double album Lolita Nation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I have," [...] Strether laughed: [...] "one does {{fill out}} some with all one takes in, and I've taken in, I dare say, more than I've natural room for. I was dog-tired when I sailed." [...] It had the <b>oddest</b> <b>sound</b> of cheerfulness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mayhap it was. Yes, doubtless {{that was}} it. I {{have been hearing}} it faintly all the--there it is again! It is not the wind! What an <b>odd</b> <b>sound!</b> Come, we will hunt it out!" ...|$|E
60|$|Presently Jo appeared, proudly {{bearing a}} flannel bundle laid forth upon a large pillow. Jo's face was very sober, {{but her eyes}} twinkled, {{and there was an}} <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> in her voice of {{repressed}} emotion of some sort.|$|E
6000|$|Paul {{fixed his}} eyes sharply {{on the woman}} as he spoke, but she seemed {{unconscious}} of it, and turned to go on, saying indifferently, [...] "Oh, that's the <b>odd</b> <b>sound,</b> is it? No, it doesn't trouble me, so grind away, and make an end of {{it as soon as}} may be." ...|$|E
5000|$|Frank Zappa is {{credited}} by some with inventing the audience wave during his set. He assigned {{sections of the}} stadium (audience) to each make different <b>odd</b> <b>sounds</b> and gestures, including standing with arms raised. He then [...] "played" [...] a [...] "tune" [...] on his [...] "crowd instrument".|$|R
5000|$|... "What's My Mission Now?" [...] is {{a single}} by the American {{industrial}} hip-hop group Tackhead, released in October 1985 on On-U Sound. Scott Becker of Option called it [...] "Sherwood as his outrageous best: wild stereo effects, a crucial beat, a bit of dubbing-it-up, found vocals (in this instance, used largely to poke fun at the military), <b>odd</b> <b>sounds,</b> the works." ...|$|R
50|$|Ai is {{a mystery}} novel writer. She {{received}} a letter from Kubo, a reader of her novel and a university student. Kubo's letter states that she hears <b>odd</b> <b>sounds</b> from the room where she lives now. Ai becomes interested by the letter and they being to investigate. Ai and Kubo learn of people that lived in the apartment and their experiences including a suicide and murder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Satanstoe; I do not {{wonder you}} smile, for {{it has an}} <b>odd</b> <b>sound,</b> {{but it is the}} name my {{grandfather}} has given the family place in Westchester. Given, I have said, though translated would be better, as I understand the present appellation is pretty literally rendered into English from the Dutch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your father sent that," [...] said Isabella Spencer with an <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> in her voice. [...] "I {{remember}} it well. It {{was among the}} things I packed up and sent after him. His father had brought it home from China fifty years ago, and he prized it beyond anything. They used {{to say it was}} worth a lot of money." ...|$|E
60|$|And here, {{though it}} makes an <b>odd</b> <b>sound,</b> {{yet it is}} {{necessary}} to say, that whoever professes himself a member of the Church of England, ought to believe a God and his providence, together with revealed religion, and the divinity of Christ. For beside those many thousands, who (to speak in the phrase of divines) do practically deny all this by the immorality of their lives; there is no small number, who in their conversation and writings directly or by consequence endeavour to overthrow it; yet all these place themselves in the list of the National Church, though at the same time (as it is highly reasonable) they are great sticklers for liberty of conscience.|$|E
50|$|The show {{focuses on}} the lives of Maisy Mouse and her friends. A mellow-voiced narrator narrates the action and {{communicates}} with the characters while the animals go through their paces without speaking; they instead make various <b>odd</b> <b>sounds</b> and noises that sound like speaking. The narrator, however, can understand them easily because he's the only one that actually speaks. The animated series keeps the two-dimensional visual style of the books.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first album}} done for another label was his [...] "Bacteria and Gravity" [...] for the RRR label in 1987 {{on which the}} second side is one long piece filled with tribal rhythms, other-worldly voices and <b>odd</b> <b>sounds</b> such a {{bullfrog}} and car horn. Shortly after this release, Greif teamed up with Mikail Bohonus of WarWorld to form Static Effect who performed improvisationally around loosely defined musical structures. They toured North America and Canada and released a number of cassettes and vinyl before disbanding in 1990.|$|R
50|$|According to a legend, Bachorza is {{a haunted}} house. Both its lords and their {{servants}} reported <b>odd</b> <b>sounds</b> coming from empty rooms; also, the paintings {{were supposed to}} disappear or move during the night. This myth purportedly affected the selling price {{of the house in}} 1935; Dołęga-Zaleski, who purchased Bachorza that year, claimed not to believe these rumours, yet his wife and the last lady of the manor, Natalia Dołęga-Zaleska née Ślepowron-Roman, maintained to have seen a parade of phantoms dressed in an old fashioned way shortly before her death in 1942.|$|R
6000|$|But poor Jo {{never got}} her laugh, {{for she was}} transfixed upon the {{threshold}} by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes. Going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover, it certainly {{was a shock to}} behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away. At the <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> the lovers turned and saw her. Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but 'that man', as Jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the astonished newcomer, [...] "Sister Jo, congratulate us!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{will have}} an <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> in history, and appear hardly credible, that in several petty republics of single towns, which make up the States General, it should be {{formally}} debated, whether the Queen of Great Britain, who preserved the commonwealth at the charge of so many millions, should be suffered to enjoy, after a peace, the liberty granted her by Spain of selling African slaves in the Spanish dominions of America! But there was a prevailing faction at The Hague, violently bent against any peace, where the Queen must act that part which they had intended for themselves. These politicians, who held constant correspondence with their old dejected friends in England, were daily fed with the vain hopes of the Queen's death, or the party's restoration. They likewise endeavoured to spin out the time, till Prince Eugene's activity had pushed on some great event, which might govern or perplex the conditions of peace. Therefore the Dutch plenipotentiaries, who proceeded by the instructions of those mistaken patriots, acted in every point with a spirit of litigiousness, than which nothing could give greater advantage to the enemy; a strict union between the allies, but especially Britain and Holland, being doubtless the only means for procuring safe and honourable terms from France.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing hath humbled me so much, or shewn {{a greater}} {{disposition}} to a contemptuous treatment of Ireland in some chief governors,[17] than that high style of several speeches from the throne, delivered, as usual, after the royal assent, in some periods {{of the two}} last reigns. Such high exaggerations of the prodigious condescensions in the prince, to pass those good laws, would have but an <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> at Westminster: Neither do I apprehend how any good law can pass, wherein the king's interest is not as much concerned {{as that of the}} people. I remember after a speech on the like occasion, delivered by my Lord Wharton, (I think it was his last) he desired Mr. Addison to ask my opinion of it: My answer was, [...] "That his Excellency had very honestly forfeited his head on account of one paragraph; wherein he asserted by plain consequence, a dispensing power in the Queen." [...] His Lordship owned it was true, but swore the words were put into his mouth by direct orders from Court. From whence it is clear, that some ministers in those times, were apt, from their high elevation, to look down upon this kingdom {{as if it had been}} one of their colonies of outcasts in America. And I observed a little of the same turn of spirit in some great men, from whom I expected better; although to do them justice, it proved no point of difficulty to make them correct their idea, whereof the whole nation quickly found the benefit?--But that is forgotten. How the style hath since run, I am wholly a stranger, having never seen a speech since the last of the Queen.|$|E
50|$|Two {{days after}} the party, Joel fails to attend a {{scheduled}} dinner at Norah's house. When she calls him, all she hears is somebody breathing and making <b>odd</b> <b>sounds</b> into the phone. She tells her children Carrie and Peter {{to go ahead and}} eat, and heads over to her brother's seedy Spanish Harlem apartment to find out about his delay. Norah sees Joel dragged out by the police. She then learns that he tried to kill the building superintendent, Mr. Pérez (Aukie Herger), and is being taken to Bellevue Hospital.|$|R
6000|$|Then the {{phonograph}} {{began to}} play. A strain of <b>odd,</b> jerky <b>sounds</b> {{was followed by}} these words, sung by a man through his nose with great vigor of expression: ...|$|R
50|$|In Pet Sounds, Wilson {{conceived}} of experimental arrangements which combine conventional rock set-ups with various exotic instruments, producing new sounds {{with a rich}} texture reminiscent of symphonic works layered underneath meticulous vocal harmonics. Many of those instruments were alien to rock music, including glockenspiel, ukulele, accordion, Electro-Theremin, bongos, harpsichord, violin, viola, cello, trombone, Coca-Cola bottles, and other <b>odd</b> <b>sounds</b> such as barking dogs, trains, and bicycle bells. This kind of selection was stylistically appropriated {{from a wide variety}} of cultures, with some relating it to exotica and its associated producers Martin Denny, Les Baxter, and Esquivel.|$|R
60|$|I sat {{up for an}} hour or more, {{trying to}} arrive at some {{conclusion}} about Farrar, but at length I gave it up. His visit had in it something impulsive which I could not reconcile with his manner. He surely owed me nothing for refusing a case against him, and must have known that my motives for so doing were not personal. But if I did not understand him, I liked him decidedly from that night forward, and I hoped that his advances had sprung from some other motive than politeness. And indeed we gradually drifted into a quasi-friendship. It became his habit, as he went out in the morning, to drop into my room for a match, and I returned the compliment by borrowing his coal oil when mine was out. At such times we would sit, or more frequently stand, discussing the affairs of the town and of the nation, for politics was an easy and attractive subject to us both. It was only in a general way that we touched upon each other's concerns, this being dangerous ground with Farrar, who was ever ready to close up at anything resembling a confidence. As for me, I hope I am not curious, but I own to having had a curiosity about Farrar's Philadelphia patron, to whom Farrar made but slight allusions. His very name--Farquhar Fenelon Cooke--had an <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> which somehow betokened an odd man, and there was more than one bit of gossip afloat in the town of which he was the subject, notwithstanding {{the fact that he had}} never honored it with a visit. The gossip was the natural result of Mr. Cooke's large properties in the vicinity. It has never been my habit, however, to press a friend on such matters, and I could easily understand and respect Farrar's reluctance to talk of one from whom he received an income.|$|E
5000|$|While {{he tries}} to chase it, he {{encounters}} {{a whole bunch of}} mice, who attack him. With an <b>odd</b> <b>sound,</b> he realized he was saved by the girl Sayako met.|$|E
5000|$|The track [...] "FX" [...] {{came about}} {{unexpectedly}} in the studio. After smoking hashish, the crucifix hanging from Iommis neck accidentally struck {{the strings of}} his guitar and the band {{took an interest in}} the <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> produced. An echo effect was added {{and the rest of the}} band proceeded to hit the guitar with various objects to generate <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> effects. Iommi calls the song [...] "a total joke". [...] The album, Tony Iommi told Circuss sister magazine Circus Raves, [...] "was such a complete change - we felt we had jumped an album, really ... We had tried to go too far." ...|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{conceived}} of experimental arrangements that combined conventional rock set-ups with various exotic instruments, producing new sounds {{with a rich}} texture reminiscent of symphonic works layered underneath meticulous vocal harmonics. In total, the number of unique instruments used for each track average to about a dozen. Many of those instruments were alien to rock music, including glockenspiel, ukulele, accordion, Electro-Theremin, bongos, harpsichord, violin, viola, cello, trombone, Coca-Cola bottles, and other <b>odd</b> <b>sounds</b> such as barking dogs, trains, and bicycle bells. This kind of selection was stylistically appropriated {{from a wide variety}} of cultures, with some relating it to exotica and its associated producers Martin Denny, Les Baxter, and Esquivel.|$|R
50|$|Afterwards, mysterious things happen. Harris and {{his wife}} Allison (Clare Kramer) are frightened by {{unexpected}} visions and <b>odd</b> <b>sounds.</b> Then Kira is attacked by a demonic force. She is severely bitten and sexually assaulted, and her house is ransacked. Sid is plagued by unexpected fires. They enlist a pair of paranormal investigators, Vincent Cochet (Tchéky Karyo) and Frances Culpepper (Megahn Perry), who determine that the three friends inadvertently invoked a powerful curse by dancing on the graves. They are now being haunted by three wayward spirits—a passionate axe murderer, a child pyromaniac, and a serial killer and rapist—who will kill them at the next full moon.|$|R
6000|$|Jock {{drew the}} bed clothes over his face, and an <b>odd</b> stifled <b>sound</b> was heard from under them. He {{remained}} thus perdu, while directions were {{being given to}} John for the night, but as the doctor was leaving the room, emerged and said—- ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{was known}} for his extreme enthusiasm for weather that would usually result in a variety of <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> effects including: Bing, bowg, boink, boing, boiiiiing, bowk, hah, haaah!, (tearing sound), (squashed sound), ohhhh, goooomph, ziiiing, zoooom, (sound of car {{stopping}} suddenly), phhhht, eeerrrrrrumble-rumble-rumble, (slurping sound), sheeewhhhh, oh-oh, vooomph, voom, wonk, vooop, whhktw, waawaa, waaaa, waaam, and zeeek.|$|E
50|$|Barefoot, Ahamed {{gradually}} sheds {{layers of}} clothes throughout the story, adapting his attire {{with the addition}} of various accessories. The <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> effect is added for emphasis, along with the warm lighting glow of a Bangladeshi sun, while a chair, woven with material forms the central prop. Integrating physical theatre and song into the performance, he mimics personalities and nationalities of people met along the journey with a very funny, and sometimes even alarming, likeness.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{unconventional}} recording {{techniques were}} used in the production of the album. The music is spare, mostly uptempo synthesizer-and-guitar pop punctuated with <b>odd</b> <b>sound</b> samples and occasionally veering into sparse country- or folk-like arrangements. Drum and bass tracks are almost entirely synthesized, though the album prominently features the accordion. In order to record the guitar solo in [...] "Absolutely Bill's Mood", the band telephoned Eugene Chadbourne in Greensboro, NC from Dubway Studios. Chadbourne played the acoustic solo and it was recorded onto the studio's answering machine, then mixed into the song.|$|E
50|$|Then three vagrant, violent men; Eamo (Brian Fortune), Scat (Karl Argue) and Hughie (Emmett Scanlan) {{break in}} and gatecrash the party. They terrorise, {{verbally}} torment, abuse, and physically and sexually assault the women, {{and the women}} scream and wail in fear and despair. Sienna tries to confront them only to be head-butted by Hughie. When Barry tries to intervene, Hughie beats him to death and instigates a game of spin the bottle to rape the women. Whilst Sian is being raped by Eamo, the lights go out, <b>odd</b> <b>sounds</b> emanate from the building, old televisions switch themselves on and a baby's haunting cries are heard. Moments later, Eamo is yanked from Sian by an unseen force, quickly followed by Sian herself.|$|R
50|$|Commander Col. Van Heusen is unconvinced {{and makes}} sure that Carruthers is {{constantly}} accompanied by another member of his crew. While the ship was on the Martian surface, a large external exhaust had been left open, allowing the creature easy access. The crew are at first skeptical that something crawled aboard while they were on Mars. However, when Kienholz investigates <b>odd</b> <b>sounds</b> coming from a lower level, he is killed and his body hidden in an air duct. Next is Gino Finelli. He is found, barely alive, but the creature attacks his would-be rescuer. Bullets have no effect, forcing the crewman to leave Gino behind, much to the distress of his brother Bob. An autopsy of Kienholz's body reveals {{that it has been}} sucked dry of all fluids.|$|R
50|$|In {{the tunnels}} beneath the property, Hank finds {{a cache of}} antique Morgan dollar coins and other silver items, {{scattered}} from the crematory nearby. He returns that night to steal the artifacts and finds an orbitoclast. He hears <b>odd</b> <b>sounds</b> in the tunnels and discovers an empty peanut butter jar. He hears someone behind him and tries to escape the tunnels, but he is attacked by an unseen assailant. The next morning, the other four learn that Hank abruptly broke up with his girlfriend and left town; the four speculate {{about the possibility that}} Hank finally won some money in a lottery. Gordon, who frequently calls his wife and saw Phil speaking to two unknown men during one telephone call, suspects that Phil {{had something to do with}} Hank's disappearance, causing tension between the group.|$|R
