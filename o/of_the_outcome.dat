5|$|Regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the {{continental}} migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.|$|E
5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome,</b> the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Pedro del Valle (1893–1978) was the {{commanding}} officer of the 11th Marine Regiment (artillery). Upon the outbreak of World War II, del Valle led his regiment during the seizure and defense of Guadalcanal, providing artillery support for the 1st Marine Division. In the Battle of the Tenaru, the firepower provided by del Valle's artillery units killed many assaulting Japanese soldiers—almost to the last man—before they reached the Marine positions. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the battle the Japanese commander, Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki, committed seppuku shortly afterwards. General Alexander Vandegrift, impressed with del Valle's leadership, recommended his promotion and on October 1, 1942, del Valle became a brigadier general. Vandegrift retained del Valle {{as head of the}} 11th Marines, the only time that the 11th Marines has ever had a general as their commanding officer. In 1943, he served as commander of Marine Forces overseeing Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Russell and Florida Islands. Sergeant Silvio Sanguedolce was awarded the Navy Cross for their actions in Guadalcanal.|$|E

The German mood was restrained, where the press were satisfied by the Soviet exclusion from patrols. In Spain, the Republicans– {{on the verge of}} disaster– were largely in favour, and the Nationalists strongly against. The Republicans praised the improved safety of the shipping routes, but were somewhat unhappy that belligerent rights had not been granted to both sides. The Nationalists made several complaints, including one over the route recommended to shipping, but none of these resulted in changes to the agreement. The agreement was welcomed by other members of the League of Nations. Italian historians tend to downplay the importance of the Nyon Conference, often seeing it as a mere extension of the Non-Intervention Committee.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to living}} in Seneca Falls, Stanton had become an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott, the Quaker minister, feminist, and {{abolitionist}} whom she had met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England {{in the spring of}} 1840 while on her honeymoon. The two women became allies when the male delegates attending the convention voted that women should be denied participation in the proceedings, even if they, like Mott, had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. After considerable debate, the women were required to sit in a roped-off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance. They were soon joined by the prominent abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, who arrived after the vote had been taken and, in protest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome,</b> refused his seat, electing instead to sit with the women.|$|E
40|$|Often <b>the</b> {{probability}} <b>of</b> responding depends {{directly on}} <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> value. This {{case can be}} treated by postulating a parametric model for <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> before nonresponse and {{a model for the}} response mechanism. The two models define a parametric model for <b>the</b> joint distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> and response indicators, and therefore <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> these models can be estimated by maximization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> likelihood corresponding to this distribution. Modeling <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> before nonresponse, however, can be problematic since no data is available from this distribution. We propose an alternative approach that allows estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> response model by first estimating <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents, and then solving an estimating equation defined by <b>the</b> census likelihood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> response indicators.

5|$|Remember Me {{features}} platforming, {{exploration and}} melee combat. The {{game is played}} as Nilin from a third-person view and introduces the mechanic of memory remixing: entering and rearranging a target's memories to manipulate them. Players accomplish this by replaying a memory and modifying details to change the target's recollection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome.</b> Another key mechanic of the gameplay is stealing memories from certain targets and using points called Remembranes to replay the memory in real-time: this is often needed to proceed through the game or avoid hazards otherwise hidden from the player. When the player is low on health, the screen will glitch until a sufficient amount of health is regained. On occasion, Nilin encounters puzzles {{in the form of}} riddles she must solve to unlock doors so as to further progress in the story.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of witches and demonic forces {{was taken for}} granted by the American colonists—witchcraft was considered {{the work of the}} Devil. Colonists believed that witches could be identified by their strange behavior. As early as 1626, nineteen years after the founding of the Jamestown colony, a grand jury in Virginia sat to consider whether Goodwife Joan Wright was a witch—she had supposedly predicted the deaths of three women and had caused illness as revenge for not hiring her as midwife. No record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> is extant. Nevertheless, Virginia did not experience events of mass hysteria such as the Salem, Massachusetts witch trials in 1692–1693, in which 19people were executed on allegations of sorcery, some years before the first accusations against Sherwood. Ecclesiastical influence in the courtroom was much less a factor in Virginia, where the clergy rarely participated in witchcraft trials, than in New England, where ministers took an active part. People's fears of witchcraft in Virginia were not based on their religious beliefs as much as they were rooted in folklore, although the two often intermingled. New England's Puritans had settled in towns, and community pressure helped contribute to witchcraft convictions. There were few such towns in Virginia, where the population mostly lived on farms and plantations, connected by water transport and scattered over a large area.|$|E
5|$|The {{views of}} historians <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> {{of the battle}} changed {{with the passage of}} time and the {{changing}} political situations surrounding them. Kutuzov proclaimed a victory both to the army and to Emperor Alexander. While many a general throughout history claimed victory out of defeat (Ramses II of Egypt did so) and in this case, Kutuzov was the one man to whom the entire Russian Army could give its allegiance, but it was an army that, despite the huge losses, considered itself undefeated. Announcing a defeat would have removed Kutuzov from his command, and further damaged an army that had endured much and still stood proud. While Alexander was not deceived by the announcement, it gave him the justification needed to allow Kutuzov to march his army off to rebuild the Russian forces and later complete the near utter destruction of the French army. As such, what was said by Kutuzov and those supporting his views was allowed to pass into the histories of the time unchecked.|$|E

5|$|At TNA's {{previous}} No Surrender PPV {{event on}} September14, Sting announced that TNA management {{had decided that}} he would challenge the TNA World Heavyweight Champion for the title at Bound for Glory. Later in the show, Joe defeated Christian Cage and Angle in a Three Ways to Glory match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Jarrett interfered in the bout by bashing a guitar over Angle's head. Following No Surrender on the September18 episode of Impact!, Sting discussed his actions further, stating that when he was younger he learned from the veterans in the industry and that Joe and Styles had been disrespectful in their rivalries with Booker T and Angle. Jarrett responded to Sting's comments later in the show, stating that the issue was not about disrespect, it was about the veterans in the company not wanting to retire and let the younger wrestlers be stars. Angle argued that he made TNA a success, not the efforts of Jarrett, Sting, Joe, or Styles. Angle then challenged Jarrett to a match at Bound for Glory IV, which Jarrett declined. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a match again, this time threatening and mocking him along with his daughters. Jarrett accepted Angle's challenge afterwards. Sting also expressed his reasons for having a desire to face Joe for the title on the same telecast, stating that he was taught respect by veterans in his youth so he was going to defeat Joe for the championship at Bound for Glory to teach Joe respect. Mick Foley was announced as the Special Ringside Enforcer for the Jarrett versus Angle bout on the October2 Impact! episode.
