500|$|Collecting and {{identifying}} the overprints {{can be an}} arduous task as there are numerous variations in the overprint settings. Feldman states [...] "the complex details of plating, shading, <b>overprint</b> <b>colours,</b> accurate measurements, to mention a few, often discourage even the most enthusiastic collector". Three specialised books, or catalogue chapters, (Freeman & Stubbs, Munk and Meredith), issued within five years of issue have concentrated on this topic and Meredith is regarded as unequalled.|$|R
50|$|For colour printing, {{multiple}} blocks are used, {{each for}} one <b>colour,</b> although <b>overprinting</b> two <b>colours</b> may produce further colours on the print. Multiple colours can be printed by keying {{the paper to}} a frame around the woodblocks.|$|R

50|$|Wallpaper {{was often}} made in {{elaborate}} floral patterns with primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) in the backgrounds and <b>overprinted</b> with <b>colours</b> of cream and tan. This {{was followed by}} Gothic art inspired papers in earth tones with stylized leaf and floral patterns. William Morris {{was one of the}} most influential designers of wallpaper and fabrics during the latter half of the Victorian period. Morris was inspired and used Medieval and Gothic tapestries in his work. Embossed paper were used on ceilings and friezes.|$|R
50|$|Chromolithography is a {{chemical}} process. The process {{is based on}} the rejection of grease by water. The image is applied to stone, grained zinc or aluminium surfaces, with a grease-based crayon or ink. Limestone and zinc are two commonly used materials in the production of chromolithographs, as aluminium unfortunately corrodes easily. After the image is drawn onto one of these surfaces, the image is gummed-up with a gum arabic solution and weak nitric acid to desensitize the surface. Before printing, the image is proved before finally inking up the image with oil based transfer or printing ink. The inked image under pressure is transposed onto a sheet of paper using a flat-bed press. This describes the direct form of printing. The offset indirect method uses a rubber-covered cylinder that transfers the image from printing surface to the paper. <b>Colours</b> may be <b>overprinted</b> by using additional stones or plates to achieve a closer reproduction of the original. Accurate registration for multi-coloured work is achieved by the use of a key outline image and registration bars which are applied to each stone or plate before drawing the solid or tone image. Ben-Day medium, uses a raised gelatin stipple image to give tone gradation. An air-brush sprays ink to give soft edges. These are just two methods used to achieve gradations of tone. The use of twelve <b>overprinted</b> <b>colours</b> would not be considered unusual. Each sheet of paper will therefore pass through the printing press as many times as there are colours in the final print. In order that each colour is placed in the right position, each stone or plate must be precisely ‘registered,’ or lined up, on the paper using a system of register marks.|$|R

40|$|Methods of {{computer}} mapping of distribution, habitat and frequency data of vascular plants in Warwickshire are described. A simplified mapping scheme for bryophytes is also outlined. The primary data for vascular plants are transferred {{in the form}} of coded information to punched tape by means of a teleprinter and checked for errors. The data are then processed in the Birmingham University KDF 9 computer by means of three separate programs, each taking the data forward to the next stage by means of magnetic tape. Intermediate print-outs give a preliminary statistical treatment of the data, as well as a simple sketch map, which can be printed on the teleprinter or line printer. The end product of the final program is a tape designed to give the necessary instructions to an incremental graph plotter. This draws symbols in the correct positions indicative of the habitat or habitats in which the species has been recorded. Two grades of frequency are shown by means of different line thicknesses. The plotted map will be reproduced with an <b>overprinting</b> in another <b>colour,</b> indicating the county boundary and various other features, as well as grid lines and border. A series of bryophyte maps without habitat and frequency information but with data on fruiting will be printed on the teleprinter. The wider applications of these mapping techniques are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Modular System {{draws on}} {{traditional}} wood engraving, woodcut and letterpress practices. It comprises two printing surfaces and printing furniture specifically devised to facilitate offset and transfer relief printing. Rigid acetal resin tint blocks, hand or laser engraved, generate tone or colour {{that may be}} applied {{to more than one}} image. Multiple <b>overprinting</b> produces variant <b>colour</b> mixtures. Their function is similar to late nineteenth-century tints devised for colour letterpress printing. Compound printing surfaces of linoleum or vinyl are segmented and joined to make removable and replaceable parts. They print variable configurations in a process that resembles historical solutions to simultaneous colour printing: from the Mentz Psalter (1475), to the compound plates of William Congreve (1820) and the segmented wood engravings of John Holt Ibbetson (1819). These compound surfaces also act as receptors for impressions from the tint blocks. Repositioning and offsetting them is expedited by press furniture especially devised for the project. Registration devices are based on the simple Japanese kent? system and laser-cut circular chases derived from traditional letterpress furniture. Printing the tint blocks directly onto the flexible compound surfaces produce two viable prints that are offsets of each other. They are reversed, but one offset is also tonally inversed. It is this unpredictable tonality that has driven this experimental project. Both the construction and processes developed using the Modular System directed historical research into functional colour relief printing which consequently unearthed examples that would influence the further development of the project. This has generated both devices and processes capable of wider applications. Printing surfaces employed in the Modular System may be laser engraved or cut and adapted to use in both lithography and intaglio printmaking...|$|R
40|$|In packaging, spot colours {{are used}} to print key {{information}} like brand logos and elements for which the colour accuracy is critical. The present study investigates methods to aid the accurate reproduction of these spot colours with the n-colour printing process. Typical n-colour printing systems consist of supplementary inks {{in addition to the}} usual CMYK inks. Adding these inks to the traditional CMYK set increases the attainable colour gamut, but the added complexity creates several challenges in generating suitable colour separations for rendering colour images. In this project, the n-colour separation is achieved by the use of additional sectors for intermediate inks. Each sector contains four inks with the achromatic ink (black) common to all sectors. This allows the extension of the principles of the CMYK printing process to these additional sectors. The methods developed in this study can be generalised to any number of inks. The project explores various aspects of the n-colour printing process including the forward characterisation methods, gamut prediction of the n-colour process and the inverse characterisation to calculate the n-colour separation for target spot colours. The scope of the study covers different printing technologies including lithographic offset, flexographic, thermal sublimation and inkjet printing. A new method is proposed to characterise the printing devices. This method, the spot <b>colour</b> <b>overprint</b> (SCOP) model, was evaluated for the n-colour printing process with different printing technologies. In addition, a set of real-world spot colours were converted to n-colour separations and printed with the 7 -colour printing process to evaluate against the original spot colours. The results show that the proposed methods can be effectively used to replace the spot coloured inks with the n-colour printing process. This can save significant material, time and costs in the packaging industry...|$|R
