5|$|A {{feature of}} central York is the Snickelways, narrow {{pedestrian}} routes, {{many of which}} led towards the former market-places in Pavement and St Sampson's Square.

The street also contains the Shrine <b>of</b> <b>Margaret</b> Clitherow, {{although it is not}} located in the house where she lived.
