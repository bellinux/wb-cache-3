The experimental result is as follows： (1) The required valve-opening-timing can be chosen by fixing an appropriate position of cam working, through some delay of the working of <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> accompanies，but by calculating beforehand some possible definite flank angle provided by the number of revolution and the load．(2) The <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> is simple in construction and its trouble is scarce，so it can be freely and easi 1 y manufactured．(3) Some suitable Bosch-type fuel jet pump can be substituted for a working pump． (4) The valve-opening-timing can be freely chosen by devising so that the pump can be revolved on the pump shaft. The system above can be available for large size engines as well as for high speed engines．(5) For measurement of the scavenging efficiency value，it is necessary to extract at least over 20 % of the effective cylinder volume...|$|E
40|$|Diversification {{of energy}} sources {{is a key}} task for {{decreasing}} environmental impacts and global emission of gases. JP- 8, a fuel derived from natural gas, coal, biomass, and waste plastics, is a bright prospect. JP- 8 is considered a multi-source multi-purpose fuel, with several applications. A preliminary characterization of the JP- 8 injection rate and injection quantity behavior was investigated based on the high-pressure {{common rail injection system}} used in a heavy-duty engine. According to the spill injection and injection pressure, a trade-off trend between injection rate and injection quantity was observed. As expected, pilot injection of JP- 8 aviation fuel and diesel fuel affects the spray quantity and injection evolution of the subsequent operation without pilot injection. The difference in spilling between diesel and JP- 8 aviation fuel is greater than the difference in injection amount per time; in the process of controlling the injector solenoid through ECU (Electric Control Units), the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> and the needle valve operate to a higher extent {{in order to maintain the}} diesel fuel’s injection quantity volume. It was found that the total injection quantity was decreased by adding 20 % pilot injection duration.

40|$|Case StudyA dry screw {{compressor}} skid was fabricated for offshore service that included oil buffered mechanical seals on the compressor. During shop testing, excessive seal oil piping vibration was observed {{that resulted in}} pipe component failures. The oil system was designed to include a common lube and seal oil system with a pump design pressure of 590 psi. There were six oil control valves on the system, including a lube <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> control <b>valve,</b> one flow control valve on the inlet end of the compressor, another flow control valve on the discharge end, two differential pressure controllers to maintain differential pressure on the seals for {{each end of the}} compressor, as well as a back <b>pressure</b> control <b>valve</b> for the oil system. Vibration and pressure pulsation measurements indicated that the response was at the pocket pass frequency of 206 Hz. The source was determined to be at the compressor. Arrangement of the control valves and control sensing lines were likely contributors to the severity of the response. Modification to the seal oil system included addition of several volumes at strategic locations to change the acoustical characteristics of the oil system to reduce the shaking forces in the pipe system. These changes along with pipe support modifications and changes to the control valve sensing lines were successful at reducing the pipe pulsations and vibration response to acceptable levels...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{conception}} {{and the model}} of hydraulic single-acting valve drive for internal combustion engines. This drive should give free control for valve lift, valve opening and valve closing time. It consists of parts: electric control valve and hydraulic actuator, whose piston is connected with engine valve and return spring. One of the basic components of high pressure HEUI injector for the Diesel engine – electric valve with solenoid was chosen as electric control valve. Principle of operation, physical and mathematical model of this drive is to be presented in this paper. Presented model consists of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic subsystems: slide of control valve with solenoid coil, power piston of hydraulic actuator with return spring and hydraulic components. Describe the dynamic behaviour of the solenoid was based on non-linear magnetic circuit model. Movement of valve slide and power piston of actuator {{was based on the}} motion equation.

The closing process of valve plate is delayed when the hold time of actuator is larger enough.

50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> 1) no <b>oil</b> or low {{oil in the}} engine 2) worn or {{defective}} oil pump or broken <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) oil gallery fracture or blockage. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> can cause engine damage. First thing to fail will be cam carrier bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip.

5000|$|The {{pressure}} is actually {{created by the}} resistance to {{the flow of the}} oil around the engine. [...] So, the <b>pressure</b> of the <b>oil</b> may vary during operation, with temperature, engine speed, and wear on the engine. Colder oil temperature can cause higher <b>pressure,</b> as the <b>oil</b> is thicker, while higher engine speeds cause the pump to run faster and push more oil through the engine. Because of variances in temperature and normal higher engine speed upon cold engine start up, it’s normal to see higher <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> upon engine start up than at normal operating temperatures, where normal <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> usually falls between 30 and 45 psi. [...] Too much <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> can create unnecessary work for the engine and even add air into the system. To ensure that the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> does not exceed the rated maximum, once pressure exceeds a preset limit a spring-loaded <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> dumps excess <b>pressure</b> either to the suction side of the pump, or directly back to the oil pan or tank.|$|R

40|$|Background: Sophisticated shunt valves {{provide the}} {{possibility}} of pressure adjustment and antisiphon control but {{have a higher probability}} of valve dysfunction especially in a posthemorrhagic setting. The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with shunt dependent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus after aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to identify patients who would benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> Methods: From 2000 to 2013, 547 patients with aneurysmatic SAH were treated at our institution, 114 underwent ventricular shunt placement (21. 1 %). 47 patients with available pre- and post-operative computed tomography scans, and an available follow-up of minimum 6 months were included. In order to measure the survival time which a nonprogrammable differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> would have had in an individual patient we defined the initial equalized shunt survival time (IESS). IESS is the time until surgical revisions of fixed differential <b>pressure</b> or flow-regulated <b>valves</b> for the treatment of over- or under-drainage as well as re-programming of adjustable valves due to over- or under-drainage. Results: Twenty patients were treated with fixed differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves,</b> 15 patients were treated with flow-regulated valves, and 12 underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement with differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves</b> assisted by a gravitational unit. Patients who reacted with remarkable changes of the ventricular width after the insertion of external ventricular drainage (EVD), before shunt placement, showed a significantly longer IESS. Conclusions: Decline of the ventricular width after EVD placement was a predictor for successful VP shunt therapy in the later course of disease. Possibly, this could allow identifying patients who benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> or a flow-regulated valve, and thus could possibly avoid valve-associated complications of a programmable valve in the later course of disease...|$|R
