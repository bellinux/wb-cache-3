40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discusses}} {{our vision}} {{and experience of}} developing <b>Open</b> <b>Innovations</b> framework program, how it was implemented and why. The <b>Open</b> <b>Innovations</b> paradigm is a new trend for performing research and development that was proposed {{only a few years}} ago in 2003. The main emphasis of this approach is on setting cooperation in form of direct industry-to-academia joint R&D project and de-velopment of the corresponding competence incubators around the most relevant technologies. As an example this paper presents the <b>open</b> <b>innovations</b> framework program FRUCT that is targeted in development of telecommunica-tions R&D ecosystem in Russia and Baltic region. The need for such cooperation is already recognized by the local in-dustry, academic community and government authorities. In particular, Nokia and Nokia Siemens Networks expressed readiness and interest to invest into this project by contri-buting competences and providing some financial support...|$|R
