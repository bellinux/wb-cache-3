40|$|Abstract. Microstrip ring {{resonator}} (MRR) sensor was modeled by simple equivalent lumped element circuits in free space based on simulation {{data obtained from}} Microwave <b>Office</b> (AWR) <b>simulator</b> and comparison was made with the measurements using the E 5071 C Network Analyzer. The calculated reflection coefficient, |Γ | and complex input impedance Zin using lumped element model were compared with the measurements results. Both results showed well agreement with a little discrepancy, basically due to imperfect soldering. The MRR was designed to have operating frequencies between 0. 5 GHz and 4. 5 GHz. The maximum surrounding of magnetic field, Hϕ is within 15 A/m in free space...|$|R
40|$|A compact {{dual-mode}} microstrip {{bandpass filter}} using geometrical slot {{is presented in}} this paper. The adopted geometrical slot is based on first iteration of Cantor square fractal curve. This filter has the benefits of possessing narrower and sharper frequency responses as compared to microstrip filters that use single mode resonators and traditional dual-mode square patch resonators. The filter has been modeled and demonstrated by Microwave <b>Office</b> EM <b>simulator</b> designed at a resonant frequency of 2 GHz using a substrate of εr = 10. 8 and thickness of h = 1. 27 mm. The output simulated results of the proposed filter exhibit 22 dB return loss, 0. 1678 dB insertion loss and 12 MHz bandwidth in the passband region. In addition to the narrow band gained, miniaturization properties as well as weakened spurious frequency responses and blocked second harmonic frequency in out of band regions have been acquired. Filter parameters including insertion loss, return loss, bandwidth, coupling coefficient and external quality factor have been compared with different values of perturbation dimension (d). Also, a full comparative study of this filter as compared with traditional square patch filter has been considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the biological parameters in a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) model in the calculation of the air-sea CO 2 flux, primary production and detrital export is analysed. The NPZD model is the Hadley Centre Ocean Carbon Cycle model (HadOCC) from the UK Met Office, used in the Hadley Centre Coupled Model 3 (HadCM 3) and FAst Met <b>Office</b> and Universities <b>Simulator</b> (FAMOUS) GCMs. Here, HadOCC is coupled to the 1 -D General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) and forced with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting meteorology to undertake a sensitivity analysis of its twenty biological parameters. Analyses are performed at three sites in the EuroSITES European Ocean Observatory Network: the Central Irminger Sea (60 ° N 40 ° W), the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (49 ° N 16 ° W) and the European Station for Time series in the Ocean Canary Islands (29 ° N 15 ° W) to assess variability in parameter sensitivities at different locations in the North Atlantic Ocean. Reasonable changes {{to the values of}} key parameters are shown to have a large effect on the calculation of the air-sea CO 2 flux, primary production, and export of biological detritus to the deep ocean. Changes in the values of key parameters have a greater effect in more productive regions than in less productive areas. We perform the analysis using one-at-a-time perturbations and using a statistical emulator, and compare results. The most sensitive parameters are generic to many NPZD ocean ecosystem models. The air-sea CO 2 flux is most influenced by variation in the parameters that control phytoplankton growth, detrital sinking and carbonate production by phytoplankton (the rain ratio). Primary production is most sensitive to the parameters that define the shape of the photosythesis-irradiance curve. Export production is most sensitive to the parameters that control the rate of detrital sinking and the remineralisation of detritus...|$|R
40|$|Wireless sensors require radio {{frequency}} (RF) circuits {{to operate at}} {{close proximity to the}} human body. For successful design of body worn applications of electronics the study of the effect of human body on RF interconnects and simple RF circuits has been undertaken through measurements and simulations in the frequency band of 50 MHz to 9 GHz. Coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines are adopted to commence the investigation. The fact that in CPW structures the ground resides in the same plane as the signal trace enables the fabrication of thin structures apt for constructing. The test structures have been fabricated using inkjet technology which being an additive and low temperature process enables the printing of transmission lines and circuit structures at which in turn enables the fabrication of test structures on thin flexible Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate. In order to discern the effect of muscle on the RF interconnections, distributed parameters, effective relative permittivity, effective loss tangent, attenuation constant and characteristic impedance are extracted using a multiline extraction process. The extraction method was also used to successfully separate the dielectric and conductor losses. The simulations have been performed using the AWR Microwave <b>Office</b> commercial RF <b>simulator.</b> The validity of the simulations and measurements has been assessed with the agreement of the simulations with measurements. It is deduced from simulations and measurements that above 1 mm distance the losses become equal to that of free space and at 0. 5 mm gap losses are close to free space as well. However, when the distance is less than 0. 5 mm the losses are significant. In order to mitigate the effect of body on RF interconnects narrow gap width and center line width should be used above 4 GHz. Bending the RF interconnects did not produce any significant change in the scattering parameters of the coplanar wave guide transmission lines, illustrating that bends do not detune the circuit performance considerably. The effect of body on the RF circuits is analyzed using simple RF circuits of different sizes. Multiline Thru-Reflect-Line calibration has been used to extract scattering parameters of the discrete components used in the circuits. The on body simulations with AWR library components and extracted discrete component values reveal that as the length of the circuit is increased the measured components provided better convergence with measured results. The experiments performed illustrate that body has significant effect on the RF interconnects and RF circuits and the effects needs to be taken in account for proper performance of the RF circuits. The findings from the investigations are used to attain guidelines for body worn electronics design...|$|R
