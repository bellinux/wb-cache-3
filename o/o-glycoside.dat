5000|$|In formal terms, a {{glycoside}} is any molecule {{in which}} a sugar group is bonded through its anomeric carbon to another group via a glycosidic bond. Glycosides can be linked by an O- (an <b>O-glycoside),</b> N- (a glycosylamine), S-(a thioglycoside), or C- (a C-glycoside) glycosidic bond. According to the IUPAC, the name [...] "C-glycoside" [...] is a misnomer; the preferred term is [...] "C-glycosyl compound". [...] The given definition is the one used by IUPAC, which recommends the Haworth projection to correctly assign stereochemical configurations. Many authors require in addition that the sugar be bonded to a non-sugar for the molecule to qualify as a glycoside, thus excluding polysaccharides. The sugar group is then known as the glycone and the non-sugar group as the aglycone or genin part of the glycoside. The glycone can consist of a single sugar group (monosaccharide) or several sugar groups (oligosaccharide).|$|E

Since only HA-aglycones are genotoxic, we investigated whether bacterial or mammalian cells are capable of cleaving <b>O-glycosides</b> as well as C-glycosides to liberate the respective genotoxic aglycones. After incubation of <b>O-glycosides</b> (sennoside A and B, frangulin A, ruberythric acid and lucidinprimveroside) with rat liver S 9 preparation, rat hepatocytes or rat coecal bacteria, the corresponding aglycones were liberated. Similarly incubated glycosides with a genotoxic aglycone (franguline A/ emodin and lucidinprimverosid/ lucidin) were mutagenic in the Salmonella/microsome assay and induced UDS in primary rat hepatocytes. With the C-glycosides (aloin and carminic acid) no enzymic liberation of the aglycones was demonstrated and the compounds did not exhibit genotoxic activity. In agreement, an aloe-extract containing the C-glykoside aloin but not the genotoxic aglycon, aloe-emodin, was inactive in these assays, whereas an extract of Cortex frangulae containing the <b>O-glycosides,</b> frangulin A and B, was active.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: The aim of our {{investigation}} was to estimate the stability of α-tocopheryl <b>O-glycosides</b> in relation to activity of exoglycosidases in selected rat tissues. Material and Methods: Acetylated glycosides were obtained in glucosidation of α-tocopherol using the Helferich method. The activity of exoglycosidases {{was determined by the}} Zwierz et al. method. Protein concentrations were determined by the biuret method. The concentration of released α-tocopherol was determined with the HPLC method. Results: The comparison of the amount of released α-tocopherol with the amount of released p-nitrophenol shows that glycoside bound in 2 a– 5 a derivatives of α-tocopherol undergoes hydrolysis significantly harder than in appropriate 2 b– 5 b p-nitrophenyl derivatives.

Thioglycosides are less investigated in contrast to <b>O-glycosides.</b> It is known that O-glycosidase is able to split <b>O-glycosides,</b> including of O-arylglycosides, in biological systems. Enzymes capable of cleaving the thioglycosidic bond are less common in nature and occur mainly in plants [9, 10]. While O-glycosidases are ubiquitous, plant myrosinase is the only known S-glycosidase [11]. Thioglycosides possess significantly lower susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis than the corresponding oxygen glycosides [12]. Also, thioglycosides have gained widespread use in carbohydrate chemistry as inhibitors of O-glycosidase and O-glycosyltransferase inhibitors [13]. Nevertheless, unlike intensively investigated <b>O-glycosides</b> of MDP, S-glycosides have received relatively little attention. Currently, only three S-alkyl glycosides of MDP, namely, methyl and butyl β-glycosides and hexadecyl S-glycoside, have been obtained [8], although 1 -thiomuramyl dipeptide itself was found to possess the adjuvant effect close to the action of muramyl dipeptide [8].

40|$|The precursors, [35 S]sulfate and [2 - 3 H]mannose, {{were used}} to study the {{biosynthesis}} of keratan sulfate and other oligosaccharides on proteoglycans isolated from Day 8 cultures of chick limb bud chondrocytes. After alkaline borohydride treatment, three fractions with sialic acid were separated by molecular sieve chromatography. The first contained keratan sulfate which was purified by digestion with chondroitinase to remove chondroitin sulfate, followed by molecular sieve and ion exchange chromatography. The purified keratan sulfate contained about 8 % of the 35 S activity originally in monomer. The chains had an average length of about 40 monosaccharides and contained only trace amounts of mannose (less than 1 residue/three to four chains). The second fraction contained {{the majority of the}} [3 H]mannose originally in monomer, but no 35 S activity. This fraction appears to contain oligosaccharide-peptides of the asparagine-N-glycosylamine type because there were no reduced sugars present and the alkaline borohydride treatment extensively degraded the core protein. The composition of the oligosaccharides, with high proportions of mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and sialic acid, was consistent with this suggestion. The third fraction consisted of a series of oligosaccharides with sizes between three to six saccharides. They contained N-acetylgalactosaminitol, indicating that they were attached to the core protein by <b>O-glycoside</b> bonds between N-acetylgalactosamine and hydroxyl groups on serine and threonine.

The best characterized compounds are sennoside, a dianthrone <b>O-glycoside</b> present in senna leaves and senna pods, and its aglycone (rhein anthrone). After oral administration, sennoside is degraded only in the lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract, releasing its active metabolite rhein anthrone. Nowadays, this process is understood at the molecular level. A study with 14 C-labelled rhein anthrone administered intracecally to rats, revealed that the compound is scarcely absorbed.

40|$|The {{variation}} in the genus Adenocarpus DC. (Leguminosae) was sampled {{as far as possible}} from its complete distribution range, the Mediterranean and tropical African regions. Characters for taxonomy were obtained from morphology and phytochemistry; a DNA analysis was also undertaken. A detailed study of morphological characters was undertaken and analyzed by one-way ANOVA, discriminant analysis and Cross Tabulation with Chi square. A flavonoid and isoflavonoid survey to provide new taxonomic characters was made using high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry. For ten of these variants, 2 - 8 samples were examined to investigate flavonoid variation. Nineteen flavonoids belonging to five classes (flavone C- and <b>O-glycosides,</b> flavonol glycosides, isoflavone glycosides and flavanones) were detected. The nuclear ITS and chloroplast trnL-trnF DNA were sequenced to provide the relationships among the variants of Adenocarpus. The phylogenies obtained from both individual and the combined analyses of the data sets were congruent. A good correlation was found in that each of the molecular clades could also be characterised by a combination of flavonoids. For example, the species in clade 4, which are distributed in South and South-East Europe and tropical Africa, are characterised by the presence of flavonol <b>O-glycosides</b> and 5 -hydroxyisoflavone <b>O-glycosides.</b> In contrast, flavonol <b>O-glycosides</b> were absent from all but one species of the other three clades, which have a mainly North Africa distribution, and these species produce flavone mono- C-glycosides and/or flavone 7 - 0 -glycosides instead. In addition flavone 41 -O-glycosides were only found in species of clade 1 and flavanones were mainly restricted to clade 3.

These closely related lectins share a specificity for the trimannoside methyl 3, 6 -di-O-(R-D-mannopyranosyl) -R-D-mannopyranoside, and are a useful model system for addressing the feasibility of differentiating between lectins with overlapping carbohydrate specificities. The ligands were designed to address two issues: (1) how the recognition properties of non-hydrolyzable C-glycoside analogues compare with those of the corresponding O-glycosides and (2) the effect of presentation of more than one saccharide recognition epitope on both affinity and specificity. Both lectins bind the C-glycosides with affinities comparable to those of the <b>O-glycoside</b> analogues; however, the ability of both lectins to differentiate between gluco and manno diastereomers was diminished in the C-glycoside series.

Measurement of antigen YH 206 levels, therefore, may particularly be useful in diagnosis and monitoring of stomach and pancreas carcinoma...|$|E

The banana {{passion fruit}} (Passiflora tripartita Breiter, Passifloraceae) known as "tumbo" is very {{appreciated}} in tropical and subtropical countries of South America. Methanolic extracts from peel and the fruit juice of P. tripartita growing in Chile were analyzed for antioxidant capacity {{as well as}} for flavonoid and phenolic content. A chromatographic method was developed for the rapid identification of the main phenolics in the samples by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS. The fast fingerprint analysis allowed the detection of eighteen flavonoid C-glycosides and four flavonoid <b>O-glycoside</b> derivatives which were characterized by UV spectra and ESI-MS-MS analysis. Several of the C-glycosides detected are structurally related to the orientin derivative 4 '-methoxy-luteolin- 8 -C-(6 '' acetyl) -beta-D-glucopyranoside (31), fully elucidated by spectroscopic methods. The antioxidant derivative 31 along with schaftoside, vicenin II, orientin and vitexin were isolated from the fruit extract by high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC). A suitable method for the preparative isolation of flavonol C-glycosides from "tumbo" extracts by HSCCC is reported. The pulp of the fruits showed good antioxidant capacity (12. 89 +/- 0. 02 mu g/mL in the DPPH assay). The peel presented the highest content of flavonoids (56. 03 +/- 4. 34 mg quercetin/ 100 g dry weight) which is related to the highest antioxidant power (10. 41 +/- 0. 01 mu g/mL in the DPPH assay) ...|$|E
40|$|The lack of pharmacopoeial methodologies for {{the quality}} control of plants used for {{therapeutic}} purposes is a huge problem that impacts directly upon public health. In the case of saponins, their great structural complexity, weak glycoside bonds and high polarity hinder their identification by conventional techniques. To apply high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI/MS(n)) to identify the <b>O-glycoside</b> sequence of saponins from the roots of Phytolacca bogotensis. Saponins were isolated by preparative HPLC and characterised by NMR spectroscopic experiments. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of isolated saponins was performed producing typical degradation reactions that {{can be associated with}} several glycosidic bonds as empirical criteria. A method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and HPLC/ESI-MS(n) for the characterisation of saponins and identification of novel molecules is described. Three saponins reported {{for the first time in}} P. bogotensis were isolated and characterised by NMR spectroscopy. Characteristic cross ring cleavage reactions have been used as empirical criteria for the characterisation of the glycosidic bonds most frequently reported for Phytolacca saponins. One new saponin was proposed on the basis of empirical criteria, and other five saponins were identified for the first time for P. bogotensis using HPLC-ESI/MS(n). Electrospray ionisation in combination with tandem mass spectrometry has been established as a powerful tool for the profiling of saponins from roots of P. bogotensis. CID proved to be a useful tool for the characterisation and identification of known and novel saponins from the plant family Phytolaccaceae and can be used for quality control purposes of crude plant extracts...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of flavonoids (flavones and flavonols) in leaves of Begonia grandis Dryander subsp. grandis plants introduced in Western Siberia (Central Siberian Botanical Garden, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk) {{during the growing}} season in the greenhouse and the open ground were studied for the first time. The ranges of flavonoid fractions and individual flavonoids contents in a favorable environment and during periods of temperature drops and frost were established. Under favorable conditions in the greenhouse and in the open ground B. grandis subsp. grandis leaves were characterized by relatively low content of the sum of flavonoids (up to 10. 1 mg/g). During periods of temperature drops in the greenhouse it was decreased (down to 5. 2 mg/g), and in conditions of more considerable temperature drops and frost in open ground it was increased by several times (up to 28. 3 mg/g). During the period of the action of stress factors content of the sum of flavonoid aglycones in the leaves was increased both in the greenhouse (including quercetin, luteolin) and in the open ground (including quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin), in the open ground content of major constituent, luteolin 8 -C-glucoside (orientin), was increased. The most significant transformations {{during the growing season}} were observed in the <b>O-glycosides</b> and free aglycones fractions, their contents of compounds and composition were varied. Four <b>O-glycosides,</b> including isoquercitrin, are detected only in the leaves of open ground plants...|$|R
30|$|Present SGLT 2 inhibitors {{belong to}} a class of structurally-related {{aromatic}} C- and O-β-d-glucopyranoside analogues of the natural product phlorizin. Phlorizin, T- 1095 A, sergliflozin and remogliflozin are <b>O-glycosides.</b> Dapagliflozin is C-glycoside SGLT 2 inhibitor. The two sets of compounds exhibit excellent glucose uptake inhibitory activity in this assay (Fig.  5). Only few reports have reported the discovery of nonglycoside inhibitors, such as flavonoid antioxidants and cyclic diarylheptanoids [37, 38]. Identification of non-glycoside inhibitors could be advantageous, which will {{lay the foundation for}} chemical structure of new-type SGLT 2 inhibitor and make it pluralistic. Further application of this system in high throughput screening will help to find new SGLT 2 inhibitors for diabetes treatment.|$|R
40|$|Phytochemical {{characters}} of the plants that have been treated as Disporum luzoniense (Merrill & Merritt 1910) or Disporopsis fuscopicta (Jessop 1979) in the Philippines were {{compared with those of}} Disporum kawakamii and Disporopsis fuscopicta in Taiwan. The present phytochemical study revealed that Disporum kawakamii had luteolin, apigenin and chrysoeriol as free state, while these flavonoids were not detected in the Philippine plant and Disporopsis fuscopicta from Taiwan. Moreover, flavone <b>O-glycosides</b> were isolated from Disporum kawakamii, while flavone C-glycoside was isolated from the Philippine plant and Disporopsis fuscopicta from Taiwan. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the Philippine plant is chemotaxonomically related to Disporopsis and this agrees with the taxonomic treatment of Jessop (1979) ...|$|R
