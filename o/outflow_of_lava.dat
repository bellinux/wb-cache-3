60|$|Darwin {{again and}} again called {{attention}} to the evidence that volcanic vents exhibit relations to one another which can only be explained by assuming the existence of lines of fissure in the earth's crust, along which the lavas have {{made their way to the}} surface. But he, at the same time, clearly saw that there was no evidence of the occurrence of great deluges <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> along such fissures; he showed how the most remarkable plateaux, composed <b>of</b> successive <b>lava</b> sheets, might be built up by repeated and moderate ejections from numerous isolated vents; and he expressly insists upon the rapidity with which the cinder-cones around the orifices of ejection and the evidences <b>of</b> successive <b>outflows</b> <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> would be obliterated by denudation.|$|R

5000|$|Most large impact craters do {{not have}} a central peak, yet have sharp rims bordered by {{asymmetrical}} radar bright ejecta blankets, have multiple rims, are surrounded and partially filled by subsequent lava which creates a reduced apparent depth, have dark crater floors, and buries some ejecta. By analyzing Magellan images, Cleopatra patera’s was found to be distorted in shape in that its noncircular inner ring is off center, but also that the <b>outflow</b> channel <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> moves from within the crater and reaches the top of the crater rim. The interiors are radar dark and smooth in comparison to the surrounding plains. [...] From the image of Plate P-11 from Venera 15 and 16 shows that Cleopatra patera that was originally interpreted as a large caldera but has now been interpreted as a multi-ringed impact crater with a central peak. Using photogeologic analysis, the floor of the crater has a shallow central depression resulting from subsidence of uplifted mantle material from below due to [...] "viscous relaxation". This was found in Venusian craters larger than 70 km in diameter by using altimetry data which shows surfaces with different elevations from the Magellan mission.|$|R

40|$|Lava flows are {{not only}} a {{fascinating}} scientific problem, involving many branches of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, but are natural events having a strong social impact. A reliable evaluation of volcanic hazard connected with lava flows depends {{on the availability of}} physical models allowing us to predict the evolution of these phenomena. In this regard, the rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>lavas</b> are <b>of</b> major importance in controlling the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> flows. Lava is a multi-phase and chemically heterogeneous system. This entails a characteristic, non-Newtonian behaviour <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> flows, which is emphasized {{by the fact that the}} rheological parameters are strongly temperature dependent and are therefore affected by the progressive cooling <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> after effusion. Physical models <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> flows show us the complex relationships between the many quantities governing this process and in the near future they may allow us to predict the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> flows and to take effective measures for the reduction of volcanic risk...|$|R
50|$|Hornitos {{are formed}} in lava flows and are small {{openings}} that release small amounts <b>of</b> <b>lava.</b> Similar to spatter cones, Hornitos are rootless, meaning they {{form on the}} surface <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> flows like spatter cones. They are usually created by the slow upwelling <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> through the roof <b>of</b> a <b>lava</b> tube. High pressure causes lava to ooze and spatter out. The lava builds up {{on the surface and}} solidifies creating the initial structure. Hornitos can grow and exceed 10 meters in height.|$|R

30|$|Another {{complication}} is {{the mechanical}} deformation <b>of</b> silicic <b>lava</b> during stages <b>of</b> cooling <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> flow after re-manence acquisition; such deformation {{is independent of}} the development of the ductile texture (e.g., the flow structure). Nakada et al. (1995) observed that in many cases, the mechanical deformation <b>of</b> a silicic <b>lava</b> flow could initiate at areas proximal to the crater <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> domes, and then propagate to more distal areas; this is brought about by subsequent magma supply. This style of deformation <b>of</b> the <b>lava</b> flow may therefore cause the paleomagnetic direction <b>of</b> rhyolite <b>lava</b> to deviate from the expected one, regardless of the degree of development of the flow structure.|$|R

50|$|Lava flows {{dated to}} about 30,000-40,000 years ago formed most <b>of</b> the <b>lava</b> tube caves in the monument.

50|$|Roughly {{ninety percent}} <b>of</b> the <b>lava</b> in the Lava Beds Monument is basaltic. There are {{primarily}} two kinds <b>of</b> basaltic <b>lava</b> flows: pahoehoe and 'a'a. Pahoehoe is smooth, often ropy {{and is the}} most common type <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> in Lava Beds. Aa is formed when pahoehoe cools and loses some of its gases. Aa is rough, sharp, and jagged; an excellent example is the Devils Homestead lava flow, which originated at Fleener Chimneys. Most of the rest <b>of</b> the <b>lava</b> in the monument is andesitic. Pumice, a type <b>of</b> rhyolitic <b>lava,</b> also is found covering the monument; this rained down around 900 years ago during the eruption of Glass Mountain.|$|R
40|$|We have modeled {{the cooling}} <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> bodies on Io after {{solidification}} <b>of</b> the <b>lava,</b> {{a process that}} has been little explored since Carr (1986). With recent estimates <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> flow thicknesses on Io ranging from 1 m to 10 m, the modeling of thermal emission from active volcanism {{must take into account}} the cooling behaviour after the solidification <b>of</b> the <b>lava,</b> which we model using a finite-element model. Once a lava body is fully solidified, the surface temperature decreases faster, as heat loss is no longer buffered by release of latent heat. This is significant as observed surface temperature is often the only clue available to determine lava surface age. We also find that cooling from the base <b>of</b> the <b>lava</b> is an important process that accelerates the solidification of a flow and therefore subsequent cooling. It is necessary to constrain the cooling process in order to better understand temperature-area relationships on Io's surface and to carry out stochastic modelling <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> flow emplacement...|$|R

40|$|Surface and {{internal}} lava structures can be valid indicators <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> viscosity and rheology, provided that care {{is taken to}} identify and eliminate structures which are strain-rate-dependent. Here, a spectrum of types among Hawaiian basaltic flows is found ranging from pahoehoe to a'a, that are interpreted as marking a progression in lava viscosity and a change in rheology. The most fluid type in this spectrum is normal pahoehoe that has a smooth but commonly wrinkled or folded (ropy) surface. The next type, distinctly more viscous and probably non-Newtonian in rheology, is spiny pahoehoe which {{is characterized by a}} spinose surface and an absence of ropy structures. Preliminary studies on the long <b>lavas</b> <b>of</b> Mauna Loa indicated, perhaps surprisingly, that there is no clear-cut correlation <b>of</b> <b>lava</b> length with type in this spectrum <b>of</b> <b>lavas,</b> indicating that viscosity/yield strength <b>of</b> the basaltic <b>lavas</b> per se are not the primary controls determining flow length.
