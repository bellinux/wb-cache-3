5|$|On November 15, {{near the}} end of the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Shanghai,</b> Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting of the Military Affairs Commission's Supreme National Defense Council to {{undertake}} strategic planning, including a decision on what to do in case of a Japanese attack on Nanking. Here Chiang insisted fervently on mounting a sustained defense of Nanking. Chiang argued, just as he had during the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Shanghai,</b> that China would be more likely to receive aid from the great powers, possibly at the ongoing Nine Power Treaty Conference, if it could prove on the battlefield its will and capacity to resist the Japanese. He also noted that holding onto Nanking would strengthen China's hand in peace talks which he wanted the German ambassador Oskar Trautmann to mediate.|$|E

5|$|An eyewall {{replacement}} {{cycle and}} weakening convection {{along the northern}} side resulted in steady weakening starting on July10. Increasing wind shear prevented the system from reorganizing as it neared East China. Early on July11, the typhoon reached the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge and began turning {{to the north and}} later north-northeast. Chan-hom made landfall in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, or roughly 140km (80mi) south-southeast <b>of</b> <b>Shanghai,</b> around 08:40UTC. The JMA assessed the storm to have had winds of 140km/h (85mph) while the JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at 155km/h (100mph). Based on the JTWC estimate, Chan-hom was the strongest typhoon to pass within 160km (100mi) <b>of</b> <b>Shanghai</b> in at least 35years, and it was the strongest landfall in Zhejiang since recordkeeping began in 1949. Thereafter the storm accelerated north-northeast and moved over the cool waters of the Yellow Sea, prompting further degradation of its structure. Chan-hom weakened below typhoon-force around 18:00UTC on July11. The system's low-level center completely exposed on July12 as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Around 18:00UTC, Chan-hom moved ashore on the Ongjin peninsula in North Korea, southwest of the capital Pyongyang, with winds of 95km/h (60mph). By 00:00UTC on July13 the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while retaining gale-force winds, and six hours later the system dissipated over north-central North Korea.|$|E

It was where Ip Man first taught Wing Chun openly to the public.|$|E
5|$|Following a long {{record of}} instigating {{localised}} conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a full-scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937.

Western countries were sympathetic to the Chinese in their struggle, particularly in their stubborn defence <b>of</b> <b>Shanghai,</b> {{a city with a}} substantial number of foreigners. The League was unable to provide any practical measures; on 4 October, it turned the case over to the Nine Power Treaty Conference.|$|E

5|$|In July 1937 {{war broke}} out in {{northern}} China between China and Japan, and by August the fighting had spread to the city <b>of</b> <b>Shanghai.</b> After capturing Shanghai the Japanese Army decided on December 1 to continue its military campaign to {{the capital city of}} the Nationalist government of China, Nanking, which is roughly 300 kilometers west <b>of</b> <b>Shanghai.</b> Although the Japanese succeeded in surrounding Nanking and defeating the Chinese garrison stationed there by December 13, few of the Chinese soldiers within the city formally surrendered. Instead they threw away their uniforms and weapons and hid among the city's civilian population. Over the course of its subsequent occupation of Nanking the Japanese Army hunted down the former Chinese soldiers within the city and in a large number of cases summarily executed them. At the same time soldiers of the Japanese Army also committed random acts of murder against civilians, and engaged in rape, arson, and looting. These events are collectively known as the Nanking Massacre.|$|E

However, after victory in the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Shanghai</b> expansionists prevailed within the Japanese military and on December 1 a campaign to capture Nanking was officially authorized. The task of occupying Nanking was given to General Iwane Matsui, the commander of Japan's Central China Area Army, who believed that the capture of Nanking would force China to surrender and thus end the war. Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek ultimately decided to defend the city and appointed Tang Shengzhi to command the Nanking Garrison Force, a hastily assembled army of local conscripts and {{the remnants of the}} Chinese units who had fought in Shanghai.|$|E
