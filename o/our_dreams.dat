It is only the envy of people who couldn't stand against the propaganda machine, and they invented things about my generation, the artists of the '60s. Our generation was breaking the Iron Curtain. It was a generation crippled by history, and most of <b>our</b> <b>dreams</b> were doomed to be unfulfilled – but the fight for freedom was not in vain.|$|E
25|$|Common was {{instrumental}} in bridging the trans-Atlantic gap by signing UK's Mr Wong and J2K to Kanye West's Getting Out <b>Our</b> <b>Dreams</b> recording outfit. Common met the pair during his tour in the UK earlier on in the year. It is speculated that the deal {{is not only to}} bring the UK and US hip hop genres together but that to rival Syco Music's cross-Atlantic success with Leona Lewis. He also has a deal with Zune mp3 players. In 2008 Common made an estimated 12 million dollars, making him equal in earnings to Eminem and Akon, tied for the 13th highest grossing Hip-Hop artist.|$|E
25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, that many of <b>our</b> <b>dreams</b> didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult.

I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E

25|$|Sigmund Freud, who {{developed}} the psychological discipline of psychoanalysis, wrote extensively about dream theories and their interpretations in the early 1900s. He explained dreams as manifestations of one's deepest desires and anxieties, often relating to repressed childhood memories or obsessions. Furthermore, he believed that virtually every dream topic, regardless of its content, represented the release of sexual tension. In The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), Freud developed a psychological technique to interpret dreams and devised a series of guidelines to understand the symbols and motifs that appear in <b>our</b> <b>dreams.</b> In modern times, dreams {{have been seen as}} a connection to the unconscious mind. They range from normal and ordinary to overly surreal and bizarre. Dreams can have varying natures, such as being frightening, exciting, magical, melancholic, adventurous, or sexual. The events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer, with the exception of lucid dreaming, where the dreamer is self-aware. Dreams can at times make a creative thought occur to the person or give a sense of inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] and felt that, {{as the show}} lost viewers in the first season, the stories got better, and that [...] "Diversity Day" [...] is an {{excellent}} example of this [...] "unfortunate trend". He noted that the episode [...] "would go on {{to be one of the}} series’ defining episodes, an installment that put a more hopeful spin on the original Offices views on accepting the disparity between <b>our</b> <b>dreams</b> and our realities." [...] However, Adams noted that Carell's character was still too aggressive for Michael Scott to be completely lovable, and that the second season episode [...] "Sexual Harassment" [...] would serve as [...] "a gentler spiritual sequel" [...] to this episode, featuring a similar premise, but with a softened Michael Scott. For his work on this episode, B. J. Novak was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy.|$|E
500|$|In {{a preview}} of the record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse {{acknowledged}} the 1980s influences that resonated throughout the track and noted that [...] "hard rock guitars and percussion come crashing in on the chorus." [...] Sarah O' Hara, while reviewing Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams for Lowdown, compared the song to [...] "Kings and Queens", a track with a similar structure included on This Is War featuring sparse verses and slow atmospheric builds to the chorus. In an interview with Loudwire, Leto described [...] "City of Angels" [...] as a very personal song about a specific place. He said, [...] "It's the story of my brother and I going to Los Angeles to make <b>our</b> <b>dreams</b> come true. It's a love letter to that beautiful and bizarre land." [...] Leto later explained that the song could refer to any place a person goes to fulfill his or her own dreams. Mary Ouellette, writing for Loudwire, felt that the song [...] "tells a passionate tale of finding comfort in calling the city of Los Angeles home." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} {{director}} role, Miyazaki deploys numerous examples of his style to great effect. Dani Cavallaro highlights the signature details of Miyazaki's style and form being displayed {{in this work}} and how it impacts the portrayal of the story. Cagliostro, the country and setting, is depicted in meticulous detail and unconstrained by limitations of architecture, geography and culture, which {{can be described as}} [...] "akogare no Paris" [...] (Paris of <b>our</b> <b>dreams),</b> which is a fantastical view of Europe through Eastern eyes. The use of unexpected and unique camera angles and attention to individual movement of the characters are distinctive signatures of Miyazaki's style, including the opening heist scene which provides characterization and spirit to understanding the character of Lupin. The changes made to the portrayal of the cast, depicting a heroic and selfless Lupin, a friendly Jigen, funny Goemon, and un-sexualized Fujiko, were initially not well received by fans. Otaku USA's Surat described compared this shift to [...] "a James Bond movie where [...] stayed at Motel 6 and his [...] "Bond mobile" [...] was a Toyota Camry!" ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked why}} New Line was {{rebooting}} the Nightmare on Elm Street film series, Emmerich explained, [...] "The Nightmare films are profoundly disturbing on a deep, human level because they're about <b>our</b> <b>dreams.</b> It's why {{we thought that}} we could reach an especially broad audience with a new film, since the feeling of having your dreams being invaded was something that would translate to any country and any culture." [...] Overall, Bayer {{wanted to create a}} darker Nightmare on Elm Street, one he felt would fit into what he describes as [...] "a darker world". Bayer said there is subtext within the film, which is designed to get the audience to ask, [...] "What makes a monster?" [...] Bayer wants the audience to think about whether a monster is something that exists purely from a physical appearance—someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove on their hand—or can a monster be something that is deeper, and within the man himself without a scarred face and bladed glove? ...|$|E

[...] The person retains the illusion of having a body, but that perception is no longer derived from the senses. The perceived world may resemble the world he or she generally inhabits while awake, but this perception {{does not come from}} the senses either. The vivid body and world is made by our brain's ability to create fully convincing realms, {{even in the absence of}} sensory information.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of each episode, Laverne and Shirley are {{skipping}} down a Milwaukee street, arm in arm, reciting a Yiddish-American hopscotch chant: [...] "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Schlemiel!

The hopscotch chant is from Penny Marshall's childhood. [...] In seasons six and seven (set in 1960s Southern California), the intro features Laverne and Shirley exiting their apartment building, but still reciting their original chant, and then a re-recorded version of the theme song is played.
