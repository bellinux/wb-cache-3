5|$|Development <b>on</b> <b>Snow</b> White and the Seven Dwarfs {{began in}} early 1934, and in June 1934, Walt Disney {{announced}} {{the production of}} his first feature, to be released under Walt Disney Productions, to The New York Times. One evening that same year, Disney acted out the entire story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to his staff, announcing that the film would be produced as a feature-length film.|$|E
5|$|In 2013's free-to-play mobile game Snow White: Queen's Return (also {{known as}} Seven Dwarfs: The Queen's Return), an uncanonical {{continuation}} of the film, the Queen has survived the fall at {{the climax of the}} film and then reverted to her youthful form to cast a curse <b>on</b> <b>Snow</b> White and the dwarfs and their entire forest.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking <b>on</b> <b>snow</b> and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking <b>on</b> <b>snow</b> by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E

5|$|Production <b>on</b> <b>Snow</b> Shark {{began in}} early 2011. The film uses {{practical}} effects rather than computer-generated imagery, and its budget was partially financed by a {{campaign on the}} crowdfunding website Indiegogo. The film, which was shot in Buffalo, New York, premiered at Dipson's Amherst Theatre on April 10, 2012, and received mixed reviews. The film was released on DVD by Independent Entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Snow affects human {{activity}} in four major areas, transportation, agriculture, structures, and sports. Most transportation modes are impeded by {{snow on the}} travel surface. Agriculture often relies <b>on</b> <b>snow</b> {{as a source of}} seasonal moisture. Structures may fail under snow loads. Humans find a wide variety of recreational activities in snowy landscapes.|$|E
5|$|Snow is an {{important}} consideration for loads on structures. To address these, European countries employ Eurocode 1: Actions on structures - Part 1-3: General actions - Snow loads. In North America, ASCE Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures gives guidance <b>on</b> <b>snow</b> loads. Both standards employ method that translate maximum expected ground snow loads onto design loads for roofs.|$|E
50|$|The second {{match was}} a {{standard}} wrestling match between Al Snow and Tazz. Snow dominated earlier {{part of the}} match by hitting several moves on Tazz before going for Head. Tazz {{took advantage of the}} situation and attacked <b>on</b> <b>Snow's</b> left knee and injured it. Tazz focused <b>on</b> <b>Snow's</b> injured leg and continued to attack it throughout the match. Tazz proceeded by suplexing Snow, and tried to apply a Half Nelson Choke, which he called Tazzmission, but Snow countered it. However, Tazz applied Tazzmission again and hurt Snow, forcing him to tap out.|$|R

5|$|After the {{completion}} of Zetsubō, Studio Mebius (a brand under VisualArt's) started production <b>on</b> <b>Snow.</b> The artists for the visual novel were Asuka Pyon, who also drew the character designs, and Kobuichi. The scenario was written by three members of staff: Mochizuki Jet, Klein, and Jinno Masaki. I've Sound, as well as T Music Factory, Famishin, and Fam contributed to the music composition. According to the liner notes on the original soundtrack of Snow, the producers acknowledged that the game's structure resembled Key's visual novels Kanon and Air. Yūichi Suzumoto, {{who is known for}} his work on Air, Clannad, and , provided scenario assistance for Snow.|$|E
5|$|MD 12 heads {{north from}} the Virginia border <b>on</b> <b>Snow</b> Hill Road, {{which is a}} two-lane {{undivided}} road. The road continues south into Virginia as SR 679 (Fleming Road). From the border, the route passes through a mix of woodland and farmland with a few residences in southern Worcester County before reaching Stockton. Here, MD 12 passes by homes and crosses MD 366 (George Island Landing Road). Upon leaving Stockton, the roads heads back into rural areas and passes near the E.A. Vaughn Wildlife Management Area before reaching the residential community of Girdletree. Past Girdletree, the road continues {{to the east of}} a tract of the Pocomoke State Forest as it approaches Snow Hill, the county seat of Worcester County. Just south of Snow Hill, the route intersects US 113 (Worcester Highway).|$|E

5|$|Scientists study snow at a {{wide variety}} of scales that include the physics of {{chemical}} bonds and clouds; the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks; and the contribution of snowmelt to river hydraulics and ground hydrology. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by engineers, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by agronomists, who address the availability of snowmelt to agriculture, and those, who design equipment for sporting activities <b>on</b> <b>snow.</b> Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub-specialty is avalanches, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} polyphenism in {{willow grouse}} differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, grouse have two plumages (breeding and non-breeding), while in Scandinavia {{there is a}} third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic basis for this is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state: they tend to sit <b>on</b> <b>snow</b> while they are mainly white, but choose the border between bare ground and snow when they have more dark feathers. They seem to be choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality.|$|E
5|$|Its {{population}} in Canada is limited due to both snow depth {{and the presence}} of the Canadian lynx. The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian lynx and cannot support its weight <b>on</b> <b>snow</b> as efficiently. The bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian lynx's range to the advantage of the bobcat. In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1990s, it is {{very rare}} to see anyone using a trzepak for its prime function. In the newest housing developments, trzepak are rarely installed. Some people {{preferred}} to beat carpets in winter <b>on</b> the <b>snow</b> - they laid the carpet face down and beat it. This method had some advantages - for instance, insects would freeze to death {{even if they were}} not expelled through beating - but it left a dirty and unpleasant-looking patch <b>on</b> the <b>snow,</b> and therefore some communities forbade beating <b>on</b> the <b>snow</b> for aesthetic reasons.|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood {{was nothing but a}} heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush <b>on</b> <b>Snow</b> White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Hawks {{returned}} to the screwball comedy genre with His Girl Friday, starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. The film was an adaptation of the hit Broadway play The Front Page by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, which had already been made into a film in 1931 and had also been reworked by the same screenwriters and transplanted to Rudyard Kipling's India for Gunga Din in 1939. In 1941, Hawks made Sergeant York, starring Gary Cooper as a pacifist farmer who becomes a decorated World War I soldier. This was the highest-grossing film of 1941 and won two Academy Awards (Best Actor and Best Editing), as well as earning Hawks his only nomination for Best Director. Later that year, Hawks worked with Cooper again for Ball of Fire, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck. The film was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and is a playful take <b>on</b> <b>Snow</b> White and the Seven Dwarfs. Cooper plays a sheltered, intellectual linguist who is writing an encyclopedia with six other scientists, and hires street-wise Stanwyck {{to help them with}} modern slang terms. In 1941, Hawks began work on the Howard Hughes-produced (and later directed) film The Outlaw, based on the life of Billy the Kid and starring Jane Russell. Hawks completed initial shooting of the film in early 1941, but due to perfectionism and battles with the Hollywood Production Code, Hughes continued to re-shoot and re-edit the film until 1943, when it was finally released with Hawks uncredited as director.|$|E
