5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (<b>often</b> <b>about</b> 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|Eva Anna Paula Hitler (née Braun; 6 February 1912– 30 April 1945) was the {{longtime}} companion of Adolf Hitler and, for fewer than 40 hours, his wife. Braun met Hitler in Munich {{when she was}} a 17-year-old assistant and model for his personal photographer; she began seeing him <b>often</b> <b>about</b> two years later. She attempted suicide twice during their early relationship. By 1936, she was a part of his household at the Berghof near Berchtesgaden and lived a sheltered life throughout World War II. Braun was a photographer, and many of the surviving colour photographs and films of Hitler were taken by her. She was a key figure within Hitler's inner social circle, but did not attend public events with him until mid-1944, when her sister Gretl married Hermann Fegelein, the SS liaison officer on his staff.|$|E
5|$|Faramir first {{encountered}} the hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in Ithilien and recognized {{them to be}} the Halflings mentioned in his dreams. Faramir questioned Frodo of his quest, and Frodo revealed that he, along with eight other companions including Boromir, had set out from Rivendell. During the interrogation, Faramir asked <b>often</b> <b>about</b> Boromir, since he knew, although Frodo at that point did not, that Boromir was already dead. One night, while on guard, Faramir waded down to the Anduin river after seeing a boat there. It contained the dead body of his brother, {{who had been killed}} by Orcs after Frodo left the group.|$|E

5|$|In 1858, Offenbach {{produced}} {{his first}} full-length operetta, Orphée aux enfers ("Orpheus in the Underworld"), which was exceptionally well received and has remained {{one of his}} most played works. During the 1860s, he produced at least 18 full-length operettas, as well as more one-act pieces. His works from this period included La belle Hélène (1864), La Vie parisienne (1866), La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein (1867) and La Périchole (1868). The risqué humour (<b>often</b> <b>about</b> sexual intrigue) and mostly gentle satiric barbs in these pieces, together with Offenbach's facility for melody, made them internationally known, and translated versions were successful in Vienna, London and elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
5|$|On the {{official}} SNK Playmore King of Fighters anniversary website, {{an image of}} K' drawn {{in the style of}} the other The King of Fighters XII participants appeared, along with a similar image of Mai Shiranui, leading to speculation that they would appear in the game. UTV Ignition Entertainment's business development director Shane Bettenhausen refused to answer these rumors, but noted fans asked more <b>often</b> <b>about</b> Mai's absence. None of them made it into the game which caused discontent within gamers. In an official press releases by Atlus regarding The King of Fighters XIII, it was stated that K's return was because of popular demand. His return along with his two teammates, Maxima and Kula, as well as Mai, has been met with praise by video game publications.|$|E

25|$|Although RPGs {{share some}} combat rules with wargames, RPGs are <b>often</b> <b>about</b> {{a small group}} of {{individual}} characters. Wargames tend to have large groups of identical units, as well as non-humanoid units such as tanks and airplanes. Role-playing games do not normally allow the player to produce more units. However, the Heroes of Might and Magic series crosses these genres by combining individual heroes with large amounts of troops in large battles.|$|E
25|$|Infrasound is {{characterized}} by an ability to cover long distances and get around obstacles with little dissipation. In music, acoustic waveguide methods, such as a large pipe organ or, for reproduction, exotic loudspeaker designs such as transmission line, rotary woofer, or traditional subwoofer designs can produce low-frequency sounds, including near-infrasound. Subwoofers designed to produce infrasound are capable of sound reproduction an octave or more below that of most commercially available subwoofers, and are <b>often</b> <b>about</b> 10 times the size.|$|E

Gravano finally realized that the Cosa Nostra code of honor was a sham. At this time, Gravano also hired a publicist, despite the fact Gravano complained <b>often</b> <b>about</b> the publicity-seeking Gotti. After the publication of Underboss, several families of Gravano's victims filed a $25 million lawsuit against him. Also in 1997, New York State took legal action to seize Gravano's profits from the book.|$|E

25|$|XML {{has been}} used to {{describe}} structured data and to serialize objects. Various XML-based protocols exist to represent the same kind of data structures as JSON for the same kind of data interchange purposes. Data can be encoded in XML several ways. The most expansive form using tag pairs results in a much larger representation than JSON, but if data is stored in attributes and 'short tag' form where the closing tag is replaced with '/>', the representation is <b>often</b> <b>about</b> the same size as JSON or just a little larger. If the data is compressed using an algorithm like gzip, there is little difference because compression is good at saving space when a pattern is repeated.|$|E
25|$|Shrinkage and {{swelling}} may occur in wood when the moisture content is changed (Stamm, 1964). Shrinkage occurs as moisture content decreases, while swelling takes place when it increases. Volume {{change is not}} equal in all directions. The greatest dimensional change occurs in a direction tangential to the growth rings. Shrinkage from the pith outwards, or radially, is usually considerably less than tangential shrinkage, while longitudinal (along the grain) shrinkage is so slight as to be usually neglected. The longitudinal shrinkage is 0.1% to 0.3%, in contrast to transverse shrinkages, which is 2% to 10%. Tangential shrinkage is <b>often</b> <b>about</b> twice as great as in the radial direction, although in some species it is as much as five times as great. The shrinkage is about 5% to 10% in the tangential direction and about 2% to 6% in the radial direction (Walker et al., 1993).|$|E
25|$|Families who {{had already}} had members in the Senate {{were more likely to}} have further family members elected to {{political}} office (and thus become senators). This was so much more likely that only a few consular novi homines (new men) are known to history. Advertising on coins was thus <b>often</b> <b>about</b> the moneyer's family. In the coin reverse shown on the right (Crawford 268/1b), the legend around the outside indicates that moneyer was N. Fabius Pictor. The seated individual is wearing a cuirass, holding a spear in his left hand and an apex, the characteristic hat worn by the flamines, in his right. At his side there is a shield inscribed QUIRIN. This is taken to refer to Q. Fabius Pictor (probably the son of Quintus Fabius Pictor the annalist) who was elected praetor in 189 BC and assigned the province of Sardinia by lot (Livy 37.50.8). He was also the flamen Quirinalis and because of this, P. Licinius Crassus, the pontifex maximus of the day did not allow him to take the Sardinian office because of various taboos surrounding the flamen's person, and the need for the flamen to perform certain rites in Rome (Livy 37.51.3–7). The Sardinian praetorship was exchanged for both the urban and peregrine praetorships, and N. Fabius Pictor remained in Rome. The entire incident was part of the political manoeuvring of Scipio Africanus against his attackers, which included the Fabii.|$|E

500|$|Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} breed {{early in}} the year, and the females lay their eggs around March. During the height of mating season, males gather in leks with multiple males defending a social display arena of much greater area {{than that of a}} lone male. The males each have their own area on the forest floor where they make their courts. The size of each court is about [...] in diameter, and the next bird is <b>often</b> <b>about</b> [...] away. The females and males live separately; only when it is time to mate do females fly over to observe and choose a male. When this occurs, the females tap the males from behind and insemination quickly follows. When females approach a lek, the males stand firmly and present themselves rigidly.|$|E
500|$|The {{start of}} the war in September 1939 alarmed many Americans, but the {{majority}} thought the U.S. should not get involved.

Willkie biographer Steve Neal wrote that the war [...] "transformed Willkie from a big-business critic of the New Deal into a champion of freedom. And it gave his candidacy new purpose." [...] Despite the chatter about Willkie, there were many who were skeptical about his chances should he seek the nomination. Kenneth F. Simpson, Republican National Committeeman from New York, initially thought the idea of a Willkie run to be silly. Indiana Senator James Watson stated that he did not mind if [...] "the town whore" [...] joined the church, but she should not lead the choir the first week.|$|E
