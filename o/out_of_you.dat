Ottman explained his intent for the scene, [...] "I used The Jeffersons as this innocuous thing—going between him and the television—so that when he does open his eyes, it scares the hell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>you...</b> I added this deafening Bartok pizz, which is when all the violins pluck their strings really loud and they create this gnarly, unsettling sound."

500|$|Greene's {{nickname}} remained {{popular due to}} his exploits on {{the playing}} field, where he was described as ferocious and intimidating. He instilled fear in opponents with the intensity of his play. In a 1979 game against the Houston Oilers, with only seconds remaining and Houston leading 20–17, the Oilers lined up near the Pittsburgh goal line to run their final play. With victory already assured for the Oilers, Greene pointed angrily across {{the line of scrimmage}} at Houston quarterback Dan Pastorini, warning, [...] "If you come into the end zone, I'll beat the crap <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>you!</b> I'm gonna kill you!"

500|$|Davey was {{initially}} uncomfortable with being {{described as a}} singer-songwriter but is now more accepting of the term. She describes her songwriting style: I write in short quick spurts of manic creativity, which are followed by spells of borderline writer's block where the writing comes really painfully and laboriously. I’m sure it's a universal experience for anyone who writes, but it's difficult to get <b>out</b> <b>of,</b> <b>you</b> can't just wish it away—it just disappears when it's had enough.

500|$|Armitage {{performs}} his own stunts. When performing fight scenes, {{they would}} be choreographed carefully so Armitage could take part rather than a stunt double. For series eight, Armitage performed a fight scene in a swimming pool, which he thought was [...] "fun," [...] but also thought it was difficult as it was [...] "like acting and punching in slow motion." [...] In another sequence, he injured a stuntman with a hospital trolley. He was only given a short lesson {{on how to handle}} firearms, since he was already accustomed to using them whilst working on Ultimate Force. While discussing the shootout at the end of series seven, Armitage noted that he is [...] "not a violent person but when you put a gun in somebody's hands [...] it's like a little animal comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> that wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E

Julie Miller from Movieline was critical of the episode's [...] "staged showdowns", but nonetheless noted that the series [...] "continues to compel" [...] like professional wrestling and enjoyed a scene in which Jenner became irritated with Nicole, labeling it the sole genuine reaction of the episode. Writing for Homorazzi, Patrick [...] "loved this episode", and expressed an interest in the love triangle that seemingly develops between Cavallari, Jenner, and Nicole.

[...] Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: [...] "I want to make a creature <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> Condense." [...] Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a kamayt-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: [...] "I call you Horse; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you wherever you go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be on your back and fortune shall come through your meditation." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{sometime}} during Summer 2008. Miller wanted to style the filming {{as if the}} cameras are following the team like in a documentary. The first day was spent in the [...] "Ottawa Bravo" [...] safe house set, where Connie reveals the threat. Throughout the shoot, Gemma Jones had hip problems. Concerned, the producers set up a body double on hand. However, Jones insisted she could do everything herself, {{and in the end}} the double was not used. During the first shootout scene in the episode, Miller wanted to make the sequence as real as possible by having the camera film as if it was under attack. Richard Armitage recalled the shootout sequence; [...] "There was a shoot-out in the final episode where I surprised myself about the amount of rounds I could pull off and how quickly. It's a weird thing. I'm not a violent person but when you put a gun in somebody's hands something strange happens.

500|$|Kelly {{understands that}} co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. [...] "You often write songs with {{collaborators}} {{that you would}} never write by yourself.

One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly's process: they would start with a simple chat. [...] "We'd just chuck ideas around and he'd pick the best bits.

500|$|... "Sweet Love" [...] {{is a slow}} jam R ballad that {{displays}} {{elements of}} electronic music; it lasts for a duration of three minutes and 19 seconds long. The instrumentation is provided by a keyboard, synthesizers, percussion and a drum machine. According to Nadeska Alexis of MTVs Rapfix, Brown sings in a falsetto tone, which she found to be reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush described the ballad as [...] "very Michael Jackson and neo-Bieber". JusMusic of Singersroom noted that [...] "Sweet Love" [...] is inspired by Silk's [...] "Freak Me" [...] (1993).

500|$|Bagwell's power hike piqued {{the curiosity}} of many {{baseball}} observers. [...] In two minor league seasons from 1989–90, {{he had managed}} six home runs in 932 at bats–a ratio of 155 at bats per home run (AB/HR). [...] With 15 HR {{in his first year}} in Houston, that average shrunk to 36.9. [...] He also exhibited extraordinary plate discipline for a rookie: while ranking tenth in the league in walks with 75, his OBP placed fifth at [...]387. [...] Of the power surge, commented Bagwell to hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo, [...] "That's awesome", to which he reacted, [...] "Awesome? [...] We can get more <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> than that." [...] By altering an approach to contact the pitch with topspin as he did when he arriving to Houston, Jaramillo taught Bagwell to hit with backspin, resulting in a soaring trajectory rather than nose diving. [...] He also habituated Bagwell to manipulate the count, waiting for a pitch to drive instead of indiscriminately swinging at any pitch that appeared to be a strike. [...] Accounted Bagwell of the newfound advantage, [...] "I didn’t hit many home runs in the minor leagues, but when I hit one, when I got backspin on it, it went a long way." ...|$|E

He acknowledged that this method would be used, but {{expressed an interest in}} shooting from the victim's perspective, similar to that of first-person shooter video games being rendered in 3D. Dunstan added that [...] "It adds a whole new layer of discipline and criteria to creating these moments.

[...] Commenting on the change to filming in 3D, Bell stated it would not affect his performance or methods of acting, noting that it would be an [...] "interesting experience". Mandylor called the 3D shoot [...] "more tedious and longer". Flannery described the 3D aspect as being [...] " [...] shot in 3D so that you can, perse, see blood coming directly at you.
