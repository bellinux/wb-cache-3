5000|$|The {{predecessor}} designs, {{which included}} the Northeast Coast, <b>Open</b> <b>Shelter</b> <b>Deck</b> Steamer, {{were based on a}} simple ship originally produced in Sunderland by J.L. Thompson & Sons (see Silver Line) from 1879, and widely manufactured up to the SS Dorington Court built in 1939. The order specified an 18 inch m increase in draft to boost displacement by 800 LT to 10100 LT. The accommodation, bridge, and main engine were located amidships, with a tunnel connecting the main engine shaft to the propeller via a long aft extension. The first Ocean-class ship, SS Ocean Vanguard, was launched on 16 August 1941.|$|E
25|$|A's most {{numerous}} {{product was}} another of its standard designs, the SD14 <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> cargo ship. During the Second World War, shipyards in the United States had delivered more than 2,700 Liberty ship <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> cargo ships. By the 1960s many Liberty ships were reaching {{the end of}} their service lives, so in 1965 A started to develop a low-cost shelter-deck cargo vessel to replace them.|$|R
5000|$|Iéna - This {{ship had}} an anti-torpedo boat {{armament}} consisting of eight, shielded, 100 mm guns, in single mounts on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{provided}} by three 250 kW steam-driven generating sets with an 18 kW emergency generator located on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> above the waterline.|$|R
5000|$|Suffren - This {{ship had}} an anti-torpedo boat {{armament}} consisting of eight, shielded, 100 mm guns, in single mounts, on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> {{and on the}} superstructure.|$|R
25|$|First class {{passengers}} had {{quarters in}} the midship {{house on the}} bridge and <b>shelter</b> <b>decks</b> with access to a saloon lighted by a skylight and dinging room. Some rooms had private lavatories, but lavatories for men and another for women were located aft of the engine casing on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> with another set {{in the center of}} the bridge deck accommodations. The upper deck was fitted for either light cargo or steerage passengers and, in the event of Chinese steerage passengers, had provision for a Chinese galley and wash area.|$|R
25|$|The Ben-my-Chree {{was also}} fitted with 8 private cabins. These were {{located on the}} <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> and were {{exceptionally}} well furnished, fitted with sofas, a table and a folding lavatory.|$|R
25|$|In 1917 Hibernias ten 6-inch (152-mm) {{guns were}} removed from their casemates because they were flooded in heavy seas and {{replaced}} with four 6-inch (152-mm) guns on the higher <b>shelter</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|R
25|$|The hull was double {{bottomed}} with {{a capacity}} of 2,270 tons of fresh water for boilers or ship use with trimming tanks in the peaks and three deep tanks, one forward and two aft of the engine room, for a total water ballast of 4,600 tons. There were five complete decks composed of orlop, lower, middle, upper and <b>shelter</b> <b>decks</b> with the strength <b>deck</b> at the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> rather than usual upper deck with ten watertight bulkheads running up to the upper deck. Normal coal capacity was 1,950 tons but that could be increased by use of reserve bunkers to 2,800 tons.|$|R
500|$|The ship's {{secondary}} armament {{consisted of}} seven 45-caliber [...] Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1893 naval guns. Four were mounted in individual casemates {{on the main}} deck; two more were mounted on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> with gun shields and the last gun was mounted in a <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> turret superfiring over the rear main gun turret. This was the first superfiring turret in naval history and, in this case, was not very successful because {{the barrel of the}} 138mm gun was too short to clear the sighting hood of the turret below. These guns fired [...] shells at muzzle velocities of [...]|$|R
50|$|The attack killed 336 Allied PoWs {{and wounded}} many others. Nino Bixio had <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> holds. In No. 1 hold, the two wooden ladders from the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> {{to the lower}} level of the hold were {{destroyed}} in the explosion, hampering the rescue of survivors from the flooded part. The two ladders from {{the upper part of}} the hold to the deck survived, so prisoners from that level were able to escape. Many, including a lot of British Indian Army PoWs, jumped overboard. However, as it became clear that the ship would survive, many others stayed aboard.|$|R

50|$|LOF modernised its {{dry cargo}} fleet with four new SD14 <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> ships built by its A&P subsidiary: London Cavalier, London Fusilier and London Grenadier in 1972 and the London Bombardier in 1973.|$|R
5000|$|The design {{specifications}} {{for the six}} ships were for length overall of 459 ft, length between perpendiculars 435 ft, molded beam of 63 ft, depth to <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> of 40 ft and loaded draft of 25 ft. Cargo capacity was for [...] with loaded displacement of 13900 LT and cargo deadweight of 7613 LT. With fuel capacity of 1500 LT cruising range was approximately 20000 mi at a normal speed of 15.5 kn. The hull was a full <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> type with seven transverse water tight bulkheads, five holds, three forward and two aft of the engine spaces with 20 ft by 30 ft hatches except for #1 at 29 ft in length and #3 which was 50 ft in length. Holds were served by booms and 50 horsepower electric winches on six king posts. The four story deck house had quarters for officers and six staterooms with private baths on the bridge deck for twelve passengers. Crew spaces were on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> level of the deck house.|$|R
500|$|Hoods {{secondary}} armament was a dozen 50-calibre BL 5.5-inch Mk I guns, {{each with}} 200 rounds. They were shipped on shielded single pivot mounts fitted along {{the upper deck}} and the forward <b>shelter</b> <b>deck.</b> This high position allowed them to be worked during heavy weather as they were less affected by waves and spray compared with the casemate mounts of earlier British capital ships. Two of these guns on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> were temporarily replaced by QF 4-inch Mk V anti-aircraft (AA) guns between 1938 and 1939. All the 5.5-inch guns were removed during another refit in 1940. The gun fired a [...] shell to a maximum range of [...]|$|R
2500|$|A {{powerful}} steam windlass {{was situated}} {{forward on the}} <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> for working the anchors, which were arranged to be stowed in hawse pipes, and two large capstans were fitted aft on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> for warping purposes. A combined steam and hand steering engine was also located aft, and this was controlled by a telemotor gear from the navigating bridge. There was also a powerful steering gear situated forward, the purpose of which was to operate a bow rudder so as to facilitate the quick turning and manoeuvring of the vessel when entering or leaving port.For the stern rudder there was a combined steam and hand gear.|$|R
50|$|The ship's {{secondary}} armament {{consisted of}} seven 45-caliber 138.6 mm Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1893 naval guns. Four were mounted in individual casemates {{on the main}} deck; two more were mounted on the <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> with gun shields and the last gun was mounted in a <b>shelter</b> <b>deck</b> turret superfiring over the rear main gun turret. This was the first superfiring turret in naval history and, in this case, was not very successful because {{the barrel of the}} 138 mm gun was too short to clear the sighting hood of the turret below. These guns fired 35 - 30 kg shells at muzzle velocities of 730 - 770 m/s.|$|R

For anti-aircraft (A/A) defence, a quadruple mounting Mark VII QF 2-pounder was shipped aft along with up to 12 20 mm Oerlikon guns, in 2 twin powered mounts Mark V in the bridge wings and 8 single pedestal mounts Mark III. , Loch Craggie, Loch Eck, Loch Glendhu, [...] and the South African Navy ships HMSAS Good Hope, Natal and Transvaal carried single Bofors 40 mm gun mounts in lieu of the twin Oerlikons.|$|R
