In this age of multimedia communication, instant transmission and computerized technology, it seems that we have become more dependent than ever on visual communication and culture as ways of developing a social and cultural identity. In such society, poster as an artistic media, a product of graphic design and powerful tool for active social participation in such society continues to flourish as a significant art form and primary means of mass communication. The diploma focuses on the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> as artistic production in the society from different perspectives, which essentially define it, {{and the study of}} multiple historical factors that have had an impact on its emergence and the development. The quality and importance of <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> depend on variety of factors, but are always in direct relation to space and time, and social situation in which it occurs. Because of the range of current possibilities of production and reproduction, we are drowning in a flood of posters, to which due to their commercialism it is hard to ascribe any artistic significance. Reasons for the research of <b>the</b> topic of <b>poster</b> lay in its communicative value. <b>The</b> diploma points <b>out</b> that <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> does not have merely economic functions, but represents a cultural and social phenomenon. At the same time, it urges one towards critical thinking, active participation in society, and socially engaged creativity. Historical review and presented posters clearly account for the impact that a piece of paper can have, if it is defined by the right space and time, the artistic principles of graphic design, and powerful conceptual identity that responds to a particular social situation. ...|$|R

Resulted from Dr. Allison Whitney's poster assignment for ENGL 1102 - English Composition II - Science Fiction – Image, Sound, Text, an undergraduate course {{offered in the}} School of Literature, Communication and Culture (LCC). For the revision of the Pearl Harbor movie poster, I chose to make the love theme within the movie more evident. In <b>the</b> original <b>poster,</b> one can hardly guess {{that there is a}} love story in the movie since the main focus of <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> is <b>the</b> pilots and nurse in heroic poses and war imagery filling in the rest of <b>the</b> <b>poster.</b> To emphasize <b>the</b> love theme in <b>the</b> new <b>poster,</b> <b>the</b> three main characters are positioned in the near bottom center of <b>the</b> <b>poster,</b> silhouetted by <b>the</b> sun behind them. Since the three characters form a love triangle, all three had to help present the love theme. Ben Affleck’s character is embracing Kate Beckinsale’s character and a side profile image of the two is seen in front of the sun. Josh Harnett’s character is standing off to the right side of them and looking away from the couple, but Kate Beckinsale is extending her arm out behind her, out of Ben Affleck’s sight to hold on to Josh Harnett’s hand. This is as far as the representation of the love theme goes. The characters in <b>the</b> new <b>poster</b> are made to be small to show that their struggle is nothing compared to the epic conflict around them. The war theme has still a major part in <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> revision. <b>The</b> characters are emphasized {{in the center of the}} image but are small compared to the rest of the war imagery that surrounds them. The sun behind them is setting on the horizon above the ocean (the three characters are standing on the horizon). And emanating off the sun are rays that are slightly tinted red. This is an abstract image of the WWII era Japanese flag (the Rising sun). To either side of <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> are numerous warships, facing each other. And in the sky above the sun and horizon and ships is a Japanese aircraft formation flying <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>poster.</b> <b>The</b> ocean is faded to black down to the bottom of the image where the title text is. The text is in a similar font to the one used on <b>the</b> original <b>poster.</b> <b>The</b> <b>poster</b> allows <b>the</b> viewer to assume with a greater degree of certainty that a love theme is prevalent throughout the movie. The evidence is the pilot and nurse embracing while the nurse is holding on to the hand of the other pilot. However, the viewer can still expect to see war action scenes and fighting. While the imagery in <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> is sparse, <b>the</b> viewer will have an easier time assuming that the movie incorporates two themes, love and war, which play large roles in the movie Pearl Harbor...|$|R
40|$|Exhibited in the Library East Commons Exhibition Gallery spring {{semester}} 2009. Resulted from Dr. Allison Whitney's poster assignment for ENGL 1102 - English Composition II - Science Fiction – Image, Sound, Text, an undergraduate course {{offered in the}} School of Literature, Communication and Culture (LCC). In <b>the</b> original <b>poster</b> <b>the</b> designers drew on the unknown. Since the movie has been released for {{a large amount of}} time, most viewers already know what the unknown aspects are. One of the less predominant themes in <b>the</b> original <b>poster</b> was a frightening theme. Therefore <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> was designed to frighten the audience. The first thing that you see in <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> is <b>the</b> large alien in the center. It has been placed in front of the text to make the alien pop off the screen. If you look closely at the alien an image of a screaming man has been placed in the reflection on the head of the alien. This adds depth to <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> and makes it seem new to the audience every time they see it. The alien was placed on an image taken by the Hubble Telescope. This adds the idea of space into the movie and makes it seem like it is much more important than <b>the</b> other <b>poster</b> led us to believe. Space is real. It’s out there and {{it is one of the}} biggest unknowns in our age. By using an actual image of space, the audience realizes that the threat could actually be real as well. The title in the movie is a much larger font than the original because the large alien that is directly below it is better emphasized with large block letters than smaller spaced <b>out</b> letters. <b>The</b> color of the title was chose to represent blood since there was a lot of it in the movie. Blood is a classic image of fear used across the gamut genres of movies to represent death, pain, and incapacitating fear. There was also a quote added to <b>the</b> <b>poster,</b> although this is similar to the original, which definitely promotes the scary theme of <b>the</b> <b>poster.</b> "Your worst nightmare just got a whole lot worse. " The alien is even stepping on the first half of the text which bent it and now the alien is using that to jump <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>poster.</b> This brings back the idea of the unknown and frightens the audience into believing that the things in space are even worse than could be imagined. There is death and destruction, but there is also no escape in the dark abyss of space. There was another aspect which wasn’t included in <b>the</b> original <b>poster</b> which is included on <b>the</b> final <b>poster.</b> This was <b>the</b> addition of the director and the major actors involved in the production of the movie written on the top of <b>the</b> <b>poster.</b> <b>The</b> actor’s names were written, but their character names were also used.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the nature of {{marketing}} communications of British shipping lines in the period from c. 1840 to c. 1970 to establish the extent to which these outputs reflect extant scholarship which points to the lack of innovation as a key reason for the demise of these lines. Design/methodology/approach: The research is built on a survey of > 450 <b>posters</b> plotting <b>the</b> shifting nature of advertising messages over this long period in response to the market. This is supported by reading trade press contemporary to the period to establish broader trends in marketing and whether this product sector was aberrant. Findings: What is revealed is a generally static response in the promotion of British shipping lines throughout the timeframe, at odds with trends elsewhere. What stands <b>out</b> is <b>the</b> widespread criticism of <b>the</b> time singling <b>out</b> <b>the</b> shipping <b>poster.</b> This suggests an advanced appreciation of the role of <b>the</b> <b>poster</b> and <b>the</b> effectiveness of promotional messages focussing on emotions- versus a product-centred approach. Originality/value: Whilst there is an established literature which suggests that the British merchant marine was hamstrung by a pattern of family ownership making adaptation slow, no research to date has expressly read marketing as a window onto that culture. This paper shows that whilst there may have been change within the sector which these British shipping lines responded to, when it came to presenting themselves in public via their communications strategy, they adopted a staid, conservative approach. British shipping lines, throughout the period, had a very fixed idea about who they were and what best represented their business irrespective of dramatic shifts in attitudes concerning how best to reach consumers. Interrogating promotional material, and particularly <b>the</b> ubiquitous shipping <b>poster,</b> provides another insight into the conservative and debilitating corporate culture of British shipping...|$|R
