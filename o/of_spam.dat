In this Letter, we propose a group-based ranking method that evaluates users' reputations based on their grouping behaviors. More specifically, users are assigned with high reputation scores if they always fall into large rating groups. Results on three real data sets indicate that the present method is more accurate and robust than correlation-based method in the presence <b>of</b> <b>spamming</b> attacks.

To the best of our knowledge, none <b>of</b> the existing <b>spam</b> detectors uses a semantic-based approach in detection <b>of</b> <b>spams.</b> In this paper, we present Semantix-Plus which uses both semantic-based indications and syntax-based indications to convert a given e-mail into a 10 -variable record. The detector then uses a backpropagation neural network for the classification of the e-mail.
