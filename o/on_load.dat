40|$|Objective(s) : Chitosan, a {{biodegradable}} and cationic polysaccharide {{with increasing}} applications in biomedicine, possesses many advantages including mucoadhesivity, biocompatibility, and low-immunogenicity. The {{aim of this}} study, was investigating the influence of pH, ratio of azelaic acid/chitosan and molecular weight of chitosan <b>on</b> <b>loading</b> efficiency of azelaic acid in chitosan particles. Materials and Methods:  A model was generated using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to study interactions between the inputs and their effects <b>on</b> <b>loading</b> of azelaic acid. Results: From {{the details of the}} model, pH showed a reverse effect <b>on</b> the <b>loading</b> efficiency. Also, a certain ratio of drug/chitosan (~ 0. 7) provided minimum loading efficiency, while molecular weight of chitosan showed no important effect <b>on</b> <b>loading</b> efficiency. Conclusion: In general, pH and drug/chitosan ratio indicated an effect <b>on</b> <b>loading</b> of the drug. pH was the major factor affecting in determining loading efficiency...|$|R

Several {{materials}} {{have been used}} for plating the housing working surface, Nikasil being one. Citroen, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, A P Grazen and others applied for patents in this field. For the apex seals, the choice of materials has evolved along with the experience gained, from carbon alloys, to steel, ferrotic, and other materials. The combination between housing plating and apex and side seals materials was determined experimentally, to obtain the best duration of both seals and housing cover.

Robustness was evaluated <b>on</b> unloaded and <b>loaded</b> system. In order to assess real-time system performance we analyzed sampling time histograms and maxi-mum timing error. Both approaches perform satisfactory on unloaded system. <b>On</b> <b>loaded</b> system LAPIC approach shows better robustness. Although sampling time histograms show bigger errors <b>on</b> <b>loaded</b> systems than <b>on</b> unloaded systems, maximum timing error does not change significantly for the LAPIC approach. ...|$|R

[...] If the ship has no load line, instead, a maximum draft assigned by its national government, that value is used, if it has been assigned a maximum. [...] Finally, for a ship to which none of the above applies, the value of d is taken as 75 per cent of the moulded depth amidships.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{recording}} of “From: The Scissor Girls To: The Imaginary Layer on Skeletons” the band immediately set {{to work on a}} follow-up LP titled, “We People Space with Phantoms.” This album would be the final Scissor Girls album to include founding member Sue Anne Zollinger, who left the band following {{the recording}} due to internal conflicts between her {{and the rest of the}} band. Following Zollinger's departure, the band hired guitarist James Yoo to accompany them on a tour. Youssefi and Melowic, the remaining Scissor Girls, quickly realized that the guitar style of Zollinger's replacement did not mesh well with their own sound, and opted to replace Yoo mid-tour. Guitarist Kelly Kuvo, who had remained in touch with the band since the early days following their formation and had actually been living with Zollinger before the latter's departure from the Scissor Girls, was chosen to replace Yoo for the remainder of the tour. Though initially reluctant to collaborate with the Scissor Girls due to her commitments to her other group, Dot Dot Dot, and her production of video art project television shows for Public-access television cable TV, Kuvo agreed to take a week off work in order to help the band finish their tour. Eventually Kuvo would go on to become a full-time member of the group, collaborating as singer, songwriter and guitarist on the band's self-released 7" [...] singles [...] "New Tactical Outline Sec. 1" [...] and [...] "New Tactical Outline Sec. 2."
