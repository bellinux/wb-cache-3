The coincidence of the fine topology with other function space topologies on C(X, Y) is discussed. Also cardinal invariants of the fine topology on C(X, R), where R is the space of reals, are studied. To answer some questions of Di Maio and Naimpally (1992) other function space topologies are investigated, namely, Krikorian topology, <b>open-cover</b> topology, graph topology, topology of uniform convergence, proximal graph topology...|$|E

Lazuli bunting increased in abundance after the fire in our low-elevation chaparral impact points. Wirtz (1979) showed comparable results; the bunting represented 11 % to 25 % of his sightings in burned chaparral stations. However, he observed fewer buntings in unburned chaparral, reporting them as only occasional sightings (1 % to 10 % of all observations). The bunting is an <b>open-cover</b> specialist, preferring to perch on branches with high visibility and forage over open ground or ground with little shrub and tree cover (Unitt 1984). It follows that the bunting would actively select burned areas over unburned ones (USDA 2007).|$|E
