40|$|Background and Problem Discussion: Due to {{companies}} large <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>obligations,</b> {{discussions of the}} current standard regarding leasing, IAS 17, have provided suggestions to a new leasing standard, which is the foundation for this thesis. Purpose and Research Question: The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine if the implementation of a new leasing standard could have an effect on the market value of firms. The research question is: Do investors find the replacement of IAS 17 value relevant? If so, is the value relevance more prominent in certain industries or related to the size of the company? Methodology: In order to fulfil the purpose, an Event Study is performed. Data collection is primarily performed through DataStream and analysis of the data is performed in Stata. Results and Conclusion: The empirical findings in this study suggest no general effect on value relevance regarding the new standard. No significant results are found within different industries. However, considering companies of different size, significant results are found. The general conclusion is therefore that size is probably a variable that is value relevant to investors considering the replacement of the new leasing standard...|$|E

40|$|While leases {{are widely}} used to finance {{productive}} assets in the U. S, lease accounting has been sharply criticized for providing incomplete and unreliable information to investors because many leases are arranged <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> as operating leases. As such, a higher cost of equity capital may be required by investors to compensate for unrecorded liabilities and imperfect information. In this dissertation, I provide the empirical evidence as to how equity market participants perceive the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ^ First, I investigate the firm characteristics that determine the choice on operating versus capital leases. By summarizing the results from prior literature, I identify the determinants from three areas: operating risks, financial constraints and tax-driven incentives. The results suggest that both economic and opportunistic reasons drive a firm 2 ̆ 7 s lease choice. Specifically, fast-growing, financially constrained, or low-tax firms opt for <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases. ^ Second, I {{examine the impact of}} <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases on the cost of equity, and whether it would be different from that of capital leases or conventional debt. The results suggest that <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases are “value relevant” as indicated by an increased cost of equity capital being associated with greater use of operating leases. However, investors also seem to suffer from the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> position of disclosed operating leases. The leverage effect of operating leases is largely attenuated relative to capital leases and conventional debt. ^ Third, I explore the role of information intermediaries in compensation for the deficiency in accounting for leases. The results indicate that the cost of equity, with respect to the use of <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases, diminishes in greater analyst followings and the existence of credit ratings. Specifically, the diminishing effect of 2 ̆ 7 financial analysts is more pronounced on <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> operating leases than that on capital leases and conventional debt. Lastly, whether a firm is audited by a big 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 firm appears to have no effect on either off- or on-balance sheet leases. ^ This study contributes to the Financial Accounting Standard Board 2 ̆ 7 s lease accounting project and helps investors assess the risk of firms with <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> leases. ...|$|R

These losses resulted in the failure, acquisition or bailout of some of the largest financial institutions and a near meltdown of the world’s financial and economic systems.

I examine a sample of publicly-listed banks in a cross-country setting, including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, and the USA, over the period of 1995 to 2011.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{investment banking}} of mortgage credit derivatives {{in terms of}} structuring and <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> financing. The benefits and risks are also studied. The study describes the particular mechanism of structuring mortgage into mortgage credit derivatives as well as <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> financing of the mortgage credit derivatives is examined. Mortgage derivatives, such as an asset-backed security (ABS) and more complex collateralized debt obligation (CDO) structures among others {{are a part of}} the structured finance and have particular features. High-risk mortgage loans are attractive assets as a part of these derivatives since the loans offer better yields than prime class mortgage. On the other hand, the risks are bigger and the risks remain through structuring and off-balance financing. The mechanism of structuring mortgage credit derivatives is described. Structuring involves many market participants and financial intermediaries. Underlying assets of these credit derivatives are certain mortgage loans. Many benefits are evolved including new sources of external finance, credit risk transfer, improved liquidity, increased trading volume, better profits and a chance to straighten the financial supply chain. The benefits of structuring mortgage credit derivatives appear similar to common benefits of structured finance and securitization. Risks and disadvantages occur as well as the mechanism of structuring mortgage credit derivatives is sub-ject to risks or disadvantages. The major risks or disadvantages are the lack of control, asymmetric information, the lack of transparency and disadvantages of credit risk transfer. <b>Off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance or financial activities outside of the balance sheet is understudied area although it has a salient role in mortgage derivatives banking. <b>Off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance creates plenty of benefits that are a new source of external finance, improved profitability, new tools to attain new lines of business in the banking industry and a possibility to leverage. However, <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance is also a subject to increased risk in banking as it increases both risk of deposit, liquidity risk as well as risk of losses, it creates a possibility to leverage and <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance also increases financial risk. In addition, the significance of <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> finance is undisputable in the field of modern investment banking. Mortgage credit derivatives banking seems to offer benefits and expose risks or disadvantages similar to the aforementioned benefits and risks of structuring or <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> financing as such.

40|$|The present paper {{analyzes}} {{two important}} aspects in the amplification {{process of the}} recent financial crisis to the real economy, that is the securitisation of financial assets (and in particular of loans and mortgages) {{and the growth of}} bank <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> activities, for instance through the development of Special Purpose Vehicles, with specific attention to the US context. In particular, this work aims to examine whether and how the increase in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> credit exposure to credit derivatives, mainly due to loan securitisation, may have affected the growth rate of loans over the past few years, also by distinguishing different categories of loans. For this purpose, we present the results of a panel fixed-effect estimation and of a panel VAR analysis, using quarterly data from the balance sheets of 39 US commercial banks and for a period between 1998 and 2008. The results show that a rise in off-balance credit exposure may have – after some time lags - a negative impact on the growth rate of bank lending, due to the potential and actual losses related to the <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> activities. However, the effects on the single categories of loans depend on their maturity: the negative effect due to an increase in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> exposure is stronger for long-term loans, like mortgages or real estate loans, while some positive impact on bank lending may arise for short-term loans, such as commercial and industrial loans, because of the liquidity/maturity transformation function associated with securitisation activities. The results of the paper regarding the impact of an increase in <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> exposures on bank deleveraging process may have some relevant policy implications for the design of financial regulation, particularly in the area of shadow banking, supporting the current policy initiatives for the revision of risk weights in securitisation exposures {{as well as for the}} implementation of consolidation regimes concerning bank <b>off-balance</b> <b>sheet</b> activities. ...|$|R
