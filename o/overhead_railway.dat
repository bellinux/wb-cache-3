25|$|The Liverpool <b>Overhead</b> <b>Railway</b> {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} electric railways in Great Britain. The first section, between Alexandra Dock and Herculaneum Dock, was opened in 1893. The line connected with Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's North Mersey Branch. It was never nationalised, and closed on 30 December 1956 due to extensive corrosion throughout its iron infrastructure (which was deemed uneconomical to replace).|$|E
25|$|The first {{electric}} railway in Great Britain was Volk's Electric Railway in Brighton, {{a pleasure}} railway, {{which opened in}} 1883, still functioning to this day. The London Underground began operating electric services using a fourth rail system in 1890 on the City and South London Railway, {{now part of the}} London Underground Northern line. The Liverpool <b>Overhead</b> <b>Railway</b> followed in 1893, being designed from the outset to be electric traction, unlike the City and South London Railway which was designed to be cable hauled initially. Main line electrification of some suburban lines began {{in the early years of}} the 20th century, using a variety of different systems. In 1921 a government committee chose 1,500VDC overhead to be the national standard, but little implementation followed and many different systems co-existed. During the interwar period, the Southern Railway adopted the 660 V DC third rail system as its standard and greatly expanded this system across its network of lines south of London.|$|E

40|$|Artículos en revistasThis {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the effect of cable slackening on stiffness computation of <b>railway</b> <b>overheads.</b> A previous model based on the catenary equation serves as the basis to include cable slackening. The influence of cable slackening is highlighted by comparing both models. A discussion of the comparison between the cable slackening model and traditional finite element formulations is presented. Although the method presented is applied to <b>railway</b> <b>overheads,</b> this methodology can be easily applied to general vertical cable nets. The proposed method shows good agreement with finite element results and the computational time is greatly reduced. The main influence of cable slackening is the smoothing of stiffness distribution at the local vicinity of the slackening dropper and consequently reducing the average stiffness of the <b>railway</b> <b>overhead.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{other urban}} {{railways}} had been constructed for electric traction: in 1890 the City and South London underground tube had opened with electric traction, followed in 1893 {{by the more}} local Liverpool <b>Overhead</b> <b>Railway.</b> Plans for electrification of the Mersey Railway in 1895 were shelved as {{the company and its}} investors were fighting in the courts; in 1897 a new board of directors was elected. In 1898, £500 was released for further expert advice that recommended electrification at a cost of £260,000 [...] (equivalent to £ in [...] ). By then, the railway had attracted the attention of George Westinghouse, an American in the UK looking for business for his UK works, the British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co. Ltd that opened at Trafford Park in 1899. Westinghouse considered the railway would be profitable with electric traction and undertook to fund electrification, promising to complete in eighteen months. Electrification was approved by Parliament in the Mersey Railway Act of 1900, which also terminated the bankruptcy and in July 1901 the Westinghouse contract was signed.|$|E

40|$|The <b>railway</b> <b>overhead</b> (or catenary) is {{the system}} of cables {{responsible}} for providing electric current to the train. This system has been reported as wind-sensitive (Scanlon et al., 2000), and particularly to the occurrence of galloping phenomena. Galloping phenomena of the <b>railway</b> <b>overhead</b> consists of undamped cable oscillations triggered by aerodynamic forces acting on the contact wire. As is well known, aerodynamic loads on the contact wire depends on the incident flow mean velocity and the angle of attack. The presence of embankments or hills modifies both vertical velocities profiles and angles of attack of the flow (Paiva et al., 2009). The presence of these cross-wind related oscillations can interfere with the safe operation of the railway service (Johnson, 1996). Therefore a correct modelling of the phenomena is required to avoid these unwanted oscillations...|$|R

6000|$|Philip {{expressed}} his gratitude in a satisfactory manner and {{stood for a}} few moments at the window. Although it was practically his first glimpse of New York, the wonders of the panorama over which he looked failed even to excite his curiosity. The clanging of the surface cars, the roar and clatter of the <b>overhead</b> <b>railway,</b> the hooting of streams of automobiles, all apparently being driven at breakneck speed, alien sounds though they were, fell upon deaf ears. He could neither listen nor observe. Every second's delay fretted him. His plans were all made. Everything depended upon their being carried out now without the slightest hitch. He walked a dozen times to the door, waiting for his luggage, and when at last it arrived he was on the point of using the telephone. He feed the linen-coated porters and dismissed them as rapidly as possible. Then he ransacked the trunks until he found, amidst a pile of fashionable clothing, a quiet and inconspicuous suit of dark grey. In the bathroom he hastily changed his clothes, selected an ordinary Homburg hat, and filled a small leather case with various papers.

The remainder of his belongings were negligible. He stood {{at the window and}} looked out across the city, the city into whose labyrinths he was so eager to penetrate--the undiscovered country. By day and night its voices were in his ears, the rattle and roar of the <b>overhead</b> <b>railway,</b> the clanging of the street cars, the heavy traffic, the fainter but never ceasing foot-fall of the multitudes. He had sat there before dawn and watched the queer, pinky-white light steal with ever widening fingers through the darkness, heard the yawn of the city as it seemed to shiver and tremble before the battle of the day. At twilight he had watched the lights spring up one by one, at first like pin pricks in the distance, growing and widening until the grotesque shapes of the buildings from which they sprung had faded into nothingness, and there was left only a velvet curtain of strangely-lit stars. At a giddy distance below he could trace the blaze of Broadway, the blue lights flashing from the electric wires as the cable cars rushed back and forth, the red and violet glimmer of the sky signs. He knew it all so well, by morning, by noon and night; in rainstorm, storms which he had watched come up from oceanwards in drifting clouds of vapour; and in sunshine, clear, brilliant sunshine, a little hard and austere, to his way of thinking, and unseasonable.|$|E
