5|$|The {{main event}} at Against All Odds {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Samoa Joe as Special Outside Enforcer between then-champion Kurt Angle and the {{challenger}} Christian Cage. On January 6, 2008 at TNA's previous PPV event Final Resolution, Angle defeated Cage to retain the championship after Cage's alliance A.J. Styles attacked Cage, aligning with Angle and The Angle Alliance. On the January 10, 2008 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Cage, Joe, and Styles would compete in a Three Way match on the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact!. Stipulations for the match were that the winner would get a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match against Angle at Against All Odds, however if Styles won he could choose instead of the title match to allow Angle to not have to defend his title for two months. Cage ended up winning the contest, thus becoming the number one contender. On the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced that Joe would be the Special Outside Enforcer at Against All Odds due him being controversially disqualified during the match. Also connected to the storyline was the allegiance of former Christian's Coalition and The Angle Alliance member Tomko to either Cage or Angle. Heading up to the match, Tomko explained he was not on either's side, despite being one-half of the TNA World Tag Team Champions with Styles. On the January 31, 2008 episode of Impact!, Tomko defeated Angle after interference from Cage. This resulted in Tomko and Cage seeming to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>page</b> on the February 7, 2008 episode of Impact!.|$|E

25|$|The most {{significant}} problem with blocking all scripts on all websites by default is substantial reduction in functionality and responsiveness (client-side scripting {{can be much}} faster than server-side scripting {{because it does not}} need to connect to a remote server and the page or frame {{does not need to be}} reloaded). Another problem with script blocking is that many users do not understand it, and do not know how to properly secure their browsers. Yet another drawback is that many sites do not work without client-side scripting, forcing users to disable protection for that site and opening their systems to vulnerabilities. The Firefox NoScript extension enables users to allow scripts selectively from a given page while disallowing others <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>page.</b> For example, scripts from example.com could be allowed, while scripts from advertisingagency.com that are attempting to run <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>page</b> could be disallowed.|$|E

25|$|Haughfoot was a hamlet, {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} a staging post for horses and carriages, in the Scottish Borders {{near the village}} of Stow. It was in this unlikely location that a Lodge was founded in 1702 by men who were mainly local landowners. The significance of this Lodge {{lies in the fact that}} none of its members were stonemasons, confirming that modern Freemasonry was fully evolved in Scotland before the appearance of centralised authority in the form of Grand Lodges. The Minute Book of the Lodge, which is extant, commences in 1702 and inside the front covers is the part which is identical to the last portion of the Edinburgh Register House and Airlie MSS. Although not complete (the missing part was almost certainly removed for reasons of secrecy) the Haughfoot fragment is sufficient to confirm that it was very likely to have been identical to the two previously mentioned MSS. The 'fragment' was probably retained because the Minute of the first meeting of the Lodge commences immediately after this portion of ritual <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>page.</b>|$|E

They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has {{all the time in the}} world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin is the only one who had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E

Konnan, however, was against the idea of his former employer coming to AAA and believed that Roldán had made a mistake. Jarrett and fellow TNA worker Abyss arrived to AAA on May 18 for a confrontation with Konnan and La Sociedad. In the end, Konnan and Jarrett revealed {{that they were in}} fact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>page</b> with each other and turned on El Zorro, along with L.A. Park, with Konnan announcing that Jarrett would be challenging for his AAA Mega Championship at Triplemanía XIX. After witnessing this turn of events, Marisela Peña Roldan finally decided that his son had gone too far and fired him from AAA, which led to Dorian proclaiming that with TNA he would revolutionize lucha libre and eventually the letters AAA would be replaced by TNA. As part of the TNA invasion, it was announced that at Triplemanía XIX TNA Knockouts Angelina Love, Mickie James and Velvet Sky would team with La Sociedads Sexy Star in an eight-woman tag team match against Cynthia Moreno, Faby Apache, AAA Reina de Reinas Champion Mari Apache and Lolita, Rob Van Dam would face Dr. Wagner Jr. for the newly created AAA Latin American Championship and Abyss and Mr. Anderson would challenge Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans for the AAA World Tag Team Championship in a steel cage match.|$|E

25|$|In February 2010, TNA {{restarted}} {{their working}} relationship with AAA and in early May 2011, Jarrett made his return to AAA television, announcing his and TNA's alignment with Dorian Roldán and his heel stable La Sociedad and their participation in Triplemanía XIX. Konnan, the co-leader of La Sociedad and former TNA worker, however, was against the idea of his former employer coming to AAA and believed that Roldán {{had made a mistake}} by inviting him to the promotion. Jarrett and Abyss arrived to AAA on May 18 for a confrontation with Konnan and La Sociedad. In the end, Jarrett and Konnan revealed that they were in fact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>page</b> with each other and turned on AAA Mega Champion El Zorro with Konnan announcing that Jarrett would be challenging for his title at Triplemanía XIX. On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, Jarrett defeated El Zorro to become the new AAA Mega Champion. On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, Jarrett successfully defended the title in a three-way elimination match against Dr. Wagner, Jr. and L.A. Park, when someone wearing El Zorro's old mask interfered and hit Park with a guitar. This person was later revealed as La Sociedad member Chessman, whom Konnan had sent to interfere in the match in order to have Park go after El Zorro instead of continuing to chase his stablemate's title. The storyline continued on October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, where both Jarrett and Park took part in the Copa Antonio Peña gauntlet match. After working together for the entire match, Park eventually turned on Jarrett and eliminated him. After a distraction from the Jarretts, Park was attacked by another masked El Zorro, costing him the match.|$|E
25|$|In late 2010 L.A. Park {{began asking}} Konnan {{for a shot}} at the AAA Mega Championship and was promised his shot if he managed to defeat El Mesías at Guerra de Titanes. Park did just that, but instead of putting {{together}} a match between him and the new Mega Champion, his La Sociedad partner El Zorro, the next title shot was awarded to Los Bizarros member Charly Manson to set up a grudge match for the title between him and El Zorro, causing dissension between Park and Konnan. On February 28 Park entered the 2011 Rey de Reyes tournament in order to solidify his spot as the number one contender, defeating Dr. Wagner Jr., Halloween and Nicho el Millonario in his semifinal match. During the match Park was attacked by La Sociedad member Damián 666, who was seemingly trying to prevent him from advancing in the tournament, but instead the interference distracted Wagner Jr. and cost him the match. On March 18 at the Rey de Reyes pay-per-view, Park was eliminated from the finals of the tournament, after brawling with rival El Mesías to a double countout. At the same event Los Perros del Mal, represented by El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, Damián 666, Halloween and Super Crazy, continued their win streak over Los Psycho Circus, by defeating them and Dr. Wagner Jr., the alliance known as Potencia Mundial, in an eight-man tag team match. Meanwhile, El Zorro was successful in his first title defense by defeating Charly Manson. At the following television taping on March 21, Konnan, disappointed with the performance of La Milicia, demoted Decnnis and named Super Fly the sub–group's new leader. Later that same night, Los Maniacos lost the AAA World Tag Team Championship to Jack Evans and the 2011 Rey de Reyes, Extreme Tiger. Following the loss, Silver King and Último Gladiador began showing signs of dissension, but were brought back together by La Legión Extranjera member Chessman, who joined Los Maniacos to form La Maniarquía. Meanwhile, the AAA Mega Champion El Zorro, having caught wind of L.A. Park's intention of challenging for his title, seemingly started interfering in his matches under his old mask, costing him back–to–back multi–man tag team matches at the April 27 and 30 TV tapings, escalating the dissension within La Sociedad in the process. In early May, Jeff Jarrett, the founder of American promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, announced his and TNA's alignment with Dorian Roldán and La Sociedad and their participation in Triplemanía XIX. Konnan, however, was against the idea of his former employer coming to AAA and believed that Roldán had made a mistake.

It was later revealed that the man who had attacked Park under El Zorro's mask was actually Charly Manson, who had been sent by Cibernético to cause dissension within the ranks of La Sociedad. On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly defeated Los Psycho Circus in a tournament final to become the first ever AAA World Trios Champions, while Jeff Jarrett defeated El Zorro to become the new AAA Mega Champion and L.A. Park ended his feud with El Mesías by defeating him in a Mask vs. Hair match.|$|E
