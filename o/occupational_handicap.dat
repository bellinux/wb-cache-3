40|$|This article {{presents}} health expectancy calculations from Bulgaria for 1976 - 1992. The calculations {{are based on}} mortality statistics and data from a national information system from the Expert Medical Commissions on Working Capacity about loss of working capacity. Following internationally accepted terminology, the most appropriate term for the health expectancies presented here is 'occupational handicap-free life expectancy' (OHFLE). Life expectancies were calculated as partial life expectancies from ages 16 to 59. Health expectancy calculations followed Sullivan's cross-sectional method with age and sex specific prevalence data on <b>occupational</b> <b>handicap.</b> Around 1985 a three- to four-fold increase in these prevalences occurred. The distribution of occupational handicaps over sexes, age groups and severity levels, however, remained fairly constant. The results show a decrease both in partial life expectancy within the age range 16 - 59 and in OHFLE {{at the age of}} 16 for men. For women a more or less stable partial life expectancy and a decrease in OHFLE at the age of 16 was found around 1985. The introduction of more incentives for people who successfully registered probably caused the decrease around 1985. Major social changes may have acted as confounding factors for the fluctuations after 1985. On the other hand the findings may reflect real changes in population health due to an increasing incidence in some major disease categories. The nation-wide system for assessment and registration of health related working incapacity has proved a useful source for an attempt to calculate OHFLE. Given uncertainties about the population health underlying these changes in OHFLE, however, it is recommended that health interview and health examination surveys should be considered as alternative routes for achieving a more comprehensive picture of population health in Bulgaria. health expectancy <b>occupational</b> <b>handicap</b> working incapacity expert medical commissions Bulgaria...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} {{to what extent}} impairments, disabilities and handicaps are used as diagnostic assessments and treatment goals in logopedics. Traditionally, logopedists are mainly concerned with impairments. These days, increasing attention is demanded for disabilities and handicaps as well. A survey study was carried out on 1, 567 patients in logopedic practices in the Netherlands to provide an empirical quantitative description of diagnostic assessments and treatment goals, formulated in terms of impairments, disabilities and handicaps. Results show that logopedists indeed often indicate impairments as diagnostic assessments and as treatment goals, particularly language development impairments and phonetic/phonological articulation impairments. Interestingly, also large numbers of diagnostic assessments and treatment goals were indicated {{at the level of}} disabilities and handicaps; the most important being disability in expressing communication and <b>occupational</b> <b>handicap.</b> These results demonstrate that disabilities and handicaps may serve an important function in logopedics, in that they may guide assessment as well as therapy. It is concluded that disabilities and handicaps should be considered in the future development of the profession of logopedics. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Locomotor {{disability}} is a problem, reported prevalence {{ranging from}} 1 % to 8. 6 %. Only {{a limited number}} of studies have been done in South Africa. They used different methodologies and definitions, thus leading to the variation in prevalence reported. A further factor influencing prevalence is that some locomotor disabilities are area-specific. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and rehabilitation needs of individuals with locomotor disability in Mitchell's Plain, for planning intervention strategies as part of this community based rehabilitation service. A cross sectional study design was employed. A stratified proportional cluster sampling technique was used to select 36 clusters resulting in a sample size of 2424 people. Screening questions recommended by the WHO were used to identify people with impairments (Phase I). Further screening (Phase II), of those identified with impairments, using a questionnaire based on the ICIDH categories, identified people with disabilities. People with locomotor disabilities were grouped together and qualitative analysis through case studies was done on sub-groups where common themes manifested. 12. 9 % reported some form of impairment; 3. 9 % adults could be classified as having disabilities. Amongst adults with disabilities, 2. 7 % had locomotor disabilities. Consistent with the literature, disability increased with age, was more frequently reported amongst females, and was associated with lower socio-economic class. Multiple impairments were frequently reported, with the most common impairment being musculo-skeletal conditions. Use of health services occurred in the public sector with the local Day Hospital used as frequently as more distant tertiary hospitals. The study revealed the need for improved and accessible medical and rehabilitation services in the community. Their poor ability to integrate functionally and economically into the community, was reflected in the high proportion of people with mobility and <b>occupational</b> <b>handicap</b> categories. Low levels of education worsened the impact on <b>occupational</b> <b>handicap.</b> It was further evident that multiple impairments amongst the elderly lead to greater dependence of people with locomotor disability on their care-givers. Even though the need for assistive equipment was high, much of assistive equipment owned was not being used. A further handicapping factor for the disabled using assistive equipment was their environment which restricted the use of assistive equipment. High locomotor disability prevalence was confirmed in this study. Major unmet needs were identified in the handicap categories of physical mobility and economic self-sufficiency. Domiciliary based intervention was recommended as the most appropriate rehabilitative intervention for the severely physically disabled persons...|$|E
40|$|Onchocerciasis or river blindness, a {{major cause}} of {{irreversible}} blindness among adults, {{has been the focus of}} international disease control efforts for over 20 years in West Africa. This paper employs the international classification of impairment, disability and handicap (ICIDH) to interpret results from a field study to assess the socioeconomic consequences of onchocerciasis in Guinea in 1987. In a sample of 136 blind, 94 visually impaired and 89 well-sighted persons, decreasing visual acuity is strongly associated with mobility, <b>occupational</b> and marital <b>handicaps.</b> Individual, household and disease correlates were explored. The implications of these findings for the ICIDH concept of handicap are discussed with particular emphasis on the need to extend analysis beyond the individual when assessing the socioeconomic consequences of disabling disease...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{prevalence}} of symptoms of panic disorder in a representative community sample of people with dizziness and to compare the profile of those whose panic was consistently linked to attacks of dizziness with those in whom dizziness was just one of many, variable somatic symptoms of panic. Validated questionnaires assessing physical and psychological symptoms, <b>occupational</b> disability, and <b>handicap</b> were administered to 128 people reporting dizziness in an epidemiological survey. Nearly two thirds of the sample reported having panic attacks, and one in four met key criteria for panic disorder. People whose panic symptoms were consistently associated with dizziness reported higher rates of vertigo than those with panic unrelated to dizziness, and higher rates of fainting, agoraphobic behavior, and occupational disability than either comparison group. Explanation of perceptual-motor triggers for disorientation may increase the predictability of attacks, thus reducing vulnerability to dizziness-provoked panic...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—Recent {{longitudinal}} {{studies have reported}} that smoking increases risk for cognitive impairment and that moderate alcohol intake could be preventive. The association between both cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking and incident cognitive impairment was studied in a representative population.  METHODS—This is a 1 year prospective population based cohort sudy of all residents aged 65 or over in the electoral ward of Gospel Oak in London, UK (n= 889). Cognitive impairment was assessed at baseline and 1 year later using the organic brain syndrome (OBS) cognitive impairment scale from the short CARE structured assessment. Subjects who were cognitively impaired at baseline were excluded from this analysis.  RESULTS—The prevalence of OBS cognitive impairment was 10. 4 % at index assessment and the 1 year cumulative incidence of cognitive impairment was 5. 7 %. Cognitive impairment {{was not associated with}} use of alcohol, although there was a non-significant association {{in the direction of a}} protective effect against onset of cognitive impairment for moderate drinkers compared with non-drinkers and heavy drinkers. Current smoking status predicted cognitive impairment (risk ratio (RR) 3. 7; (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) = 1. 1 - 12. 3) independently from sex, age, alcohol, <b>occupational</b> class, education, <b>handicap,</b> depression, and baseline cognitive function.  CONCLUSIONS—Smoking seems to be a prospective risk factor for incident cognitive impairment; thus encouragement of older people to stop smoking could be considered as part of a strategy to reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment. ...|$|R
40|$|Social phobia is {{a common}} (13 %) and {{disabling}} anxiety disorder associated with considerable social and <b>occupational</b> <b>handicap.</b> It {{is not likely to}} remit without treatment. Although the efficacy of cognitive behavioural and pharmacological interventions are relatively well established {{there is a need for}} further development, as many patients remain disabled at the end of treatment. There is still a lack of understanding of the factors involved in incomplete treatment responses. In addition, it is important to examine how treatments actually work in clinical practice. The aims of the present thesis were to examine the effectiveness of an intensive (3 weeks) cognitive behavioural group treatment (CBGT) in a pilot study and in a waiting list controlled study. Taking into account some recent developments in psychological treatment the intensive CBGT was modified (and renamed intensive group cognitive treatment /IGCT/) and compared to individual cognitive therapy (ICT) and treatment as usual (TAU), involving medication, in a randomized controlled study of 100 patients. Finally, a trait-based study of personality patterns before and after treatment was conducted aiming to outline personality characteristics in patients with social phobia, and patterns of change following treatment. The result of the pilot study as well of the waiting list controlled study showed that patients improved significantly after three weeks of treatment, with reduced levels of social phobia related symptoms. The treatment effects were maintained at one year post-treatment. The efficacy of the intensive treatment was further confirmed in the randomized, controlled trial of IGCT, ICT and TAU. ICT was, however, more effective than IGCT and TAU, which showed equal efficacy. The personality patterns of patients were characterised by pronounced levels of harm avoidance and character traits associated with personality disorders. Dysfunctional traits were changed following treatments: however, nonresponders still exhibited high levels of harm avoidance. To conclude, brief intensive group treatment is a feasible and effective option in the treatment of social phobia in routine psychiatric practice. It works fast and shows maintained or improved effects at one year post-treatment. IGCT, ICT and TAU are all effective and enduring treatments for social phobia. However, ICT is superior to IGCT and TAU. The 3 -week IGCT seems to be more accepted and is as effective as the 12 -month medication focused TAU. Pronounced harm avoidance is a general vulnerability trait in patients with social phobia and may be a general predictor of poor treatment response. Further studies are needed for additional understanding of factors contributing to incomplete treatments responses...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dizziness {{is known}} to be a common, handicapping {{condition}} in the elderly, and a strong association between dizziness and anxiety disorders has been observed in hospital samples. However, {{little is known about the}} prevalence of dizziness among people of working age in the community and its implications for psychosocial functioning and general practice consultation and treatment. AIM: To determine the prevalence of dizziness, giddiness, vertigo, and unsteadiness, and associations with disability and handicap, symptoms of panic and agoraphobia, and general practice consultation and treatment. METHOD: Postal questionnaires were completed by 2064 people aged 18 - 64 years randomly sampled from the patient lists of four London practices. Validated survey items were used to assess symptoms, panic and agoraphobia, levels of <b>occupational</b> disability and <b>handicap,</b> and general practice consultation and treatment. RESULTS: More than one in five responders (n = 480) had experienced dizziness during the past month; nearly half of these (n = 225) reported some degree of handicap and 30 % had been dizzy for more than five years. Almost half (n = 221) of those with dizziness also reported anxiety and/or avoidance behaviour. Multiple physical and psychological symptoms were associated with higher levels of handicap. Only one in four of the 225 dizzy responders reporting some degree of handicap had received any form of treatment. CONCLUSION: Dizziness is a common, chronic, and often untreated symptom in people aged 18 - 65 years, associated with extensive handicap and psychological morbidity...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyses}} the actual <b>occupational</b> situation, vocational <b>handicaps</b> and past labour career {{of a group}} of about 1000 Dutch patients suffering from a neuromuscular disorder (NMD). On the basis of the likelihood of a substantial employment history and sufficient numbers of patients, four types of NMD were selected: dystrophia myotonica (DM), hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and myasthenia gravis (MG). Results show that a labour career is in reach of most NMD patients, even for those with severe limitations. It is concluded that physical limitations seem not to be decisive in that respect. The loss of the quality of communication, the loss of mental abilities and the effect of the diseases on the facial expression, as with some DM patients, are also important for chances on the labour market. Though the labour participation of NMD patients tends to decrease after the age of 34, the availability of work adaptations makes it possible to prolong the labour career. Analysis of the actual work situation of NMD patients shows that both disorder-related limitations and work characteristics {{play an important role in}} the amount of physical work problems encountered. It is argued that physical labour has to be regarded as generally unsuitable for NMD patients. This has implications for the sort and level of education to be attained by NMD patients. Career counselling as a focus point for the choice of an educational programme may improve labour market opportunities as well as quality of employment of NMD patients. Allowing for and accepting the possible effects of the disorder in the work situation are considered to be important in respect to labour participation and work satisfaction of workers with NMD. Reducing time pressure demands and increasing the freedom to organize one's work, are measures to be given especial consideration...|$|R
