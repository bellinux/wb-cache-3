2500|$|After An Inconvenient Truth was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award, Donna Brazile (Gore's campaign chairwoman from the 2000 campaign) speculated that Gore might announce a possible presidential candidacy for the 2008 election. During a speech on January 31, 2007, at Moravian College, Brazile stated, [...] "Wait till <b>Oscar</b> <b>night,</b> I tell people: 'I'm dating. I haven't fallen in love yet. On <b>Oscar</b> <b>night,</b> if Al Gore has slimmed down 25 or 30 pounds, Lord knows.'" [...] During the award ceremony, [...] Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio shared the stage {{to speak about the}} [...] "greening" [...] of the ceremony itself.

2500|$|Approximately {{three dozen}} {{people came to}} the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards. The 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards had double the {{attendance}} as the first, and the 3rd awards ceremony had double this number. By the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony, CNN and two major wire services covered the event. Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards prior to the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage: [...] "We finally figured out you couldn't compete with the Oscars on <b>Oscar</b> <b>night,</b> but if you went the night before, when the press {{from all over the}} world are here and they are looking for something to do, it could well catch on," [...] he said to BBC News.|$|E
2500|$|Wilder's and Brackett's estrangement during Double Indemnity {{was not a}} {{permanent}} one.

[...] "Charlie produced The Uninvited...I wrote Double Indemnity with Raymond Chandler... I don't think he ever forgave me. He always thought I cheated on him with Raymond Chandler." [...] Brackett spun the breakup in a decidedly different light, saying, [...] "Billy got so despondent at being without me that we did The Lost Weekend, a depressing film about a writer who has trouble writing." [...] Lost Weekend was a distinguished offspring for the reconciled couple – they left <b>Oscar</b> <b>night</b> with three Awards: Best Picture for producer Brackett, Best Director for Wilder, and a shared pair of statuettes for both for Best Screenplay. They worked together through Sunset Boulevard in 1950, then split for good.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2005, Rock {{hosted the}} 77th Academy Awards ceremony. The {{decision}} to have Rock host the awards was seen {{by some as a}} chance to bring an [...] "edge" [...] to the ceremony, and to make it more relevant or appealing to younger audiences. Jokingly, Rock opened by saying [...] "Welcome to the 77th and LAST Academy Awards!" [...] During one segment Rock asked, [...] "Who is this guy?" [...] in reference to actor Jude Law seemingly appearing in every movie Rock had seen that year and implied Law was a low-rent Tom Cruise (he made a joke about filmmakers rushing production when unable to get the actors they want: [...] "If you want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law, wait !"). Subsequently, a defensive Sean Penn took the stage to present and said, [...] "In answer to our host's question, Jude Law is one of our finest young actors." [...] (At the time, Penn and Law were shooting All the King's Men.) Law was not the only actor that Rock poked fun at that evening, however—he turned the joke on himself at one point, saying, [...] "If you want Denzel [...] and all you can get is me, wait!" [...] Older Oscar officials were reportedly displeased with Rock's performance, which did not elevate ratings for the ceremony. Rock was also criticized for referring to the Oscars as [...] "idiotic", and asserting that heterosexual men do not watch them, in an interview prior to <b>Oscar</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
