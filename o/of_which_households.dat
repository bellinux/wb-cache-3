The TP load to GB waters {{was estimated to be}} 60 kt yr(- 1), <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>households</b> contributed 73, agriculture contributed 20, industry contributed 3, and 4 came from background sources. The SRP load to GB waters was estimated to be 47 kt yr(- 1), <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>households</b> contributed 78, agriculture contributed 13, industry contributed 4, and 6 came from background Sources. The 'average' area-normalized TP and SRP loads to GB waters approximated 2. 4 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1) and 1. 8 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1), respectively. A consideration of uncertainties in the data contributing to these estimates suggested that the TP load to GB waters might lie between 33 and 68 kt yr(- 1), with agriculture contributing between 10 and 28 of the TP load. These estimates are consistent with recent appraisals of annual TP and SRP loads to GB coastal waters and area-normalized TP loads from their catchments. Estimates of the contributions of RBDs to these P loads were consistent with the geographical distribution of P concentrations in GB rivers and recent assessments of surface waters at risk from P Pollution...|$|E

30|$|At {{the time}} of {{disasters}} and soon after, people largely count on their kinship networks, mutual aid, self-help groups and indigenous organizations secure help and support (Haines et al., 1996; Aldrich, 2012). However, as the frequency and severity of co-variate shocks such as flooding increases, the role of social networks begins to wane. This process {{came out in the}} FGDs where participants have mentioned the severity of flooding in recent years as the main obstacle for relying less on kinship networks and neighbors. Moreover, flooding has affected the majority people in neighboring villages so much so {{that it was impossible to}} rely on kinship networks. For instance, one key informant explained that since the heavy flooding of 2006, the frequency and severity of floods are increasing in all villages as a result <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>households</b> have to “rely on relief grains to sustain their lives”. This opinion was also verified by data obtained from the District Agriculture and Development Office that showed an increase in relief grain recipients.|$|E

The data set is a panel of youth age 20 - 33 for the years 1985 - 90. Our methods differ from most prior studies in many ways including consideration of possible sample selection bias, a richer model of the stochastic error structure, better measurement <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>households</b> are bound by borrowing constraints, and a fuller consideration of the endogeneity of wealth and income. Once all changes are implemented, we find ownership tendencies to be quite sensitive to economic variables. Specifically, potential earnings, the relative cost of owning a home, and especially borrowing constraints affect the tendency to own a home. In our sample of youth, 37 % of households are constrained even after choosing their loan-to-value ratio to minimize {{the impact of the}} separate wealth and income requirements. The constraints reduce the probability of ownership of these households by 10 to 20 percentage points (a third to a half) depending on the particular characteristics of the household. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the question}} <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>households</b> {{opt out of}} public education in a multi-community economy with local school finance and housing markets. In particular, {{the objective is to}} investigate whether perfect income stratification across public and private educational sectors predicted by single jurisdiction models and by multiple jurisdiction ones without housing markets holds in this setting. Nechyba (1999) has shown that the existence of a fixed stock of heterogeneous houses can prevent perfect income stratification from arising in equilibrium. Here we demonstrate that, even with homogeneous housing, perfect income stratification is not assured. On the contrary, it is possible to find equilibria in which households from intermediate income intervals use private schools, while richer ones prefer to send their youths to a local public school of higher quality. The emergence of very high quality public schools that attract students from the best-off households and survive the competition of private schools is therefore possible. The paper identifies a new way whereby housing markets affect how the market for education works. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is presentation of household expenditures and analysis of changes in their level and structure in the years from 1998 to 2002 in Poland. Income {{was chosen as the}} basic classification criterion, on the basis <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>households</b> were broken down into ten groups according to the consecutive deciles of income per person in the given household. This paper is a continuation (obviously, in a much narrower scope) of the research, the results of which were published in the book: Analysis of income and expenditures of the population [cf. Podolec (2000) ]. One of the objectives set by the author was to identify the current directions in behaviour of social and economic groups of the population in the scope of income shape and expenditures. This shaping was analysed for the period (1990 — 1997) in which Poland faced dynamic changes in the social and economic system, which was reflected in the results of the analyses made. This paper refers to the period, in which dynamics of transformations in social and economic structures was definitely weaker against {{the first years of the}} transformation; yet we can still observe trends in the household income and expenditures structure shaping, which originated in the first years of the transformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the determinants of international remittances at a household and community level. It analyses both the determinants <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>households</b> that receives remittances {{and the amount of}} remittances received. The dataset used for the analysis is provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Mexico and contains more than 25 000 observations. OLS regression analyses with heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors have been used to analyze the data. Evidence from the analysis suggests that the poorest households are more likely to receive remittances from abroad, while the richest households on average receive a higher amount of remittances. The same relationship is found between agricultural land property and remittances; households with less land have a higher probability of receiving remittances, but they receive on average less than the richer households. No evidence of a migration hump is found. The fact that migrants from wealthier households are inclined to remit more money suggests that Mexican migrants primarily are motivated to remit based on their own self‐interest. However, there is not enough evidence to know this for certain. Additionally, the investigation finds several other significant relationships between household and community variables, and the probability of receiving remittances. Meanwhile factors affecting the amount of remittances received by the households are few; apart from total income and agricultural land property, the age of the head of households is the only variable with a significant impact...|$|E

40|$|In Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe a {{substantial}} share of bank deposits are denominated in foreign currency. Deposit euroization poses key challenges for monetary policy and financial sector supervision. On the one hand, it limits {{the effectiveness of}} monetary policy interventions. On the other hand, it increases financial sector fragility by exposing banks to currency risk or currency-induced credit risk. Policymakers disagree on whether {{countries in the region}} should tackle deposit euroization with ‘dedollarization' policies or should rather strive to adopt the Euro as their legal tender. Assessing the potential effectiveness of ‘dedollarization' policies requires a clear understanding <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>households</b> hold foreign currency deposits and why they do so. On the basis of survey data covering 16, 375 households in ten countries in 2011 and 2012, we provide a comprehensive household-level analysis of deposit euroization in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. We examine how households' preferences for, and holding of, foreign currency deposits are related to individual expectations about monetary conditions and network effects. We also examine to what extent monetary expectations and deposit euroization are the legacy of past financial crises or the outflow of current policies and institutions in the region. Our findings suggest that deposit euroization in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe can be partly tackled by prudent monetary and economic decisions by today's policymakers. The preferences of households for Euro deposits are partly driven by their distrust in the stability of their domestic currency, which in turn is related to their assessment of current policies and institutions. However, our findings also suggest that a stable monetary policy may not be sufficient to deal with the hysteresis of deposit euroization across the region. First, we confirm that the holding of foreign currency deposits has become a ‘habit' in the region. Second, we find that deposit euroization is still strongly influenced by households' experiences of financial crises in the 1990 s. Our findings question the effectiveness of supply side interventions (e. g. bank regulation) or demand side interventions (e. g. local currency capital market development) in de-euroizing household savings. First, we show that deposit euroization is largely demand driven. Second, we show that households already have access to a broad range of savings products in local currenc...|$|E
40|$|In Africa, AIDS affects {{everyone}} in the community. When I was working on HIV/AIDS in Tanzania in 1999, I found myself talking to district administrators and farmers in terms <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>households</b> are afflicted, which households are affected and which households are not affected. One farmer kindly told me 'Here there is no household that is not affected. Afflicted and affected. Your third category does not exist. ' Some people claim that AIDS is now more an urban problem than a rural one, but the actual rate of prevalence in any area depends on the local context. In fact, in Africa and other developing countries, you cannot make the urban-rural distinction, because of the constant movement of people. Town people go home to the village at special times of the year, rural people work in towns, and nowadays there is yet more movement because of more funerals {{and the fact that}} when people are very ill, they go home. Remember, relatively few people in Africa die in towns. We all want to be buried near to our forefathers - back to the roots. Deadening impact on agriculture The impact of AIDS can be counted in terms of calories per head, and food security {{is going to be more}} precarious. Because of AIDS, farming systems suffer labour shortage and bottlenecks; these cause shortages of food both for consumption and for sale. If you don t have labour you cannot grow crops that take a long time to mature, like banana (one year) or coffee (five years). You had better grow cassava or sweet potatoes which takes six months and has quick returns. The overriding need for many families is to fill the stomach, care for relatives and take in orphans. For such families, the level of livelihood has gone down. In Rwanda, genocide and AIDS mean that there are more than 11, 000 households headed by children below the age of 11. The biggest threat is that with so many non-socialised children you cannot expect that wars in Africa are going to stop. Some will drift off to be soldiers, or to the cities to be street children, but even for those who stay in rural areas, life will be precarious. They are not being prepared to be farmers. At best they will perhaps be quasi-farmers, disconnected from the land, if they have not sold it. There is no handing-down of knowledge and skills. Schools could have played a very useful role, but in north-western Tanzania, for example, school attendance levels have dropped from 100 % to 30 % because there is no-one to send children to school, to buy books, to pay school fees, and no-one to be the teacher. And when casual labour gives instant earnings, instead of the need to wait for income from farming, which will a young person choose? Disease and risk We have to understand the forces which are driving the epidemic, or rather pandemic now that it is global. Some people present AIDS as a disease in terms of microbes; many people blame its spread on commercial sex workers and loose sexual behaviour. It s not that simple. There are considerations of family and survival. Last year, in Mwanza, Tanzania, a farmer told me: 'My son, here AIDS is not about the virus, it is about food. This is a very dry area. Rains come three months every year. By April, the place is dry, our harvest is in the stores. By end of August, rice stores have run out and you have families without food. So if I have a teenage girl and she goes out and comes back with a kilo of rice, I will not ask. ' It is also a question of risk. People living in comfort perceive risk in terms of the future, tomorrow, the year after, ten years, twenty years it s theoretical because you know that you have something to live for. But talk about AIDS to a commercial sex worker, driven to her work by desperation, and she will say that hunger tonight is a greater risk to her and her children than AIDS, perhaps, after 5 years. Less poverty, less disease As Louis Pasteur said 'The microbe is nothing, the terrain is everything'. That Africa is the poorest continent and that Africa is facing the biggest epidemic of AIDS surely tells us something about the relationship between poverty and the disease. Instead of condemning the alleged promiscuity of our youth, who say their behaviour is only a symptom of the absence of development, we need to make sure that AIDS prevention and poverty alleviation go hand in hand. So yes, more public awareness even though we know that 95 % of people in Tanzania today are aware of AIDS. And, yes, let us help our agricultural extension workers to know and explain more about AIDS, as well as early planting. And, yes, give us institutions and policies which admit to the problem and plan their preparedness. To combat AIDS is not only to change behaviour but also to work on food security and issues like land. Without the security of livelihood, we are going to keep the problem. In Africa, AIDS {{affects everyone}} in the community.
