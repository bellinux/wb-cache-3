5|$|A {{memorial}} at St Magnus' Cathedral {{in nearby}} Kirkwall displays a plaque dedicated {{to those who}} lost their lives, beneath which a book of remembrance lists their names. This list of names was not released by the Government until 40 years after the sinking. Each week a page <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> turned. The ship's bell was recovered in the 1970s and, after being restored, {{was added to the}} memorial in St Magnus'.

5|$|D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's {{most famous}} work, On Growth and Form {{was written in}} Dundee, mostly in 1915, but {{publication}} was put off until 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson's many late alterations to the text. The central theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism {{as an alternative to}} natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.|$|E
5|$|Phil England {{writes in}} The Ecologist that the {{strength}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> the rigour {{of the research}} and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers {{who want to get}} a broader picture of this aspect: Jim Hoggan’s Climate Cover-Up, George Monbiot’s Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning and Ross Gelbspan’s The Heat is On and Boiling Point. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{emphasised}} in {{the section}} on vegetables, {{in which there are}} five aubergine recipes and only one potato dish (pommes Anna). Dishes from Greece and North Africa are included along with typical southern French standards such as tomates provençales. The occasional non-Mediterranean dish is included, including cèpes à la bordelaise (fried in olive oil with parsley and garlic).|$|E

50|$|Jason Shen {{reviewed}} <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> {{issuing a}} strong recommendation to readers to buy it. According to Shen, <b>the</b> best part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> idea that successful startups are based around secrets, whereas <b>the</b> worst part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>was</b> Thiel's favoring startups {{that have a}} grand plan upfront.|$|R

5|$|The Sermons, a {{political}} treatise composed {{in the guise}} of sermons, went almost unnoticed by contemporaries. In the Sermons, Skarga discusses what he sees as the problems of the ailing Commonwealth: lack of patriotism, internal quarrels, tolerance of heretics, the king's relative powerlessness, perverse laws (a critique of the nobility's Golden Freedoms), and immorality. Another notable aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> its focus on the desperate plight of the serfs (the peasants).|$|E
5|$|The actual authorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> unclear. The second Dutch {{edition of}} the book carried the text 'Op last van den staatssekretaris der Z.A.R., F.W. Reitz' ('By order of the State Secretary of the S.A.R., F.W. Reitz'). J.C. Smuts is {{indicated}} as author, but probably only edited the introduction {{and the end of}} the book, in co-operation with E. J. P. Jorissen. The rest of the text was probably prepared by J. de Villiers Roos.|$|E
5|$|The book is {{structured}} into two sections. The first portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{critical of the}} aviation industry and the U.S. government agencies tasked with inspecting it. The second portion of the book addresses consumers and potential airline passengers. The book became successful shortly after publication. It reached number 10 on the New York Times Best Seller list and number 9 on a Chicago Tribune list of bestsellers in early April 1997. Most reviews of the book in media publications were positive. Some individuals within the airline industry claimed the book contained factual inaccuracies, and this was investigated {{as part of a}} class project at George Washington University.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} in English on 14 February 2014 by Jonathan Cape. Its first publication, however, was in September 2013 as a Danish translation. Although the manuscript was in English, it was translated and published first in Denmark. On 23 October 2014, the book was translated into Finnish. The Polish translation came on 7 October 2015. In addition, a Norwegian translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> planned.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire body}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{arranged}} as a dictionary from Aberdevine ('Vide Siskin.) on page 58 (the pages are however not numbered in the original) to Yelper ('Vide Avoset.) on page 687. Since the book {{does not have}} a continuous narrative to summarise, the account here will use one species as a running example to illustrate the book's approach. The cirl bunting is chosen because it was discovered by Montagu and is associated in Britain with his home town of Kingsbridge, Devon. He also chose the species for the colour frontispiece of the book.|$|E
5|$|The first portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> a {{critique}} of deficiencies in safety practices by the Federal Aviation Administration and United States Department of Transportation, and the inherent problems with the closeness between these agencies and the airline industry. The book is an exposé of what Schiavo saw as fraud, corruption, waste, mismanagement, and dangerous negligence in the aviation industry and the FAA as a crusader for flight safety. Her primary criticisms in the book focus on the FAA's reluctance to address its many shortcomings, while expressing her concern {{that there was a}} fundamental conflict of interest between the FAA job of oversight and the FAA job of promoting aviation.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} sonic {{weapon was}} one which had been unsuccessfully pioneered by German {{scientists}} {{under the control of}} Albert Speer during World War II. A book that Tintin examines in Professor Topolino's house, German Research in World War II by Leslie E. Simon– a retired Major General in the US Army– really existed and was published in 1947. In the strip, Hergé preserved the English language title of the book rather than translating it into French, although altered the book's cover design to remove a prominent swastika. The inclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> one of the few instances that there is any reference to the Second World War within The Adventures of Tintin.|$|E
5|$|The last 145 pages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{addressed}} to passengers, {{to help them}} determine which airlines have good safety records and how to better ensure safe travel while flying. Schiavo discusses the average ages of certain airline fleets, reveals the accident rates of the major airline carriers, safety ratings at national airlines, bomb detection rates at U.S. airports, and provides a list of airports where power failures have affected the effectiveness of control towers. She concludes {{with a list of}} recommendations for how individuals can effect change at government agencies including the FAA, and how to address concerns of conflict of interest between air safety and inspection and the airline industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} four short stories by different writers and artists from the computer game and comic industries.

5|$|Despite the obstacles, {{readers and}} {{commentators}} {{have reached a}} broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, {{and their three children}} Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text La Scienza Nuova ("The New Science"), upon which they argue Finnegans Wake is structured.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{frequently}} quarrelled {{with fellow}} inventors and engineering peers over steam {{technology in the}} mid-1800s. His increasing frustration led to his premature publication {{of what he had}} hoped would be the equivalent of his earlier manual for millers—the petulantly titled The Abortion of the Young Steam Engineer's Guide. The Steam Engineer's Guide was significantly shorter than this first book and less structured in its approach. A third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> devoted to an ongoing argument between Evans and John Stevens (another prominent steam engineer of the day), much of which had previously appeared in the journal The Medical Repository and to which now Evans added various additional criticisms of Stevens' contentions. Evans concludes his book by renouncing inventing and any further work on his designs, complaining of the ingratitude of the public and the unprofitability of the endeavour, although this would prove to be just one of many such assertions by Evans over the coming years. Regardless, the Steam Engineer's Guide proved to be a popular work, though not on the same scale as his guide to milling, however it was the first book in the United States to make accessible to anyone ideas and techniques for steam engineering.|$|E
