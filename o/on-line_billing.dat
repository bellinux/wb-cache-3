50|$|Electronic tolling {{proposals}} that represented the shadow price of {{electronic toll collection}} (instead of the TSC) may have misled decision makers. Consumers have additionally endured an increased administrative burden associated with paying toll bills and navigating toll collection company <b>on-line</b> <b>billing</b> systems. Additionally, visitors to a region may incur e-toll tag fees imposed by their rental car company. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 identified and attempted to address a similar problem associated with the government collection of information. Approvals were to be secured by government agencies before promulgating a paper form, website, survey or electronic submission that will impose an information collection burden on the general public. However, the act did not anticipate and thus address the consumer burden associated with funding infrastructure via electronic toll collection instead of through more traditional forms of taxation.|$|E

40|$|It is {{predicted}} {{that by the}} year 2000, U. S. cellular carriers will invest billions of dollars for cellular billing and customer care. Two of the most desirable attributes of the cellular billing systems are the flexibility of upgrade and ability to inform the billing experts quickly about the status of the system to minimize any possible fraud and improve customer service. Although the second attribute can be realized by reporting the billing customer record in real time, this tends to congest the signaling channel, which is not desirable. In this paper, we propose several schemes for the provision of a quick billing status report which maintains low-signaling traffic. The performance of these schemes is derived analytically. We expect that these results may provide a guideline for the future design of <b>on-line</b> <b>billing</b> systems in personal communication services (PCS's) networks...|$|E
40|$|SUNRISE is a data {{architecture}} for the usage and billing information management {{in a telephone}} network. Its aim is to provide real-time rating and information services, in addition to <b>on-line</b> <b>billing</b> services. The SUNRISE system {{is based on the}} chronicle data model [JMS 94] that provides for summary information to be maintained about the calling patterns of each customer. A logically integrated view is maintained of the customer profiles managed by different business units or service providers. The summary information and a portion of the customer profile information permanently resides in a main memory storage system (such as the Dali system [JLR + 94] or the HP Smallbase system). A wide range of queries can be answered in real-time using the summary information and the customer profiles. Such queries can also be asked by a telephone switch during call set-up. More complex queries are supported by an on-line call detail database. Billing can be provided by programs that access the ca [...] ...|$|E

We also show how an ISO Formal Description Technique (LOTOS) is used to specify and validate the system. Key words: network management, security, telecommunications, Web. 1...|$|R
5000|$|In that capacity, he {{established}} a website that included <b>on-line</b> tax <b>bills</b> and the first on-line automobile registration and property tax payment plan in Texas. Under his management, the number of taxing jurisdictions served by the Assessor's office increased from forty-four to sixty-five. He kept the same $25 million budget throughout his decade in office. Bettencourt is known as [...] "The Tax Man" [...] for his work as Assessor-Collector and his push to lower property tax rates. Bettencourt was elected in 1998 as the first ever Republican Tax Assessor-Collector in Harris County's history, serving ten years in total. By 2000, his Voter Registration Department had scrubbed the voter rolls of then 50,000 deceased and felon voter registrations, of which 500 actually had someone still voting in 1994, 1996, and 1998 elections. In 2002, Bettencourt's office released an audit of the 2001 City of Houston elections showing 2,098 people voting illegally in those elections. While automating voter registration procedures, Bettencourt won reelection in 2000, 2004, and 2008, and set the highest record vote total, 607,085, in a contested major party race of any Republican office holder to date for Harris County in 2004.|$|R

Email, <b>on-line</b> banking, paying <b>bills</b> and news and weather updates {{are the most common}} uses of the internet by Australians this year, according to research by ACMA. Report 6 in a series on telecommunications examines consumer adoption of the internet and the impact this is having on the growth of the digital economy in Australia. With 73 per cent of Australian households now having access to the internet, the report found that, overall, household internet users are accessing the internet more frequently, with an increasing number recording ?heavy? use (8 or more times per week). The use of the internet for online purchases is extensive. Just over half (54 per cent) of those accessing the internet in the quarter ending March 2008 bought a product online, an increase of 8 per cent from 2006. ?One of the main changes to consumer behaviour {{as a result of the}} internet is the willingness of consumers to engage in commerce online,? said Chris Chapman, ACMA Chairman. ?Paying bills, airline ticket purchases and accommodation bookings have become some of the most popular activities on the internet. ?The internet has also become a significant social medium with the majority of internet users nominating email and socialising as activities they perform online. Changes to social interaction have been identified with a large number of internet users participating and using social networking sites, instant messaging, blogs and VoIP as communication tools. ? Internet users report a reduction in their use of traditional forms of media for entertainment and information activities - such as watching television, listening to the radio and reading magazines and newspapers. The internet has enabled users to engage in viewing and listening activities online by streaming or downloading videos, podcasts, music and television. The report is the sixth and final in ACMA?s Telecommunication Today series on consumer use of communication services, and is available on ACMA?s website...|$|R
40|$|The informatisation of {{the public}} sector – called {{e-government}} – has also important repercussions for legal teaching. In e-government, law will also be transposed using process models. This new form of legal practise has to be taught in the law school. Standard information technology, workflow systems, electronic documents and electronic signatures constitute new subjects of legal teaching. The example of the application e-law (electronic law-making) in Austria illustrates the change. This system will fundamentally reform this work process of the Austrian legislative process. Its goals are speeding-up legislation and making it more efficient and transparent. The idea is to create one continuous paperless electronic workflow from the first draft of a law until to its publication. Documents can be handled and processed electronically through the whole legislative process. Authorised users can get information on drafts or submit proposals or amendments <b>on-line.</b> Furthermore, the <b>bills</b> can be easily forwarded to the parliament for deliberation and approval. Finally these texts will be officially published in authentic version in an electronic Federal Law Gazette online. The project is still in its test phase but the present results are very promising for a successful roll-out besides some practical difficulties...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to develop an on-line banking system that {{provides}} customers with the facility to check their accounts and do transactions on-line, using Short Message Service (SMS). The system will provide all the bank's facilities to its customers once their authentications [PIN No] match, including viewing account balance information, performing fund transfers, giving the customer an option of changing PIN no, and paying <b>bills</b> <b>on-line.</b> The current banking system puts the customer into great inconvenience specially by the requirements of his essential physical presence in the banking hall, to execute his transactions. The search for a more convenient operational process is envisage {{in order to make}} the customer's task easier an acceptable. The widely used mobile 'phone and its Short Message Service is made use of in order to achieve our desired goal. The new system will be a partnership between bank and the customer where the input is by a coded text message, and the output is received in a similar manner. The process will depend on the particular request of the customer. The phone sends an SMS which is processed through the GSM provider and fed into the SMS provider via the SUNTEL switch. The SMS server translates it into a bank understandable message and then directs the message to the appropriate server. The message server on receiving the request takes appropriate step to effect the particular operation. When compared to the existing system, there are many advantages of this new service. These are, simple and secure, convenient, anytime, anywhere, value added, cheaper and faster, technologically up-to-date, DIY (Do-it-yourself) banking. This new system will enable automation of some of the functions, thus conceiving an efficient, reliable, speedy and cost effective operational model for the NSB...|$|R
