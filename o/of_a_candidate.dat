On 24 August, however, the party's deputy leader Éamon Ó Cuív told Raidió na Gaeltachta that he believed the party should put forward a candidate.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{argued that}} the {{sections}} of the Act dealing with disputation by petition encompassed any question {{about the validity of}} an election, including the eligibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate,</b> and that the sections should be interpreted broadly. Sue made a similar argument, saying that the sections allowing disputes by petition and the sections allowing disputes by the relevant house of Parliament were not mutually exclusive and that elections could be disputed by either the Parliament or the people.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidate}} that wins {{the election and}} assumes office is eventual President of South Korea Cho Myung-ho (Lee Jung-gil). His administration begins with his undertaking the grand task of forwarding talks of reunification between the North and South after witnessing the grim reality that is the struggle between the two nations.

40|$|Economic {{models of}} {{politics}} typically use the expected value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate's</b> vote share to proxy electoral probability. In this paper, the authors introduce a risk calculation {{to augment the}} evaluation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate's</b> (or party's) expected vote share and they divide this risk element into its systematic and unsystematic components. For {{the same reason that}} systematic risk is <b>a</b> primary focus <b>of</b> portfolio management, the authors discover that an analogous systematic risk component is central to presidential elections. Their approach accounts for correlations in vote swings among states, piercing the fiction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> state-by-state or 'local' campaign strategy. Copyright 1993 by MIT Press. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{court was}} unwilling to extend the {{traditional}} defence of qualified privilege as it was {{of the opinion that}} Parliament's intention in enacting section 14 was clear: it is wholly untenable that the speech made at an election rally is privileged when the same speech published by or on behalf <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> for the election is not.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case.

She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate,</b> as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel's {{eligibility}} for office was challenged {{on the basis}} of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election. The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> is different from residency for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's eligibility.|$|E

Montalto was allied with the Spanish and had previously backed Tolomeo Gallio. After Medici's election, Avila revealed that Philip III had excluded Medici as well, and protested so loudly {{that he could be}} heard on the street. The cardinals who had elected Medici answered that protesting the election <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> was useless once the person was elected pope. Upon his election, Medici took the name Leo XI in honour of his great-uncle Leo X. His election made Leo the fourth cardinal to be elected pope that had been created by Sixtus V in his consistory in 1583.|$|E

Some states provide for the placing in {{nomination}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> to receive the electoral votes (the candidate for president of the political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> for president. In New Jersey, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in North Carolina, the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the work}} of Downs (1957), spatial models of {{elections}} have been <b>a</b> mainstay <b>of</b> research in political science and public choice. Despite the plethora of theoretical and empirical research involving spatial models, researchers have not considered in great detail {{the complexity of the}} decision task that <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> confronts. Two facets <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate’s</b> decision process are investigated here, using <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> laboratory experiments where subjects face a fixed incumbent in a two-dimensional policy space. First, we analyze the effect that the complexity of the electoral landscape has on the ability of the subject to defeat the incumbent. Second, we analyze the impact that a subject’s “mental model” (which we infer from a pre-experiment questionnaire) has on her performance. The experimental results suggest that the complexity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate’s</b> decision task and her perception of the task may be important factors in electoral competition.
