5|$|In the match, Zimbabwe batted first, and {{the public}} at the ground were not aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest</b> until the 22nd over, when Flower came out to bat wearing a black armband. Olonga was also seen wearing a black armband on the Zimbabwe team balcony. The crowd of 4,000 at the ground were {{supportive}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest,</b> {{and a number of}} them made their own black armbands during the match. In the match itself, Flower scored 39, as Zimbabwe reached 340/2, and Olonga took 0/8 in 3 overs, as Zimbabwe won a rain-affected match by 86 runs (D/L method).|$|E

5|$|On 31 August 2006, over 600 people {{attended}} {{a protest against}} the high carbon emissions. It was coordinated by the Camp for Climate Action group. At least 3,000 police officers from 12 forces {{were reported to have}} been drafted in for the duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest,</b> to safeguard electricity supplies and prevent the protesters from shutting the station down. Thirty-nine people were arrested after trying illegally {{to gain access to the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|Abdulwahab Hussain {{was also}} a member of Al Wefaq who {{resigned}} in 2005. Unlike Mushaima and al-Singace, Hussain left politics in 2005. He returned in 2009 when he co-founded Al Wafa' opposition group and became its official spokesperson. He played a bigger role in the uprising; he was not arrested when the uprising began nor was he outside the country. Hussain led the first demonstration in the uprising {{in the early hours of}} 14 February. He is also credited with suggesting autonomous action and total decentralization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest</b> movement which was adopted by February 14 Youth Coalition, the group behind the call for an uprising in order to avoid getting infiltrated by government.|$|E

5|$|Although often {{assumed to}} be a debate of recent origins, local Washington, D.C. {{newspapers}} have published news items on the controversy many times since at least 1971, all in response to Native American individuals or organizations asking for the name to be changed. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, prompting numerous Native Americans to write letters to Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke; others boycotted Redskins products and protested, but Cooke rejected the possibility of change. There was a protest of about 2,000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills; the American Indian Movement's (AIM) Vernon Bellecourt {{was one of the main}} organizers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among {{the mass}} protests that {{occurred}} {{at that time}} were the winter 1981 general strike in Bielsko-Biała, the nationwide warning strike {{in the spring of}} that year and hunger demonstrations in summer. The warning strike took place {{in the aftermath of the}} Bydgoszcz events (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention. Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, at the price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest</b> movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.|$|E
5|$|Each man was {{subsequently}} released August 10 on $3,000 bail. The charge of murder was later amended to manslaughter by {{the grand jury}} indictment. The trial was convened November 26 under Judge Harding, with the widow of Patrick Langan, one of those slain on August 1, named as prosecutor. Of the 20 subpoenaed by the prosecution to {{bear witness to the}} peaceful nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest,</b> only six appeared to testify. Three admitted to seeing violence committed by the mob prior to the shooting. Many more testified on behalf of the accused.|$|E

5|$|Enrollment levels {{held steady}} into the Great Depression; but in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} convert the school into a mental health institution. Students, faculty and administrators organized with the Bowling Green community to counter the proposal. The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protest</b> Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the school would be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote. A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and {{changed its name to}} Bowling Green State University.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest,</b> the JNA {{increased}} combat readiness of its garrison in Split {{and elsewhere in}} Dalmatia and withdrew a part of artillery and personnel from Split to its bases located away from the coast. Furthermore, the Military-Maritime District of the JNA ordered its garrisons to stock up potable water and prepare power generators for use if the supply of electricity were cut. The JNA evacuated itself from Split by 4 January 1992, pursuant to agreements ending the Battle of the Barracks.|$|E
5|$|Saturday (2005) is a {{novel by}} Ian McEwan set in Fitzrovia, London, on Saturday, 15 February 2003, as a large {{demonstration}} is taking place against the United States' 2003 invasion of Iraq. The protagonist, Henry Perowne, a 48-year-old neurosurgeon, has planned a series of chores and pleasures culminating in a family dinner in the evening. As he goes about his day, he ponders the meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest</b> and the problems that inspired it; however, the day is disrupted by an encounter with a violent, troubled man.|$|E

5|$|The Irascibles or Irascible 18 {{were the}} labels {{given to a}} group of American {{abstract}} artists who put name to an open letter, written in 1950, to the president of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, rejecting the museum's exhibition American Painting Today - 1950 and boycotting the accompanying competition. The subsequent media coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest</b> and a now iconic group photograph, that appeared in Life magazine, gave them notoriety, popularised the term Abstract Expressionist and established them as the so-called first generation of the putative movement.|$|E
5|$|The march {{ended in}} a picket {{in front of the}} Banovina building, where the JNA had its {{headquarters}} in Split at the time. The protesters demanded an end to the JNA-imposed blockade of the village of Kijevo. Scuffles broke {{out in front of the}} building, and a JNA soldier was killed by a gunshot reportedly fired from the crowd. Four organisers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest</b> were arrested a month later by the JNA, tried in a military court and convicted. They were released months later in a prisoner exchange. The protest caused the JNA to withdraw a portion of military equipment previously based in Split to more secure locations and increase its combat readiness there. The blockade of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations days after the protest.|$|E
5|$|The protests {{reached a}} new level of {{visibility}} during 1993 as part of a grassroots campaign where protesters came from outside the area to support local opposition to the road. The initial focus was on the removal of a tree on George Green, east of Wanstead, that attracted the attention of local, then national media. The activity peaked in 1994 with several high-profile protesters setting up micronations on property scheduled for demolition, most notably on Claremont Road in Leyton. The final stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest</b> was a single building on Fillebrook Road in Leytonstone, which, due to a security blunder, became occupied by squatters.|$|E

Members of several disability groups picketed before the premiere, protesting at the portrayal of mental retardation shown in the film. The groups revealed {{that it was the}} first time that they had ever protested together at an event. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest,</b> the normally unobstructed views of the red carpet leading to the premiere were blocked off by 10-foot (3-m)-high fences and there was an increase in the number of security personnel present. No protests were held at the United Kingdom's September premiere.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the band}} members grew up together: Dama, Dadah and Bekoto were playmates and {{attended}} the same primary school; during their secondary school studies, Dadah's older brother Nono likewise became {{a close friend of}} Raoul, the older brother of Dama. The high school offered a music program in which Dadah, Nono, Charle, Bekoto and Fafa participated together, with Fafa as a vocalist and Bekoto as a pianist. Beginning in 1970, Raoul became enamored with the acoustic guitar. He met frequently with Dadah and Nono to play together using guitars he constructed from wood and bicycle brake cables available at a workshop attached to a center for the deaf and blind where his father worked; the trio began performing at school parties and events. As teens, the trio often listened to a radio show hosted by popular Malagasy journalist and ethnomusicologist Latimer Rangers, who recorded, broadcast and promoted contemporary and traditional music from villages across Madagascar. Rangers also broadcast foreign artists who were relatively unknown to the Malagasy public, such as Bob Dylan, described the meaning and history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>protest</b> song and other foreign genres, and drew connections between Malagasy musical styles and American Blues music, South African music and other genres.|$|E
