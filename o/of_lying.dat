40|$|In {{this work}} {{we deal with}} {{coverings}} and actions <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> group- groupoids being a sort <b>of</b> the structured <b>Lie</b> groupoids. Firstly, we define an action <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> group-groupoid on some Lie group and the smooth coverings <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> group-groupoids. Later, we show the equivalence of the category of smooth actions <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> group-groupoids on Lie groups and the category of smooth cov- erings <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> group-groupoids. Further, we prove a theorem which denotes how is obtained a covering Lie group-groupoid and a smooth covering morphism <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> group-groupoids from a Lie group-groupoid.

50|$|The mapping from Lie {{groups to}} Lie algebras is functorial, which implies that homomorphisms <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups lift to homomorphisms <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras, and various {{properties}} are satisfied by this lifting: it commutes with composition, it maps Lie subgroups, kernels, quotients and cokernels <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups to subalgebras, kernels, quotients and cokernels <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras, respectively.|$|R
5|$|After thirty-four hours <b>of</b> <b>lying</b> in state, {{the doors}} of the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E
5|$|In the present, when Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange {{tries to}} {{convince}} them that Blonde planned to kill them and steal the diamonds for himself. Eddie kills Nash and accuses Orange <b>of</b> <b>lying,</b> since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news that the police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint. Eddie points his own weapon at White, creating a Mexican standoff. All three shoot; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are wounded.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner's secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner's body was so damaged by the fall {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly night watchman and a private investigator describe the events they saw that evening. A police inspector testifies to finding a suicide note. Faulkner's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner's marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner's courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out of turn to accuse Nancy Lee <b>of</b> <b>lying.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{notion is}} closely related to that of a {{representation}} <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> group. Roughly speaking, the representations <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras are the differentiated form <b>of</b> representations <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups, while the representations of the universal cover <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> group are the integrated form of the representations <b>of</b> its <b>Lie</b> algebra.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{demonstrate}} that the notions of derivative representation <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> algebra on a vector bundle, of semi-linear representation <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> group on a vector bundle, and related concepts, may {{be understood in terms}} <b>of</b> representations <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebroids and Lie groupoids, and we indicate how these notions extend to derivative representations <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebroids and semi-linear representations <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groupoids in general...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Non-abelian {{homology}} <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras with coefficients in Lie algebras {{is constructed}} and studied, generalising the classical Chevalley-Eilenberg homology <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras. The relation of cyclic homology with Milnor cyclic homology of non-commutative associative algebras is established {{in terms of}} the long exact non-abelian homology sequence <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras. Some explicit formulas for the second and the third non-abelian homology <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras are obtained. Using the generalised notion <b>of</b> the <b>Lie</b> algebra <b>of</b> derivations, we introduce the second non-abelian cohomology <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras with coefficients in crossed modules and extend the seven-term exact non-abelian cohomology sequence of Guin to nine-term exact sequence...|$|R
5|$|Boone informs Locke he {{is tired}} <b>of</b> <b>lying,</b> {{and wants to}} tell Shannon about the hatch. Locke knocks him {{unconscious}} with the handle of his knife, and Boone awakes to find himself tied up. Locke applies a strange paste on Boone's head wound and leaves a knife embedded in {{the ground in front}} of Boone so he'll be able to free himself. Locke explains that he will be able to reach it once he is properly motivated. After several unsuccessful attempts to do so, Boone hears Shannon's screams and the sounds of the 'monster' approaching. This is the impetus he needs, and after a short struggle, and in excruciating pain, he is finally able to reach the weapon. He then frees himself and searches for his sister.|$|E
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) {{starts a}} {{campaign}} against Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), her main rival in the election for congress. When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her <b>of</b> <b>lying,</b> Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When the presidential candidates make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport he says is too often used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit {{so that he could}} have something important to put on his college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make up, and go to work on Kurt's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Fey's {{projects}} after 2008 {{include a}} voice {{role in the}} English-language version of the Japanese animated film Ponyo. In 2009, she appeared in The Invention <b>of</b> <b>Lying,</b> alongside Ricky Gervais, Jennifer Garner, Rob Lowe, and Christopher Guest. Her next film role was in Shawn Levy's 2010 comedy Date Night, a feature that focuses on a married couple, played by Fey and Steve Carell, who go on a date; however, the night goes awry for the two. Also in the same year, she voiced Roxanne Ritchie, a television reporter, in the DreamWorks animated film Megamind (2010). With a total worldwide gross of US$321million, Megamind is Fey's most commercially successful picture to date. It earned US$173million outside the U.S. and US$148million domestically.|$|E
40|$|In this survey, {{we report}} {{on the state of the}} art of some of the {{fundamental}} problems in the <b>Lie</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups modeled on locally convex spaces, such as integrability <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras, integrability <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> subalgebras to Lie subgroups, and integrability <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebra extensions to Lie group extensions. We further describe how regularity or local exponentiality <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> group can be used to obtain quite satisfying answers to some of the fundamental problems. These results are illustrated by specialization to some specific classes <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups, such as direct limit groups, linear <b>Lie</b> groups, groups <b>of</b> smooth maps and groups of diffeomorphisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how central {{extensions}} <b>of</b> (possibly infinite-dimensional) <b>Lie</b> algebras integrate to central extensions <b>of</b> eÃÅtale <b>Lie</b> 2 -groups. In finite dimensions, central extensions <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras integrate to central extensions <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups, a fact which is due to the vanishing of pi 2 for each finite-dimensional Lie group. This fact was used by Cartan (in a slightly other guise) to construct the simply connected Lie group associated to each finite-dimensional Lie algebra. In infinite dimensions, there is an obstruction for a central extension <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras to integrate to a central extension <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups. This obstruction comes from non-trivial pi 2 for general Lie groups. We show that this obstruction may be overcome by integrating central extensions <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> algebras not to Lie groups but to central extensions <b>of</b> eÃÅtale <b>Lie</b> 2 -groups. As an application, we obtain a generalization <b>of</b> <b>Lie‚Äôs</b> Third Theorem to infinite-dimensional Lie algebras...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the theory}} <b>of</b> <b>Lie</b> groups, the {{exponential}} map is a map from the <b>Lie</b> algebra [...] <b>of</b> a <b>Lie</b> group [...] to the group, which {{allows one to}} recapture the local group structure from the Lie algebra.

5|$|In early October 2006, Baird's {{department}} reviewed a promised $200 {{million grant}} to the City of Ottawa's light-rail expansion {{project for the}} O-Train. Baird indicated {{that the government would}} keep the funding at least until the November election, but added that the Council elected in November would have the final say on the issue. He also leaked details of the city's contact with the German firm Siemens. As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome. Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another <b>of</b> <b>lying</b> about details of the project, and Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird's decision to release details of the private contract. Chiarelli was defeated in the election and the light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example <b>of</b> <b>lying</b> as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the final Arsenal and Chelsea {{submitted}} claims for wrongful dismissal of Adebayor and Mikel, respectively, to The Football Association (FA). The FA denied both appeals and clarified their penalties. Ebou√© was charged with violent conduct for striking Bridge, whereas Adebayor was charged for his behaviour after being sent off. Both players were suspended for three matches ‚Äì one less than Mikel. Arsenal and Chelsea were charged with misconduct concerning their inability to control their players and were fined ¬£100,000 each. Wenger criticised the FA's treatment of his players and accused the linesman <b>of</b> <b>lying</b> in his account of Adebayor's actions. This led to an investigation where Wenger was found guilty; he was later fined ¬£2,500 and censured by the FA.|$|E

5|$|Uxbridge Football Club was {{provided}} {{with the use of}} the station stadium from 1923 and played evening matches there. Ten barrack blocks designed by A. Gilpin were built around the parade ground in 1925, as was the RAF officers' hospital and the original Operations Room, controlled by the Fighting Area of Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB). The Air Ministry chose RAF Uxbridge as the new base for ADGB on 14 January 1926 owing to its proximity to Whitehall. The site had the added advantage <b>of</b> <b>lying</b> on the fringes of London and therefore difficult for an enemy to locate and bomb. Having also housed a gymnasium, the lecture hall building became the station cinema in 1927, initially for the use of station personnel only but soon opened to the general public. On 1 March 1929, the headquarters of the Observer Corps was established at Hillingdon House; Air Commodore Edward Masterman was appointed its first commandant. The Observer Corps remained at RAF Uxbridge until 1 March 1936, when it transferred to RAF Bentley Priory.|$|E
5|$|Kate tells Erin about Rhys' plan, but he convinces Erin that Kate is {{a jealous}} ex-girlfriend who is lying. Erin {{believes}} {{him and they}} have dinner together. Rhys pours wine on her shirt sleeve and at the hospital, he implies to Karl that Erin has a drinking problem. She quits the surgical program and Rhys asks Jessica if he can take her place. Karl realises he has been used and Rhys takes him to visit Elaine, {{to try to make}} him understand what getting on the program means to him. Elaine reveals she has spinal degeneration and Karl remarks that Rhys cannot help her. Rhys explains that he wants to help the next person to develop the condition. Rhys sits an exam on the material he has missed and Jessica allows him join the surgical program. Rhys makes a bet with Kate that he can seduce Jade, but when he goes to kiss her, Jade rejects him. Rhys' mother asks if she can visit him and Rhys tells her he is working over Easter. When they run into Jade and Kyle, Rhys does not introduce them to Elaine and she accuses him of being ashamed of her. Rhys then takes Elaine to meet Martin, who reveals he failed his surgical program interview. Elaine accuses him <b>of</b> <b>lying</b> to her and being like his father. Rhys denies this and Elaine tells him to fix things with the people he has hurt.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains a {{temporary}} worker Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) {{so that she}} can take her place when she goes on maternity leave. In the break room, the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office. Pam, being well into her pregnancy, is sensitive about her looks and so becomes offended by their discussion. Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is, if anything, more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality and pregnant women cannot be sexually attractive, and accuses the others <b>of</b> <b>lying</b> to spare Pam's feelings. Troubled by Dwight's comments, Pam asks her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he finds the new temp attractive. Not wanting to upset his wife, Jim tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive, even objectively. Though Jim gives no sign of unease, Pam is convinced that he is lying to her, and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove it. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam's replacement attractive, Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test {{in the form of a}} retail store's blood pressure tester. At the conclusion of the interview, Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim said he does not find the new temp attractive, but as Jim continues to insist he is telling the truth Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question, including Jim's name. Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure, which his father also suffers from, and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband's health.|$|E

Mercedes tells her family to choose between her and Theresa, and when they side with Theresa, Mercedes moves out. When Carmel's ring disappears from her body, the McQueen family accuse Mercedes of {{stealing}} it and ban her from Carmel's funeral. Mercedes turns up to the funeral drunk and hurls abuse at her family where Myra tells her that she wishes she had died instead of Carmel and Mercedes leaves the funeral, planning to leave the village. However, Mercedes is stabbed by an unknown assailant. After the funeral, Porsche McQueen (Twinnie Lee Moore) eventually owns up to stealing Carmel's ring and the family go to find Mercedes to apologise, only to discover she is missing.
