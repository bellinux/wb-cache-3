50|$|This type {{of engine}} still has tappet noise even after adjustment. This noise is said {{to come from the}} cams due to {{incorrect}} valve setup (when setting valve clearance each cylinder must be set to TDC) or from age and use of incorrect <b>oil</b> <b>grade.</b> The correct <b>oil</b> <b>grade</b> is 5W-30 semi synthetic oil. Another reason is the large tappet clearance on the exhaust valve. This could of course be reduced to lower the noise level but the engine would then suffer from a rough idle and usually stalled.|$|E

Therefore, an important advantage of the proposed technology is to obtain mineral fuel products as an output. The technologies of high-temperature processing are based on thermal decomposition of waste without oxygen at high temperature.

Absorption coefficient showed limited potential and only distinguished (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) the 20 W- 50 grade from the other two grades in the 1. 7 - 2. 0 THz range. Refractive index data demonstrated relatively flat and consistently spaced curves for the three <b>oil</b> <b>grades.</b> ANOVA results confirmed a highly significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) in refractive index among each of the three oils across the 0. 5 - 2. 0 THz range.

Samples of SS- 304 stainless steel have been heated in a muffle furnace in desired temperature and allowed to dwell for two hours. The heated specimen are then cooled in different media namely inside the furnace, open air, cutting grade <b>oil</b> (<b>grade</b> 44) and water at room temperature to obtain different grades of heat treatment. Microstructures and corresponding micro hardness of the samples have been measured along with Feritscopic studies. Wear characteristics have been studied in a multi tribo-tester (Ducom) in dry sliding condition against EN- 8 steel roller. Speed, load on job and duration of test run have been considered as the experimental parameters. The wear of the samples have been obtained directly from ‘Winducom 2006 ’ software. Mass loss of the samples before and after operation has also been considered as the measure of wear in the present study.

40|$|A {{finite element}} (FE) {{analysis}} {{is made for}} steady-state two-dimensional forward extrusion with three different extrusion ratio values. Predicting extrusion force of aluminum billet extruded with palm oil lubricant will definitely be helpful in deciding the right extrusion ratio. Hence, the finite element method was applied to investigate the influence of extrusion ratio on palm oil lubricant. The extrusion ratios evaluated were 1. 5, 2, and 3. The reference {{of the study was}} in accordance to the experiment results of 0. 1 mg paraffinic mineral <b>oil</b> <b>grade</b> 95 (Pr 95) with kinematic viscosity of 90. 12 mm 2 /s at 40 °C for the extrusion ratio of 3. The result was found to be reliable once the FE model was validated by the established work. The extrusion force for each extrusion ratio was described and evaluated. The FE analysis also accounts for plasticity material flow and equivalent plastic strains in the deformation region. The analysis agreed that the extrusion ratio of 1. 5 reduced the extrusion force compared to the extrusion ratio of 2 and 3. This was confirmed by the plotted equivalent plastic strain deformation which shows that the high value of equivalent plastic strain near the extrusion die surface was decreased. As a result, the extrusion force becomes greater with the increasing of extrusion ratio...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{establishes}} {{the feasibility of}} microwave heating for extracting oil from Oil Sands in ex-situ processes. Previous studies in this area have shown some potential, but have not characterised the dielectric properties of the Oil Sands used, nor related them to the mineral composition, {{both of which are}} vital if successful scale up is to be achieved. In this work the fundamental interactions of microwave energy with Oil Sands are investigated and understood for the first time, and the material characterisation related to microwave heating and oil extraction studies is carried out. It is shown that microwave heating is not feasible for extracting <b>oil</b> from High <b>Grade</b> <b>Oil</b> Sands due to their very low water content (< 0. 5 %), and consequently their low dielectric loss factor. Low <b>Grade</b> <b>Oil</b> Sands can be processed, with bitumen recoveries in excess of 50 % shown in this work, and energy requirements around 200 kWh/tonne. Low Grade sands contain significant clay fines and have a higher water content (∼ 5 %). This water is bound within the clay minerals, and allows temperatures in excess of 300 °C to be achieved during processing. The presence of hydrated clay minerals (predominantly kaolinite) is the key characteristic that makes Low <b>Grade</b> <b>Oil</b> Sands amenable to microwave heating. The clay minerals present in the Low <b>Grade</b> <b>Oil</b> Sands make them undesirable for conventional processing, and this study shows that microwave heating could provide a dry-processing route for recovery of bitumen from clay-containing feedstocks...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to adapt the classical spot/futures relationship stemming from the theory of storage to the case of the North Sea crude oil market. Brent (and other North Sea crude <b>oil</b> <b>grades)</b> is waterborne and these logistical issues mean that a true spot market for Brent does not exist. As a result, the dated Brent (BFO) price, one of the most widely quoted ‘spot’ crude oil marker prices in the world, is in reality a short-term forward contract price. A new arbitrage relationship is constructed to take account of this and a new formulation for the convenience yield is calculated. Comparison is made with the classical convenience yield in the light of historic price behaviour in both Brent (BFO) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) markets...|$|R

For seven different <b>oil</b> <b>grades,</b> entrainment rate and initial droplet size distribution were investigated using a plunging jet apparatus with coupled camera equipment and subsequent image analysis. We found that amount of oil entrained is proportional to layer thickness and largely independent of oil properties: A dispersant dose of 1 : 200 did not result in a significantly different entrainment rate compared to no dispersants. Oil viscosity had a minor to no influence on entrainment rate, until a certain threshold above which entrainment was impeded. The mean droplet size scales with the modified Weber number as described by Johansen. The obtained results can help improve dispersion algorithms in oil spill fate and transport models, to aid making an informed decision about application of dispersants. </p...|$|R
