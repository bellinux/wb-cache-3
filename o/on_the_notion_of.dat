5|$|On 3 September 1939, Britain {{declared}} war when its ultimatum for Germany {{to withdraw from}} Poland expired. Because the Statute of Westminster {{had not yet been}} ratified by the Australian parliament, any declaration of war by the UK applied to Australia by default. In some other Commonwealth Dominions, such as South Africa and Canada, there were intense parliamentary debates before the declaration of war was accepted. Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies asked the British government to notify Germany that Australia was an associate of the United Kingdom. Menzies' support for the war was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> an imperial defence system, upon which he believed Australia relied and which would be destroyed if the UK was defeated. This position was generally accepted by the Australian public, although there was little enthusiasm for war.|$|E

Also the infant has the experience of negotiating their relationship with their mother. For the second half the mother discusses her observations and experiences.|$|E

Through the development of clear principles based on the human security concept, there has been a step forward in the development of clear rules of when humanitarian intervention can occur and the obligations of states that intervene in the internal disputes of a state.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{the coming}} into effect of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1985 saw {{a shift in the}} gay rights {{movement}} in Canada, as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies. Premised on Charter protections and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> the immutability of homosexuality, judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights, including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same-sex marriage. It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety, dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals, its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change.|$|E

While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple peristyle form. When he used the “triumphal arch” motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than {{on a large scale}} as Alberti used it at Sant’Andrea’s. This Ancient Roman motif {{is often referred to as}} the Palladian Arch.|$|E

25|$|The game BioShock Infinite {{is heavily}} based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> American exceptionalism {{at the turn}} of the 19th century, and {{incorporates}} notions taken from Christianity to support the game's dystopian themes. One aspect of this was the use of baptism. One developer on Irrational Games staff expressed strong concern to the lead developer, Ken Levine, that the game's presentation of baptism was highly controversial, leading Levine to with the developer to recast the baptism aspect as a notion of forgiveness rather than a religious tenet. At least one player objected to the final changes, prompting them to request a refund from Steam. The scene was otherwise well received by critics as less a commentary on Christianity but on as a representation of themes such as free will, evil, rebirth and redemption that were central to the game.|$|E
25|$|Sela's early {{important}} work was his solution in mid-1990s of the isomorphism problem for torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups. The machinery of group actions on real trees, developed by Eliyahu Rips, {{played a key}} role in Sela's approach. The solution of the isomorphism problem also relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> canonical representatives for elements of hyperbolic groups, introduced by Rips and Sela in a joint 1995 paper. The machinery of the canonical representatives allowed Rips and Sela to prove algorithmic solvability of finite systems of equations in torsion-free hyperbolic groups, by reducing the problem to solving equations in free groups where the Makanin-Razborov algorithm can be applied. The technique of canonical representatives was later generalized by Dahmani to the case of relatively hyperbolic groups and {{played a key role}} in the solution of the isomorphism problem for toral relatively hyprbolic groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{rumor that}} Swedlund was {{replaced}} by an Air Force officer sometimes arises given that the Ministry of Defense chose to prioritize new aircraft over nuclear weapons. Some {{have pointed out that}} the increase in flexibility was likely due to replacing Swedlund with somebody new, as his successor did not have a strong opinion one way or the other. In the 1965 report, the Commander-in-Chief took another step away from assuming a nuclear armed Sweden. Although they were still advocating for Swedish nuclear weapons in general terms, they were no longer emphasized in defense planning. They felt that there was an imminent risk that Swedish nuclear possession would be prohibited {{as a result of the}} ongoing disarmament negotiations. The report also looked favorably <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> defending Sweden with modern conventional forces as they now embraced the Margin Doctrine. The Margin Doctrine assumed that an invasion of Sweden would not occur in isolation, but rather as a part of a major conflict; in such a situation, a large power (e.g. the USSR) would be unlikely to deploy its full military forces against Sweden.|$|E

25|$|Interested in the {{definition}} of number, Russell studied the work of George Boole, Georg Cantor, and Augustus De Morgan. Materials in the Bertrand Russell Archives at McMaster University include notes of his reading in algebraic logic by Charles Sanders Peirce and Ernst Schröder. In 1900 he attended the first International Congress of Philosophy in Paris, where he became familiar with the work of the Italian mathematician, Giuseppe Peano. He mastered Peano's new symbolism and his set of axioms for arithmetic. Peano defined logically all of the terms of these axioms with the exception of 0, number, successor, and the singular term, the, which were the primitives of his system. Russell took it upon himself to find logical definitions for each of these. Between 1897 and 1903 he published several articles applying Peano's notation to the classical Boole-Schröder algebra of relations, among them <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Notion</b> <b>of</b> Order, Sur la logique des relations avec les applications à la théorie des séries, and On Cardinal Numbers. He became convinced that the foundations of mathematics could be derived within what has since come to be called higher-order logic which in turn he believed to include some form of unrestricted comprehension axiom.|$|E
