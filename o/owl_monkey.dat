2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, several groups began {{exploring}} {{the impact of}} interfering with [...] on cortical map reorganization. Michael Merzenich, Jon Kaas and Doug Rasmusson were some of those researchers. They found that if the cortical map is deprived of its input, it activates {{at a later time}} in response to other, usually adjacent inputs. Their findings have been since corroborated and extended by many research groups. Merzenich's (1984) study involved the mapping of <b>owl</b> <b>monkey</b> hands before and after amputation of the third digit. Before amputation, there were five distinct areas, one corresponding to each digit of the experimental hand. Sixty-two days following amputation of the third digit, the area in the cortical map formerly occupied by that digit had been invaded by the previously adjacent second and fourth digit zones. The areas representing digit one and five are not located directly beside the area representing digit three, so these regions remained, for the most part, unchanged following amputation. This study demonstrates that only those regions that border a certain area invade it to alter the cortical map. In the somatic sensory system, in which this phenomenon has been most thoroughly investigated, JT Wall and J Xu have traced the mechanisms underlying this plasticity. Re-organization is not cortically emergent, but occurs at every level in the processing hierarchy; [...] this produces the map changes observed in the cerebral cortex.|$|E

40|$|Cardiac {{hypertrophy}} is {{a common}} postmortem finding in <b>owl</b> <b>monkeys.</b> In most cases the animals do not exhibit clinical signs until the disease is advanced, making antemortem diagnosis of subclinical disease difficult and treatment unrewarding. We obtained echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and thoracic radiographs from members of a colony of <b>owl</b> <b>monkeys</b> that previously was identified as showing a 40 % incidence of gross myocardial hypertrophy at necropsy, to assess the usefulness of these modalities for antemortem diagnosis. No single modality was sufficiently sensitive and specific to detect all monkeys with cardiac hypertrophy. Electrocardiography was the least sensitive method for detecting <b>owl</b> <b>monkeys</b> with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Thoracic radiographs were more sensitive than was electrocardiography in this context but cannot detect animals with concentric hypertrophy without an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography was the most sensitive method for identifying cardiac hypertrophy in <b>owl</b> <b>monkeys.</b> The most useful parameters suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy in our <b>owl</b> <b>monkeys</b> were an increased average left ventricular wall thickness to chamber radius ratio and an increased calculated left ventricular myocardial mass. Parameters suggestive of dilative cardiomyopathy were an increased average left ventricular myocardial mass and a decreased average ratio of left ventricular free wall thickness to left ventricular chamber radius. When all 4 noninvasive diagnostic modalities (physical examination, echocardiography, electrocardiography, and thoracic radiography) were used concurrently, the probability of detecting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in <b>owl</b> <b>monkeys</b> was increased greatly...|$|R

5000|$|Azara's night monkeys {{are another}} species {{that proved to}} be monogamous. In an 18-year study {{conducted}} by the University of Pennsylvania, these monkeys proved to be entirely monogamous, exhibiting no genetic information or visual information that could lead to the assumption that extra pair copulation was occurring. This explained the question as to why the male <b>owl</b> <b>monkey</b> invested so much time in protecting and raising their own offspring.

40|$|This study {{offers a}} {{detailed}} description of natal dispersal patterns in <b>owl</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Aotus azarai) and evaluates the extent and characteristics of sex-biased dispersal in this monoga-mous mammal. <b>Owl</b> <b>monkeys</b> are small, territorial primates that live in socially monogamous groups in the Argentinean Chaco. Between 1997 and 2007 we recorded the disappearance or dispersal of 102 individuals born in 24 social groups. All individuals, both males and females, left their natal group, and they did so when they were between 2. 2 and 4. 9 years of age. Most dispersal events occurred immediately before or during the birth season and very few of them occurred during the mating season. Males and females did not differ significantly in the tim-ing of dispersal, the age when they dispersed or how far they dispersed. Dispersals during the harsher Fall/Winter season were associated with the eviction of one or both adults in the group. The limited data on the fate of dispersed individuals suggests that natal dispersal is a highly risk event in the life of <b>owl</b> <b>monkeys.</b> The data also provide adequate support for the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis for natal dispersal in this species...|$|R

40|$|Vaccination {{of animals}} against malaria parasites {{is thought to}} induce two basic {{immunological}} responses: (i) specific recognition of parasite antigens by the host, and (ii) a generalized immune enhancement due {{to the presence of}} adjuvant. Immunological techniques were used in this study to monitor cellular and humoral immune changes in <b>owl</b> <b>monkeys</b> prior to and following immunization with a vaccine consisting of merozoite-enriched schizonts of Plasmodium falciparum and one of three adjuvants: N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (muramyl dipeptide), Freund's complete adjuvant, or 6 -O-stearoyl-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine. The results showed that most of the immunized animals responded specifically to malarial antigens as demonstrated by the fact that peripheral blood lymphocytes underwent blast transformation in vitro in the presence of parasite antigens and that substantial antibody titres were produced as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. By use of the in vitro inhibition test, it was found that sera from immunized <b>owl</b> <b>monkeys</b> collected after challenge greatly inhibited merozoite reinvasion. Generalized nonspecific immune responses observed in <b>owl</b> <b>monkeys</b> following vaccination included {{an increase in the number}} of white blood cells and the proportion of T and B cells in the peripheral blood.

They maintained that the monophyly of the Antillean monkeys was still supported in the most parsimonious trees, but in slightly less parsimonious trees, Aotus does appear to be linked with Xenothrix.
