Wilson wrote to Lord Loch (27 September 1910) “we can comfort <b>ourselves</b> <b>with</b> the reflexion {{that to be}} abused by Repington is the highest praise an honest man can get”.|$|E

500|$|The {{expiration}} of Wordsworth's Alfoxton House lease soon {{provided an}} opportunity for the two friends to live together. They conceived a plan to settle in Germany with Dorothy and Coleridge's wife, Sara, [...] "to pass the two ensuing years in order to acquire the German language, and to furnish <b>ourselves</b> <b>with</b> a tolerable stock of information in natural science". In September 1798, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Dorothy travelled to Germany to explore proximate living arrangements, but this proved difficult. Although they lived together in Hamburg for a short time, the city was too expensive for their budgets. Coleridge soon found accommodations in the town of Ratzeburg in Schleswig-Holstein, which was less expensive but still socially vibrant. The impoverished Wordsworth, however, could neither afford to follow Coleridge nor provide for himself and his sister in Hamburg; the siblings instead moved to moderately priced accommodations in Goslar in Lower Saxony, Germany.|$|E

The critic from The Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a [...] "tale to make the reader laugh and cry– to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable... a dainty dish to set before a King." [...] William Makepeace Thackeray, writing in Fraser's Magazine, described the book as [...] "a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, 'God bless him!'" ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within <b>ourselves,</b> <b>with</b> this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E
500|$|When night {{began to}} fall, we climbed into our boats and floated down the Danube and crossed {{over to the}} other side several miles below the place where Vlad's army was stationed. There we dug {{ourselves}} trenches, so that cavalry could not harm us. After that we crossed back {{over to the other}} side and transported other janissaries over the Danube, and when the entire infantry had crossed over, then we prepared and set out gradually against Vlad's army, together with the artillery and other equipment that we had brought with us. Having halted, we set up the cannon, but not in time to stop three hundred janissaries from being killed ... Seeing that our side was greatly weakening, we defended <b>ourselves</b> <b>with</b> the 120 guns which we had brought over and fired so often that we repelled the prince's army and greatly strengthened our position ...

500|$|Aware of the {{potential}} for controversy, Liszt wrote, [...] "The barometer is hardly set on praise for me at the moment. I expect quite a hard downpour of rain when the symphonic poems appear." [...] Joseph Joachim, who in his time in Weimar had found Liszt's workshop rehearsals and the trial-and-error process practiced in them to be wearisome, was dismayed at what he considered their lack of creativity. Vienna music critic Eduard Hanslick found even the term [...] "Sinfonische Dichtung" [...] contradictory and offensive; he wrote against them with vehemence after he had heard only one, Les préludes. Surgeon Theodor Billroth, who was also a musical friend of Brahms, wrote of them, [...] "This morning [...] and Kirchner played the Symphonic Poems (sic) of Liszt on two pianos ... music of hell, and can't even be called musictoilet paper music! I finally vetoed Liszt on medical grounds and we purged <b>ourselves</b> <b>with</b> Brahms's [...] G Major String Sextet."

500|$|Because [...] "radical, body-altering" [...] {{surgery on}} a long-running {{character}} {{would cause the}} production team ongoing problems with continuity, {{it was decided that}} Peggy would have a [...] "less visible" [...] lumpectomy, rather than a mastectomy. A member of the EastEnders production team explained: [...] "We have to think about costume and what it's going to look like afterwards and what we're lumbering <b>ourselves</b> <b>with</b> [...] you have to think of that for a long-term character." [...] Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases. However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the [...] "all-clear" [...] at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction. It has been reported that Peggy was the first soap opera character to undergo a mastectomy. BBC Production chief executive Matthew Bannister praised Windsor's portrayal of Peggy coming to terms with a mastectomy, commenting: [...] "It's brought a good deal of comfort and help to us {{and a lot of other}} people." ...|$|E

The strategy failed {{as many of the}} businesses NWG invested in lost money, leaving the band facing tax rates potentially as high as 83 percent. [...] "We made Dark Side and it looked as if we'd cracked it," [...] recalled Waters. [...] "Then suddenly these bastards had stolen it all. It looked as if we might be faced with huge tax bills for the money that had been lost. Eighty-three per cent {{was a lot of money}} in those days and we didn't have it."

500|$|There was a noted {{effort on}} the part of Corps staff and other Transylvanian exiles (Ion Agârbiceanu, Laurian Gabor, Octavian Tăslăuanu etc.) to {{encourage}} the rapid integration of Podil-formed units into the Romanian line of defense. After a quick session of retraining, the Corps units were attached to the 11th Division, which was recovering in Iași. It was, however, decided that the formations, particularly those from Transylvania, were to be kept distinguished from the rest under the common command structure. An official act of 1918 explained the rationale behind this act: [...] "Transylvanians should fight as Transylvanians [...] against the Hungarian state, so as to assert, clearly and beyond all doubt, that the Romanian nationals of the Hungarian state do not recognize its authority. To have fought against Hungary, however the war may end, ought to have been a badge of honor for the Romanian nation in Hungary and a moral reinforcement during the battles to come". When it was proposed that men from the Corps be assigned noms de guerre so as to avoid execution if captured, Deleu reacted strongly: [...] "We intend to be the army of Transylvania! We aim to be the conscience of Transylvania, which is for absolute freedom and The Union! We do not want [...] a conquered land, we wish to liberate <b>ourselves</b> <b>with</b> our own forces! Hangings? Let them hang us! But let them be aware that Transylvania herself is fighting for liberty and The Union!" ...|$|E

500|$|As the Cold War set in, the {{alliance}} with the Communists became increasingly damaging for the RDA. The French colonial administration showed itself increasingly hostile toward the RDA and its president, whom the administration called a [...] "Stalinist". Tensions reached their height {{at the beginning of}} 1950, when, following an outbreak of anti-colonial violence, almost the entire PDCI leadership was arrested; Houphouët-Boigny managed to slip away shortly before police arrived at his house. Although Houphouët-Boigny would have been saved by his parliamentary immunity, his missed arrest was popularly attributed to his influence and his prestige. In the ensuing chaos, riots broke out in Côte d'Ivoire; the most significant of which was a clash with the police at Dimbokro in which 13 Africans were killed and 50 wounded. According to official figures, by 1951 a total of 52 Africans had been killed, several hundred wounded and around 3,000 arrested (numbers which, according to an opinion reported by journalist Ronald Segal in African Profiles, are certainly underestimated). In order to defuse the crisis, Prime Minister René Pleven entrusted the France's Minister for Overseas Territories, François Mitterrand, with the task of detaching the RDA from the PCF, and in fact an official alliance between the RDA and Mitterrand's party, the UDSR, was established in 1952. Knowing he was at an impasse, in October 1950, Houphouët-Boigny agreed to break the Communist alliance. Asked in an undated interview why he worked with the communists, Houphouët-Boigny replied: [...] "I, a bourgeois landowner, I would preach the class struggle? That is why we aligned <b>ourselves</b> <b>with</b> the Communist Party, without joining it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film {{any more than a}} man could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of her little sister is sweetly innocent. We saw this film twice, on the day of release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands that lesson to our children's children. Had we space we could tell the comments of men and women on this production. One thing may be said and that is, all saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, with <b>ourselves,</b> <b>with</b> one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful because they make nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E
500|$|The {{return of}} a wife after 18years results in Michael Henchard's {{downfall}} in Thomas Hardy's novel Mayor of Casterbridge (1886). [...] A bad-tempered, impulsive and cruel husband, feeling burdened by his wife, Henchard sells her to a stranger for five guineas. [...] He becomes a successful businessman and rises {{to the position of}} mayor, but the return of his wife many years later prompts his fall back into penury. [...] The custom was also referred to in the 19th-century French play, Le Marché de Londres. Commenting on the drama and contemporary French attitudes on the custom, in 1846 the writer Angus B. Reach complained: [...] "They reckon up a long and visionary list of our failings [...] would as readily give up their belief in the geographical and physical existence of London, as in the astounding fact that in England a husband sells his wife exactly as he sells his horse or his dog." [...] Such complaints were still commonplace nearly 20years later; in The Book of Days (1864), author Robert Chambers wrote about a case of wife selling in 1832, and noted that [...] "the occasional instances of wife-sale, while remarked by <b>ourselves</b> <b>with</b> little beyond a passing smile, have made a deep impression on our continental neighbours, [...] constantly cite it as an evidence of our low civilisation." [...] Embarrassed by the practice, a legal handbook of 1853 enabled English judges to dismiss wife selling as a myth: [...] "It is a vulgar error that a husband can get rid of his wife by selling her in the open market with a halter round her neck. Such an act on his part would be severely punished by the local magistrate." [...] Originally published in 1869, Burn's Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer states that [...] "publicly selling or buying a wife is clearly an indictable offence... And many prosecutions against husbands for selling, and others for buying, have recently been sustained, and imprisonment for six months inflicted".|$|E
