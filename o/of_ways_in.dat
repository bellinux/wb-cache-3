In shorter competition cricket, a batsman receives a 'free hit' on the ball after any kind of No ball (see below). This means the batsman can freely hit one ball with no danger of being out in most ways.|$|E

25|$|The term {{aperiodic}} {{has been}} used in a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> the mathematical literature on tilings (and in other mathematical fields as well, such as dynamical systems or graph theory, with altogether different meanings). With respect to tilings the term aperiodic was sometimes used synonymously with the term non-periodic. A non-periodic tiling is simply one that is not fixed by any non-trivial translation. Sometimes the term described - implicitly or explicitly - a tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles. Frequently the term aperiodic was just used vaguely to describe the structures under consideration, referring to physical aperiodic solids, namely quasicrystals, or to something non-periodic with some kind of global order.|$|E
25|$|Current {{estimates}} {{state that}} 2 million hospital patients {{are affected by}} adverse drug reactions every year and adverse drug events are the fourth leading cause of death. These adverse drug reactions result in an estimated economic cost of $136 billion per year. Polymorphisms (genetic variations) in individuals effect drug metabolism and therefore an individual's response to a medication. Examples <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which genetics may affect an individual’s response to drugs include: drug transporters, metabolism and drug interactions. Pharmacogenetics {{may be used in}} the near future by public health practitioners to determine the best candidates for certain drugs, thereby reducing much of the guesswork in prescribing drugs. Such actions have the potential to improve the effectiveness of treatments and reduce adverse drug events.|$|E
