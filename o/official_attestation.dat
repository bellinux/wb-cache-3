40|$|Increasing {{quantities}} of radioactively contaminated and activated metallic residues {{can be expected}} to be treated and disposed off due to decommissioning of nuclear installations and site remediation. In view of the high disposal costs and the anticipated long intermediate storage time maximum volume reduction of radioactive waste is one of the key-notes. For more than 10 years Siempelkamp's CARLA melting plant in Krefeld has successfully demonstrated the recycling of slightly radioactively contaminated scrap. Re-use has been represented by manufacture of high-quality waste containers and shielding equipment made of ductile cast iron. In the last few years a supplementary recycling path has been developed in order to involve the potential of scrap with high chromium and/or nickel content. The process is based on a special granulating technique and the substitution of the hematite (iron ore) portion of heavy concrete shieldings. For <b>official</b> <b>attestation</b> of the granule concrete shieldings all necessary tests for type A/IP II container approval have been successfully performed according to the IAEA requirements. Furthermore, different versions of such containers have been qualified for their usage in German repositories...|$|E

40|$|In Belgium, on 10 {{millions}} of inhabitants, {{there are more}} than 31. 000 divorces per year and we estimate that 600. 000 children are experiencing separation of their parents. The general practitioner (GP) have inevitably the responsability of the medical follow-up of some of these children. The possible professional implications related to these young patients, concerning the GP have never been the subject of a study so far. Consequently the aim of this research was to reveal {{what is happening in the}} daily practice of the family practitioner related with the children of separete parents. There were some hypothesis notably about particular working conditions for the GP in connection with possible consequences for these children and possible necessity of special professional attitudes. A qualitative research in focus group was organized with GPs in order to get an interaction between the participants and to go past the concepts supposed before the study. Therefore between September and December 04, 8 focus groups of 10 - 18 generalist practitioners were set up in Brussels and Mons. Each meeting was axed around couples separated for less than 3 years and children between 0 and 15 years. Finally, 120 GPs discussed about 242 cases of divorces from their practice. The debates totally typed word by word were analysed with assistance of the software QSR N 5. The point of view of the GPs is: 1) A divorce affects the working conditions of the general practitioner, for example the parcelling out of the medical follow-up of the child and the fact " of being used" by the family. 2) The conflict between the parents after the separation increases the difficulties for the GP in his daily practice. 3) The parental's separation influences the choice of professional attitudes of the GP, notably vis-a-vis the conflict (for instance to try or not to try the conflict's management). 4) Mainly in conflict situation, parental divorce is a risk for the child; psychological or behavioural disorders, physical health problems, school difficulties, 5) Certain professional attitudes of the general practitioner can influence positively the evolution of these children, for example to speak to the two parents. 6) Some professional actions aggravate the situation of the these children, for instance to product certain <b>official</b> written documents (<b>attestations,</b> reports, certificats,) in a conflicts context. In conclusion, this study desmonstrates that parental separation affects the medical follow-up of the children by the GPs and that professional attitudes influences positively or negatively the child's evolution. For the first time, some negative consequences of the divorce on children are described in the first line. All this results must be confirmed by quantitative research work.
