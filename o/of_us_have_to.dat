When Liz asks why Jack is taking a bus to Washington he replies [...] "ever since these buffoons from Detroit took private planes the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put on a show," [...] a reference to controversial travel methods by several CEOs {{en route to a}} November 19 congressional hearing. The dilemma over bailout money also bears resemblance to federal bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler. In describing how he plans to destroy Jack's image, Devon says [...] "by the time I'm done you're going to make AIG look like the Lehman Brothers of microwaves," [...] a reference to two notable corporations from the financial crisis. Devon also says that in his search for an organization more powerful than GE he selected the American government because, [...] "American Idols not on until January." ...|$|E
2500|$|That was [...] "the {{story of}} a young person going out into the world {{for the first time and}} finding the world a very {{difficult}} place indeed. That's the story that all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Skip L. Cheesboro - the {{producer}} of the American television special {{that is to be}} made about the crucifixion. He is a no-nonsense man who, in his own words, admits that [...] "some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be shallow so others can be deep." [...] He has been played by Doug Wert to Matthew Modine.|$|E

2500|$|Author Kate Lock has {{described}} Ricky as hapless and {{a figure of}} fun, [...] "completely lacking in tact and rarely opens his mouth without putting his foot in it." [...] Noting the changes his character went through in 2000, Owen said, [...] " [...] grew up over the years just as all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change. He became more sensitive and more mature." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rothenberg {{said he had}} {{not always}} planned on killing Lexa, but the fact that Debnam-Carey was {{simultaneously}} on another show (Fear the Walking Dead), and was therefore unlikely to ever become a series regular on The 100, he felt use of the character would be limited or absent in the future. This is when the writers decided to craft a death scene for her to propel the story forward. [...] "I remember as we were breaking the season, we talked about reincarnation in the Grounder world and how that was how commanders were selected. I didn't want to throw that out as nonsense, which is how Clarke had received it, but I also didn't want {{to say that it was}} real reincarnation," [...] he said, adding he had been reading The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil at the time, which [...] "talks quite a bit about a future where we'll be able to upload our minds—literally upload our consciousness—into a computer and live forever." [...] This gave Rothenberg the idea for incorporating a [...] "technological reincarnation" [...] storyline. [...] "The commander A.I. would need to be able to pass itself from person to person over time and [...] Lexa was just the most recent recipient of this artificial intelligence augmentation of her consciousness. So once we came up with that idea, that was the point at which everything jelled and sort of came together storytelling-wise," [...] he stated. [...] "And of course, if you're dealing with a story about reincarnation, you've got to die before you can be reincarnated. So Lexa dying became a very tragic necessity." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke was in love with Lexa, that they were soulmates, and Lexa's death will haunt Clarke. [...] " [...] is going to have to figure out how to compartmentalize, the way that all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do in the real world when people are suddenly and tragically taken away from us," [...] he added. [...] "That's kind of the point of The 100 in many ways. These horrible things happen and yet we still have to figure out a way to move on and be the heroes of our own stories." ...|$|E
60|$|Circumstances are the lashes laid on {{to us by}} life. Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{receive them}} with bared ivory backs, and others are {{permitted}} to keep on a coat--that is the only difference.|$|E

5000|$|Quist {{also spoke}} against {{the health care}} bill at the event.

6000|$|... 'You don't? Ay, well, I {{suppose you}} found a {{difference}} from London. You like life, and big, grand places.

6000|$|... "Glory be to God, {{the poor}} cratures!" [...] said the soft-hearted lady. [...] "It isn't much the like <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give away, Father Bernard; I needn't be telling you that. But we'll help, you know,--we'll help." ...|$|E

60|$|All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be prevaricators, hypocrites and liars {{every day}} of our lives; {{otherwise}} the social structure would fall into pieces the first day. We must act in one another's presence just as we must wear clothes. It is for the best.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the three}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> Rob Pike, got started, {{it was pure}} research.

6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} {{the story of the}} Prodigal Son?" [...] he asked. [...] "Well, that's the parable of democracy, of self-government in the individual and in society.

6000|$|... "Oh, Netta! Don't you understand? Don't {{you see the}} implications? It's a creature, half {{bird and}} half reptile, and it proves, {{absolutely}} proves, Netta, beyond the faintest possibility of a doubt, that the evolutionists are quite right--quite scientific. And if it once comes to be generally recognized, I don't know, I'm sure, what is ever to become of religion and of science.

6000|$|... "It must be {{a general}} thing, Greenly; I rather think we shall all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go aboard of le Foudroyant.

This will bring matters to a crisis at once. By letting the fore-sail fall, and setting the spanker, you might shove the ship ahead a little faster." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will," [...] said Miss Miniver, {{refusing to}} be suppressed, [...] "if some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be killed to get it."

6000|$|... "Baron," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have told}} {{you that there is}} a man in London who has set himself to solve the mystery of Barnes' death. The two people whom he would {{naturally}} suspect are Miss Fitzmaurice and myself. There is strong presumptive evidence against us, owing to my silence at the inquest, and at any moment we might either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> face this charge.

40|$|Environmental {{problems}} have become global {{problems of the}} modern world. Our planet is in danger! In modern society, people began to forget that the Earth is our common home.

2500|$|After the Lewinsky scandal broke, Barr was {{the first}} lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton's resignation.
