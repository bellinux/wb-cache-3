5|$|The {{audience}} is seated in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> {{to the left}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing desirability. While the metsuke-bashira pillar obstructs the view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, {{and that it had}} been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along the front edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading {{can be used to}} virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
50|$|Psychodrama {{has three}} {{important}} techniques: <b>the</b> technique <b>of</b> doubling, <b>the</b> technique <b>of</b> mirroring, and <b>the</b> technique <b>of</b> role reversal. Each technique represents different stages in Moreno's theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infant: <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> identity (<b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> doubling), <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self (<b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> mirroring), and <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other (<b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> role reversal). Role reversal requires {{that one has}} learned to differentiate in <b>the</b> areas <b>of</b> time, place and person, and is capable of moving {{out of his own}} position into another's position to be able to enact that other role.|$|R

5|$|A revised edition, the Nord Stage 2 {{appeared}} in September 2011, containing an improved synthesizer model and sampler functionality, {{as seen in}} the Nord Wave. The three models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stage</b> 2 are the HA-88, containing 88 fully weighted keys, the HA-76, containing 76 weighted keys, and the SW-73, containing 73 semi-weighted keys. An updated model, the Stage 2 EX, with extended memory capacity, was announced in 2015.|$|E
5|$|As an {{homage to}} the venue, the stage was {{decorated}} with roses. The multi-leveled set-up consisted of New York City fire escape routes. Other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> had a ladder reaching the mezzanine floors and a replica of an F train carriage. Gaga's wardrobe was also rose themed, with leotards, hats and jackets, and instruments adorned with red roses. The main set list for the residency encompassed songs from The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way, and Artpop. Some tracks were performed in acoustic versions.|$|E
5|$|Elevators, which operate {{differently}} {{depending on}} the hotel, enable the player to go between the five floors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> The faster a stage is cleared, the more points {{will be given to}} the player. Every stage has its own title screen via which the game can be saved. The screens are also used to enter previously played hotel stages and the map of the Mushroom Kingdom, which allows the player to access any visited hotel.|$|E
50|$|Katamari Forever {{contains}} 34 stages, {{with all}} but three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> being taken from previous titles in <b>the</b> series. Half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> take place within <b>the</b> mind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King <b>of</b> All Cosmos, who gets knocked {{in the head and}} suffers from amnesia. The levels are black-and-white in appearance, and the objective is to roll up junk to bring color back to <b>the</b> <b>stages.</b> <b>The</b> other half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> take place in the present, where RoboKing, a robotic version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King <b>of</b> All Cosmos created by the cousins, goes on a rampage and destroys all the stars in the sky.|$|R

5|$|Frank {{married into}} a family with wide {{theatrical}} connections. His wife, {{who was on the}} stage until she married, was the daughter of the actress Kate Terry, and a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> dynasty that included Ellen, Fred and Marion Terry, Mabel Terry-Lewis and Edith and Edward Gordon Craig. Frank had no theatrical ambitions and worked all his life as a stockbroker in the City of London.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{produced}} a sequel entitled Ziegfeld Girl, starring James Stewart, Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr, and Lana Turner, which recycled some film from The Great Ziegfeld. In 1946, MGM made another sequel, Ziegfeld Follies, directed by Vincente Minnelli, director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> show.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the Baldwin company gave Nelson an {{amplifier}} and a three-cord pickup electric guitar. During {{a show in}} Helotes, Texas, Nelson {{left the}} guitar on the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> and it was later stepped on by a drunk man.|$|E

They married later that year. The couple have two sons, Ronan Cal Day-Lewis (born 1998) and Cashel Blake Day-Lewis (born 2002) and divide their time between their homes in New York City and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In June 1964, {{during a}} {{performance}} at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke {{the head of his}} guitar on the low ceiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> Angered by the audience's laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of the Who's live set.|$|E
5|$|Japanese theatre styles {{have been}} applied to The Tempest. In 1988 and again in 1992 Yukio Ninagawa brought his version of The Tempest to the UK. It was staged as a {{rehearsal}} of a Noh drama, with a traditional Noh theatre at the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> but also using elements which were at odds with Noh conventions. In 1992, Minoru Fujita presented a Bunraku (Japanese puppet) version in Osaka and at the Tokyo Globe.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} characteristic of Noh stage is its independent roof that hangs over the stage even in indoor theatres. Supported by four columns, the roof symbolizes the sanctity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> with its architectural design derived from the worship pavilion (haiden) or sacred dance pavilion (kagura-den) of Shinto shrines. The roof also unifies the theatre space and defines the stage as an architectural entity.|$|E
5|$|Riders protested {{during the}} ninth stage, a criterium in Milan. This protest was {{nominally}} about the overall safety conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> and was sparked by life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before. In the protest, riders declined {{to contest the}} stage except for a final sprint finish, a decision that proved controversial with race organizers and fans.|$|E
5|$|Riders were {{required}} to sign in at checkpoints during each stage to minimize the opportunities for cheating; they were also photographed {{at the beginning and}} end of each stage, and the images compared by the judges.

5|$|Several {{versions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> {{were used}} during the tour. The first two legs of 1992 were indoors and used {{the smallest of the}} sets, which included fourVidiwalls (Philips-branded giant television screens); sixpainted Trabants suspended above the stage; 36television monitors; and a B-stage, a small remote platform connected to the main stage by a ramp. A seventh Trabant by the B-stage doubled as a DJ booth and a mirror ball.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the days}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> road {{avalanches}} and rockfalls often forced closures of the highway, {{partly due to}} the massive disturbance of the land during the road's construction. No attempt was made to remedy this until shortly after the automobile road was built. In the 1930s, as a relief project during the Great Depression, a crew from the Civilian Conservation Corps replanted the slopes around Independence, by then abandoned for two decades.|$|E
