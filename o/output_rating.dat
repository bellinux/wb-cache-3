40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Friction spinning is a relative newcomer to textile technology. It has generated great interest because of its potential for wide application of certain problems regarding the quality of yarn produced at high <b>output</b> <b>rates</b> can be solved. General acceptance of the process is hindered by uncertainty as to its capability of producing yarns of sufficient strength at speeds greater than 300 m/min. (NB: as a guide, maximum <b>output</b> <b>rates</b> of competitive technologies {{are no more than}} 150 m/min.) Friction spinning appears to have no intrinsic self-limit to its maximum <b>output</b> <b>rate,</b> unlike ring and rotor spinning which are limited by centrifugal effects leading to excessive yarn breakages. The process will therefore provide something of a quantum leap in output if acceptable yarn quality is achieved. [Continues. ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to observe the relationships between operator’s work performance (speed of filleting and actual <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> of round codfish as well as of fillets) and his physiological parameters (mean heart rate, blood pressure and product of mean heart rate and blood pressure) during codfish filleting operation, and at the same time collect sufficient data to observe the effect of factors, such as speed of filleting and size of fish on the actual <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> and percentage yield of filleting. The effect of size of round codfish filleted on mean heart <b>rate</b> and normal <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> (round fish as well as fillets) of the filleting operator was also investigated. [...] This study was carried out at a small fish processing plant. Four average skilled male filleting operators were selected with the help of plant supervisors. Each subject was asked to work at five different filleting speeds, on an individual type filleting table layout. “Head on-gut in” codfish was supplied to each operator in 75 lb. boxes. A total of about 2625 lbs. of round codfish was processed during this study. A total of 35 individual experiments were performed. The actual time of filleting each box of 75 lbs. round codfish, performance rating (speed of filleting), number of codfish/ 75 lb. box, weight of skin-on fillets, operator’s mean heart rate and blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) were recorded for each filleting experiment. [...] Within the range and scope of this study, the analysis of the results indicated following trends: [...] 1. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and mean heart rate of the operator. [...] 2. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and systolic blood pressure of the operator. [...] 3. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and product of mean heart rate and systolic blood pressure of the operator. [...] 4. Significant linear negative relationship between speed of filleting and percentage yield produced. [...] 5. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of filleting and actual <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> (round fish as well as fillets) produced. [...] 6. Significant linear positive relationship between actual <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> (round fish as well as fillets) and mean heart rate of filleting operator. [...] 7. Significant linear positive relationship between size of round fish filleted and actual <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> (round fish as well as fillets) produced. [...] 8. Significant linear positive relationship between size of round fish filleted and mean heart rate of the operator. [...] 9. Significant curvilinear positive relationship between size of round fish filleted and normal <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> (round fish as well as fillets) produced. [...] Management in fish plants could use the relationships between work performance (actual <b>output</b> <b>rate,</b> etc.) and physiological parameters (mean heart rate, etc.) to design a better method of filleting, working height and work layout etc., and therefore improve the efficiency of the plant, without causing unnecessary higher physiological loads on the operator.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the {{adenosine}} 5 '-monophosphate (AMP) bronchial challenge test, AMP {{is usually}} administered according to dosing protocols for methacholine. We investigated whether the 2 -min tidal breathing challenge test for methacholine is applicable to AMP. Parameters known to affect nebulizer output were studied. Our {{aim was to}} determine whether control of additional parameters is needed for currently standardized protocols. METHODS: The study was performed with the Sidestream nebulizer from the APS Pro Aerosol Provocation System (CareFusion Respiratory). The effects of AMP concentration, jet pressure, and suction flow <b>rate</b> on nebulizer <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> and aerosol droplet size distribution were determined. RESULTS: The volume median diameter for water increased from 5. 10 [*]μm to 8. 49 [*]μm when the jet pressure was reduced to obtain the prescribed <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 13 [*]mL/min. The <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> was increased when a suction flow rate was used to remove the aerosol. Increasing the AMP concentration resulted in smaller droplets and a lower <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> when a suction flow was applied. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of AMP concentration on nebulizer performance may result in changes in the administered dose and site of deposition of AMP at dose escalation. All of the investigated parameters influence nebulizer performance, hence the outcome of a bronchial challenge test. Therefore, these parameters should not only be specified in challenge testing, but be actively controlled as well...|$|R
