500|$|When asked {{towards the}} end of his career whether he had been stung by the {{criticism}} he had received, Stevenson replied [...] "A lot <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> are just constipated Methodists". There was no compulsory retirement age for a judge with Stevenson's length of service, which resulted in some speculation following the announcement of his retirement from the bench in 1979 that perhaps his unpopularity with certain sections of the media and establishment had led to pressure on him to step down.|$|E
500|$|Bannon did not {{outwardly}} advertise {{the fact}} that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, and one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> told me my file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. [...] "You've got to think that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, but I really think I beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know." ...|$|E

[...] "The burden rests on the shoulders <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> at the state attorney's office", Mason said, referring to proving that Casey Anthony committed a crime. Mason said that the jurors are required, whether they like it or not, to find the defendant not guilty if the state did not adequately prove its case against Casey Anthony. Mason emphasized that {{the burden of proof}} is on the state, and that Casey Anthony's decision not to testify is not an implication of guilt.|$|E
2500|$|... "CEO confidence—that look {{in their}} eyes, {{their view of}} the animal spirits—appears to be back in {{stronger}} measure than I at least have heard in some time. What then happens when CEOs go into the boardroom, as I think most <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> around the table know, is that they tend to generate some excitement by directors themselves. Directors are really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics. One CEO said to me about a week ago, 'Being a board member is starting to be fun again,' and that is not something this particular CEO, who is on a lot of large-cap boards, would have said a year ago." ...|$|E

And they for their part will not show themselves to him in the same way they show themselves to me.|$|E

2500|$|Velikovsky's {{ideas have}} been almost entirely {{rejected}} by mainstream academia (often vociferously so) and his work is generally regarded as erroneous in all its detailed conclusions. Moreover, scholars view his unorthodox methodology (for example, using comparative mythology to derive scenarios in celestial mechanics) as an unacceptable way to arrive at conclusions. Stephen Jay Gould offered a synopsis of the mainstream response to Velikovsky, writing, [...] "Velikovsky is neither crank nor charlatanalthough, to state my opinion and to quote one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues,</b> he is at least gloriously wrong... Velikovsky would rebuild the science of celestial mechanics to save the literal accuracy of ancient legends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez (Democrat, California), [...] "appalled" [...] by the {{situation}} {{created by the}} book and the four Republican endorsements, said [...] "I urge the rest <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> to join me in denouncing this witch hunt, which is clearly intended to create fear and distrust in our Capitol Hill community." [...] The book and its endorsement from the four Congressmen were denounced on the House floor by Congressman Keith Ellison (Democrat, Minnesota), the first Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress, in a speech that included a statement by the House's Tri-Caucus (consisting of about 87 House members), officially entered into the Congressional Record and broadcast on C-SPAN on October 26, 2009.|$|E

[...] Contrasting the differing fates of Deal, who won the 2010 gubernatorial election in Georgia, and former Democratic Representative Cynthia McKinney, who lost her primary after endorsing 9/11 conspiracy theories, David Weigel of Slate noted: [...] "Dipping a toe into the birtherism fever swamp didn't stop Deal from winning a statewide primary." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} earlier I'd just heard of the tragic death <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleague...</b> As I meditated on the {{fragility}} of our human frame, I was drawn once more {{to the life of}} the spirit.

The same evening of this visit to Rocamadour, I began my Litanies à la Vierge noire for female voices and organ. In that work I tried to get across the atmosphere of [...] "peasant devotion" [...] that had struck me so forcibly in that lofty chapel.|$|R

When I was contemplating writing and publishing this book, two <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> and well known Israeli journalists (Maxim Gilan and Samuel Mour) were arrested and put in jail for exposing the involvement of the Israeli secret police ... in the kidnapping in Paris of Mehdi Ben Barka ..., charged with crimes against national security and ... locked up for six months.

2500|$|On 16 August 1952, Lawrence fainted {{backstage}} {{immediately after}} finishing a Saturday matinee of The King and I. After [...] "a few days at home," [...] wrote Aldrich, she {{was admitted to}} New York-Presbyterian Hospital for tests. Doctors said she was suffering from hepatitis, and she was admitted to a room on the 16th floor. Her former son-in-law, Dr. William G. Cahan, recalled in his 1992 memoir (by then he was a globally recognised medical expert on cancer) what happened next in 1952:She was admitted to New York Hospital [...] Her doctors were puzzled by what was described in the press as [...] "a liver problem," [...] and suspected {{that she might have}} cancer. Hearing this, and without Gertrude's knowledge, her husband consulted me. Not wanting to alarm her by appearing in person (she knew, of course, that by now I was a cancer specialist), I sent some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> as consultants. They, too, were puzzled, and ordered an exploratory laparotomy (abdominal operation).|$|E
2500|$|When I was young, {{literary}} critics often rejoiced that {{the hypocrisy of}} the Victorians had been discredited, or expressed confidence that the operation would soon be complete. So far from that, it has returned in a peculiarly stifling form to take possession of critics of Eng. Lit.; Mr Pecksniff has become {{the patron saint of}} many <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleagues.</b> As so often, the deformity is the result of severe pressure between forces in themselves good. The study of English authors of the past is now centred in the universities, and yet there must be no censorship - no work of admitted literary merit may be hidden from the learners. Somehow we must save poor Teacher's face, and protect him from the indignant or jeering students, local authorities or parents. It thus came to be tacitly agreed that a dead author usually hated what he described, hated it as much as we do, even, and wanted his book to shame everybody out of being so nasty ever again. This is often called fearless or unflinching criticism, and one of its ill effects is to make the young people regard all literature as a terrific nag or scold. Independently of this, a strong drive has been going on to recover the children for orthodox or traditional religious beliefs; ... and when you understand all that, you may just be able to understand how they manage to present James Joyce as a man devoted to the God who was satisfied by the crucifixion. The concordat was reached over his dead body.|$|E
40|$|My {{emphasis}} {{in this article}} is on international and global approaches to journalism research. And my challenge is to consider some integrative and global contexts for that task. I have always advocated setting up clear conceptual levels of analysis in examining media questions within the emerging communication subfeld in the U. S. of media sociology. The work <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> Pam Shoemaker and me began with this idea to consider the various levels of infuence of shaping media content (SHOEMAKER & REESE, 1996).
