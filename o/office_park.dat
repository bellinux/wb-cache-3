40|$|Road-transport is an {{important}} source of congestion in the cities. <b>Office</b> <b>parks,</b> which are recognized with their high intensity of labour and visitors, contribute to road-based commuter and business transport. Consequently, their accessibility by environmentally friendly means of transport is crucial for the environment and economy. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the role of location policy in The Netherlands in determining the extent of <b>office</b> <b>parks</b> accessibility by environmentally friendly means of transport. Initially, leading location policy principles relevant for the accessibility of <b>office</b> <b>parks</b> are examined. Selected policy principles coincide with each other in their explicitly or implicitly stated underlying goal: preventing suburbanisation. Secondly, implementation of these principles are analyzed in the light of four selected criteria: Land use change; urban versus rural areas; inner city versus peripheral locations; and presence of parking policy. Common to these criteria is that they provide insight for the spatial distribution of <b>office</b> <b>parks</b> and use of public transport as environmentally friendly alternative. Results indicate initially that land use change is being experienced in favour of more urbanization. The second result is that majority of the <b>office</b> <b>parks</b> are found to be located in the urban areas in The Netherlands. Thirdly, distribution of the <b>office</b> <b>parks</b> within the urban areas displays a nearly equal representation between the inner city and peripheral locations. However, this trend is expected to change at the expense of inner city <b>office</b> <b>parks.</b> And finally, presence of parking policy does not always provide sufficient results for improving accessibility. Combination of these results leads one to conclude that demand for accessibility by car, which is a strong location factor in the eyes of office based companies, is dealt with a (rather) flexible approach by the governmental organisations. In that, national policy goal of keeping the economic vitality and competitiveness of the regions and cities plays a determinant role...|$|R

The $103 million station {{was just one of}} the university's several construction projects that occurred in the 2000s. Starting in the late 1990s, a $500 million College Community Redevelopment Project led to the development of the $8.5 million Piedra del Sol Apartments, the $14.3 million Fraternity Row, and future developments of a $15 million Sorority Row, a $150 million Paseo retail, office, and apartment project, as well as a $125 million research and <b>office</b> <b>park.</b> In 2003, a pedestrian bridge opened, connecting several of the dorms to the main campus.
