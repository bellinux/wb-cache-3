500|$|Kekal has {{acknowledged}} in interviews that the band members, {{at the time}} interviewed, subscribed to Christianity, and {{has been described as}} one of the first black metal bands to profess Christian beliefs. Known to have fans from different religious backgrounds, and with the majority of their listeners being non-Christians, the band has stated on its Facebook page that as an institution it is not a Christian metal band and does not endorse any particular religion or ideology, and has always maintained that it is about music, life, and universality, and stands against any form of elitism and exclusivism in today's culture. Although Christianity has comprised a part of the band's lyrics, the band has said that from The Painful Experience (3rd album) onward its lyrics have not been associated with religion or ideology at all. Mark Allan Powell commented on this in Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, stating that [...] "on the band's first two albums the songs testified to their Christian faith in an upfront way", but that on their third album, the band pulled back from an overt approach that [...] "Jeff says tended to turn people against the band before they gave the music a chance." [...] According to Powell, [...] "they maintain that three-fourths of their albums are purchased by non-Christians." [...] In an interview with HM Magazine, Jeff Arwadi clarified his view on Christian metal: [...] "I don't want to divide our fans and market as religious - secular dichotomy. We always see everything as one. When we started the band, we knew nothing about the Christian metal scene, and we started just like a normal band in our underground scene. We grew up in the normal underground metal scene, and have already got attention from that scene since the very beginning. Kekal never belong to any church or some kind of ministry and never will. We are 100% just like any band you would call them as secular band. But then we knew we were also accepted within the Christian metal scene as well, that's cool to know, although I think it still less than 50% of <b>our</b> <b>general</b> fan base." ...|$|E

It has been read and applauded by those who can neither weigh its facts, nor appreciate its argument, nor detect its tendencies; while those who can - the philosopher, the naturalist, and the divine - have concurred in branding it with their severest censure.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Our</b> <b>general</b> {{practice}} {{is to place}} considerable confidence in the interpretations of state law reached by the federal courts of appeals. Cf. Mills v. Rogers, 457 [...] U.S. 291, 306 (1982); Bishop v. Wood, 426 [...] U.S. 341, 346 (1976). Petitioners and amici nevertheless attempt to upset this interpretation {{in a number of}} ways. First, they maintain that 25524.2 evinces no concern with the economics of nuclear power. The statute states that the [...] "development" [...] and [...] "existence" [...] of a permanent disposal technology approved by federal authorities will lift the moratorium; the statute does not provide for considering the economic costs of the technology selected. This view of the statute is overly myopic. Once a technology is selected and demonstrated, the utilities and the California Public Utilities Commission would be able to estimate costs; such cost estimates cannot be made until the Federal Government has settled upon the method of long-term waste disposal. Moreover, once a satisfactory disposal technology is found and demonstrated, fears of having to close down operating reactors should largely evaporate.|$|E

He says Mantoux's work [...] "is not simply a critique of Keynes", but [...] "a stimulus to question the received wisdom's interpretation of the unfolding events in Germany". Harcourt says that despite it discussing Keynes' errors [...] "in great detail", Mantoux's work [...] "has not led us to revise <b>our</b> <b>general</b> judgment of Keynes", yet [...] "it does make us question the soundness of theoretical and empirical aspects" [...] of his arguments. A. J. P. Taylor writes that in 1919 [...] "many people believed that the payment of reparations would reduce Germany to a state of Asiatic poverty", and that Keynes [...] "held this view, as did all Germans; and probably many Frenchmen". However, he also says these [...] "apprehensions of Keynes and the Germans were grotesquely exaggerated".|$|E

2500|$|Taste can be {{objective}} {{in terms of}} the five tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and savory) {{but it can also be}} subjective in terms of what we deem [...] "good" [...] and [...] "bad." [...] Taste is [...] "subjective, objective, and qualitative". In terms of it being a philosophical concept, taste is hard to define because it is essentially subjective when pertaining to the personal preferences of individuals i.e. [...] "'de gustibus non est disputandum' (there is no disputing taste)". We cannot tell someone they do not think something tastes good because we do not agree, and vice versa. In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it is whether we choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into <b>our</b> <b>general</b> society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement ...|$|E
