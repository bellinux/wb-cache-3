5|$|During {{the last}} days of July and into early August, the Allied fleet sailed away from the Japanese coast to avoid a typhoon and allow the ships to {{replenish}} their stocks <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> ammunition. The fleet then sailed north and, on both 9 and 10 August, the carrier aircraft attacked a large concentration of Japanese aircraft on airfields in northern Honshu. The carrier pilots claimed the destruction of 720 Japanese aircraft in this operation.|$|E
5|$|Increasing costs: due {{to higher}} costs <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> insurance, {{and due to}} greater {{regulation}} requiring equipment such as new radios, {{or in some cases}} transponders, gliding costs have increased, although without the continuous use of engines and fuel, they are still considerably lower than traditional power flying.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this article deals with the flow behavior of bio-ethanol, conventional petrol and their blends (E 15, E 85). The temperature dependence density and kinematic viscosity of the liquids have been measured. The densitometer Densito 30 PX with the scale for measuring fuels {{has been used to}} the measuring temperature dependence of the density <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> their blends. The rotary viscometer Anton Paar DV- 3 P has been used to the measuring temperature dependence of kinematic viscosity <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> their blends. For all samples has determined that the temperature has increased the density <b>and</b> kinematic viscosity <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> their blends has decreased. The range of temperature measurement has been from − 10 °C to 40 °C. The mathematic models have been compiled (polynomial and exponential) according to the general shapes. The coefficients of determination R 2 have achieved high values from 0. 98 to 0. 99 for temperature dependence <b>of</b> density <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> their blends and from 0. 86 to 0. 96 for temperature dependence of kinematic viscosity <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> their blends.

Number 2, dubbed Marianna Belle by its combat crew, made the cut because it did not consume more than the normal amount <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> oil in carrying out its missions, which were marked by top mechanical reliability.|$|E
5|$|Once protogalaxies {{began to}} form and contract, the first halo stars (called Population III stars) {{appeared}} within them.

5|$|Beginning on 21January 1947, the UK {{experienced}} several cold spells {{that brought}} large drifts of snow to the country, blocking roads and railways, which caused problems transporting coal {{to the electric}} power stations. Many had to shut down, forcing severe restrictions to cut power consumption, including restricting domestic electricity to 19 hours per day and cutting some industrial supplies completely. In addition, radio broadcasts were limited, television services were suspended, some magazines were ordered to stop publishing, and newspapers were reduced in size. These measures, {{on top of the}} low temperatures, badly affected public morale and the Minister <b>of</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>and</b> Power, Emanuel Shinwell, became a scapegoat; he received death threats and had to be placed under police guard. Towards the end of February, there were also fears of a food shortage as supplies were cut off and vegetables were frozen into the ground.|$|E

The game {{was released on}} several other formats such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, including a much upgraded version for the Amiga home computer. The game {{was inspired by the}} Gulf War and depicts a conflict between an insane Middle Eastern dictator, General Kilbaba, and the United States.

30|$|Another {{potential}} {{problem with the}} presence of O 2 in thermochemical processes is the effect of residual oxygen in the syngas on the catalysts used for the production <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> chemicals. Since these catalysts need to be kept in a reduced state for the efficient production <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> chemicals from [CO] and [H 2], any residual oxygen in the syngas will quickly re-oxidize these reduced catalysts to their non-reactive, oxidation state, resulting in reduced <b>fuel</b> production efficiency <b>and</b> potential damage to the catalysts.|$|R
5|$|Division of Sector West into Croatian- and RSK-controlled areas {{fragmented}} {{the market}} for locally grown agricultural produce, and produce processing plants were rendered inaccessible to most farmers. Furthermore, the RSK-controlled area of Sector West suffered from severe shortage <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> electricity, while the Croatian-held Pakrac was cut off from water supply systems fed by springs in the RSK-held area {{to the south of}} the town. The situation led the head of the UN Civil Affairs in Sector West, Gerard Fischer, and Argentine General Carlos Maria Zabala, commanding officer of the UNPROFOR in Sector West, to propose a degree of cooperation between local authorities on both sides in the area.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Trait du Nord {{horses were}} among those confiscated by Germans from Belgium and France {{for use in the}} war. In 1919, these horses were {{returned}} to their homeland, allowing the reconstruction of the breed. During World War II, the armed forces used all stocks <b>of</b> <b>fuel,</b> <b>and</b> the draft horse was used to continue agricultural production in France. After the war, farmers quickly equipped themselves with mechanized equipment. The decline in the breeding of the Trait du Nord became noticeable in the early 1950s, and by 1960 breed numbers had collapsed completely. By the early 1970s, breeding had slowed so much that the Trait du Nord, along with other French draft breeds, was in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the brief}} April War, the Germans had {{captured}} over 300 ex-VVKJ aircraft. They considered {{them to be}} of little use for the Luftwaffe, so {{it was decided to}} equip the ZNDH with an appropriate number of these aircraft. These aircraft, scattered in every corner of Yugoslavia, were then collected, minor damage repaired and stocks <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> spare parts stored at airfield workshops. Naturally, the majority of the aircraft were more or less damaged and action was undertaken to repair as many of them as possible. Former VVKJ pilots of Croatian background and other personnel of aeronautical specialty were approached and offered instant rehabilitation (most of them were in German POW camps), jobs and safety for their families.|$|E

Due to shortages <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> poor weather, H-Hour was postponed until 14:15. When H-Hour came, a powerful creeping barrage supported two companies of the Royal Canadian Regiment eastward. By evening, B Company controlled the Cider Crossroads, having met virtually no resistance in their advance to the objective.

Energy balance includes both the energy content and the energy needed for the production <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> lubricants. <b>Fuel</b> consumption measured for one year ranged from 1. 2 – 1. 4 l/m^ 3. Based on the consumption <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> lubricants the paper quantifies the amount of emissions in two scenarios (minimum consumption and maximum consumption) with a special focus on GHG emissions. Calculations are made of emissions for diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> for the alternatively applicable rape-seed methyl ester (RME), and a calculation is also made of emissions originating from fossil sources. By using RME as a <b>fuel,</b> the amount <b>of</b> CO 2 emissions from fossil sources discharged into the environment can be reduced by 3. 4 kg per a cubic meter over the bark of timber extracted by cableway...|$|R
5|$|Soviet Strike is set {{after the}} {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, and takes place in a fictionalised Russia, Eastern Europe and around the Caspian Sea. The player pilots an Apache helicopter and battles with the forces of Shadowman, a renegade ex-Communist figure. Like its predecessors, the game features shooting action mixed with strategic management <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> ammunition, but has more authentic 3D graphics, as well as a modified overhead - as opposed to isometric - perspective. The game also features a more realistic enemy artificial intelligence and environment. Critics received the game positively, praising the graphics and full motion video, while commentary on the gameplay and difficulty was more mixed.|$|E
5|$|Strategic Air Command {{found itself}} in an uncomfortable position; bombers had been tuned for {{efficiency}} at high speeds and altitudes, performance that had been purchased at great cost in both engineering and financial terms. Before the B-70 was to replace the B-52 in the long-range role, SAC had introduced the B-58 Hustler to replace the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the medium-range role. The Hustler was expensive to develop and purchase, and required enormous amounts <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> maintenance {{in comparison to the}} B-47. It was estimated that it cost three times as much to operate as the much larger and longer-ranged B-52.|$|E

30|$|Household {{energy demand}} {{is known to}} be mostly guided by prices <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> appliances, {{disposable}} income of households, availability <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> appliances, and cultural preferences (Dzioubinsky and Chipman 1999; Zhang and Guo 2013). In Nigerian households, one other factor that influences energy consumption, electricity demand for lighting in particular, is the type of dwelling. In this presentation, a household is used to refer to the group of people or family occupying the same dwelling. The dwelling may consist of just one room, hereafter referred to as one-room household, or several rooms, as in apartments or flats, duplex buildings, or bungalows, similarly referred to as many-room household.|$|R
