40|$|This {{dissertation}} rethinks some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core arguments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western theories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses.</b> By demonstrating <b>the</b> inapplicability <b>of</b> {{these theories}} in <b>the</b> situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Twentieth Century totalitarian regime in Czechoslovakia, this study argues {{for a replacement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dominant paradigms with new theories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> relevant to <b>the</b> specific historical and social conditions. History <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> in communist Czechoslovakia shows that <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> were not viewed as an inherently destructive social element.

5|$|Gravitational {{interactions}} of galaxies {{with each other}} and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> of virialized objects in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> to light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.|$|E

If the capitalists win {{the class}} {{struggle}} to push wages down and labor effort up, raising <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> surplus value, then a capitalist economy faces regular problems of excess producer supply and thus inadequate aggregate demand - the underconsumptionist theory. On which Engels comments [...] "the underconsumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses,</b> <b>the</b> restriction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> {{to what is}} necessary for their maintenance and reproduction, {{is not a new}} phenomenon.

But it tells us just as little why crises exist today as why they did not exist before" ...|$|R
40|$|URL] This article {{shows that}} both J. S.

Initially, Mill tried to find in society a power to rival <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses,</b> but later he advocated a new framework to political institutions which would guarantee <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> educated minorities in government, and thereby create <b>the</b> opposition <b>of</b> ideas that he deemed necessary to prevent <b>the</b> tyranny <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses.</b> Intending to prevent <b>the</b> excesses <b>of</b> democracy, John Stuart Mill attributed more importance to <b>the</b> building up <b>of</b> political institutions, while Alexis de Tocqueville emphasized <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> participation in politics at local level.

5|$|In September 1523, Leo Jud, Zwingli's {{closest friend}} and {{colleague}} and pastor of St. Peterskirche, publicly called {{for the removal of}} statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and iconoclastic activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion. Supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Zurich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Zurich, the dioceses of Chur and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.|$|E
