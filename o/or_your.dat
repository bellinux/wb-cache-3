5|$|When Carey {{tries to}} open up a bit more, her sentiments are the {{equivalent}} of a Hallmark Precious Moments figurine. In a ballad 'Bye Bye', Carey isn't taking chances, designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody, be it 'your best friend, your baby, your man <b>or</b> <b>your</b> lady'. But Carey gracefully pulls off the universality of the lyrics, and the tune will likely be a massive hit.|$|E

The gelding fought gainst McCoy' attempts to restrain him in the early stages, but moved into the lead two hurdles out and won by three lengths from the mare Cockney Sparrow. McCoy described the victory as [...] "a good performance, a good starting point" [...] but {{pointed out that the}} gelding was much the best horse in the race on previous form and was expected to win easily. On 26 December at Kempton Park Racecourse My Tent <b>Or</b> <b>Yours</b> faced The New One in a much-anticipated race for the Grade I Christmas Hurdle. Since beating My Tent <b>Or</b> <b>Yours</b> at Aintree in 2012, The New One had won six races including the Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle and the International Hurdle and was favoured in the betting at 5/6 while My Tent <b>Or</b> <b>Yours</b> starting at 11/8 in a field of six. My Tent <b>Or</b> <b>Yours</b> was restrained by McCoy in the early stages and survived a mistake at the fifth hurdle before moving up into second place behind The New One before the second last. The two leading contenders drew away from the other runners in the straight with My Tent <b>Or</b> <b>Yours</b> gaining the advantage in the last 100 yards to win by half a length after what Daily Telegraph described as [...] "the best hurdle race run in England or Ireland this season".|$|R

All nine of the runners were {{previous}} Grade I winners. Geraghty tracked the leaders before sending Jezki up to take the lead from the pacemaker Captain Cee Bee at the second last. He first repelled a challenge from Hurricane Fly and then held off the late run of My Tent <b>Or</b> <b>Yours</b> to claim the championship by a neck. The New One finished strongly to take third, two and a half lengths further back. Only Hurricane Fly and the outsider Steps To Freedom appeared to oppose Jezki when he started 4/5 favourite for the Racing Post Champion Hurdle at Punchestown on 2 May.

My Tent <b>Or</b> <b>Yours</b> tracked the leader before taking a narrow lead at the last but was overtaken by the rallying Champagne Fever on the run-in and beaten half a length into second place. Only three horses, including the Dovecote Novices' Hurdle winner Forgotten Voice, appeared to oppose My Tent <b>Or</b> <b>Yours</b> in the Top Novices' Hurdle at Aintree in April. Starting the 4/11 favourite, he took the lead three hurdles from the finish and went clear of his rival to win very easily by sixteen lengths. After the race, Henderson commented [...] "When you've had a hard race at Cheltenham it's nice to just come back and get confidence and go to bed for the summer happy and relieved. We know he’s good. He’s got to be in the ‘contenders' bracket for next year’s Champion Hurdle. He’s becoming very professional. That is what this season has been all about".|$|R
500|$|... "Wake Up", {{the opening}} track, is a mid-tempo number backed by dance, pop and {{electronic}} beats, and has [...] "a more mature pop-techno sound" [...] than Duff's previous work. Its instrumentation includes a guitar, bass and drums. Kelefa Anneth of The New York Times {{noted that the}} song contains musical influences of The Go-Go's. The lyrics of the song speak about having fun. Duff initially sings {{about the consequences of}} her fame and how people think they know [...] "everything about [...] " [...] ("There's people talking / They talk about me / They know my name / They think they know everything / But they don't know anything about me"). As the chorus draws near, the song takes on a [...] "party anthem" [...] approach, where Duff discusses the [...] "struggle" [...] for joy and self-confidence: [...] "I know I make mistakes / I'm living life day to day / It's never really easy but it's OK..." [...] According to Duff, the song [...] "makes you want to forget about all the pressure of dealing with your boss, <b>or</b> <b>your</b> teacher, <b>or</b> <b>your</b> mom, or ," [...] and lyrically discusses [...] "getting out and not forgetting to have some fun." [...] Duff has also said the song also [...] "talks about being in all [...] favorite places in the world, which is Tokyo and Paris and London and New York." [...] "Beat of My Heart", the third track on the album, is inspired by the new wave genre. The song also draws influences from the bubblegum pop and dance genres. It carries a [...] "soft electronic pop" [...] sound and has the heart beat sound as its base. According to Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine, the word 'beat of my heart' is repeated forty-four times in the song.|$|E

The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly.

He warned them, [...] "I can be your best friend <b>or</b> <b>your</b> worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E
500|$|For an offer, such as [...] "you may use my car {{whenever}} you like", {{the consequence of}} compliance [...] "represents a situation which is preferred to the norm". Noncompliance, that is, not taking up the offer {{of the use of}} the car, is identical to the norm, and so neither more nor less preferable. Threats, on the other hand, are characterised by compliance that leads to an outcome less preferable to the norm, with noncompliance leading to an outcome less desirable still. For instance, if someone is threatened with [...] "your money <b>or</b> <b>your</b> life", compliance would lead to them losing their money, while noncompliance would lead to them losing their life. Both are less desirable than the norm (that is, not being threatened at all), but, for the subject of the threat, losing money is more desirable than being killed. A throffer is a third kind of intervention. It differs from both a threat and an offer, as compliance is preferable to the norm, while noncompliance is less preferable than the norm.|$|E
