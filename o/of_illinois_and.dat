5|$|In the 18th century, the Sauk and Meskwaki (or Fox) Native American tribes lived {{along the}} Mississippi River {{in what is}} now the U.S. states <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>and</b> Iowa. The two tribes had become closely {{connected}} after having been displaced from the Great Lakes region in conflicts with New France and other Native American tribes, particularly after the so-called Fox Wars ended in the 1730s. By the time of the Black Hawk War, the population of the two tribes was about 6,000 people.|$|E

5|$|The Black Hawk War of 1832 {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} at least 70 settlers and soldiers, and hundreds of Black Hawk's band. As well as the combat casualties of the war, a relief force under General Winfield Scott suffered hundreds deserted and dead, many from cholera. The end of the war at Bad Axe ended the large-scale threat of Native American attacks in northwest Illinois, and allowed further settlement <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>and</b> what became Iowa and Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|The Iowa {{class were}} the only battleships with the speed {{required}} for post-war operations based around fast aircraft carrier task forces.

5|$|In 1961, {{with its}} first {{location}} in Skokie, Illinois, Burger King Corporation and its franchises began opening stores and by 1967 had over 20 locations {{spread throughout the}} state. The Hootses, claiming that their trademark gave them exclusive rights to the name in Illinois sued BK in the state, and later federal, courts under the case Burger King of Florida, Inc. v. Hoots 403 F.2d 904 (7th Cir. 1968). The decision issued by United States District Court for the Central District <b>of</b> <b>Illinois,</b> <b>and</b> upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, stated that the BK federal trademark, applied for in 1961 and granted in 1963, took precedence over the Hootses' older, state trademark; The Court granted the Hootses exclusive rights to the Burger King trademark within a circular area defined with a 20-mile (32km) radius centered on their original location.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{supported}} the idea, believing {{it the best}} solution to an intractable problem. The bill passed, providing for a commission of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices. To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans; the fifteenth member {{was to be a}} Supreme Court justice chosen by the other four on the commission (themselves two Republicans and two Democrats). Justice David Davis, an independent respected by both parties, was expected to be their choice, but he upset the careful planning by accepting election to the Senate by the state <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>and</b> refusing to serve on the commission. The remaining Supreme Court justices were all Republicans and, with the addition of Justice Joseph P. Bradley to the place intended for Davis, the commission had an 8–7 Republican majority. Randall nevertheless favored the compromise, even voting in favor of it in the roll call vote (the Speaker usually does not vote). The commission met and awarded all of the disputed ballots to Hayes by an 8–7 party-line vote.|$|E

5|$|The Society for Human Rights was an American LGBT Rights {{organization}} {{established in}} Chicago in 1924. Society founder Henry Gerber {{was inspired to}} create it by German Doctor Magnus Hirschfeld and his work with the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. It was the first recognized gay rights organization in the United States, having received a charter from the state <b>of</b> <b>Illinois,</b> <b>and</b> produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom. A few months after being chartered, the group ceased {{to exist in the}} wake of the arrest of several of the Society's members.

5|$|He and {{his brother}} Jonathan were sent to Le Mans Military Academy in Rolling Prairie, Indiana, after Jackson was {{diagnosed}} as hyperactive. He was often paddled for disciplinary reasons during his time as a cadet. Jackson repeated ninth grade and was suspended from school twice. He was an all-state running back on his football team {{in high school and}} was featured in the February 1984 issue of Sports Illustrated as part of their Faces in the Crowd section, which noted him for his 15touchdowns, 889rushing yards, and 7.2yards per carry in six games. Jackson enrolled in North Carolina A University, his father's alma mater, earning his Bachelor of Science degree magna cum laude in 1987. He decided to follow his father's advice to receive a seminary education at the Chicago Theological Seminary, where he earned his master's degree a year early but opted not to become ordained. Jackson proceeded to law school at the University <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>and</b> convinced his future wife to transfer there from the Georgetown University Law Center. He then earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Illinois College of Law in 1993. Jackson never sat for the bar exam despite finishing his coursework a semester early.|$|E
5|$|The State of Illinois {{wanted a}} {{commemorative}} coin {{to be issued}} for the centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union. A bill that would accomplish this, H.R. 8764, was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on January 16, 1918 by that state's Loren E. Wheeler. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, which held hearings on March 5. Wheeler told the committee (of which {{he was not a}} member) that the coins were desired for distribution during the celebrations in Illinois. He had been to see Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker. Neither had any objection to the legislation, though McAdoo had explained that the problem with commemorative coins was that they did not sell as well as expected, and many were returned to the Mint for melting. After telling of his meeting with the officials, Wheeler explained to the committee that the coins would be purchased by the State Treasurer <b>of</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>and</b> so there would be no returns. James L. Slayden of Texas asked what the cost to the federal government would be, but Wheeler did not know. Slayden asked what had been the cost for the 1916–1917 McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar, and Ohio's William A. Ashbrook, the chairman of the committee, said that the cost of the dies had been borne by the group purchasing the coins from the government; Ashbrook proposed amending the bill to make this clear this would be an expense to be paid by Illinois. Wheeler had no objection, and stated that to avoid returns, it might be best if the issue was limited to 100,000 coins rather than the 200,000 in the original bill. Ashbrook then asked if the coins were to be sold at a premium by the centennial committee, and Wheeler denied this, indicating that they were to be circulated like any other half dollar. This concluded the public hearing on the bill, with the committee to take further action in executive session.|$|E
