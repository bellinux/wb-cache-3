In one meeting in Australia he won £800 at a time a skilled worker in England earned £85 a year. Three years after his national championship, and with his career starting to fade, he rode at a meeting on the track at Aston, Birmingham on Easter Monday, 1897.

25|$|The 1940 Stanley Cup semifinals {{between the}} Maple Leafs and Red Wings was {{especially}} notable {{with the second}} game devolving into a brawl. The tone of the game was set early when Maple Leafs' defenceman, Rudolph Kampman, injured Red Wings' forward Cecil Dillon who became unable to play {{the rest of the}} night. In the second period, Maple Leafs' Red Horner and Red Wings' Alex Motter fought on the ice and continued {{to do so in the}} penalty box with local police called in to break it up. Later in the same frame, Red Wings' Don Grosso lifted Maple Leafs' Hank Goldup over the boards, dropping him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cement</b> floor. Goldup had to be assisted off the ice.|$|E

Calvin also has a younger brother, Richard Ramsey, who after being raised by foster parents after being left for adoption at the age of three months, finally met Calvin, mother Evelyn and his three other siblings in 2010. Like his brother, Richard also plays basketball, playing for De Ocampo Memorial College in Sta. Mesa, Manila and currently serves as an assistant coach for the De Ocampo Cobras.|$|E

Over the next two days, 2nd Brigade cleared the rest of the city, securing {{the south side of the}} bridges, followed by an assault on the headquarters of an Iraqi paramilitary group on 4 April. Rather than taking and holding ground, the Americans launched probing attacks into the city, engaged enemy forces, and then pulled back. Airstrikes were used against the Ba'ath Party Headquarters, a school used as a headquarters building, and a soccer field used as a rallying point. A hospital was also being used as a headquarters by Iraqi forces, however this was not bombed due to civilians in the area. By 4 April, resistance had ceased and the city was declared cleared. 1-41 Infantry, 1st Armored Division, and the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division would be awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for their performance during combat operations.|$|E
