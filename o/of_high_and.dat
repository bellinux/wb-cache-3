The hotel opened on 15 November 1851, {{less than a year after}} the organised settlement of Christchurch.

A well-known man, Hart had no political experience; he was never elected onto the Canterbury Provincial Council.|$|E

5|$|Periyar {{stated that}} the caste system in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked {{with the arrival of}} Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a {{different}} stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.|$|E

25|$|The third {{prevalent}} {{issue the}} Philippine educational system continuously encounters is the affordability of education (or lack thereof). A big disparity in educational achievements is evident across various social groups.

Additionally, most freshmen students at the tertiary level come from relatively well-off families.|$|E

25|$|Many {{schools in}} the New England Small College Athletic Conference are known for low grade {{inflation}} and rigorous academic standards. The practice was often contrasted with the Ivy League schools with respect to uncovered grade inflation. Some members have received limited media coverage over perceived grade inflation.

25|$|At {{low latitudes}} the Hadley {{circulation}} dominates, and {{is essentially the}} same as the process which on Earth generates the trade winds. At higher latitudes a series <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low pressure areas, called baroclinic pressure waves, dominate the weather. Mars is drier and colder than Earth, and in consequence dust raised by these winds tends to remain in the atmosphere longer than on Earth as there is no precipitation to wash it out (excepting CO2 snowfall). One such cyclonic storm was recently captured by the Hubble space telescope (pictured below).|$|E
25|$|The {{relief of}} Bulgaria is varied. In the {{relatively}} small territory of the country there are extensive lowlands, plains, hills, low and high mountains, many valleys and deep gorges. The main characteristic of Bulgaria's topography is four alternating bands <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low terrain that extend east to west across the country. From north to south, those bands, called geomorphological regions, are the Danubian Plain, the Balkan Mountains, the Transitional region and the Rilo-Rhodope region. The easternmost sections near the Black Sea are hilly, but they gradually gain height to the west until the westernmost {{part of the country}} is entirely high ground.|$|E

25|$|Using {{relatively}} recent night light data and electricity consumption {{in comparison with}} Gross County Product, the informal sector of the local economy in Veracruz state is shown to have grown {{during the period of}} the Fox Administration though the regional government remained PRI. The assumption that the informal economy of Mexico is a constant 30% of total economic activity is not supported at the local level. The small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> low literacy rates amongst municipios in Veracruz but not enough to warrant including an I-statistic as a regressor. Global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macro-regional level which is an area for further research beyond this study.|$|E
