40|$|Visuals are {{a central}} feature of STEM in {{all levels of}} {{education}} and many areas of employment. The wide variety of visuals that {{students are expected to}} master in STEM prevents an approach that aims to teach students about every type of visual that they may encounter. This paper proposes a pedagogy that can be applied across year levels and learning areas, allowing a school-wide, cross-curricular, approach to teaching about visual, that enhances learning in STEM and all other learning areas. Visuals are classified into six categories based on their properties, unlike traditional methods that classify visuals according to purpose. As visuals in the same category share common properties, students are able to transfer their knowledge from the familiar to unfamiliar in each category. The paper details the classification and proposes some strategies that can be can be incorporated into existing methods of teaching students about visuals in all learning areas. The approach may also assist students to see the connections between the different learning areas within and <b>outside</b> <b>STEM...</b>|$|R

Peri (2012) finds a strong positive association between immigration and state-level TFP, and explains one third to one half of this link to increased task specialisation by native workers. Working with a panel of US cities, Peri et al. (2013) show that an increase in immigrant scientists and engineers leads to increased wages for US college-educated workers (inside and <b>outside</b> <b>STEM</b> sectors), which they interpret as the result of migrant-led productivity shifts. They also find that changes in task specialisation play a key role. By contrast Quispe-Agnoli and Zavodny (2002) find negative significant effects of migrants for US high-skilled manufacturing industries, an effect they ascribe to slow assimilation of new arrivals. These studies are an important advance on the classic work by Ottaviano and Peri (2006), which links migrant diversity to higher productivity in US metros. Ottaviano and Peri argue that effects are largely driven by agglomeration economies, and ascribe some of this to skilled migrants, but are unable to test this directly.|$|R

The mature fruits are green, 1.5-3mm sized berry. Seeds ripen in the autumn and the fruits forcefully eject seeds which are coated in a sticky substance that allows them to adhere to whatever they touch. After rain, the sticky seed will slide down a needle that it has landed on onto a stem where it will then germinate and enter into the host. The seeds may spread long distances via animals.|$|R

30|$|Venation in C. involucratus {{stem and}} leaf {{involves}} two separate patterns. One is {{the separation of}} bundles over large absolute distances (or many-celled), expressing the ski jump pdf, {{and the other is}} close, cell contact arrangement generating the children’s slide pdf. Also each can be defined mathematically by equations so descriptions pass beyond the crude geometric stage. It is of interest to examine other monocots for vascular pattern, whether it has a uniform distribution (Fig.  3 c) or a gradient profile (Fig.  3 d) or possibly some other distribution. A more deeply seated phenomenon is the internal organization of vascular bundles with phloem facing the <b>outside</b> in <b>stems</b> or the adaxial surface of leaves and xylem located to the center of stems and the abaxial face in leaves. Several observed exceptions in stems to this rule suggest a relationship between internal (within a bundle) and external (between bundles and stem margin) with the latter serving as an entre to the problem of the former.|$|R

Flaviviruses, members of a genus in the family Flaviviridae,comprise a number of medically relevant viruses, such as den-gue virus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) (1). These small enveloped viruses infect cells by receptor-mediated endocy-tosis and acidic-pH-induced membrane fusion in endosomes (2, 3). The fusion reaction is mediated by the major envelope protein E, a class II fusion protein (4), which contains three domains (DI, DII, and DIII), a membrane-proximal region (the so-called “stem”), and the carboxy-terminal transmembrane anchor (Fig. 1 A).

Areas severely damaged by elk are commonly protected with woven wire fence, which can exclude other animals. Complete exclusion {{and prevention of}} large mammal herbivory might not always be necessary to restore vegetative communities. We designed and evaluated a simple fence that excluded elk, but maintained access for deer and other species. We enclosed a 1 -ha stand of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux) with our fence in an area with a high density of elk. We monitored effectiveness of the fence with trackplots, animal-activated cameras, and changes in aspen stem height and density. We documented only 1 elk within the exclosure in 2 years of monitoring. Mammals that used the exclosure included beaver (Castor canadensis), black bear (Ursus americanus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), deer (Odocoileus spp.), mountain lion (Puma concolor), raccoon (Procyon lotor), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and lagomorph (Leporidae).

50|$|The {{first step}} of the {{transition}} is {{the transformation of the}} vegetative stem primordia into floral primordia. This occurs as biochemical changes take place to change cellular differentiation of leaf, bud and stem tissues into tissue that will grow into the reproductive organs. Growth of {{the central part of the}} stem tip stops or flattens out and the sides develop protuberances in a whorled or spiral fashion around the <b>outside</b> of the <b>stem</b> end. These protuberances develop into the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue. Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower.|$|R
25|$|Woody dicots {{and many}} nonwoody dicots have {{secondary}} growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the <b>outside.</b> As the <b>stem</b> increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the periderm, which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely packed cells in the periderm that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.|$|R
40|$|Undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and {{mathematics}} (STEM) {{education has been}} receiving {{a great deal of}} attention. Stakeholders in government as well as academic institutions recognize the significance of educational reform in STEM fields to improve student engagement, retention and proficiency. Boston University, through partnership with the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL), offers graduate students the opportunity to perform an educational research project in a STEM course in the Teaching-as-Research (TAR) Fellowship. The main goal of a TAR project is to identify educational interventions that improve student outcomes. This study, being a TAR project, examines how scientific literacy of undergraduates enrolled in Introduction to Neuroscience (NE 101) at Boston University changes {{over the course of a}} semester in response to a three-skill intervention. Scientific literacy, broadly defined as the ability to leverage evidence and data to interpret scientific research and evaluate the significance of conclusions, has been promoted by academic institutions by some time. Be that as it may, best practices for teaching scientific literacy and standardized methods of measurement have yet to be explicitly outlined. There are, however, validated paradigms that are gaining momentum: The integrated STEM education model and the Test of Scientific Literacy Skills (TOSLS). Integrated STEM education incorporates multiple academic disciplines (within and <b>outside</b> <b>STEM</b> fields) and promotes application of knowledge to solving real-world problems. The TOSLS is an assessment tool in sync with this educational model; its purpose is to gauge students’ proficiency in nine key skills of scientific literacy by posing questions that require students to implement these skills in meaningful scenarios. In this study, I used a subset of the scientific literacy skills outlined in the TOSLS to design curriculum for the discussion component of NE 101. I also used pre- and post-intervention adaptations of the TOSLS for measuring students’ achievement of scientific literacy in addition to weekly quiz questions. However, another focus of this study was to highlight changes in students’ motivation and attitudes toward scientific inquiry pre- to post-intervention. Research conducted by Carberry et al. suggests that employing a variety of quantitative and qualitative measurements provides a more holistic picture of students’ learning. To this end, two focus groups were held and a post-course discussion survey was deployed at the end of the course. The quantitative and qualitative data collected from these instruments indicate vital points for STEM educators to consider when designing and implementing course curriculum, especially those courses oriented toward promoting scientific literacy in their student population. Major considerations include: 1. 	Design problem-based activities that integrate multiple scientific literacy skills 2. 	Incorporate scientific literature from non-primary sources and that is representative of students’ interests 3. 	Develop students’ competency in reading primary scientific literature by gradually increasing the difficulty of material 4.

The research published on how to address the on-going United States (US) national challenge of increasing gender parity in undergraduate engineering programs is almost entirely US centric. The authors of this paper reached across borders and <b>outside</b> the <b>STEM</b> education literature to gain a different perspective on the US problem of persistent gender segregation in undergraduate engineering education. As we compared the issue of gender parity between the US, Jordan and Malaysia, three previously unexplored areas began to take shape: 1. The US has potentially inaccurately scoped the problem, 2. Different factors seem to contribute to greater gender equity in undergraduate engineering programs in Jordan and Malaysia than in the US, and 3. A sociological framework for analysis and interpretation (not previously published in the engineering education literature) helps us better understand the core causes of gender inequity in advanced industrialized countries, such as the US. Once we better understand the core causes, effective solutions can be designed. The purpose of this paper is to begin to re-scope the problem of increasing the number of women in engineering education in the US, identify potential factors that contribute to gender equity in Jordan and Malaysia, and to propose future areas of robust cross-national engineering education research...|$|R
