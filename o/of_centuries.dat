5|$|Alboin (530sJune 28, 572) {{was king}} of the Lombards from about 560 until 572. During his reign the Lombards ended their migrations by {{settling}} in Italy, {{the northern part of}} which Alboin conquered between 569 and 572. He had a lasting effect on Italy and the Pannonian Basin; in the former his invasion marked the beginning <b>of</b> <b>centuries</b> of Lombard rule, and in the latter his defeat of the Gepids and his departure from Pannonia ended the dominance there of the Germanic peoples.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Manila sits on top <b>of</b> <b>centuries</b> {{of prehistoric}} {{alluvial}} deposits {{built by the}} waters of the Pasig River and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay. Manila's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since the American colonial times. Some of the city's natural variations in topography have been evened out. , Manila had a total area of 42.88 square kilometers.|$|E
5|$|As of 2013, {{five centuries}} {{were made in}} the finals with only two of them {{resulting}} in victories. The 2002 edition saw ten centuries—all at the Premadasa Stadium, Colombo, the highest for a single tournament, while the least number <b>of</b> <b>centuries</b> were scored in the 2013 edition with three. The most recent century was made by Fakhar Zaman of Pakistan when he scored 114 against India during the final of the 2017 edition of the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Bird's nest fungi {{were first}} {{mentioned}} by Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius in Rariorum plantarum historia (1601). Over {{the next couple}} <b>of</b> <b>centuries,</b> these fungi were the subject of some controversy regarding whether the peridioles were seeds, and the mechanism by which they were dispersed in nature. For example, the French botanist Jean-Jacques Paulet, in his work Traité des champignons (1790–3), erroneously suggested that peridioles were ejected from the fruiting bodies by some sort of spring mechanism.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of his {{retirement}} in 1948, Bradman had made twenty-nine centuries in eighty innings. These centuries, with which he had accumulated 5,393 of his 6,996 Test runs, were scored with a 36.25% ratio <b>of</b> <b>centuries</b> per innings played. This allowed him to maintain a career batting average of 99.94, while no other batsman has been able to reach 61. He would have retired with an average of 100 had he scored four more runs in his final innings.|$|E
5|$|Details of {{the modern}} climate record are known through the taking of {{measurements}} from such weather instruments as thermometers, barometers, and anemometers {{during the past few}} centuries. The instruments used to study weather over the modern time scale, their known error, their immediate environment, and their exposure have changed over the years, which must be considered when studying the climate <b>of</b> <b>centuries</b> past.|$|E

After this failure, he went back to traveling, this time around Shandong and Hebei.|$|E
5|$|West Antarctica {{is covered}} by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, {{possibility}} of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, ocean levels would rise by several metres in a relatively geologically short period of time, perhaps a matter <b>of</b> <b>centuries.</b> Several Antarctic ice streams, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, flow {{to one of the}} many Antarctic ice shelves: see ice-sheet dynamics.|$|E
5|$|Citizens were {{organized}} {{on the basis}} <b>of</b> <b>centuries</b> and tribes, which would each gather into their own assemblies. The Comitia Centuriata ("Centuriate Assembly") was the assembly of the centuries (i.e., soldiers). The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul. The centuries would vote, one at a time, until a measure received support from {{a majority of the}} centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had geimperium powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and ratify the results of a census. It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.|$|E

5|$|GDRT {{was most}} likely the first Aksumite king to be {{involved}} in South Arabian affairs, as well as the first known king to be mentioned in South Arabian inscriptions. His reign resulted in the control of much of western Yemen, such as the Tihāmah, Najrā, Ma`afir, Ẓafār (until c. 230), and parts of Hashid territory around Hamir in the northern highlands. Furthermore, GDRT's military alliances and his conquests in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the required formidable fleet for such feats, and the extension of Aksumite influence throughout Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia all reflect a new zenith in Aksumite power. His involvement would mark the beginning <b>of</b> <b>centuries</b> of Aksumite involvement in South Arabia, culminating with the full-scale invasion of Yemen by King Kaleb in 520 (or 525), resulting in the establishment of an Aksumite province covering all of South Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede orbits Jupiter at a {{distance}} of 1,070,400km, third among the Galilean satellites, and completes a revolution every seven days and three hours. Like most known moons, Ganymede is tidally locked, with one side always facing toward the planet, hence its day is seven days and three hours. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale <b>of</b> <b>centuries.</b> The ranges of change are 0.0009–0.0022 and 0.05–0.32°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0 and 0.33°.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{decided to}} retire from all cricket after the tour, not {{returning}} for Gloucestershire in 1947. Within 24 hours of his arrival back in England, he married Sybil Ness-Harvey. He played only two more first-class games. He scored an unbeaten 92 for the M.C.C. against Ireland in 1950. To help boost a Gloucestershire membership drive, he joined his former side for a match the following year. Although given an excellent reception by the crowd, his tired appearance and struggle to score seven runs before being dismissed embarrassed many of those present. In all first-class cricket, Hammond scored 50,551 runs {{at an average of}} 56.10 with 167 centuries. He remains seventh on the list of highest run scorers in first-class cricket and has the third highest number <b>of</b> <b>centuries,</b> as of 2015.|$|E

5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday afternoon and placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination <b>of</b> <b>centuries</b> of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates {{did not know that}} the Pope had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch who responded by excommunicating the legates.|$|E
5|$|In cricket, a batsman {{reaches a}} century when he scores 100 or more {{runs in a}} single innings. A century is {{regarded}} as a landmark score for a batsman, and his number <b>of</b> <b>centuries</b> is generally recorded in his career statistics. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional league for Twenty20 cricket in India, which has been held annually since its first edition in 2008. In the ten seasons played, 47 centuries have been scored by 30 different batsmen. Players from eight of the eleven franchises have scored centuries; the only franchises that have not had a player score a century for them are Pune Warriors India, Kochi Tuskers Kerala and Gujarat Lions.|$|E
5|$|In cricket, {{a player}} {{is said to}} have scored a century when he scores 100 or more runs in a single innings. The Asia Cup is a One Day International (ODI) tournament {{organised}} by the Asian Cricket Council, a subordinate of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Originally started as a biennial tournament in 1984, it has since been organised 12 times as of the latest edition in 2014. Since its inception, a total of 47 centuries have been scored by 30 players from 4 different teams—Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Affiliate teams such as Afghanistan, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates are yet to have a centurion. Pakistan leads the list with the most number <b>of</b> <b>centuries</b> and centurions, 16 and 10 respectively. Bangladesh trail the list with four centuries and as many centurions.|$|E
