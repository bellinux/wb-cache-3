5|$|A {{large number}} <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> changes {{took place during}} the 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been {{experimental}} since {{the early part of the}} century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house. Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.|$|E

5|$|After {{publishing}} Prehistory of Scotland (1935), Childe produced one of {{the defining}} books of his career, Man Makes Himself (1936). Influenced by Marxist views of history, Childe argued that the usual distinction between (pre-literate) prehistory and (literate) history was a false dichotomy and that human society has progressed through a series <b>of</b> <b>technological,</b> economic and social revolutions. These included the Neolithic Revolution, when hunter-gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities, through to the Urban Revolution, when society progressed {{from a series of}} small towns through to the first cities, and right up to more recent times, when the Industrial Revolution changed the nature of production.|$|E

5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters have been of crucial importance in a number <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially took a very similar form, and the main application of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E

40|$|This paper takes Tianjin {{for example}} and {{analyzes}} the development tend <b>of</b> scientific and <b>technological</b> progress in Tianjin.

Research finding shows that these five indicators are all positive correlated with the GDP, and especially ‘environment <b>of</b> scientific and <b>technological</b> progress’, ‘input <b>of</b> scientific and <b>technological</b> activities’, and ‘science and technology for economic and social development’, which are significantly positive correlation of GDP. The {{extent to which these}} five indicators impact the GDP from strong to weak is ‘input <b>of</b> scientific and <b>technological</b> activities’, ‘science and technology for economic and social development’, ‘environment <b>of</b> scientific and <b>technological</b> progress’, ‘high-tech industrialization’, and ‘output <b>of</b> scientific and <b>technological</b> activities’. The ‘input <b>of</b> scientific and <b>technological</b> activities’ index (2011) in Tianjin scores only 70 which ranks fourth among the five indexes, however its impact on GDP is most significant. So it would be best for Tianjin to increase the human and financial input in ‘scientific and technological activities’ to promote the growth of GDP in future.  </p...|$|R

5|$|During Pettit's tenure, the Institute progressed {{into the}} top tier <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> {{education}} institutions. Under his leadership, Tech's research budget surpassed the $100 million mark {{for the first time}} in its history. Thomas E. Stelson was Georgia Tech's Vice President for Research from 1974 to 1988. Faced with a longstanding cultural war over the relative merits of basic research versus applied research, Stelson emphasized the importance of both. An increased focus on research activities allowed more funding for academics, which allowed the school's ranking to start a long and continuing rise from that of the 20s. Stelson simultaneously served as the interim director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute from 1975 to 1976, during which time he reorganized the station into eight semi-autonomous laboratories in order to allow each to develop a specialization and clientele—a model that GTRI retains (with slight modifications) to this day.|$|E

Spurred by intense competition from the formidable Pennsylvania Railroad, the dominant railroad in the lucrative New YorkWashington market since the 1880s, the Royal Blue in its mid-1930s reincarnation was noted for a number <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> innovations, including streamlining and the first non-articulated diesel locomotive on a passenger train in the U.S., a harbinger of the steam locomotive's eventual demise.|$|E
5|$|The Genesee Wesleyan Seminary {{was founded}} in 1831 by the Genesee Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima, New York, south of Rochester.

However, the location was soon thought {{by many to be}} insufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support.|$|E

5|$|William Monahan's screenplay, {{based on}} the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, {{examines}} contemporary tension between Western and Arab societies and the comparative effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> and human counter-intelligence methods. The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes. The film's photography sought to emphasize the contrast between the gold and dust of the desert and Arab cities, and the blue and gray of bureaucracy and Washington. Accordingly, they used natural light wherever possible. Marc Streitenfeld arranged the musical score.|$|E
