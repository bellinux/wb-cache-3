40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relevance of social settings as predictors of risky sexual behavior. In a young adult sample (n = 324, M age = 20. 2 years), we examined the association between frequency of attendance at five different settings and frequency of engaging in four risky sexual behaviors (i. e., unprotected intercourse when not drunk <b>or</b> <b>high,</b> unprotected intercourse when drunk <b>or</b> <b>high,</b> casual sex when not drunk <b>or</b> <b>high,</b> casual sex when drunk <b>or</b> <b>high).</b> Predictive associations were examined using negative binomial regression, and all analyses controlled for frequency of recent alcohol use and age at first use of alcohol. Greater attendance at fraternity/sorority parties predicted more frequent intercourse for females in the not drunk <b>or</b> <b>high</b> and drunk <b>or</b> <b>high</b> contexts, and more frequent casual sex for males in the not drunk <b>or</b> <b>high</b> context. Greater attendance at large private parties predicted more frequent intercourse for females in the not drunk <b>or</b> <b>high</b> context. Greater attendance at bars without dance floors predicted more frequent intercourse for males in the drunk <b>or</b> <b>high</b> context. These findings highlight the importance of socializing habits in understanding risky sexual behavior...|$|R
