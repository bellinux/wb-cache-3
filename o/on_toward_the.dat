5|$|After departing New Richmond, {{the tornado}} moved <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northeast, {{continuing}} along a course almost {{parallel to the}} Omaha Railroad line, with most of its destruction after that point confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of town. The tornado struck several farms in the Stanton area, passing barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. The storm came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, {{proving to be a}} great scare for its residents as it reminded many of a similar tornado which struck Clear Lake in September 1884. A large number of farms in the area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson was killed instantly when the tornado flattened his farmstead, leaving his wife and son gravely injured. Northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado tore through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away. Several homes and farms {{in the vicinity of the}} hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away, leaving several families destitute. The storm continued east into Barron County, where the farming community of Arland sustained a direct hit, with virtually the entire settlement being demolished, but no fatalities or serious injuries being reported. The tornado dissipated a few miles southwest of the city of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.|$|E

25|$|Caesar {{realized}} that his siege would fail unless he could get Vercingetorix off the high ground. He used one legion as a decoy while the rest moved onto better ground, capturing three Gallic camps in the process. He then ordered a general retreat to lure Vercingetorix off the high ground. However, the order was not heard by most of Caesar's force. Instead, spurred on by {{the ease with which}} they captured the camps, they pressed <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> town and mounted a direct assault on it. The Aedui arrived at that moment but the Romans mistook them for enemies at the beginning and Caesar had to make order in his lines. The noise of the assault alerted Vercingetorix who arrived and saw the Roman and Aedui just beneath the walls of Gergovia. Vercingetorix then led a cavalry charge which crushed the Roman lines. After the cavalry charge, the warriors left their horses and joined the infantry who were fighting the Romans, who had suffered heavy casualties. Given the importance of the disaster Caesar ordered a retreat. In the wake of the battle, Caesar lifted his siege and fled the Arverni lands in the direction of Aedui territory.|$|E
25|$|Before {{reaching}} the 28th Gurkha Brigade Shimada's tanks were offered a perfect {{target in the}} form of Lt. Col. Cyril Stokes' 5/14th Punjabis, who were in marching order (long columns of units following each other) {{on either side of the}} road to Trolak. Stokes' Punjabis were heading up to reinforce Stewart's brigade. Commanding Shimada's three leading tanks was Lt. Sadanobu Watanabe, who led his tanks straight through Stokes' Punjabis, machine guns firing at the perfect target offered by the lined up soldiers. Lt.Col.Stokes was mortally wounded and his battalion suffered heavy casualties before Watanabe's tanks carried <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> road bridge (5/14th Punjabis mustered 146 officers and soldiers by 8 January). By 8:00a.m. the leading Japanese tanks were within Selby's brigade H.Q. area. The 28th Brigade were completely unaware of what had happened to Stewart's entire brigade and the Japanese tore through them faster, scattering both the 2/2nd and 2/9th Gurkhas, which were spread around Selby's brigade H.Q. Although they suffered heavy casualties many of the soldiers from these two battalions made it across the rail bridge before the main Japanese force got to their position.|$|E
25|$|After 2 days {{of intense}} {{physical}} and mental strain, during which Maj. Miller had led his battalion in {{the front line of}} the advance through the forest of Argonne, the enemy was met in a prepared position south of Gesnes. Though almost exhausted, he energetically reorganized his battalion and ordered an attack. Upon reaching open ground the advancing line began to waver in the face of machinegun fire from the front and flanks and direct artillery fire. Personally leading his command group forward between his front-line companies, Maj. Miller inspired his men by his personal courage, and they again pressed <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> hostile position. As this officer led the renewed attack he was shot in the right leg, but he nevertheless staggered forward at the head of his command. Soon afterwards he was again shot in the right arm, but he continued the charge, personally cheering his troops on through the heavy machinegun fire. Just before the objective was reached he received a wound in the abdomen, which forced him to the ground, but he continued to urge his men on, telling them to push on to the next ridge and leave him where he lay. He died from his wounds a few days later.|$|E

Just as he reached the top, Second Lieutenant Thomas T. Jones, commanding the 3rd Platoon, saw and heard three North Korean mortars fire from [...] away on a grassy ridge to the east. He suggested to Kennedy that artillery fire be directed on these mortars, but Kennedy did not act on the suggestion. Kennedy established his command post inside the tunnel behind the 2nd Platoon position. The D Company position was entirely within the area enclosed by the stone wall, which was nearly intact except on the northeast near the 3rd Platoon position where it had crumbled and was covered with brush and trees. Jones pointed out to his platoon sergeant and squad leaders where he wanted them to take position at the edge of the woods facing the North Korean mortars he had seen on the grassy ridge beyond. He then remained a few minutes in conversation with Kennedy. A few minutes later Jones joined his 3rd Squad men at the edge of the woods. They told him that the platoon sergeant and the rest had continued <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> narrow grassy ridge. One of the squad members called Jones to the edge of the woods and pointed out 12 well-camouflaged North Korean soldiers, one of them carrying a machine gun, coming down the narrow ridge toward them from the mortar position.

[...] They then headed for Redding, the muster point specified by militia Major General Gold S. Silliman, who oversaw Fairfield County's defenses. [...] Silliman had mustered a force of 500 volunteers from eastern Connecticut. [...] Under Wooster's direction Arnold and his fellow officers moved their small force toward Danbury so they could intercept and harass the British as they returned to their ships. [...] Wooster divided the force, with Arnold and Silliman leading 400 men {{to the village of}} Ridgefield, Connecticut to block the British march, while he led 200 men to harass the British rear guard. [...] By 11 am on April 27 Wooster's column had caught up with and engaged Tryon's rear guard. [...] In two brief skirmishes, Wooster was mortally wounded, but the action delayed the British long enough for Arnold and Silliman to establish a crude breastwork just north of Ridgefield. [...] In the ensuing battle, the militia companies put up stiff resistance before they were flanked and driven off. [...] Arnold's horse was shot, and when it went down, his leg was pinned under it. [...] Arnold was very nearly bayoneted by a British soldier, but shot him with a pistol and managed to get away with a minor wound to his left leg. [...] The British camped for the night near Ridgefield, and then proceeded <b>on</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> coast, harassed by militia all the way. [...] Arnold and Silliman rallied their troops, which grew to include Continental Army and artillery units as well as militia units from further afield. [...] Arnold eventually established a fairly strong position on Campo Hill (in present-day Westport, Connecticut) near the beach where the British expected to embark. [...] The British managed to elude his attempt to entrap them, and drove off many of the militia with their field artillery before embarking on their ships and sailing back to New York. [...] During the final skirmishing, Arnold had a second horse shot out under him. [...] When Congress learned of the action on May 2, it finally promoted Arnold to major general, although his seniority of rank was behind those promoted in February.|$|E
