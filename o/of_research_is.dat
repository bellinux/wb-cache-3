5|$|Research programs, {{including}} field {{projects such}} as the VORTEX projects (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment), deployment of TOTO (the TOtable Tornado Observatory), Doppler On Wheels (DOW), {{and dozens of other}} programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. Universities, government agencies such as the National Severe Storms Laboratory, private-sector meteorologists, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the National Science Foundation. The pace <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken; gaps in information about the wind, pressure, and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere; and the computing power available for simulation.|$|E

25|$|Another area <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> {{the role}} of nicotinic receptors in {{schizophrenia}} and smoking.

25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{principles of}} the wind tunnel work equally on watercraft, except the water is more viscous and so sets greater forces on the object being tested. A looping flume is typically used for underwater aquadynamic testing. The interaction between {{two different types of}} fluids means that pure wind tunnel testing is only partly relevant.

One area where this has been attempted is the specific domain area of social anxiety in those who stutter.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{fundamental}} inventions {{came from the}} Bell Labs, the innovations for manufacturing commercially viable tantalum electrolytic capacitors were done by the researchers of the Sprague Electric Company. Preston Robinson, Sprague's Director <b>of</b> <b>Research,</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to be the}} actual inventor of tantalum capacitors in 1954. His invention was supported by R. J. Millard, who introduced the “reform” step in 1955, a significant improvement in which the dielectric of the capacitor was repaired after each dip-and-convert cycle of MnO2 deposition. This dramatically reduced the leakage current of the finished capacitors.|$|E

25|$|An {{active area}} <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> the {{univalent}} foundations {{and related to}} it homotopy type theory. Here, sets may be defined as certain kinds of types, with universal properties of sets arising from higher inductive types. Principles such as the axiom of choice and {{the law of the}} excluded middle appear in a spectrum of different forms, some of which can be proven, others which correspond to the classical notions; this allows for a detailed discussion of the effect of these axioms on mathematics.|$|E
25|$|An organic {{light-emitting}} diode (OLED) is a {{light-emitting diode}} (LED) {{in which the}} emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound that emits light {{in response to an}} electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes; typically, {{at least one of these}} electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs. A major area <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{myoclonus}} {{is supported}} through the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

Determining the extent that genetics play in these abnormalities may lead to potential treatments for their reversal, potentially correcting the loss of inhibition while enhancing mechanisms in the body that would compensate for their effects.|$|E
