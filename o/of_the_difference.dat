5|$|Tabram {{was killed}} on 7 August 1888; she had {{suffered}} 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and {{the closeness of the}} location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date to those of the later Ripper murders led police to link them. The attack differs from the canonical murders in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen, and many experts do not connect it with the later murders because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in the wound pattern.|$|E

5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are a consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility {{as they can be}} dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They {{are also more likely to}} be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E
5|$|Adding to the problems, the zip fuel {{program was}} {{canceled}} in 1959. After burning, the fuel turned into liquids and solids that increased wear on moving turbine engine components. Although the B-70 {{was intended to}} use zip only in the afterburners, and thus avoid this problem, the enormous cost of the zip program for such limited gains led to its cancellation. This by itself was not a fatal problem, however, as newly developed high-energy fuels like JP-6 were available to make up some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference.</b> Most of the range lost in the change from zip fuel was restored by filling {{one of the two}} bomb bays with a fuel tank. However, another problem arose when the F-108 program was canceled in September 1959, which ended the shared development that benefited the B-70 program.|$|E
5|$|Construction of a {{connection}} between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in level, a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The lift was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys, with small electric motors to overcome friction. The new lift was built {{over the top of the}} old one, so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J A Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus uses a proprietary, {{in-house}} engine {{referred to}} as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded on the engine created for their previous game, Daxter (2006), to include a fluid and cloth simulator. The camera system was modified to cater to the fixed cinematic camera for God of War gameplay, and the lighting system was reworked to aid in presenting realistic graphics. The game was originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222megahertz (MHz) processor. Ready at Dawn repeatedly contacted Sony regarding increasing the clock speed of the PSP on account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> to the game and had developed a version of the game with higher speed. Sony released a firmware upgrade that allowed games to use the full 333MHz processor. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence. The upgrade, however, noticeably decreased battery life. After the game's completion, Game Director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.|$|E
5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found that half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When {{taking into account the}} health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the Beti {{at large}} detested French forced labour {{practices}} and taxes. Some people {{fled to the}} bush before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or waiting {{until the last minute}} to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference.</b> To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{eventually}} cost R$965million, 15% {{more than}} originally estimated. The two-year delay in receiving BNDES funds caused {{an increase of}} R$108million to the cost because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in interest between loans taken from regular banks and from the government agency. Temporary structures {{were included in the}} total cost, currently estimated to be R$77million. After the sale of the tax credits received, Corinthians will have to pay between R$700 and R$750million spread over 12 years. AnÃ­bal Coutinho projected the stadium to generate R$150million per year. Andres Sanchez expects revenue to reach R$200million per year and expenses to be up to R$35million per year. Revenue will come from ticket sales and commercial properties in the arena, especially corporate conventions, fairs and events. On 25 August 2013, Andres said that out of 16 naming rights properties, he had already secured seven buyers, although no deals had yet been formalised. The club plans to sell the stadium naming rights for R$400million for 20 years.|$|E

Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process.
