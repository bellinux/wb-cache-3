A partial record of this hydrothermal activity is preserved by hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblages and fluid inclusions oc-curring in barren and mineralized parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district. These features provide constraints on <b>the</b> hydrologic interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mineralizing system. Surficial exposures contain alteration assemblages which reflect two distinct fluid types that are known to occur in <b>the</b> shallow parts <b>of</b> active hydrothermal systems. The hydrothermal mineral assemblage comprising quartz, calcite, illite, or interlayered illite-montmorillonite, plus or minus chlorite, pyrite, or adularia occurs in scattered exposures around the district and indicates the former widespread presence of near-neutral pH chloride waters. Fluid in-clusion data in barren exposures <b>outh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district center indicate that these fluids were dilute, containing less than 5 wt percent NaC 1 equiv and had temperatures in <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 160 ø to 240 øC. <b>The</b> assemblage <b>of</b> kaolinite, plus or minus alunite and natroalunite, occurs locally above blind orebodies in <b>the</b> southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district and in outlying exposure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Dimethyl su fide, methane sulfonate, non-sea-salt sulfate and {{sulfur dioxide}} {{concentrations}} i air were obtained uring a cruise between the U. K. and the Antarctic {{during the period}} October 1992 -January 1993. In equatorial regions (30 °N to 30 °S) the atmospheric DMS concentration ranged from 3 to 46 ng (S) m- 3 {{with an average of}} 18 ng(S) m- 3. In the polar waters and regions <b>outh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Falkland Islands concentrations from 3 to 714 ng(S) m- 3 were observed with a mean concentration of 73 ng(S) m- 3. Methane sullbnate concentrations were also enhanced inthe vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Antarctic Peninsula nd in the Weddell Sea. A simple model of DMS oxidation was used to estimate the ocean to atmosphere flux rate, and this was found to be within <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> previous estimates, with a mean value of 1011 ng (S) m- z h- 1.

The project provided <b>the</b> s ervices <b>of</b> consultants in park management, forest genetic resource conservation, and deer f armingA complete description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cuc Phuong National Park was prepared, as well as a document on national parks and protected areas planning; the latter was tr anslated into Vietnamese for <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ministry <b>of</b> Forestry. <b>The</b> immediate creation <b>of</b> a n elementary protection service and of study groups for undertaking inventories of resources were recommended to strengthen national park management. In the long term, it would be necessary to develop a more permanent protection service, complete the resource inventory surveys, create the basic facilities in the parks, and prepare a programme for l ong-term park managementThe project also reviewed forest and vegetation cover in <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> Cuc Phuong, and advised on genetic resources conservation. For <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> th ese resources, the basic requirements were training for patrol staff, and <b>the</b> prepar ation <b>of</b> management base maps. It was recommended that all species currently believed to be endemic should be included in <b>the</b> programme <b>of</b> ex situ conservation: a set of v oucher specimens of seed source trees should be deposited in the herbarium and special care should be taken to label seed from different sources, indicating precise parent treesThe potential for increasing deer farming in the area surrounding Cu c Phuong was high, particularly for small-scale industry in the abandoned fields to <b>the</b> s <b>outh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park. The project established a list of priority taxa for conservation, and it was recommended that Cuc Phuong National Park serve as an educational centre for local farmers, to promote interest in deer farming.
