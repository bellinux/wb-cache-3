5|$|Despite {{transitioning}} into an extratropical cyclone {{during its}} passage of Japan, Linfa still maintained strong winds, which caused heavy damage to susceptible structures. The highest wind associated with Linfa in Japan was clocked at 119km/h (74mph) in Murotomisaki, Kōchi Prefecture. Operations on the Tōhoku Main Line were delayed {{as a result}} of strong winds onset by Linfa. Wind gusts as high as 55km/h (35mph) in Nakatsugawa in Tochigi Prefecture caused the complete destruction of at least five buildings and damaged several others, resulting in ¥$760,000 (US$6,400) in damage. More considerable damage occurred in Shiga Prefecture, where strong winds caused damage to greenhouses and nearby crops, accruing ¥36.75million (US$308,700) in damage. In addition, two people were injured after winds threw a section <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> into the car they were occupying.|$|E

There are two fare control areas. The full-time area at the east end of the station, between 179th and 180th Streets, has a token booth and a bank of 12 turnstiles and two high-exit-only turnstiles. The part-time exit at 178th Street contains a nine-turnstile bank, two high exit entrance turnstiles (HEETs), and two high exit turnstiles. The two ends are connected by a full-length mezzanine, which features Our Spectrum of Support artwork by Reginald Polynice, a set <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> cutout figures appearing to hold up the ceiling of the mezzanine. The station also features a control tower. The station is ADA-accessible via an elevator installed at 179th Place {{on the north side of}} Hillside Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Strike began {{development}} as a game for the 3DO under the working title of 32-bit Strike. Strike series creator Mike Posehn assisted in early programming and the design but otherwise {{did not wish to}} work as part of a large team, necessitated by the move to a more advanced console. The development team, who had already spent several months working on the 3DO version, decided to rework it instead as a PlayStation game when {{it was clear that the}} 3DO's demise was inevitable; an additional two years' labor time was the result. The team re-evaluated the basics of the 16-bit games and aimed to create more lifelike environments and enemy behaviour. The 3D engine - created by the Road Rash 3DO team - used satellite images of real topography, imposed on polygonal maps. It also modified the preceding isometric viewpoint - which caused buildings to obstruct the player's view - to an overhead perspective with which the player could move and see over terrain and structures. In order to ensure proper spatial relations and unit placement, the team built three dimensional reliefs of each mission on sheets <b>of</b> <b>plywood.</b> Unlike some of its predecessors, Soviet Strike features only a helicopter - albeit with power-ups in some levels - and the team also abandoned the unpopular on-foot levels found in Urban Strike. The developers aimed to include more humour in the game, with other additions being voice-overs and full motion video.|$|E

40|$|It is {{our purpose}} of this study to {{determine}} the optimum adhesive condition of lauan veneer on the surface of hardboard bearing mesh marks on the both side, and to make a comparative study of Young 2 ̆ 7 s moduli <b>of</b> hardboard-core <b>plywood</b> with those <b>of</b> veneer-core <b>plywood.</b> The hardboard are manufactured from lauan chip under the investgated optimum condition as reported previously. The following conclusions may be drawn from the results of this experiment: (1) The optimum adhesive condition between hardboard and lauan veneer for manufacturing hardboard-core plywood with the strongest Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, by phenol resin, is as follow: filler (coconut husk powder) 15 p. h. r. glue spread 200 gr/m^ 2 specific pressure 15 kp/cm^ 2 press temperature 150 °C press time 5 min (2) At first, the hardboard having the highest Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus was manufactured from chip, unip, under the condition that we searched for previous studies. Then hardboard-core plywoods were manufactured from fore-mentioned hardboard and lauan veneer under the previously determined condition which gives the highest Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus. The properties <b>of</b> manufactured hardboard-core <b>plywood,</b> and veneer-core plywood are showed on the table 5. (3) Because of reinforcement by veneer, the Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus <b>of</b> hardboard-core <b>plywood</b> have almost equal value <b>of</b> veneer-core <b>plywood</b> having similar thikness, but the hardboard-core plywood have only half value of the specific Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus comparing with that <b>of</b> veneer-core <b>plywood</b> (Table 5) ...|$|R

In this study, magnesium oxychloride cement-based (MOC) inorganic adhesives {{are presented as}} an effective and sustainable binder for plywood applications. The phase composition, microstructure, and thermal stability of the adhesives prepared with different ratios of MgO/MgCl 2 were investigated. In addition, the dry and wet shear strength and the combustion behavior <b>of</b> the <b>plywood</b> were also examined. The {{results indicated that the}} limiting oxygen index (LOI) values <b>of</b> the <b>plywood</b> bonded by the MOC adhesives were higher than those <b>of</b> the <b>plywood</b> bonded by urea-formaldehyde resin. The active MgO/MgCl 2 molar ratio of 7 was the optimal ratio for the dry and wet shear strength <b>of</b> the <b>plywood</b> with values <b>of</b> 1. 02 and 0. 88 MPa, respectively, which meet the interior use panel (Type II plywood) requirements. These improvements were ascribed to the increasing ratio of MgO/MgCl 2 that facilitated the formation of an excellent microstructure. Meanwhile, the continuous hydration phase strengthened the interaction between the MOC adhesive and the wood. With these improved properties, MOC adhesive is expected to be widely used for industrial applications in plywood fabrication...|$|R
