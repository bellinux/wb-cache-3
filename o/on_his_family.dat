5|$|Merrick was {{becoming}} a greater financial burden <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> and eventually, his father secured him a hawker's licence which enabled him to earn money selling items from the haberdashery shop, door to door.

Housewives refused to open doors for him and now people not only stared at him but began to follow him out of curiosity. Merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself.
