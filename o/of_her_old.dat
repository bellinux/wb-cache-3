5|$|Meanwhile, Wombosi {{continues}} to obsess over the attempt on his life. Conklin, having anticipated this, planted {{a body in}} the Paris morgue to appear as the assailant, but Wombosi is not fooled and threatens to report this and other CIA secrets to the media. The Professor assassinates Wombosi on Conklin's orders. Bourne, posing as Kane, learns about Wombosi's yacht, and that the assailant had been shot twice in the back during the escape; he realizes {{that he was the}} assailant.

Under pressure from Abbott to tie off the Wombosi matter entirely, Conklin tracks Bourne's location and sends the Professor there, but Bourne shoots him twice with Eamon's shotgun, mortally wounding him. The Professor reveals their shared connection to Treadstone before dying. Bourne sends Marie, Eamon, and Eamon's children away for their protection, and then contacts Conklin via the Professor's phone to arrange a meeting. From a rooftop near the arranged location in Paris, Bourne sees Conklin has brought backup, so he abandons the meeting, but uses the opportunity to place a tracking device on Conklin's car, leading Bourne to Treadstone's safe house.|$|E
5|$|Sharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. She {{tells them}} both {{she will not}} kill herself, and after {{settling}} old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>old</b> friend Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). She decides {{she wants to be}} remembered as a strong woman, not as weak in her bed, and takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her sleep that night. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016, and Phil is due to do a eulogy to her there but gets too emotional and runs home.

25|$|The third first-person {{narration}} from Alhambra follows, {{which is}} much the same as the second. We then have “The End”, which takes us to the Smart home once they return from holiday. The house has been emptied of all possessions – we must assume, as the family do, by Amber – leaving nothing but the answering machine, which contains messages forcing Magnus, Michael and Eve to face up to their past. Magnus and Astrid seem freed and excited by the experience of losing their possessions, their past – Michael also seems to find some redemption. Eve, however, runs away from the family, embarking on a round-the-world tour – eventually ending up in America, where she goes in search <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>old</b> family home. “The End” ends, ominously, with Eve seeming to take up Amber’s mantle, arriving at someone’s house as an uninvited guest. The book then finishes with a short section from Alhambra, reinforcing her connection to the cinema.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the Hogettes {{can be traced to}} October 1983 when Michael Torbert (Mikey T.), founder of the group, went to a Halloween party at his grandmother's {{retirement}} home wearing one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>old</b> dresses as a costume. [...] The costume was such a hit that he gathered a group of men who he [...] "thought were tough enough to go out in public in a dress." [...] The group would go to children's hospitals to cheer up sick children. [...] On November 27, 1983, the group attended their first Washington Redskins football game in full drag, but with the addition of pig snout masks, in reference to The Hogs, the nickname of the Redskins offensive line players.|$|E

500|$|As they {{continue}} to grow and mature, the girls have many disappointing encounters which leave them fearful of the loneliness that must await them in this foreign country where they struggle hopelessly to fit in and be understood. Even as a grown woman, returning to her Dominican roots, Yolanda finds she can never truly escape the fear that has hovered over her {{for as long as}} she can remember. This is evident in the very first chapter, [...] "Antojos", as Alvarez reveals the panic evoked in the adult Yolanda at the sudden realization that she is stranded in a guava field in the Dominican Republic, where women do not go about unchaperoned at night. Alvarez evokes Yolanda's fear as she reports that [...] "the rustling leaves of the guava trees echo the warnings <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>old</b> aunts: you will get lost, you will get kidnapped, you will get raped, you will get killed".|$|E

[...] Linda advises Mei-li to put on one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>old</b> stripper dresses to attract Ta, but the stratagem backfires, since Ta is attracted to Mei-li because of her wholesomeness. [...] Ta and Mei-li quarrel; she takes her flower drum and leaves Club Chop Suey.|$|E
500|$|She {{temporarily}} mounted an imported Heinkel aircraft catapult {{atop the}} third turret between 1930 and 1933. It {{was transferred to}} the cruiser [...] when Sevastopol began the first stage of her reconstruction in November 1933. This was based on that done for her sister Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya, but was even more extensive. Her rear superstructure was enlarged and a new structure was built just forward of it which required the repositioning of the mainmast forward. This did not leave enough room for a derrick, as was fitted in Marat, and two large booms were fitted to handle aircraft while the existing boat cranes remained in place. The mast had to be reinforced by two short legs to handle the weight of the booms and their loads. Her false bow was reworked into a real forecastle like those fitted to her sisters. All twenty-five <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>old</b> boilers were replaced by a dozen oil-fired boilers originally intended for the s. The space saved was used to add another inboard longitudinal watertight bulkhead that greatly improved her underwater protection.|$|E
