5|$|The advent in {{the mid-1990s}} of ’no-frills’ carriers, such as easyJet, has had a {{significant}} impact on air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5million passengers, up from just 4.3million in 1996. They are responsible for the growth of regional airports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations, serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier. The annual rate of growth in the <b>overall</b> <b>demand</b> for air travel has remained stable since 1975, averaging 5.8 per cent annually. Recent growth is being serviced by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which, since 2000, have experienced flat or declining traffic levels. In response, traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price, leading to lower prices on the short haul routes serviced by this sector, especially in business fares. They have also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launched no-frills subsidiaries of their own.|$|E
25|$|Economic growth: Ontario's GDP {{growth has}} varied between 2% and 3% in recent years, and is {{expected}} to average 3.0% over the next few years. Although electricity per unit of GDP has been falling in the past few years, the total rate of economic growth will result in increased <b>overall</b> <b>demand.</b> This overall increase, however, is significantly smaller than the rate of economic or population growth, showing that electricity demand is decoupled from these two growth rates, a pattern that is recently being replicated in other areas of Canada and other G7 countries.|$|E
25|$|Ocean Reef Senior High School was {{responsible}} for Year 8–12 education for the suburb from its inception until 1990, when Belridge Senior High School opened for Year 8 students. Belridge was primarily opened to reduce <b>overall</b> <b>demand</b> at Ocean Reef due to high demand for its advanced programs and its inability to take students from within its primary catchment area. From its opening in 1990 until 1995, Belridge progressively expanded its age range until becoming a full secondary school in 1995 when the first class of graduating Year Twelve students commenced their studies.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{industrialization}} on an economy's <b>overall</b> <b>demands</b> for skill cannot be deduced on purely a priori grounds, but depends, rather, on such variables as {{the character of}} the agricultural sector at the onset of industrialization, the particular industries in which manufacturing employment is concentrated, and the distribution of tertiary-sector employment between professional, technical, and scientific occupations, and such relatively low-skill occupations as demestic service. An examination of the evolution of the Massachusetts economy between 1820 and 1880 concludes that there was no major increase in the <b>overall</b> <b>demands</b> for skilled and educated labor during this period, at least before 1870. ...|$|R
30|$|We {{test this}} {{proposition}} by checking for differential effects of <b>overall</b> labour <b>demand</b> across {{varying levels of}} occupation-specific demand.

25|$|The Prime Minister of Finland (2003–2010) Mr. Matti Vanhanen has {{mentioned}} {{that he wants to}} see more electric cars on Finnish roads as soon as possible and with any cost to the governmental car related tax incomes. Charging at home from motor and cabin heating outlets (common in all Nordic countries) has been determined to be a possible load on the grid, although this load is expected to mainly take place at night when <b>overall</b> <b>demand</b> is lower. If all cars in Finland run totally on electricity, it will add 7-9 TWh annually to the load, which corresponds to 10% of Finland's annual consumption.|$|E

[...] Berman et al. give an example from economics, where a dataset suggests <b>overall</b> <b>demand</b> is positively correlated with price (that is, higher prices lead to more demand), in contradiction of expectation. [...] Analysis reveals time to be the confounding variable: plotting both price and demand against time reveals the expected negative correlation over various periods, which then reverses to become positive if the influence of time is ignored by simply plotting demand against price.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Overall</b> <b>demand</b> for the 747-8 {{turned out}} to be below Boeing's initial {{projections}} as well, which led to several reductions in production rate. Production was initially decreased from 2 to 1.75 aircraft per month in April 2013 and then reduced further to 1.5 aircraft per month in October 2013. [...] On June 25, 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that the order backlog was down to 32 and Boeing had decided to reduce production to one aircraft per month in 2016. [...] In January 2016, Boeing confirmed that it was reducing 747-8 production to 0.5 per month beginning in September 2016, incurring a $569 million post-tax charge against its fourth-quarter 2015 profits. The chief reason given was that the recovery of the air cargo market had stalled, resulting in slowed demand for the 747 freighter.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{founding}} of Potosi in 1545, Spanish settlers traveled {{from there to the}} Cintis to give birth, it being too cold and socially turbulent in Potosi. This would create an early connection between this wine region and the imperial city. [...] Subsequently, residents of Potosi who acquired wealth founded villas in the valley of the Cintis. [...] By 1585 this area became the major center of wine and singani production initiating many of the first non-monastic commercial ventures. [...] During the 16th Century, Turuchipa was listed as delivering [...] "vinos endebles" [...] (weak wine) to Potosi, while Cinti delivered wine and distilled liquor. [...] At that time each household in Potosi was observed to possess eight to ten [...] "cántaros" [...] or amphora-like jugs of alcoholic drink. [...] This plus population estimates of 100,000 to 200,000 would provide some sense of the <b>overall</b> <b>demand</b> for wine, chicha, and liquor at that time and place.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1980s, {{passive solar}} {{building}} design and passive house have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without active energy harvesting. For new builds, and with expert design, {{this can be}} accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building. Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design. Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building. A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels (costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kWh production, U.S. dollar equivalent) may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%. A [...] high seasonal energy efficiency ratio 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7kW of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating, and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation. Passive cooling, and superior system engineering techniques, can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70% to 90%. Photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the <b>overall</b> <b>demand</b> for electricity is lower.|$|E
