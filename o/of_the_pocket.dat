5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> boroughs {{abolished}} by the Reform Act {{belonged to}} the Tory Party.

The tenants-at-will thereby enfranchised typically voted as instructed by their landlords, who in turn normally supported the Tory party. This concession, together with the Whig Party's internal divisions and the difficulties faced by the nation's economy, allowed the Tories under Sir Robert Peel to make gains in the elections of 1835 and 1837, and to retake the House of Commons in 1841.|$|E

Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50am and the NTSB arrived on the scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The NTSB ruled the crash was due to the train operator's failure to follow standard procedures and WMATA management for failure to provide proper supervision of the train operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration of the train identification and destination codes leading to the routing of the train into the pocket track.|$|E

A 5-yard false start penalty against Virginia Tech was offset by a pass interference penalty two plays later by Stanford.

40|$|Recent quantum {{oscillation}} {{experiments in}} underdoped high temperature superconductors seem to imply two paradoxes. The first paradox concerns <b>the</b> apparent non-existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electron <b>pockets</b> in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The second paradox {{is a clear}} signature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no evidence as yet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding hole <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> approximately double <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electron <b>pocket.</b> This hole pockets should be present if the Fermi surface reconstruction {{is due to a}} commensurate density wave, assuming that Luttinger sum rule relating <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> and <b>the</b> total number <b>of</b> charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these apparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address the first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to correlated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the materials studied in quantum oscillations. <b>The</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectral function is significantly reduced for <b>the</b> electron <b>pockets</b> for an intermediate range of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half <b>the</b> hole <b>pocket</b> is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer matrix calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder affects <b>the</b> electron <b>pocket</b> more significantly than <b>the</b> hole <b>pocket.</b> However, when, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included, it wipes out the frequency corresponding to <b>the</b> hole <b>pocket.</b> Thus, if we are correct, {{it will be necessary to}} do measurements at higher magnetic fields and even higher quality samples to recover <b>the</b> hole <b>pocket</b> frequency.

5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 20 German infantry and armoured divisions {{trapped in the}} Falaise pocket around 12 were still operating {{with a degree of}} combat-effectiveness. As these formations retreated eastwards they fought desperately to keep the jaws of the encirclement—formed by the Canadians in Trun and St. Lambert, and the Poles and Americans in Chambois—from closing. German movement out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> throughout the night of 19 August cut off the Polish battlegroups on the Mont Ormel ridge. On discovering this Stefanowicz conferred with Koszutski. Lacking sufficient means to either seal the pocket or fight their way clear, the two decided that the only chance of survival for their force was to hold fast until relieved. Although the Polish soldiers on Point 262N could hear movement from the valley below, other than some mortar rounds that landed among the positions of the 8th Infantry Battalion the night passed uneventfully. Without possession of Point 262S the Poles were unable to interfere with the large numbers of German troops slipping past the southern slopes of the ridge. The uneven, wooded terrain, interspersed with thick hedgerows, made control of the ground to the west and southwest difficult by day and impossible by night. As it grew light on 20 August Szydłowski prepared to fulfil his orders of the previous day and organised two companies of his 9th Infantry Battalion, supported by the 1st Armoured Regiment, for an attack across the road towards Point 262S. However, hampered by the wreckage littering the pass the attack soon bogged down in the face of fierce German resistance.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August, in {{conjunction}} with American movements northward to Chambois, Canadian forces launched Operation Tractable; the Allied intention was to trap and destroy the German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army {{near the town of}} Falaise. Five days later, the two arms of the encirclement were almost complete; the advancing U.S. 90th Infantry Division had made contact with the Polish 1st Armored Division and the first Allied units crossed the Seine at Mantes Gassicourt, while German units were fleeing eastward by any means they could find. By 22 August, the Falaise Pocket — which the Germans had been fighting desperately to keep open to allow their trapped forces to escape — was finally sealed, ending the Battle of Normandy with a major Allied victory. All German forces west of the Allied lines were now dead or in captivity and although perhaps 100,000 German troops escaped they left behind 40,000–50,000 prisoners and over 10,000 dead. A total of 344 tanks and self-propelled guns, 2,447 soft-skinned vehicles and 252 artillery pieces were found abandoned or destroyed in the northern sector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b> The Allies were able to advance freely through undefended territory and by 25 August all four Allied armies (First Canadian, Second British, First U.S., and Third U.S.) involved in the Normandy campaign were on the river Seine.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Protein−ligand binding {{is a key}} {{biological}} process at the molecular level. The identification and characterization of small-molecule binding sites on therapeutically relevant proteins have tremendous implications for target evaluation and rational drug design. In this work, we used the recently developed level-set variational implicit-solvent model (VISM) with the Coulomb field approximation (CFA) to locate and characterize potential protein− small-molecule binding sites. We applied our method to a data set of 515 protein−ligand complexes and found that 96. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cocrystallized ligands bind to <b>the</b> VISM-CFA-identified <b>pockets</b> and that 71. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identified <b>pockets</b> are occupied by cocrystallized ligands. For 228 tight-binding protein−ligand complexes (i. e, complexes with experimental pKd values larger than 6), 99. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cocrystallized ligands are in <b>the</b> VISM-CFA-identified <b>pockets.</b> In addition, {{it was found that}} the ligand binding orientations are consistent with the hydrophilic and hydrophobic descriptions provided by VISM. Quantitative characterization of binding pockets with topological and physicochemical parameters was used to assess <b>the</b> “ligandability ” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets.</b> <b>The</b> results illustrate the key interactions between ligands and receptors and can be very informative for rational drug design. 1...|$|R
