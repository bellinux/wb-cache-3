500|$|In 1834 {{a second}} edition was {{published}} {{under the name}} Les Chouans ou La Bretagne en 1799.

[...] "If <b>only</b> <b>you</b> knew," [...] he wrote to her, [...] "how much there is of you in every altered phrase of Chouans!" [...] The second edition also demonstrates the author's maturing political philosophy (softening his representation of the royalists), and the evolved female characters testify to his relationship with Hańska.|$|E
