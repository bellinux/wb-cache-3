Most legal restrictions on Roman Catholics were lifted by the Catholic Relief Act 1829, which, however, provides, [...] "nothing herein contained shall … enable any Person, otherwise than as he is now by Law enabled, to hold or enjoy the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Lord High Chancellor, Lord Keeper or Lord Commissioner of the Great Seal". The words [...] "as he is now by Law enabled", however, caused considerable doubt, as it was unclear if Roman Catholics were disqualified from holding the office in the first place. For the removal of all doubt, Parliament passed Lord Chancellor (Tenure <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> and <b>Discharge</b> <b>of</b> Ecclesiastical Functions) Act 1974, declaring that there was never any impediment to the appointment of a Roman Catholic. The Act nevertheless provided that, if a Roman Catholic were appointed to the office, then the Sovereign may temporarily transfer the Lord Chancellor's ecclesiastical functions to the Prime Minister or another minister.|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: Discharge against {{medical advice}} (AMA) has {{negative}} impacts on treatment outcomes {{and health care}} resources. Also, physicians and hospital administrators get involved in litigation. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the causes <b>of</b> AMA <b>discharges</b> in different wards and emergency departments in teaching and nonteaching hospitals affiliated with Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was performed investigating the AMA leaves within 6 months in 2014. Data was obtained from the Department of Medical Records and the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Quality Improvement. Data was recorded in a questionnaire consisting of two parts. Part I included demographic information and Part II was about the reasons <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> against medical advice. Data was aggregated by expert staff in <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Quality Improvement. SPSS V. 18 was applied for data analysis. Results: The prevalence of AMA leaves in emergency department and other wards in teaching hospitals affiliated with Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences was 3. 81 and 4. 38, respectively. These figures in nonteaching hospitals were 8. 38 and 1. 59, respectively. The most common causes <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> against medical advice were partial recovery, lack of trust in service quality, feeling uncomfortable, and emotional reasons. Conclusion: To reduce the rate of AMA leaves and its consequences, health care staff should be supportive towards the patients and communicate effectively in order to build their confidence. © 2016, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.
