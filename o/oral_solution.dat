40|$|Controversy {{continues}} {{regarding the}} optimal composition of glucose electrolyte <b>oral</b> rehydration <b>solutions</b> {{for the treatment}} of acute diarrhoea. Four perfusion models (normal human jejunum, normal rat small intestine, cholera toxin treated secreting rat small intestine and rotavirus infected rat small intestine) have been developed and used to compare the efficacy of a hypotonic <b>oral</b> rehydration <b>solution</b> with standard United Kingdom British National formulary and developing world <b>oral</b> rehydration <b>solutions</b> (WHO). Despite obvious physiological and pathophysiological differences between these models there was general congruence in the water and solute absorption profiles of the different <b>oral</b> rehydration <b>solutions.</b> Hypotonic <b>oral</b> rehydration <b>solution</b> promoted significantly greater water absorption than other <b>oral</b> rehydration <b>solutions</b> in all rat models (p < 0. 001) but apparently increased water absorption failed to achieve significance in human jejunum. British National Formulary-oral rehydration solution was unable to reverse net water secretion in both rotavirus and cholera toxin models. Net sodium absorption from hypotonic and WHO-oral rehydration solutions was significantly greater than from the low sodium British National Formulary-oral rehydration solutions (p < 0. 001) except in the rotavirus model when absorption was similar to hypotonic-oral rehydration solutions. These findings show that there is agreement in the apparent efficacy of <b>oral</b> rehydration <b>solutions</b> in these animal and human perfusion models, and that improved water absorption with adequate sodium absorption may be achieved by reducing <b>oral</b> rehydration <b>solution</b> osmolality...|$|R

Ciclosporin was originally brought to market by Sandoz, now Novartis, under the brand name Sandimmune, which is available as soft gelatin capsules, as an <b>oral</b> <b>solution,</b> and as a formulation for intravenous administration.

Generic ciclosporin preparations have been marketed under various trade names, including Cicloral (Sandoz/Hexal), Gengraf (Abbott) and Deximune (Dexcel Pharma). Since 2002, a topical emulsion of ciclosporin for treating inflammation caused by keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome) has been marketed under the trade name Restasis (0.05%).

Bevirimat was initially evaluated for safety and pharmacokinetics in a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase clinical study in healthy volunteers. It was administered as an <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> in doses of 25, 50, 100, and 250mg.

In one clinical trial, headaches was the most commonly reported side effect of bevirimat, reported by four participants on bevirimat and one on the placebo. The second most common reported side effect was throat discomfort by two participants on bevirimat. No serious adverse effects were reported, all adverse effects reported were mild, and no participants discontinued use of bevirimat because of the adverse effects.|$|E
40|$|Aim: Appropriate {{formulations}} {{are essential}} in pharmacotherapy. This study surveyed {{the use of}} different formulations by children in the community, and examined the reported lack of appropriate formulations (<b>oral</b> <b>solutions)</b> {{in relation to the}} licensing status of drugs. Methods: A cross-sectional study based on 68 019 pharmacy dispensing records was performed in The Netherlands. For each prescription the formulation was assessed, and all prescriptions were categorized: unlicensed (no product licence), off-label (licensed drugs used outside the licence terms) and authorized (licensed drugs used according to the licence). The types of formulation used were assessed in relation to age and licensing status. Results: In all age groups, approximately half of all prescriptions were for oral drugs. The only major age-related trend was within oral drugs: younger children {{were more likely to be}} prescribed <b>oral</b> <b>solutions.</b> For authorized drugs the proportion of tablet/capsules exceeded <b>oral</b> <b>solutions</b> at the age of 7 y, whereas for off-label drugs this occurred at 3 y of age. For those medicines prepared by the pharmacy, tablets and capsules were more likely to be prescribed from the age of 9 y. Conclusion: Many children in the community receive inappropriate oral formulations. Regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry need to ensure that children have access to medicines with appropriate formulations...|$|R

In normal intestine, absorption of water was greater (108 (8. 1) microliters/min/g; p less than 0. 01) and sodium secretion less (- 4. 3 (0. 3) mumol/min/g; p less than 0. 01) from the <b>oral</b> rehydration <b>solution</b> containing bicarbonate than from the solution in which bicarbonate was replaced by chloride ions (59. 5 (7. 2) microliters/min/g and - 7. 8 (0. 8) mumol/min/g, respectively). Glucose absorption in normal intestine was similar with both solutions. In the secreting intestine, both <b>oral</b> rehydration <b>solutions</b> reversed net water secretion to absorption, but inclusion of bicarbonate resulted in significantly less net absorption of both water (2. 18 (6. 9) microliters/min/g; p less than 0. 05) and glucose (18. 7 (2. 1) mumol/min/g; p less than 0. 001) compared with bicarbonate free <b>oral</b> rehydration <b>solution</b> (19. 4 (3. 9) microliters/min/g and 35. 8 (3. 7) mumol/min/g, respectively).

5000|$|Conventional {{itraconazole}} (e.g. Sporanox) has {{relatively low}} bioavailability after oral administration, especially when given in capsule form {{on an empty}} stomach. The capsule form is a molecular dispersion of itraconazole in amorphous HPMC polymer. The fast-dissolving polymer targets a supersaturated solution of itraconazole from which enhanced absorption can be expected. Recently, itraconazole was found {{to contribute to the}} formation of nanofibers in certain simulated intestinal fluids. These nanofibers have a uniform width of 12 nm and a length up to several micrometers. The <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> is better absorbed. The cyclodextrin contained in the <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> can cause an osmotic diarrhea, and if this is a problem, then half the dose can be given as <b>oral</b> <b>solution</b> and half as capsule {{to reduce the amount of}} cyclodextrin given.
