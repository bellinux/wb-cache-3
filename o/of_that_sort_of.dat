500|$|Pipette then {{tries to}} coax {{the old lady}} into leaving, kissing and hugging her, and {{appealing}} to her (hoped for) good nature. The old lady sees through her attempt, and in punishment for her [...] "telling stories" [...] compels her to kiss and cuddle all she meets. She cries out in protest that she's too shy for such behaviour, but the old lady assures her that she'll [...] "get over [...] shyness {{after a year or}} two <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing". Boomblehardt approaches next, and Pipette flings herself on him, crying [...] "Kiss me!". He obliges. She responds, [...] "How dare you take such a liberty! You insolent old man! Kiss me". And so he does. She boxes his ears, much to his confusion, and then retreats into the inn in tears.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, nobody wanted to step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you go make a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people who told me how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E

2500|$|The Château de Chimay is in {{the county}} of , Belgium, near the French border. The holder of the title [...] "Prince of Caraman-Chimay" [...] did so {{rightfully}} and possessed a long and proper noble pedigree. This princely title was of the [...] "foreign prince" [...] type of the old French monarchy, in which [...] "Prince" [...] is a noble rank rather than a method showing the degree of relationship to the crown. The wife <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> prince becomes a [...] "Princess", and so Clara became, entirely legitimately, a European princess. That her husband-to-be was more than twice her age, quite poor, and even, perhaps, not very handsome, {{seems to have been}} of minor consequence. They were married on 20 May 1890, in Paris. Clara was married at age 16 and her husband was 31.|$|E
2500|$|Two prototypes of the T28 were built. They {{underwent}} evaluation at the Aberdeen Proving Ground and Fort Knox facilities until 1947. In 1947 {{one of the}} T28s {{was heavily}} damaged by an engine fire during trials at Yuma Proving Ground and was broken up and sold for scrap. The T28 never went into service due to the obsolete design, expensive maintenance costs, and the heavy weight; prevented it from being transported across seas, but was retained to test the [...] "durability of components on such a heavy vehicle". Work on it ended before completion as the War Department decided to stop the development of vehicles <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> weight and the T28 program terminated in October 1947. By that point the T29 and T30 turreted heavy tank designs had been built. The T29 mounted the same gun as the T28 in a conventional rotating turret. The T30 was developed with a larger-caliber gun and more powerful engine. The T29 program {{was used to test}} mechanical components for future tank designs ...|$|E

Cave commissioned Andrew Dominik to direct One More Time with Feeling—in which Cave discusses the album's writing and recording process after Arthur's death—so that he could address the album's context without conducting interviews with the media.|$|E
