Ultimately Magoon did not take up any <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>new</b> responsibilities and formally entered retirement. He died in Washington, D.C., in 1920 after complications from surgery for acute appendicitis.|$|E
5|$|With {{five months}} devoted to casting for the pilot, Gough and Miller cast {{ultimately}} hired eight actors {{to take on}} the role of series regulars for the first season. Since then, only two characters from the first season have remained regulars through to the eighth season, with seven new actors taking on lead roles from seasons two through eight. Four <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>new</b> actors began as recurring guests in their first seasonal appearance, but were given top billing the following season. As the series progresses, recurring guests appear at various times to help move the overall storyline of the show or just provide a side-story arc for one of the main characters, such as Brainiac or Adam Knight. Other recurring guests appear as background characters, showing up for only a few scenes, which includes characters like Sheriff Nancy Adams or Dr. Virgil Swann.|$|E

25|$|As the war ended, the {{structure}} of the Soviet military was reorganized from a war-time to a peace-time mode. Directive No. 11097 of 10 June 1945 created several new formations, known as Groups of Forces, equivalent to military districts, but used for command and administration of Soviet forces outside the Soviet Union itself. One <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>new</b> formations, at that time 300,000-400,000 strong, was to be stationed in Poland. It was mostly based on the 2nd Belorussian Front of General Konstantin Rokossovsky (formerly stationed around Mecklenburg and Brandenburg). With the exception of Szczecin (Stettin), which fell under the operational territory of the Western Group of Forces, the Northern Group of Forces was located entirely within the territory of Poland.|$|E
25|$|Another rivalry, with Stade Bordelais, {{took its}} place, when clubs from outside Paris were finally {{allowed to play}} in 1899. The teams were going to meet in 7 of the next 10 finals, with Bordeaux winning 5 of them. Yet the most heated one was the first Stade won in 1901. Bordeaux won the match 3–0 on a hotly debated try. Afterwards, Stade accused Bordeaux of fielding three ineligible players: earlier in the year, Stade Bordelais had merged with Bordeaux Université Club to become Stade Bordelais Université Club, but three <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>new</b> players had not been with the club {{for at least three}} months as the rules dictated.

[...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>new</b> seven episodes to be produced. It was also the first South Park Halloween episode. The script was written by Parker, Stone and writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker and Stone, who made the pinkeye a major element of the plot because they associate the illness with the elementary school experience. Parker said, [...] "Pinkeye is just such a huge part of your life when you're in third grade. Pinkeye is the thing every third grader gets and it's just such a bizarre thing." [...] In writing the episode, Parker said he wanted to convey his belief that Halloween is a positive holiday, especially for children: [...] "Halloween's a great thing.

500|$|Known to {{the ancient}} Greeks as ἀδάμας – adámas ("proper", [...] "unalterable", [...] "unbreakable") and {{sometimes}} called adamant, diamond is the hardest known naturally occurring material, scoring 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. Diamond is extremely strong owing {{to the structure of}} its carbon atoms, where each carbon atom has four neighbors joined to it with covalent bonds. The material boron nitride, when in a form structurally identical to diamond (zincblende structure), is nearly as hard as diamond; a currently hypothetical material, beta carbon nitride, may also be as hard or harder in one form. It has been shown that some diamond aggregates having nanometer grain size are harder and tougher than conventional large diamond crystals, thus they perform better as abrasive material. Owing to the use <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>new</b> ultra-hard materials for diamond testing, more accurate values are now known for diamond hardness. A surface perpendicular to the [...] crystallographic direction (that is the longest diagonal of a cube) of a pure (i.e., type IIa) diamond has a hardness value of 167GPa when scratched with an nanodiamond tip, while the nanodiamond sample itself has a value of 310GPa when tested with another nanodiamond tip. Because the test only works properly with a tip made of harder material than the sample being tested, the true value for nanodiamond is likely somewhat lower than 310GPa.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, a {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study of the}} rbcL gene showed Gilliesia and related genera clustering in a separate clade at subfamilial level. The authors rejected the proposal of Traub (1982) of a separate family, Gilliesiaceae (later resurrected by Ravenna), but rather created the Gilliesioideae, as one of three subfamilies within Alliaceae, together with Allioideae and Tulbaghioideae. As phylogenetically constructed, Gilliesioideae (Gilliesioideae (Lindl.) Am., Botany: 134. 1832 - Gilliesieae Lindl. in Bot. Reg.: ad t. 992. 1826. - Type: Gilliesia Lindl.) consisted <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>New</b> World Alliaceae {{not included in the}} other two subfamilies, which included both the former Gilliesieae (Ancrumia, Erinna, Gethyum, Gilliesia, Miersia, Solaria and Trichlora) together with Ipheion, Leucocoryne, Nothoscordum, and Tristagma.

[...] This is the circumscription which the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) accepted in the APG classification of 1998 and which later became known as Alliaceae sensu stricto (s.s.). In the 2003 update (APGII) it was proposed to include Agapanthaceae and Amaryllidaceae under Alliaceae, while recognising an argument for renaming the overarching family from Alliaceae to Amaryllidaceae.|$|E
