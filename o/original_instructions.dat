25|$|There, over {{a three-day}} period in October 1518, Luther defended himself under {{questioning}} by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan. The Pope's right to issue indulgences {{was at the}} centre of the dispute between the two men. The hearings degenerated into a shouting match. More than writing his theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope. Cajetan's <b>original</b> <b>instructions</b> had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant, but the legate desisted from doing so. Luther slipped out of the city at night, unbeknownst to Cajetan.|$|E
25|$|Thielmann {{intended}} {{that the}} 9th Brigade should be posted {{in rear of}} this general disposition of his troops, so that its services might be made available according as circumstances might require; but through some misunderstanding in the transmission of the order, General Borcke was induced, after having moved along the Brussels road until near La Bawette, thence to turn off to his left, and continue his march, according to his <b>original</b> <b>instructions</b> {{in the direction of}} Fromont, Bourgeois, and Saint-Lambert, towards Couture-Saint-Germain; being under the impression that the whole corps had already commenced this march, in pursuance of the general plan, and that his brigade was destined to cover the movement.|$|E

25|$|The {{change in}} timing rushed {{preparations}} for the operations, which were hasty and imperfect as a result. The <b>original</b> <b>instructions</b> for the second Transjordan operations contained only a general statement that considerable help might be counted on from the Beni Sakhr and that Chauvel should keep in close touch with them. GHQ had no clear idea of {{the capabilities of the}} Beni Sakhr, but GHQ fitted them into Chauvel's battle and Allenby ordered Chauvel to attack on 30 April. All this happened without asking the opinion of either T. E. Lawrence or Captain Hubert Young, Lawrence's liaison officer with the Beni Sakhr, who was aware that the leader of the Arabs around Madaba was both perplexed and frightened by GHQ's reaction to his envoys. Lawrence was in Jerusalem during the Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt operations and claimed no knowledge of the Beni Sakhr, or their leader.|$|E
25|$|Knowing the {{strategic}} value of Pearl River Delta to China and aware that British naval superiority made a reconquest {{of the region}} unlikely, Qishan attempted to prevent the war for widening further by negotiating a peace treaty with Britain. On 21 January Qishan and Elliot drafted the Convention of Chuenpi, a document which both parties hoped would end the war. The convention would establish equal diplomatic rights between Britain and China, exchange Hong Kong Island for Chusan, and reopen trade in Canton by 1 February 1841. China would also pay six millions of silver dollars as recompense for the opium destroyed at Humen in 1838. The status of the opium trade was left open to be discussed at a future date. Despite {{the success of the}} negotiations between Qishan and Elliot, both of their respective governments refused to sign the convention. The Daoguang Emperor was infuriated that Qing territory would be given up in a treaty that had been signed without his permission, and ordered Qishan arrested (who was later sentenced to death, then commuted to military service.) Lord Palmerston recalled Elliot from his post and refused to sign the convention, wanting more concessions to be forced from the Chinese per his <b>original</b> <b>instructions.</b>|$|E

The <b>original</b> <b>instructions</b> for Operation Hard-surface were that American planes would [...] "attack and destroy" [...] any intruders over Saudi air space, but were later changed to read that the Saudis could defend {{themselves}} if attacked. Bunker evidently stuck to the original formula and stressed that if only Faisal would halt his aid to the royalists, the US would be able pressure Nasser to withdraw. Faisal eventually accepted the offer, and Bunker went on to meet with Nasser in Beirut, where the Egyptian President repeated the assurance he had given Bunche.|$|E

500|$|As part {{of reforms}} of the {{university}} in the 19th century, the University of Oxford commissioners laid down new statutes for the chair in 1881, replacing Savile's <b>original</b> <b>instructions</b> and requirements. The 1881statute provided that the professor was to [...] "lecture and give instruction in theoretical and practical Astronomy", and {{was to be a}} Fellow of New College. The electors for the professorship were to be the Warden of New College (or a person nominated by the college in his place), the Chancellor of the university, the President of the Royal Society, the Astronomer Royal, the Radcliffe Observer, a person nominated by the university council and one other nominated by New College. Changes to the university's internal legislation in the 20th and early 21st centuries abolished specific statutes for the duties of, and rules for appointment to, individual chairs such as the Savilian professorships. The University Council is now empowered to make appropriate arrangements for appointments and conditions of service, with the college to which any professorship is allocated (New College {{in the case of the}} Savilian chairs) to have two representatives on the board of electors. The professorship is one of two permanent chairs attached to Oxford's Sub-Department of Astrophysics.|$|E
500|$|The {{combined}} Franco-Spanish fleet put to sea on 19 October 1805, and by 21 October was {{in sight}} of the British ships. Nelson formed up his lines and the British began to converge on their distant opponents. Contrary to his <b>original</b> <b>instructions,</b> Nelson took {{the lead of the}} weather column in Victory. Concerned for the commander-in-chief's safety in such an exposed position, Henry Blackwood, a long-standing friend of Nelson and commander of the frigate [...] that day, suggested that Nelson come aboard his ship to better observe and direct the battle. Nelson refused, so Blackwood instead tried to convince him to let Harvey come past him in the Temeraire, and so lead the column into battle. Nelson agreed to this, and signalled for Harvey to come past him. As Temeraire drew up towards Victory, Nelson decided that if he was standing aside to let another ship lead his line, so too should Collingwood, commanding the lee column of ships. He signalled Collingwood, aboard his flagship , to let another ship come ahead of him, but Collingwood continued to surge ahead. Reconsidering his plan, Nelson is reported to have hailed the Temeraire, as she came up alongside Victory, with the words [...] "I'll thank you, Captain Harvey, to keep in your proper station, which is astern of the Victory". Nelson's instruction was followed up by a formal signal and Harvey dropped back reluctantly, but otherwise kept within one ship's length of Victory as she sailed up to the Franco-Spanish line.|$|E
500|$|Organized {{crimes against}} civilians, {{including}} women and children, {{were carried out}} on a huge scale by the German police and military forces, {{as well as the}} local collaborators. Under the command of the Reich Main Security Office, the Einsatzgruppen killing squads conducted large-scale massacres of Jews and communists in conquered Soviet territories. Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg puts the number of Jews murdered by [...] "mobile killing operations" [...] at 1,400,000. The <b>original</b> <b>instructions</b> to kill [...] "Jews in party and state positions" [...] was broadened to include [...] "all male Jews of military age" [...] and was expanded once more to [...] "all male Jews regardless of age." [...] By the end of July, the Germans were regularly killing women and children. On 18 December 1941, Himmler and Hitler discussed the [...] "Jewish question", and Himmler noted the meeting's result in his appointment book: [...] "To be annihilated as partisans." [...] According to Christopher Browning, this represented the Nazi decision of [...] "annihilating Jews and solving the so-called 'Jewish question' under the cover of killing partisans." [...] In accordance with Nazi policies against [...] "inferior" [...] Asian peoples, Turkmens were also persecuted. According to a post-war report by Prince Veli Kajum Khan, they were imprisoned in concentration camps in terrible conditions, where those deemed to have [...] "Mongolian" [...] features were murdered daily. Asians were also targeted by the Einsatzgruppen and were the subjects of lethal medical experiments and murder at a [...] "pathological institute" [...] in Kiev. Hitler received reports of the mass killings conducted by the Einsatzgruppen which were first conveyed to the RSHA, where they were aggregated into a summary report by Gestapo Chief Heinrich Müller.|$|E

Jurors were instructed that they must consider the witness's state of mind, that if they found that Bronston [...] "fully understood the questions put to him but nevertheless gave false answers knowing the same to be false", they should convict him.

2500|$|Hearing of the plans, Danish {{archaeologist}} Søren Telling – {{aware that}} all archaeological investigation {{was under the}} ultimate jurisdiction of SS chief Heinrich Himmler – immediately telephoned both {{the head of the}} SS's archaeological department, Amt für Ahnenerbe ("Office for ancestral heritage"), and Himmler himself. Telling argued strongly against the destruction of an important remnant of [...] "Aryan civilization" [...] and Himmler authorized him to stop the construction of the anti-tank trench. He informed Telling that a written order would be dispatched but that it would take several days to arrive. Telling then drove to the site and ordered the commanding Wehrmacht officers to immediately stop the construction process. When the local Wehrmacht commander refused, Telling threatened him with reprisals from the SS. Construction was called off and Himmler's written order arrived two days later countering the Wehrmacht's <b>original</b> <b>instructions.</b> Telling later settled near the site and considered himself a custodian of it until his death in 1968.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>original</b> <b>instruction</b> set, all {{operations}} were memory-to-memory only, with no visible data registers.

2500|$|Plaut {{noted that}} the command to observe the Sabbath in [...] preceded {{the account of the}} Tabernacle’s {{construction}} just as it had been commanded {{at the end of the}} <b>original</b> <b>instructions</b> in [...] so the Sabbath was the bridge that connected the building of the Tabernacle with its deeper purpose. Professor Nahum Sarna, formerly of Brandeis University, wrote that the injunction to observe the Sabbath in [...] practically repeats [...] verbatim, with an addition not to kindle fire on the Sabbath. The wording of this prohibition led the Rabbis of the Talmud to understand that fire may not be kindled on the Sabbath itself but may be lit before the Sabbath if not refueled on the Sabbath. The Karaites rejected this interpretation and spent the day without lights (although some later adherents did accept the Rabbinic practice). Sarna wrote that it was probably to demonstrate opposition to the early Karaite view that the Rabbis mandated lighting candles on Friday nights, and to that end, the Geonim (the post-Talmudic heads of the Babylonian academies) instituted the recital of a blessing over them.|$|E
2500|$|Her first husband, Edward Jerningham, died in 1515, and by 1532 she {{had married}} Sir William Kingston, who had been {{appointed}} Constable of the Tower of London on 28 May 1524, an office which placed him in charge of state prisoners. In May 1536 Anne Boleyn, second wife of King Henry VIII, became Kingston's prisoner. During her brief time in the Tower, Anne was attended by four women who had served either Catherine of Aragon or her daughter, Mary, and who {{were said to have}} been chosen by Thomas Cromwell because they were 'unsympathetic' to Anne: Lady Kingston; two of Anne's aunts, Lady Shelton and Lady Boleyn; and Lady Coffin, the wife of her Master of the Horse. Kingston's <b>original</b> <b>instructions</b> from Cromwell were to discourage conversation with Anne. However, according to Ives, Anne herself 'began to babble incriminating material' to her attendants, and in a series of letters Kingston duly informed Cromwell of what Anne had said. These statements were later used as evidence against her at her trial. Kingston described Anne's attendants as [...] "honest and good women", but Anne termed it [...] "a great unkindness in the King to set such about me as I have never loved".|$|E

Could I return to the island, and get the articles of value left on it by the French, such as the copper they had not used, and divers pales received from the Bombay ship, which had been abandoned by us all under a tent, more profit would accrue to my owners than by any illicit commerce we could now possibly carry into effect on the coast.|$|E

60|$|The elder Heyst {{had left}} behind him a little money and a certain {{quantity}} of movable objects, such as books, tables, chairs, and pictures, which might have complained of heartless desertion {{after many years of}} faithful service; for there is a soul in things. Heyst, our Heyst, had often thought of them, reproachful and mute, shrouded and locked up in those rooms, far away in London with the sounds of the street reaching them faintly, and sometimes a little sunshine, when the blinds were pulled up and the windows opened {{from time to time in}} pursuance of his <b>original</b> <b>instructions</b> and later reminders. It seemed as if in his conception of a world not worth touching, and perhaps not substantial enough to grasp, these objects familiar to his childhood and his youth, and associated with the memory of an old man, were the only realities, something having an absolute existence. He would never have them sold, or even moved from the places they occupied when he looked upon them last.

6000|$|That {{the refusal}} of the said Warren Hastings to ratify the said resignation, and his {{disavowal}} of the said Lauchlan Macleane, his agent, is not justified by anything contained in his said letter to the Court of Directors, dated on the 15th of August, 1777,--the said Warren Hastings nowhere directly and positively asserting that the said Lauchlan Macleane was not his agent, and had not both full and general powers, and even particular instructions for this very act, although the said Warren Hastings uses many indirect and circuitous, but insufficient and inapplicable, insinuations to that effect. And the said letter does, on the contrary, contain a clear and express avowal that the said Lauchlan Macleane was his confidential agent, and that in that capacity he acted throughout, and particularly in this special matter, with zeal and fidelity. And the said letter does further admit in effect the instructions produced by the said Lauchlan Macleane, Esquire, confirmed by Mr. Vansittart and Mr. Stewart, and relied on and confided in by the Court of Directors, by which the said Lauchlan Macleane appeared to be specially empowered to declare the said resignation, {{the words of the}} said instruction being as follows: [...] "That he [Mr. Hastings] will not continue in the government of Bengal, unless certain conditions therein specified can be obtained"; and the words of the said letter being as follows: [...] "What I myself know with certainty, or can recollect at this distance of time, concerning the powers and instructions which were given to Messieurs Macleane and Graham, when they undertook to be my agents in England, I will circumstantially relate. I am in possession of two papers which were presented to those gentlemen {{at the time of their}} departure from Bengal, one of which comprises four short propositions which I required as the conditions of my being confirmed in this government." [...] And although the said Warren Hastings does here artfully somewhat change the words of his written instructions (and which having in his possession he might as easily have given verbatim) to other words which may appear less explicit, yet they are in fact capable of only the same meaning: for, as, at the time of giving the said instructions to his agents, he was in full possession of his office, he could want no confirmation therein except his own; and, in such circumstances, [...] "to require certain things, as the conditions of his being confirmed in his government," [...] is tantamount to a declaration [...] "that he will not continue in his government, unless those conditions can be obtained." [...] And the said attempt at prevarication can serve, its author the less, as either both sentences have one and the same meaning, or, if their meaning be different, the <b>original</b> <b>instructions</b> in his own handwriting, or, in other words, the thing itself, must be preferred as evidence of its contents to a loose statement of its purport, founded, perhaps, on a loose recollection of it at a great distance of time.|$|E
