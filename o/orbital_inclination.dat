5|$|WASP-13b has an <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> of 86.9º, {{which means}} that it orbits almost edge-on as seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b has an <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> of 86.7º as {{seen from}} Earth. The planet is, thus, almost edge-on when seen from Earth. The planet has been {{observed}} to transit its host star.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbit of}} Pallas was {{determined}} by Gauss, who found the period of 4.6 years {{was similar to the}} period for Ceres. Pallas has a relatively high <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> to the plane of the ecliptic.|$|E
50|$|They orbit at an {{altitude}} of 5900 km, well above low earth orbit and well below geostationary orbit, at <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations</b> of 109.8 and 52.6 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Their semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) {{range between}} 19.3 and 22.7 Gm, their <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations</b> between 145.7° and 154.8°, and their orbital eccentricities between 0.02 and 0.28.|$|R
50|$|In 2003 Maciej Konacki and Wolszczan {{determined}} the <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations</b> {{of the two}} pulsar planets, showing that the actual masses are approximately 3.9 and 4.3 Earth masses respectively.|$|R
5|$|Kepler-5b orbits {{its host}} star every 3.5485 {{days at a}} mean {{distance}} of 0.05064 AU. In addition, with an <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> of 86.3º, Kepler-5b orbits Kepler-5 almost edge-on with respect to Earth. In comparison, planet Mercury orbits the Sun {{at a distance of}} 0.387 AU every 87.97 days.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{through a}} study of many lunar {{orbiting}} satellites, scientists came to discover that most low lunar orbits (LLO) are unstable. PFS-2 had been placed, unknown to mission planners at the time, squarely {{into one of the}} most unstable of orbits, at 11 degrees <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination,</b> far from the four frozen lunar orbits discovered only later at 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86° inclination.|$|E
5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to {{the plane of the}} asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E

50|$|Their semi-major axes (distances from Jupiter) {{range between}} 22.9 and 24.1 Gm, their <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations</b> between 164.9° and 165.5°, and their orbital eccentricities between 0.23 and 0.27 (with one exception).|$|R
50|$|The term true mass {{is synonymous}} with the term mass, but is used in {{astronomy}} to differentiate the measured mass of a planet from the lower limit of mass usually obtained from radial velocity techniques. Methods {{used to determine the}} true mass of a planet include measuring the distance and period of one of its satellites, advanced astrometry techniques that use the motions of other planets in the same star system, combining radial velocity techniques with transit observations (which indicate very low <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations),</b> and combining radial velocity techniques with stellar parallax measurements (which also determine <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations).</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{amplitude}} of the radial velocity oscillations {{means that the}} planet has a mass at least 5.7 times that of Jupiter in the Solar System. However, the radial velocity method only yields a minimum value on the planet's mass, depending on the <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> to our line-of-sight. Therefore, the true mass of the planet may be much greater than this lower limit.|$|E
5|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} for such a past resonance is Miranda's unusually high <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> (4.34°) for a body {{so close to the}} planet. The largest Uranian moons may be internally differentiated, with rocky cores at their centers surrounded by ice mantles. Titania and Oberon may harbor liquid water oceans at the core/mantle boundary. The major moons of Uranus are airless bodies. For instance, Titania was shown to possess no atmosphere at a pressure larger than 10–20nanobar.|$|E
5|$|The Gallic {{group are}} four {{prograde}} outer moons {{that are similar}} enough in their distance from the planet (207–302 radii of Saturn), their <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> (35–40°) and their color {{that they can be}} considered a group. They are Albiorix, Bebhionn, Erriapus, and Tarvos. Tarvos, as of 2009, is the most distant of Saturn's moons with a prograde orbit. The largest among these moons is Albiorix with an estimated size of about 32km.|$|E
5|$|Three {{prominent}} {{bands of}} dust {{have been found}} within the asteroid belt. These have similar <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations</b> as the Eos, Koronis, and Themis asteroid families, and so are possibly associated with those groupings.|$|R
50|$|Solar sail craft can {{approach}} the Sun to deliver observation payloads {{or to take}} up station keeping orbits. They can operate at 0.25 AU or closer. They can reach high <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations,</b> including polar.|$|R
5|$|Over many orbits, the {{cumulative}} effect of gravitational perturbations on comets with high <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations</b> and small perihelion distances is generally to reduce the perihelion distance to very small values. Hale–Bopp has about a 15%chance of eventually becoming a sungrazing comet through this process.|$|R
5|$|Despite its {{relative}} brightness (it {{is about a}} fifth as bright as Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the ecliptic (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater likelihood of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to {{its relative}}ly high <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination,</b> {{and the fact that}} it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices.|$|E
5|$|Haumea has an {{orbital period}} of 284 Earth years, a {{perihelion}} of 35 AU, and an <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> of 28°. It passed aphelion in early 1992, {{and is currently}} more than 50 AU from the Sun. Haumea's orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity {{than that of the}} other members of its collisional family. This is thought to be due to Haumea's weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit {{over the course of a}} billion years, through the Kozai effect, which allows the exchange of an orbit's inclination for increased eccentricity.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10c is the {{outermost}} {{of the two}} known planets of Kepler-10, completing one orbit of the star every 45.29485 days {{at a distance of}} 0.2407 AU. The inner planet, Kepler-10b, is a rocky planet that orbits every ~0.8 days at a distance of 0.01684 AU. Kepler-10c's equilibrium temperature is estimated at 584 K, almost four times hotter than Jupiter's. The planet's <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> is 89.65º, or almost edge-on with respect to Earth and to Kepler-10. Transits have been observed at points where Kepler-10c has crossed in front of its host star.|$|E
50|$|Low Lunar orbit (LLO)—orbits below 100 km altitude—are of {{particular}} interest in exploration of the moon, but suffer from gravitational perturbation effects that make most unstable, and leave only a few <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations</b> possible for indefinite frozen orbits, useful for long-term stays in LLO.|$|R
50|$|Over many orbits, the {{cumulative}} effect of gravitational perturbations on comets with high <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations</b> and small perihelion distances is generally to reduce the perihelion distance to very small values. Hale-Bopp has about a 15% chance of eventually becoming a sungrazing comet through this process.|$|R
50|$|Global {{coverage}} for each system is generally achieved by a satellite constellation of 18-30 medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites spread between several orbital planes. The actual systems vary, but use <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations</b> of >50° and orbital periods of roughly twelve hours (at {{an altitude of}} about 20000 km).|$|R
5|$|Kepler-11g has an {{estimated}} surface equilibrium temperature of 400 K, over 1.5 times (50% higher) that of Earth's equilibrium temperature. Kepler-11g orbits Kepler-11 every 118.37774 days (over 2.5 {{times that of}} the fifth planet from Kepler-11, Kepler-11f) at a distance of 0.462 AU, almost half of the distance from which Earth orbits the Sun. Its eccentricity is unknown. In comparison, planet Mercury orbits the Sun every 87.97 days at a distance of 0.387 AU. With an <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> of 89.8°, Kepler-11g is seen almost edge-on with respect to Earth.|$|E
5|$|There is one known {{planet in}} the orbit of WASP-44: WASP-44b. The planet is a Hot Jupiter with a mass of 0.889 Jupiters. Its radius is 1.14 times that of Jupiter. WASP-44b orbits its host star every 2.4238039 days at a {{distance}} 0.03473 AU, approximately 3.47% the mean distance between the Earth and Sun. With an <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> of 86.02º, WASP-44b has an orbit that exists almost edge-on to its host star with respect to Earth. WASPA-44b's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.036, indicating a mostly circular orbit.|$|E
5|$|WASP-15b has {{a mass of}} 0.542 times Jupiter's {{mass and}} a radius that is 1.428 times Jupiter's radius. Due in part to its {{proximity}} to its host star, a distance of 0.0499 AU (7,500,000km), WASP-15b is greatly inflated, with a density of 0.247 g/cm3. Another factor, such as an internal heat source, is suspected to add to this extremely high radius and extremely low density. WASP-15b orbits its host star every 3.7520656 days. It also has an <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> of 85.5º, making it almost edge-on {{as seen from the}} Earth's perspective.|$|E

5|$|Currently Umbriel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 resonance with Miranda. This would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity, contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected. Due to Uranus's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of Jupiter or Saturn. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination),</b> its eccentricity would have been damped, turning off the heat source.|$|E
5|$|The mass of Gliese 876 d from radial {{velocity}} has one problem, {{it is that}} only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value also depends on the <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination,</b> which in general is unknown. However, models incorporating the gravitational interactions between the resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined. This reveals that the outer planets are nearly coplanar with an inclination of around 59° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in the same plane as the other planets, the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6.83 times the mass of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The γ ring is narrow, {{optically}} {{dense and}} slightly eccentric. Its <b>orbital</b> <b>inclination</b> is almost zero. The {{width of the}} ring varies in the range 3.6–4.7km, although equivalent optical depth is constant at 3.3km. The normal optical depth of the γ ring is 0.7–0.9. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the γ ring disappeared, which means it is geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. The width and normal optical depth of the γ ring show significant azimuthal variations. The mechanism of confinement of such a narrow ring is not known, {{but it has been}} noticed that the sharp inner edge of the γ ring is in a 6:5 resonance with Ophelia.|$|E
5|$|The Inuit group {{includes}} five prograde outer moons {{that are similar}} enough in their distances from the planet (186–297 radii of Saturn), their <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations</b> (45–50°) and their colors {{that they can be}} considered a group. The moons are Ijiraq, Kiviuq, Paaliaq, Siarnaq, and Tarqeq. The largest among them is Siarnaq with an estimated size of about 40km.|$|R
500|$|The Kreutz sungrazers are {{probably}} not a unique phenomenon. [...] Studies have shown that for comets with high <b>orbital</b> <b>inclinations</b> and perihelion distances of less than about 2AU, {{the cumulative effect of}} gravitational perturbations tends to result in sungrazing orbits.
