40|$|Conclusion : <b>the</b> {{mechanisms}} <b>of</b> uplift.

Some mechanisms <b>of</b> uplift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulges</b> have been discussed. M. F.

To overcome this limitation, we aim to age-date <b>the</b> <b>bulge</b> stellar populations far away from <b>the</b> <b>bulge</b> minor axis. Methods. Color–magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions have been obtained from deep near-IR VLT/HAWK-I images taken at the two Southern corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boxy <b>bulge,</b> i. e., near <b>the</b> opposite edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galactic bar.

For each bulge field, mean reddening and distance are determined using <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> red clump stars, and the metallicity distribution is derived photometrically using <b>the</b> color distribution <b>of</b> stars in <b>the</b> upper red giant branch.
