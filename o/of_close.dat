40|$|Abstract. Let M be {{a compact}} Riemannian manifold. It is very Interesting {{to know how}} many closed {{geodesic}} there are in the manifold M. The manifold M is said to have the density <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics if the set <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics in M is dense. In this survey, we will give some progress in the problem related to the density <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics in two step nilmanifolds. The most results introduced in this paper are in [?], [2], [7], [1],[6] and [?]. 1. Closed Geodesics and Density <b>of</b> <b>Closed</b> Geodesics Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold. A geodesic γ(t) in M is called the closed geodesic if for some ω> 0, γ(t + ω) = γ(t), t ∈ R. A compact Riemannian manifold M is said to have the density <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics if the set <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics is dense in M. For example, consider 2 -sphere S 2. The great circles in S 2 are closed geodesics and the set <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics is equal to S 2. So, 2 -sphere S 2 has the density <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics. Another example is the 2 -torus R 2 /Z 2. Let (R 2,+) be the abelian group with the Euclidean inner product and Z 2 its integral lattice. Then, the 2 -torus R 2 /Z 2 has the density <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics. Let N be a n-dimensional Lie algebra over the real numbers R.

5|$|By 1798 the British Royal Navy had {{successfully}} contained the French Navy {{within its own}} harbours, employing a strategy <b>of</b> <b>close</b> blockade to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars. The strategy was particularly effective in the English Channel, where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting {{the movements of the}} French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on the Normandy coast. This was essential to prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours under the guidance of a Captain Muskein. To improve the Royal Navy's ability to observe French movements on the Normandy coast, a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized, garrisoned, and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf in 1795.|$|E

Define a bijective map from the collection of sets that V intersects to {1, ..., k} thus giving an index to each of these sets.

The intersection of all such Ui for 1 ≤ i ≤ k intersected with V, is a neighbourhood of x that does not intersect the union of this collection <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> sets.|$|R
