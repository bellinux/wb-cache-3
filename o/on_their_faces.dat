5|$|The Shetland {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} British breeds. The ewes are usually polled (hornless) and the rams usually horned, although horned ewes and polled rams do occur occasionally. The breed is noted for its very fine, soft wool and the high quality of its meat, though its smaller size limits its use in commercial meat markets. They are small-bodied animals, with some wool <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces,</b> noses or legs, but not in excess. The legs are of medium length and finely boned. They have small, erect ears. A distinguishing feature of northern short-tailed sheep is the short, fluke-shaped tail, broad at the base, tapering to a point, and covered towards the tip in hair, not wool.|$|E

5|$|The {{simulation}} included 3,500 Canadian Army members, representing all of Winnipeg's units, {{making it}} the largest military exercise in Winnipeg to that point. The defending forces were commanded by Colonels E. A. Pridham and D. S. McKay. Troops were drawn from the 18th (Manitoba) Armoured Car Regiment, No. 10 District Engineers and Signals, the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, the Winnipeg Grenadiers, the Winnipeg Light Infantry, the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada, Veteran's Guard of Canada (including over 300 veterans of the First World War), {{and a number of}} reserve and civilian groups. The 'Nazi' troops were volunteers from the Young Men's Board of Trade, using uniforms rented from Hollywood and with painted sabre scars <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces.</b> They were commanded by Erich von Neurenberg. Approximately $3,000 was spent on the event.|$|E
5|$|At 01:00 on 2 May, the Soviets {{picked up}} a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps {{requesting}} a cease-fire and stating that emissaries would come under a white flag to Potsdamer bridge. Early {{in the morning of}} 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. General of the Artillery Helmuth Weidling, the commander of the Berlin Defense Area, surrendered with his staff at 06:00. Down in the Führerbunker, Chief of the Army General Staff General Hans Krebs and Hitler's Chief Adjutant Generalleutnant Wilhelm Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head. Johannes Hentschel, the master electro-mechanic for the bunker complex, stayed after everyone else had either committed suicide or left, as the field hospital in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09:00 on 2 May. The bodies of Goebbels six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their beds in the Vorbunker; the clear mark of cyanide appeared <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nomura had {{originally}} intended Seifer {{not only as}} Squall's rival, but also {{as part of the}} love triangle between him, Squall, and Rinoa. Although this concept was shelved in the final script, Seifer remains Squall's rival and his appearance was designed to contrast with Squall's. They have equivalent but mirrored scars <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> and their jackets are of opposing color and length. Both characters use gunblades; Squall's gunblade is larger and requires two hands, while Seifer's gunblade is lighter and can be wielded with one hand. A younger version of Seifer makes an appearance in Kingdom Hearts II {{as a member of the}} Twilight Town Disciplinary Committee with Fujin and Raijin. Seifer in the virtual Twilight Town is a rival of the main character, Roxas, and at one point mentions that he does not wish to cooperate with destiny. He is voiced by Takehito Koyasu and Will Friedle in the Japanese and English versions, respectively. He is also featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy VIII.|$|E
5|$|The hobo's third tale {{tells the}} story of Tom Sawyer, whom Bart portrays, and Huckleberry Finn, whom Nelson portrays. Tom is a rebellious trouble maker while Huck is a bully. Huck is caught holding hands with Becky (Lisa) and is forced to marry her by her father (Homer). Huck dodges the {{marriage}} and goes on the run with Tom, leaving Missouri for Missoura. However, they are chased by townspeople led by Becky's father and their families. Huck and Tom flee to a river boat, but are thrown into the Mississippi River and are caught by the townspeople. At their funeral, Tom and Huck are first revealed to not be in their caskets, seemingly watching the proceedings from the rafters which they have big smiles <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces,</b> until Reverend Lovejoy orders their bodies lowered into the caskets, revealing that Tom and Huck are in fact dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies has a dark red head, neck, and rump; the red is glossy, reflecting bright light. The {{rest of the}} upper body is a blackish-brown, and the upper breast and under-body a light brownish-grey. The red of the head is sharply demarcated against the brown plumage, giving the bird the appearance of having a red hood. The bill is black or blackish-brown, and the gape is black or yellowish. There is a distinct black loral stripe that extends to become a narrow eye ring. The iris is dark brown. The adult female's head and neck are grey-brown with a pink-red tint to the forehead and chin. The rest of the female's upper body is grey-brown with darker shades on the wings and lighter shades on the breast and underparts. The gape is yellow. One study suggested {{a connection between the}} female's bill colour and breeding status, with birds that had a horn-coloured (grey) bill also having well-developed brood patches. Juveniles are similar to females though with an obvious pale yellow edge to the lower mandible. Initially lacking in red plumage, they begin to get red feathers <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> after around a month of age. Males keep their juvenile plumage for up to three months, and take a similar period to come into full colour. M. e. infuscata is similar in appearance to the nominate race but has red extending from the rump onto the back, a darker grey belly, and is slightly larger overall.|$|E

5|$|The episodes took {{seventeen}} days to film, where normally crew {{are given}} eight days to film a week's worth of episodes. Between forty and forty-five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode, including assistant directors, a design department, cameras, lighting, sound, make up, costume, visual effects, fire safety officers and a stunt team {{consisting of a}} stunt co-ordinator and stunt doubles. Filming was done with four television cameras, a steadicam and a dolly. The exterior fire scenes were filmed first, in five night shoots lasting until 4a.m., and the real exterior set was burnt. Safety was the top priority for the fire scenes, and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected. Stunt doubles wore flame-proof gel <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder, several layers of cardboard boxes were stacked {{on the ground for}} the stunt doubles to fall onto. For filming the final explosion scene, all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for their reactions. The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios, two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off, which also affected a live broadcast of Big Brother. The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain. The explosion was completed in a third take. Despite the delay, the scenes were completed on schedule. Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears.|$|E

25|$|The domesticated rabbits used in {{the film}} {{differed}} greatly in appearance from the wild rabbits that were plaguing the southwest at the time. In Night of the Lepus, this was explained by stating that they were descended from recent rabbit farm escapees. To depict the rabbit attacks, a combination of techniques were used. For some scenes, the rabbits were filmed in close-up stomping on miniature structures in slow motion. For attack scenes, they had ketchup smeared <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces.</b> For other scenes, human actors were shown wearing rabbit costumes.|$|E

25|$|To further {{enhance the}} desired pale complexion, women layered white make-up <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces.</b> This make-up, called Ceruse, {{was made up}} of white lead and vinegar. Women wearing ceruse {{achieved}} the white face, however, the white lead that was used to make it is poisonous. Women in this time often contracted lead poisoning which resulted in deaths before the age of 50. Other ingredients used as make-up were sulfur, alum, and tin ash. In addition to using make-up to achieve the pale complexion, women in this era were bled to take the color out of their faces.|$|E
