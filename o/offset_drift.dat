50|$|The primary {{signal from}} a Hall sensor loses {{amplitude}} sharply {{as the air}} gap increases. For Hall sensor manufacturers this means {{that they need to}} provide maximum possible compensation for the Hall signal’s physically induced <b>offset</b> <b>drift.</b> The conventional way of doing this is to measure the temperature at the sensor and use this information to compensate the offset, but this fails for two reasons: firstly because the drift does not vary linearly with the temperature, and secondly because not even the sign of the drift is the same for all sensors.|$|E

The size of the charge <b>offset</b> <b>drift</b> (0. 15 $e$) is intermediate between that of Al/AlO$_x$/Al tunnel junctions (greater than 1 $e$) and Si SEDs defined with Si gates (0. 01 $e$).

40|$|A {{beam current}} monitor system was {{developed}} to measure the CW electron beam current delivered to the CEBAF Hall A. The experiments require non-invasive measurements during beam delivery, with an absolute accuracy better than 0. 2 % in the current range from 1 to 180 mu-A. Two redundant cavities, and their associated electronics, monitor the beam current continuously. They are periodically calibrated {{with respect to a}} Parametric Current Transformer (PCT) manufactured by Bergoz, having an accurate and stable sensitivity of 4 mu-A/V, but having <b>offset</b> <b>drifts</b> at the mu-A level that prevent its direct use as a non-invasive device. A beam current of at least 50 mu-A is repetitively turned on and off during the calibration process to reduce the error due to the PCT <b>offset</b> <b>drifts.</b> This is invasive to beam delivery, and one of the goals is to minimize the calibration time without compromising accuracy. This paper describes the beam current monitor system, identifies the sources of error, and reports on the system's performance during actual machine operations...|$|R

Corrective polishing is then differential i.e. proportional with respect to the <b>offset.</b> <b>Drifts</b> in removal rate will affect the correction, but the principle of leaving edges always turned up provides a contingency.|$|R

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{electronic}} applications deal with small signal inputs. These systems need to have very low offset as well as very low <b>offset</b> <b>drift</b> over time and temperature. High precision is required in these fields. Such fields like instrumentation, automotive and industrial applications require precision amplifiers within reasonable cost and simplicity. The amplifiers by far having the lowest possible offset and <b>offset</b> <b>drift</b> is the auto zero amplifier. In this thesis we describe a precision opamp using ping pong auto zero architecture, which is capable of very low offset and <b>offset</b> <b>drift</b> over temperature along with producing continuous output.

The simulated results show that the amplifier is fully functional and capable of less than 15 uV of input referred offset voltage. The design has been carried out in cadence 0. 18 um technology.

It leads to electronic equipment failures. At present operational amplifiers are base elements of analog electronic devices. Radiation impact leads to degradation of operational amplifiers input stages. Input bias current increasing and input <b>offset</b> voltage <b>drifts</b> are the results of ionizing radiation expose of operational amplifiers. Therefore, space application electronic equipment fails after accumulation of limit dose.

40|$|The {{parallel}} scan infrared imager {{consists of}} a linear focal plane array (FPA) detector aligned orthogonally to scan direction and imaging requires a one-dimensional scan to cover {{the field of view}} in horizontal dimension entirely. Each column of the image is corresponding to one frame outputted from the detector and the non-uniformity of detector is usually manifested as horizontal stripes. In other words, one image could contain many different detector frames, and this is very helpful in non-uniformity correction (NUC). Although a scene contains a lot of temperature information, we could assume that the scene is made up of numerous small fractions with same temperature; thus the fraction could work as a thermal reference source (TRS) and the difference in responses of detector pixels which view the same fraction can be obtained. When the amount of detector frames is large enough, we could find out all the differences in responses of the detector pixels, and <b>offset</b> <b>drifts</b> can be corrected by utilizing these differences. Based on these characteristics, we propose a novel NUC algorithm to correct <b>offset</b> non-uniformity in <b>drift</b> with time...|$|R

40|$|A general AC PM (Permanent Magnet) {{motor control}} system {{consists}} of a motion controller, a current tracking amplifier, a feedback encoder and the motor itself. The motion controller generates two analog commands to the current tracking amplifier and the three phase currents are reproduced at the motor terminals. However, DC offsets are always present at the motor terminals due to the DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) offsets of the motion controller and the current sensor offsets of the current tracking amplifier. These current offsets generate sinusoidal torque disturbance and hence produce velocity ripples. Such a disturbance cannot be rejected by using a simple PI (Proportional plus Integral) control. Furthermore, the current <b>offsets</b> <b>drift</b> with time and temperature so that an off-line compensation does not work satisfactorily.

40|$|When using a Photo-elastic {{modulator}} (PEM) {{in combination}} with a coherent light source, {{in addition to the}} modulation of the phase, Fabry-Perot interference in the PEM’s optical head induces large offsets in the 1 ω and 2 ω detector signals. A Jones matrix which describes both effects simultaneously, was derived for a single axis PEM and used to find an expression for the detector signal for two different MO Kerr setups. The effect of the PEM tilt angle, polarizer angle, analyzer angle, and retardation, on the detector signal offsets show that offsets can be zeroed by adjusting PEM tilt angle, polarizer angle, and retardation. This strategy will allow one to avoid large <b>offset</b> <b>drifts</b> due to the small retardation, intensity, and beam direction fluctuations caused by lab temperature fluctuations.
