Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer <b>of</b> <b>roots,</b> mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur.

40|$|Root {{networks}} {{contribute to}} slope stability through complex interactions with soil that include mechanical compression and tension. Due to the spatial heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>root</b> distribution and the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>root</b> turnover, the quantification <b>of</b> <b>root</b> reinforcement on steep slopes is challenging and consequently {{the calculation of}} slope stability also. Although considerable progress has been made, some important aspects <b>of</b> <b>root</b> mechanics remain neglected. In this study we address specifically the role of root-strength variability on the mechanical behavior <b>of</b> a <b>root</b> bundle. Many factors contribute to the variability <b>of</b> <b>root</b> mechanical properties even within a single class of diameter. This work presents a new approach for quantifying root reinforcement that considers the variability of mechanical properties <b>of</b> each <b>root</b> diameter class. Using the data of laboratory tensile tests and field pullout tests, we calibrate {{the parameters of the}} Weibull survival function to implement the variability <b>of</b> <b>root</b> strength in a numerical model for the calculation <b>of</b> <b>root</b> reinforcement (RBMw). The results show that, for both laboratory and field data sets, the parameters of the Weibull distribution may be considered constant with the exponent equal to 2 and the normalized failure displacement equal to 1. Moreover, the results show that the variability <b>of</b> <b>root</b> strength in each root diameter class has a major influence on the behavior <b>of</b> a <b>root</b> bundle with important implications when considering different approaches in slope stability calculation. Sensitivity analysis shows that the calibration of the equations of the tensile force, the elasticity <b>of</b> the <b>roots,</b> and the root distribution are the most important steps. The new model allows the characterization <b>of</b> <b>root</b> reinforcement in terms of maximum pullout force, stiffness, and energy. Moreover, it simplifies the implementation <b>of</b> <b>root</b> reinforcement in slope stability models. The realistic quantification <b>of</b> <b>root</b> reinforcement for tensile, shear and compression behavior allows for the consideration of the stabilization effects <b>of</b> <b>root</b> networks on steep slopes and the influence that this has on the triggering of shallow landslides...|$|R

5|$|Some Hydnellum species, {{including}} H. ferrugineum and H. scleropodium, form a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity <b>of</b> <b>roots.</b> The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations.

5|$|The {{crown of}} the tooth is {{triangular}} and contains six cusps, connected by low crests, that surround two prominent, low-lying fossae (basins) and a third, smaller fossa. Because {{of the complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues interpreted it as a molar; because of the number <b>of</b> <b>roots,</b> the arrangement of the cusps, and the shape of the tooth, as an upper molar; and because it tapers towards the end, as a last molar. One side, the longest, is flat and low compared to the others, suggesting it is the labial (outer) face. This would imply that the tooth is from the left jaw. Under this interpretation, the length of the tooth is 2.65mm, width is 2.20mm, height at the labial side is 1.05mm, and height at the lingual side is 1.30mm.|$|E

40|$|The timing <b>of</b> fine <b>root</b> {{production}} and turnover strongly influences both the seasonal potential for soil resource acquisition among competing root {{systems and the}} plant fluxes <b>of</b> <b>root</b> carbon into soil pools. However, basic patterns and variability in the rates and timing or fine root {{production and}} turnover are generally unknown among perennial plants species. We address this shortfall using a heuristic model relating root phenology to turnover together with three years of minirhizotron observations <b>of</b> <b>root</b> dynamics in 12 temperate tree species grown in a common garden. We specifically investigated how the amount and the timing <b>of</b> <b>root</b> production differ among species and how they impact estimates <b>of</b> fine <b>root</b> turnover. Across the 12 species, there was wide variation in the timing <b>of</b> <b>root</b> production with some species producing a single root flush in early summer and others producing roots either more uniformly over the growing season or in multiple pulses. Additionally, the pattern and timing <b>of</b> <b>root</b> production appeared to be consistent across years for some species but varied in others. Root turnover rate was related to total root production (P < 0. 001) as species with greater root production typically had faster root turnover rates. We also found that, within species, annual root production varied up to a threefold increase between years, which led to large interannual differences in turnover rate. Results from the heuristic model indicated that shifting the pattern or timing <b>of</b> <b>root</b> production can impact estimates <b>of</b> <b>root</b> turnover rates for root populations with life spans {{less than one year}} while estimates <b>of</b> <b>root</b> turnover rate for longer lived roots were unaffected by changes in root phenology. Overall, we suggest that more detailed observations <b>of</b> <b>root</b> phenology and production will improve fidelity <b>of</b> <b>root</b> turnover estimates. Future efforts should link patterns <b>of</b> <b>root</b> phenology and production with whole-plant life history traits and variation in annual and seasonal climate...|$|R

5|$|The two {{roots of}} any {{quadratic}} equation {{may be of}} three possible types: two different real numbers, two identical real numbers (i.e., a degenerate double root), or a pair of complex conjugate roots.

In the second case, both roots are identical, corresponding to a solution circle that transforms into itself under inversion. In this case, one of the given circles is itself a solution to the Apollonius problem, and the number of distinct solutions is reduced by one. The third case of complex conjugate radii does not correspond to a geometrically possible solution for Apollonius' problem, since a solution circle cannot have an imaginary radius; therefore, the number of solutions is reduced by two. Interestingly, Apollonius' problem cannot have seven solutions, although it may have any other number of solutions from zero to eight.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to media}} reports and {{speculation}} at the time, the fires killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 mule deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Of 21 grizzlies that were radio-collared and had home ranges where the fires happened, only one was {{believed to have been}} lost. Grizzlies were observed in burned areas more often than unburned areas the following year, feeding on the proliferation <b>of</b> <b>roots</b> and foliage as well as on ants which thrived due to all the dead wood. Moose had been declining in the northern sections of the park since the 1960s, but the decline became more obvious after the fires. Unlike elk, which are primarily grazers and tend to eat grasses, moose {{are more likely to be}} browsers, consuming primarily woody food sources, particularly willow and subalpine fir, which were temporarily reduced by the fires. All ungulates experienced a high initial mortality the winter after the fires, but this has been attributed to a severe winter more than the fires themselves. However, moose populations, unlike other ungulates, have not rebounded in subsequent years. Rodents likely experienced the highest mortality of all mammals due not only to heat and smoke they could not easily escape, but also because of the reduction in forest cover, allowing would-be predators less difficulty in spotting them.|$|E

When they reach the center of the labyrinth <b>of</b> <b>roots,</b> Stroud's men catch up to them; they had been searching for Ritzia, not the beast.
