5|$|In 1924, Moore won {{a six-month}} {{travelling}} scholarship which {{he spent in}} Northern Italy studying the great works of Michelangelo, Giotto di Bondone, Giovanni Pisano and several <b>other</b> <b>Old</b> Masters.

The reclining figure was to have a profound effect upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.|$|E

The arcade and Atari 2600 versions of Asteroids, along with Asteroids Deluxe, were included in Atari Anthology for both Xbox and PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{a number}} of churches and monasteries {{were built in the}} town. St Canute's Church (Skt.

5|$|In September 1906, Jean Cras was {{assigned}} to the ship. By 1908, Masséna had been withdrawn from service and placed in the Reserve Squadron, along with five <b>other</b> <b>old</b> battleships. Masséna remained on active duty until 1913, when she was withdrawn and placed out of service. She was reduced to a hulk in 1915. That year, the Triple Entente had launched an invasion at Gallipoli in an attempt to capture Constantinople, knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war, and open a route to supply Russia via the Dardanelles. Too old for active service, Masséna did not take part in the ensuing Gallipoli Campaign, which had stalled by the end of 1915, having made no significant progress. The Entente decided to withdraw from the operation, and the old battleship did see some use here. Masséna was towed from Toulon to Cape Helles on the Gallipoli peninsula {{at the end of the}} year, and scuttled there on 9 November to form a breakwater to protect the evacuation effort that withdrew the Allied expeditionary force in January 1916.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1566, Mary's secretary, David Rizzio, {{was murdered}} by conspirators loyal to Darnley. Mary escaped from Edinburgh to Dunbar and by 18 March {{returned}} with a formidable force. Knox fled to Kyle in Ayrshire, where he completed the major part of his magnum opus, History of the Reformation in Scotland. When he returned to Edinburgh, he found the Protestant nobles divided {{over what to do}} with Mary. Lord Darnley had been murdered and the Queen almost immediately married the chief suspect, the Earl of Bothwell. The indictment of murder thus upon her, she had been forced to abdicate and was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle. Lord Moray had become the regent of King James VI. <b>Other</b> <b>old</b> friends of Knox's, Lord Argyll and William Kirkcaldy, stood by Mary. On 29 July 1567, Knox preached James VI's coronation sermon at the church in Stirling. During this period Knox thundered against her in his sermons, {{even to the point of}} calling for her death. However, Mary's life was spared, and she escaped on 2 May 1568.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a reunion of the games' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them, as his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with <b>other</b> <b>old</b> members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E
