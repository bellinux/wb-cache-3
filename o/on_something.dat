5|$|For instance, the {{periodontal}} ligament {{can detect}} the pressure exerted when biting <b>on</b> <b>something</b> {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left <b>on,</b> <b>something</b> that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|In the Politburo Podgorny {{could count}} on the support of Gennady Voronov and Petro Shelest. Podgorny was {{constantly}} in conflict with Kosygin over policy issues in the Politburo. When Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed <b>on</b> <b>something</b> Brezhnev would find himself in the minority, and forced to follow their decisions. However, Podgorny was pleased about his position within the leadership, and even more pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet. As head of state, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 had called {{for the expansion of}} Party activities in the Soviets.|$|E

5|$|In the Time Room, Prismo reveals to Jake that Finn {{has been}} transported to a separate, altered world {{based on his}} wish that The Lich never existed. Together, they watch the events in Finn's world on Prismo's television, and Prismo asks Jake what {{he would like to}} wish for. Jake wishes for a sandwich, but Prismo urges him to {{consider}} using his wish <b>on</b> <b>something</b> important, such as helping Finn. Jake tells Prismo he will use it when he knows Finn will be in real danger, and after a conversation, the two decide to hang out; Prismo mutes the TV and the two begin to ignore the events happening in Finn's timeline.|$|E
5|$|In {{the letter}} column of issue 26, Rucka {{announced}} a six-issue limited series titled Lazarus: X+66 {{would be released}} monthly beginning July 2017. The series is written by Rucka and Troutman, and each issue focuses on an individual supporting character from the main series. Lark is involved as a consultant, and each issue is drawn by a different artist. This {{decision was made to}} give Lark time to work <b>on</b> <b>something</b> unrelated to Lazarus, which had been his only project since the series began. He will return with the main series in 2018. A four-page preview of the first installment, drawn by Steve Lieber, was included with the book's solicitation in Image Plus #16.|$|E
25|$|Death {{is treated}} inconsistently; in some books {{it is said}} that it is {{impossible}} to die, in others, people die. Problematically, the plot often depends <b>on</b> <b>something</b> either dying, or not being killable.|$|E

50|$|A process {{theory is}} a system of ideas that {{explains}} how an entity changes and develops. Process theories are often contrasted with variance theories, that is, systems of ideas that explain the variance in a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.

25|$|This {{change of}} vowel {{also applies to}} certain object-focus verbs in the {{completed}} aspect. In addition to /u/ becoming /i/, /a/ becomes /e/ in certain cases. For example, dela (brought something) and not *dinala, semal (worked <b>on</b> <b>something)</b> and not *sinamal, and seli (bought) and not *sinali.|$|E
25|$|The {{two basic}} types of {{sensation}} are touch-position and pain-temperature.

25|$|The Americans, however, {{wanted to}} shift from {{water-borne}} trade to a land-based trade system. Their idea for establishing this depended <b>on</b> <b>something</b> they were masters at: building railways. The American colonial government thought a railway could help boost Nueva Ecija's economic growth, {{in the same way}} that the US railway system helped unite and develop the economy of the North American continent.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{the use of}} radial {{engines in}} {{land-based}} fighters was relatively rare in Europe, as {{it was believed that}} their large frontal area would cause too much drag <b>on</b> <b>something</b> as small as a fighter. Tank was not convinced of this, having witnessed the successful use of radial engines by the U.S. Navy, and felt a properly streamlined installation would eliminate this problem.|$|E

25|$|In late 2013, Green {{stated that}} he is writing a new book with the working title The Racket.

25|$|To further complicate matters, it {{has been}} noted that Gene Roddenberry was {{something}} of a revisionist when it came to canon. People who worked with Roddenberry remember that he used to handle canon not on a series-by-series basis nor an episode-by-episode basis, but point by point. If he changed his mind <b>on</b> <b>something,</b> or if a fact in one episode contradicted what he considered to be a more important fact in another episode, he had no problem declaring that specific point non-canon.|$|E

25|$|The longe line {{traveling}} from {{the horse to}} the hand is held in the hand in which direction the horse is moving (so if the horse is working clockwise to the right, the right hand is the leading hand). The extra longe line is folded, never coiled, in the other hand. If the horse were to take off, a coiled line could tighten around the trainer's hand, dragging the trainer and possibly leading to life-threatening injuries. Large loops could be stepped on or caught <b>on</b> <b>something.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{disorder}} of a temporomandibular joint is disc displacement.

This, as explained above, is usually very painful, because unlike these adjacent tissues, the central portion of the disc contains no sensory innervation.|$|E
