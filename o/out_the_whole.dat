5|$|In the epilogue, Shiva retires to Mount Kailash {{where he}} lives {{the rest of his}} days peacefully, though missing Sati every day. Ganesh, Kali and Kartik become renowned as Gods for their prowess, all over India. They take revenge for Sati's death by wiping <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> clan of the Egyptian assassins. Bhrigu {{continues}} teaching and collates his knowledge in a book called Bhrigu Samhita. Sati's death is not forgotten and she is later renowned as Goddess Shakti, and her ashes are spread throughout India, in places later known as Shakti Peethas (Seat of Shakti). It is revealed that {{in order to ensure that}} the Somras is not mass-manufactured again, the course of the Yamuna is turned towards the east, thus drying up the Saraswati River.|$|E

The procedure, which involved installing a metal hip, was performed in Montreal, as it was not approved in the United States. On February 2, 2007, he signed a minor league contract with the Orioles that included an invitation to spring training. He suffered an injury and {{did not make the}} cut, and was sent to the minor leagues. He made one appearance for the Class-AA Bowie Baysox, and then joined the Norfolk Tides, the Orioles' Class-AAA affiliate. His contract was then purchased on June 19, 2007, and he appeared in that night's game against the San Diego Padres.|$|E

25|$|Although 1993's Sonatine did {{poorly in}} Japan, it {{received}} rave reviews in Europe {{when it was}} shown at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. Kitano plays a Tokyo yakuza who is sent by his boss to Okinawa to help end a gang war there. He is tired of gangster life, and when he finds <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> mission is a ruse, he welcomes what comes with open arms. All four of his films were screened at the 1994 London Film Festival.|$|E

The time they bought allowed Auchinleck to organise the defence of {{the western end of}} Ruweisat Ridge. The 1st Armoured Division had been sent to intervene at Deir el Shein. They ran into 15th Panzer Division just south of Deir el Shein and drove it west. By the end of the day's fighting, the Afrika Korps had 37 tanks left out of its initial complement of 55.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographic}} Broken Hill, {{for which}} the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch) formed the Broken Hill Company to stake <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at {{the eve of the}} Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W.

25|$|In 2017, New South Wales won Game 1, 28-4 {{sparking}} the New South Wales {{media to}} start proclaiming {{the beginning of}} the Blues Dynasty. Queensland won Game 2, 18-16 after making changes to the team with the returning Billy Slater and Johnathan Thurston, who kicked the winning goal for Queensland. Thurston injured his shoulder in the 30th minute of the match, essentially disabling it as he played <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> match. Thurston was later ruled out {{for the rest of the}} year after scans revealed his shoulder needed a reconstruction, ending his representative career as he announced 2017 would be his last representative year. In Game 3, New South Wales went in with an unchanged lineup for all three games, the first to do so since 1996. Queensland dominated the Blues, winning 22-6, with Queensland Winger Dane Gagai winning the Wally Lewis Medal for Best Player in the series. It also had Johnathan Thurston raise the Origin Shield with Queensland Captain Cameron Smith, before being chaired off the ground by his teammates, ending Thurston's representative career on a high note.|$|E

When Lois is in custody, her father Sam Lane is there to greet her in an interview room in an unnamed facility. Sam tells Lois the only reason he has been lenient with her is because she is his daughter, while he does love her the planet will always come first over his family and threatens to make her disappear forever if she continues. Lois returns to the Daily Planet under cover of night and explains all to Perry. She points <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs. Perry understands and though he must protect the paper he is first and foremost a good journalist and nudges Lois in the right direction; he won't run the story but noted it must get out to the people somehow. Enlightened, she quits the Daily Planet, as Lois gets her edge back. It was later revealed she never really quit the Daily Planet.|$|E

Furthermore, he labelled it as a [...] "sexy saxophone-tinged track", being disappointed about Atlantic Records not promoting the {{single in the}} United States.

He had gauged and fathomed all the schemes and systems of philosophy, and had found them utterly empty and unsatisfying — [...] "unworkable" [...] was his own word about them — and he turned with simple faith to the Gospel of the Saviour.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Bahn of The A.V. Club {{was less}} {{positive}} about the episode, grading it as a B-. He praised the early scene where Amy was abandoned for the [...] "zingy dialogue" [...] but found himself [...] "enjoying the cleverness of the explanation without really buying into it". He expressed confusion at how the time-shift worked and thought the problem was too thin to carry <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> episode, and that Amy's abandonment and love for Rory which was left [...] " [...] pull it off". He thought that the two Amys seen in the mini episodes [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] were more fun to watch and the episode did not reveal anything new about Amy and Rory. However, he praised how the decision the Doctor had to make was portrayed.|$|E

500|$|In 1976, the Bruins offered Orr US$600,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) per season, but {{he would}} have to pass a {{physical}} examination at the start of each season's training camp. Only the first year's money was guaranteed. Eagleson was quoted at the time as saying, [...] "There is only one way that Bobby Orr will ever be back with the Bruins. And that's if Jeremy Jacobs asks him for another meeting and straightens <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> situation. Otherwise he's gone." [...] Instead, Orr became a free agent, with Boston to receive compensation. Orr and Eagleson whittled down a list of potential teams to St. Louis and Chicago. Chicago offered a five-year guaranteed contract with the Black Hawks, and on June 8, 1976, he officially signed with the Black Hawks. The Bruins' general manager, Harry Sinden complained of tampering by the Black Hawks, and demanded that Chicago owner Bill Wirtz submit to a lie detector test. According to documents held by Orr, they had a valid case. Orr signed with the Black Hawks at a secret meeting in May 1976, prior to becoming a free agent.|$|E
500|$|Still underground, Picard discovers a {{computer}} terminal, which he activates, causing a hologram of the salesman to appear and explain they are witnessing {{a demonstration of}} an intelligent weapon system which is able to upgrade in response to any enemy threat. Picard surmises that the Minosians and the Drake were destroyed by the weapons. He unsuccessfully attempts to coerce the hologram to end the demonstration. Data is able to locate Picard, and determines that while the sentries could be set to destroy their own power source, the resulting explosion would probably take <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> area, including the away-team. Picard finally tells the salesman he will buy the system, causing the salesman to disappear and the probes on the planet to shut down. Meanwhile, La Forge uses the planet's atmosphere to reveal {{the location of the}} space-born probe and destroys it. [...] The away team returns to the star-drive section, where Picard allows La Forge to stay in command until they rendezvous with the saucer section, remarking that he left him with the ship intact and would like it returned in the same condition.|$|E
500|$|There are {{contradictory}} claims {{as to who}} was {{the leader}} of the coup and had managed its execution, coming from Simović, Mirković, and Major Živan Knežević. Mirković claimed sole credit immediately after the coup and stated on its tenth anniversary that: [...] "Only after I had informed General [...] about my idea and he had accepted it did I make the decision to undertake the planned revolt. I made the decision myself, and I also carried <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> organization. I made the decision as to when the revolt would take place." [...] It is likely that he had been a planning a coup since 1937 when an Italo-Yugoslav pact was signed. King Peter later credited simply the [...] "younger and middle ranks [...] of the Yugoslav army" [...] for the coup in a speech on 17 December 1941. Simović's response was published posthumously, he claimed that he [...] "stood {{in the center of the}} whole undertaking" [...] and [...] "personally engaged his assistant Brigadier General Bora Mirković for the action". Tomasevich considers Mirković's account to be the more credible of the two, and points out it is corroborated from several sources, both Allied and Axis. The matter would play a role in the factionalism that would divide the soon-to-be Yugoslav government-in-exile during the war.|$|E
