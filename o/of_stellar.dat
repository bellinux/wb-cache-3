40|$|Although {{numerous}} photometric and spectroscopic {{studies of}} stars in Galactic globular clusters suggest the existence <b>of</b> several <b>stellar</b> generations {{in the majority of}} clusters studied so far, kinematical properties <b>of</b> these <b>stellar</b> generations are still relatively poorly know. In this contribution we present first results of our study of kinematical properties <b>of</b> chemically-tagged <b>stellar</b> populations in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc. Our analysis reveals the existence <b>of</b> three <b>stellar</b> generations in 47 Tuc that are different in their [Li/Na] and [Na/O] ratios. Additionally, we find that the three generations also differ in their kinematical properties: stars belonging to primordial generation are less centrally concentrated and are kinematically hotter than those in the subsequent generations.

40|$|People usually {{estimate}} the ages and metallicities <b>of</b> dominating <b>stellar</b> populations <b>of</b> galaxies without current star formation {{by comparing the}} observed absorption line indices or colors to predictions <b>of</b> some simple <b>stellar</b> populations, which have only a star burst or have star bursts within a short period. However, some studies show that there are recent star formations in galaxies including early type galaxies. This suggests that we possibly did not obtain stellar ages and metallicities, which are close to those <b>of</b> the dominating <b>stellar</b> populations <b>of</b> galaxies from colors. We study how young populations in composite stellar populations affect colors of star systems and to analyze how the stellar ages and metallicities derived from colors possibly bias from the dominating populations of composite star systems. It is found that the age and mass fraction of the young population <b>of</b> a composite <b>stellar</b> population affect colors of the system significantly, but the former is stronger than the latter. In addition, our {{results show that the}} stellar ages and metallicities derived directly from two observational colors are about 2. 14 Gyr younger while 0. 0027 more metal rich than those of the dominating populations <b>of</b> composite <b>stellar</b> systems on average.

5|$|After {{they are}} formed, {{the stars in}} the {{globular}} cluster begin to interact gravitationally with each other. As a result, the velocity vectors of the stars are steadily modified, and the stars lose any history of their original velocity. The characteristic interval for this to occur is the relaxation time. This is related to the characteristic length of time a star needs to cross the cluster as well as the number <b>of</b> <b>stellar</b> masses in the system. The value of the relaxation time varies by cluster, but the mean value is on the order of 109 years.|$|E

5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population <b>of</b> <b>stellar</b> systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
