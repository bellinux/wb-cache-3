5|$|Of the 14 men in {{contention}} for the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates {{leading up to}} the convention were Ulysses S. Grant, James G. Blaine, and John Sherman. Grant had served two terms as President from 1869 to 1877, and was seeking an unprecedented third term in office. He was backed by the Stalwart faction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, which supported political machines and patronage. Blaine was a senator and former representative from Maine who was backed by the Half-Breed faction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party. Sherman, the brother of Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman, was serving as Secretary of the Treasury under President Rutherford B. Hayes.

5000|$|Headlines during <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> {{convention}} in Kansas City hinted at the still-simmering debates within <b>the</b> rank-and-file <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{as to whether}} or not a new party might be formed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weaknesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> [...] "Conservatives Seek a New Party if Reagan Loses," [...] The Chicago Tribune's Wednesday, August 18, 1976 headlines told readers during the Kansas City convention, which quoted both White House aides as well as critics in <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party who debated <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> a new party emerging out of that year's division in <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> ranks.|$|R
5|$|The republic's {{administrative}} divisions {{remained largely}} unchanged from the structure {{used during the}} Soviet era, with the notable exception of selsoviets—a low-level administrative unit type abolished after the new law on the administrative-territorial divisions had been adopted in May 2000. As of 2014, the republic's administrative-territorial divisions include seven administrative districts (raions) and two republican urban okrugs. The districts have administrative jurisdiction over the inhabited localities located on their territory. Territories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> urban okrugs are separate from the districts and include a city/town <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> significance, {{as well as one}} or several inhabited localities in their vicinity which had historically been administratively subordinated to that city/town.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature with the help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Taft's presidency, {{protectionism}} {{through the use of}} tariffs was a fundamental position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party. The Dingley Tariff had been enacted to protect American industry from foreign competition. The 1908 party platform had supported unspecified revisions to the Dingley Act, and Taft interpreted this to mean reductions. Taft called a special session of Congress to convene on March 15, 1909 to deal with the tariff question.|$|E

5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus {{almost exclusively to}} women's rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith. Unlike many {{of those involved in}} the women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910 midterm {{election}} campaign, Roosevelt involved himself in New York politics, while Taft with donations and influence tried {{to secure the}} election <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, former lieutenant governor Warren G.

In New Jersey, Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected governor, and Harding lost his race in Ohio.|$|E
