25|$|To be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> <b>side,</b> a pill-activated {{inflation}} {{device is}} preferred. A small pill that dissolves on water contact {{is the safest}} option, as it also works in shallow waters where a hydrostatic activator fails. This type of jacket is called an 'automatic'. As it is {{more sensitive to the}} presence of water, early models could also be activated by very heavy rain or spray. For this reason, spare re-arming kits should be carried on board for each life jacket. However, with modern cup/bobbin mechanisms this problem rarely arises and mechanisms such as the Halkey Roberts Pro firing system have all but eliminated accidental firing.|$|E

BOSS operates from 6 pm to until 2am Sunday thru Thursday and until 4am on the weekends during {{the spring and fall}} semesters. Summer hours are 7pm–12am, 7 days a week. Their van service will even drop people off right at their front door if they live in their area of service. This service is funded through students segregated fees.|$|E

The shooting range was enveloped in a blizzard, but Squire chose to carry out the practice.

2500|$|Archduke Charles {{wished to}} prevent the army of Moreau from joining with his {{colleague}} Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. The Austrian commander hoped to withdraw to the south bank of the Danube but the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle was following too closely. By attacking Moreau, the archduke hoped to push the French back in order {{to prevent the}}ir two armies from merging and to give his own troops enough room to cross the Danube safely. Also, he wanted to lure Moreau into crossing the Danube and separating himself from Jourdan. Moreau's army was extended across a front [...] wide. Charles drew up plans to attack on 11 August. He sent one column to cross to the north bank of the Danube at Günzburg to get behind the French right flank. His troops were ready to move at midnight, but heavy rains slowed several of his assault columns. On the 10th Saint-Cyr with Taponier's division, drove the Austrians in his front out of the village of Eglingen. Urged on by Moreau, Saint-Cyr balked because he believed that the enemy were in strength nearby. Before anything more could be done, the heavy rain began and made it impossible to fire the cannons on both sides. Moreau refused to let his subordinate withdraw to a more defensible position or to order Duhesme's division to move closer. The only concession Moreau would make was to send up one regiment of Carabiniers to patrol in front of Taponier. To be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> <b>side,</b> Saint-Cyr stationed Lecourbe and one demi brigade at Dischingen where there was a bridge over the Egau River.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{awareness}} of provisions of consumer protection act among dental and medical professionals in Udaipur city, Rajasthan, India. Materials and Methods: In a cross sectional study, a total of 448 professionals (253 males, 195 females) belonging to dental (222) and medical (226) categories were surveyed using a self administered structured questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of 22 questions about {{the awareness of}} consumer protection art (CPA) and whether these profes-sionals were following the recommendations of CPA. The student’s t-test, ANOVA test, and Scheffe’s test were used as tests of significance. Results: The awareness scores were significantly higher for medical professionals com-pared with those of dental professionals. Similarly, postgraduates showed more awareness in both the professions and {{it was found that}} private practitioners significantly have more awareness than the academic sector.

40|$|Abstract—Transition {{theory has}} been used to derive the elasticplastic and {{transitional}} stresses. Results obtained have been discussed numerically and depicted graphically. It is observed that the rotating disk made of incompressible material with inclusion require higher angular speed to yield at the internal surface as compared to disk made of compressible material. It is seen that the radial and circumferential stresses are maximum at the internal surface with and without edge load (for flat disk). With the increase in thickness parameter (k = 2, 4), the circumferential stress is maximum at the external surface while the radial stress is maximum at the internal surface. From the figures drawn the disk with exponentially varying thickness (k = 2), high angular speed is required for initial yielding at internal surface as compared to flat disk and exponentially varying thickness for k = 4 onwards. It is concluded that the disk made of isotropic compressible material is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> design as compared to disk made of isotropic incompressible material as it requires higher percentage increase in an angular speed to become fully plastic from its initial yielding...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In the {{substation}} automation applications {{the utility of}} Ethernet local area networks (LANs) that interconnects different network devices together has become so popular and has grown steadily, there is always an anxiety on how {{to protect against the}} event of a single link network failure? Though, the easiest way to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> <b>side</b> is by <b>the</b> creation of more than one link between two network devices, having many paths between two network devices in the network establishes a loop (loops). A loop is very dangerous to have in data link layer where the frame doesn’t have TTL (time to live) counting down. [9] This can result in an endless loop in the entire LAN and put the network down [3]. To eliminate loop in Ethernet LAN with redundant link, we can use one of the data link layer protocol which is called STP (Spanning Tree Protocol). In the past STP was not so popular but today more and more enterprises are beginning to use the STP. But not only companies have found the Spanning Tree Protocol to be very interesting, other establishments like schools, hospitals, businesses etc have also found this a great reliable protocol to have.
