5|$|If f {{is allowed}} to be any Euclidean function, then the list of {{possible}} D values for which the domain is Euclidean is not yet known. The first example of a Euclidean domain that was not norm-Euclidean (with D=69) was published in 1994. In 1973, Weinberger proved that a quadratic integer ring with D>0 is Euclidean if, and <b>only</b> <b>if,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a principal ideal domain, provided that the generalized Riemann hypothesis holds.|$|E
5|$|A k-coloring, {{for some}} integer k, is an {{assignment}} {{of one of}} k colors to each vertex of a graph G such that the endpoints of each edge get different colors. The k-colorings of G correspond exactly to homomorphisms from G to the complete graph K'k. Indeed, the vertices of K'k correspond to the k colors, and two colors are adjacent as vertices of K'k if {{and if they are}} different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to K'k if and only if it maps adjacent vertices of G to different colors (i.e., it is a k-coloring). In particular, G is k-colorable if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> K'k-colorable.|$|E

5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E
5|$|The rough idea {{of these}} inapproximability results is {{to form a}} graph that {{represents}} a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> satisfiable. The proof is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine {{a small number of}} randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject the proof, without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.|$|E
5|$|The {{three types}} of {{scrimmage}} kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E
