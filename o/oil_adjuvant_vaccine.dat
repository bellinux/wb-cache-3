40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} newly {{formulated}} enterotoxaemia vaccine having oil and alum adjuvants, with presently available toxoid and alum precipitated vaccines. Materials and Methods: Three types of enterotoxaemia vaccines, namely toxoid (TV), alum precipitated (APV) and alum precipitated <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvant</b> <b>vaccine</b> (AOV) were prepared using a highly toxigenic strain of Clostridium perfringens type D procured from Division of Biological Standardization, IVRI, Izatnagar. Humoral immunity generated in rabbits with these vaccines was then quantified using indirect {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) and mice neutralization test (MNT). Results: Out of three enterotoxaemia vaccines tested, alum precipitated <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvant</b> <b>vaccine</b> produced higher and persistent antibody titre for more than 45 days without any booster dose and did not produce any untoward reactions at the injection site. Alum precipitated vaccine elicited better and persistent immune response than toxoid vaccine though it was less than alum precipitated <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvant</b> <b>vaccine.</b> In MNT, alum precipitated and alum precipitated oil adjuvant vaccines showed protection at 45 th day of post vaccination while toxoid vaccine showed only up to 28 th day. Conclusion: Results of the study unfolded the synergistic role of adjuvants in the induction of better and persistent immune response and also indicated the superiority of alum precipitated <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvant</b> <b>vaccine</b> over the currently available toxoid and alum precipitated enterotoxaemia vaccines.

We have previously reported the development of a differential BoHV- 1 vaccine, based on a recombinant glycoprotein E (gE) -deleted virus (265 gE-). In present paper the efficacy of such recombinant was evaluated as an inactivated vaccine. Five BoHV- 1 seronegative calves were vaccinated intramuscularly on day 0 and boostered 30 days later with an inactivated, <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccine</b> containing an antigenic mass equivalent to 10 (7. 0) fifty per cent cell culture infectious doses (CCID 50) of 265 gE-. Three calves were kept as non vaccinated controls. On day 60 post vaccination both vaccinated and controls were challenged with the virulent parental strain. No clinical signs or adverse effects were seen after or during vaccination. After challenge, 2 / 5 vaccinated calves showed mild clinical signs of infection, whereas all non vaccinated controls displayed intense rhinotracheitis and shed virus for longer and to higher titres than vaccinated calves. Serological responses were detected in all vaccinated animals after the second dose of vaccine, but not on control calves. Following corticosteroid administration in attempting to induce reactivation of the latent infection, no clinical signs were observed in vaccinated calves, whereas non vaccinated controls showed clinical signs of respiratory disease.

40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of the three Southern African Territories (SAT) types of foot-and-mouth diseasevirus (FMDV) reflects high antigenic variation, and indications are that vaccines targeting each SAT-specific topotype may be needed. This has serious implications for control of FMD using vaccines as wellas the choice of strains to include in regional antigen banks. Here, we investigated an intra-serotypechimeric virus, vSAT 2 ZIM 14 -SAT 2, which was engineered by replacing the surface-exposed capsid-codingregion (1 B- 1 D/ 2 A) of a SAT 2 genome-length clone, pSAT 2, {{with that of the}} field isolate, SAT 2 /ZIM/ 14 / 90. The chimeric FMDV produced by this technique was viable, grew to high titres and stably maintained the 1 B- 1 D/ 2 A sequence upon passage. Chemically inactivated, <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccines</b> of both the chimericand parental immunogens were used to vaccinate cattle. The serological response to vaccination showedthe production of strong neutralizing antibody titres that correlated with protection against homolo-gous FMDV challenge. We also predicted a good likelihood that cattle vaccinated with an intra-serotypechimeric vaccine would be protected against challenge with viruses that caused recent outbreaks insouthern Africa. These results provide support that chimeric vaccines containing the external capsid offield isolates induce protective immune responses in FMD host species similar to the parental vaccine.

Moreover, this once-a-year vaccination regimen could also substantially reduce the logistical costs involved during vaccination campaigns, compared to the current biannual vaccination regimen. Once the shelf life of the vaccine has been established, the vaccine could also be registered as a stock remedy under the Fertilisers, Farm Feed, Agricultural Remedies and Stock Remedies Act, 36 of 1947, administered by DAFF.

The disease resistance of chukar Partridges in the vaccine groups (100. 00) was significantly different from that of the control group (0. 00) (p< 0. 001). The mean antibody titers between all groups were significantly different (p< 0. 001). In the groups that vaccinated simultaneously with B 1 live vaccine and IOAV, the enhancement of titers was meaningful in comparison to the groups that received only lived vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Vegetable oils (Vo) are an {{alternative}} to fish oil (Fo) in aquaculture feeds. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary soybean oil (Vo diet), rich in linoleic acid, and of dietary fish oil (Fo diet) {{on the development of}} spinal deformities under bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced chronic inflammation conditions in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. Fish [25 g body weight (BW) ] were fed the experimental diets for 99 days. On day 47 of feeding (40 g BW), fish were subjected to four experimental regimes: (i) intramuscular injections with LPS, (ii) sham-injected phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), (iii) intraperitoneally injected commercial <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvant</b> <b>vaccine,</b> or (iv) no treatment. The fish continued under a common feeding regime in sea water for 165 more days. Body weight was temporarily higher in the Vo group than in the Fo group prior to immunization and was also affected by the type of immunization. At the end of the trial, no differences were seen between the dietary groups. The overall prevalence of spinal deformities was approximately 14 % {{at the end of the}} experiment. The Vo diet affected vertebral shape but did not induce spinal deformities. In groups injected with LPS and PBS, spinal deformities ranged between 21 % and 38 %, diet independent. Deformed vertebrae were located at or in proximity to the injection point. Assessment of inflammatory markers revealed high levels of plasma prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in the Vo-fed and LPS-injected groups, suggesting an inflammatory response to LPS. Cyclooxigenase 2 (COX- 2) mRNA expression in bone was higher in fish fed Fo compared to Vo-fed fish. Gene expression of immunoglobulin M (IgM) was up-regulated in bone of all LPS-injected groups irrespective of dietary oil. In conclusion, the study suggests that Vo is not a risk factor for the development of inflammation-related spinal deformities. At the same time, we found evidence that localized injection-related processes could trigger the development of vertebral body malformations...|$|E
40|$|Swine {{influenza}} is {{a highly}} contagious acute viral disease of the respiratory tract in pigs, which is prevalent world-wide. The disease causes considerable economic damage primarily due to reduced weight gain in finishing pigs and reduced reproductive performance of sows. In addition, influenza is a zoonotic disease, because swine influenza viruses can transmit to, and cause disease in people, and pigs can {{be a source of}} new human influenza strains. Moreover, antigenic drift of the swine influenza A H 3 N 2 viruses in the Netherlands and Belgium was demonstrated and a replacement of this strain by a more recent swine H 3 N 2 virus in swine vaccines has been recommended. In this thesis, research is described in which the protection conferred by current swine influenza vaccines was evaluated and possible improvements to influenza vaccines were studied. A current commercial split virus in <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvant</b> <b>vaccine</b> was shown to be efficacious in protecting pigs against a drift variant of H 3 N 2 in a vaccination-challenge experiment. Therefore, there does not yet seem to be an urgent need for the virus strains to be replaced by more recent strains. The swine vaccine may confer a broader protection than human sub-unit vaccines possibly {{because of the presence of}} the other viral proteins in addition to the HA and NA, and of the adjuvant. Because the variability of the HA and NA are a major problem in vaccinating pigs and humans against influenza, immune responses to other more conserved proteins were studied. Antibodies to the highly conserved extracellular domain of M 2 and cytotoxic T cells (CTL) to the NP seemed to be involved in broad-spectrum protection in pigs after infection, but are not induced by current vaccines. However, an experimental vaccine that induced those effectors, and no antibodies to the HA and NA, enhanced instead of prevented clinical signs after viral challenge. This indicates that those effectors can even exacerbate disease, when induced parenterally and/or if other effectors are absent. Therefore, although including conserved antigens in vaccines and enhancing the response against them could broaden protection, caution must be exercised to make sure they do not enhance disease after vaccination with novel generations of vaccines. Successive intranasal vaccination with an attenuated H 1 N 1 strain and an H 3 N 2 strain will specifically induce mucosal subtype cross-reactive IgA and IgG antibodies, as well as CTL. Although such drastic vaccination strategies are not applicable to pigs they might be applied as a strategy of immunisation in case a next human pandemic is feared. A broad-spectrum vaccine, which can be applied intramuscular would be ideal but as long as such a vaccine cannot be developed, extensive influenza surveillance and regular updating of vaccine strains will remain necessary...|$|E
40|$|Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is the {{etiologic}} agent of furunculosis, a frequent and significant disease of fisheries worldwide. The disease is largely controlled by commercial <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvanted</b> <b>vaccines</b> containing bacterins. However, the mechanisms {{leading to a}} protective immune response remain poorly understood. The type-three secretion system (T 3 SS) plays {{a central role in}} virulence of A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and thus may have an influence on the immune response of the host. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of the T 3 SS antigens in mounting a protective immune response against furunculosis. Rainbow trout were intraperitoneally vaccinated in two independent experiments with bacterins prepared from a wild-type A. salmonicida strain and an isogenic strain carrying a deletion in the T 3 SS (delta ascV). Fish were challenged with the wt strain eight weeks after vaccination. In both trials, the survival rate of trout vaccinated with the delta ascV strain was significantly higher (23 - 28 %) in comparison to the group vaccinated with the wt strain. High-throughput proteomics analysis of whole bacteria showed the ascV deletion in the mutant strain resulted in lower expression of all the components of the T 3 SS, several of which have a potential immunosuppressive activity. In a third experiment, fish were vaccinated with recombinant AcrV (homologous to the protective antigen LcrV of Yersinia) or S-layer protein VapA (control). AcrV vaccinated fish were not protected against a challenge while fish vaccinated with VapA were partially protected. The presence of T 3 SS proteins in the vaccine preparations decreased the level of protection against A. salmonicida infection and that AcrV was not a protective antigen. These results challenge the hypothesis that mounting specific antibodies against T 3 SS proteins should bring better protection to fish and demonstrate that further investigations are needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying effective immune responses against A. salmonicida infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of Fusobacterium necrophorum crude leukotoxoid vaccine to immunize and protect steers against experimentally induced liver abscesses was evaluated. The vaccine consisted of cell-free culture supernatant {{of a high}} leukotoxin-producing strain of F. necrophorum, inactivated with formalin and homogenized with an <b>oil</b> emulsion <b>adjuvant.</b> <b>Vaccine</b> was injected subcutaneously on days 0 and 21. Blood samples were collected weekly to monitor immune response. Three weeks after the second vaccination, steers were injected intraportally with F. necrophorum culture to induce liver abscesses. Three weeks later (day 63), steers were euthanatized and necropsied; livers were examined, and protection was assessed. Anti-leukotoxin antibody titers in the control steers generally {{did not differ from}} the baseline (week 0) titers. The titers in the vaccinated groups increased, more so after the second injection, and the increase was generally dose dependent. At necropsy, all steers in the control group had liver abscesses. In the vaccinated groups, two out of five steers in the 1. 0 ml group and one each in the 2. 0, 5. 0, and 2. 25 ml (concentrated) groups had liver abscesses. The difference suggests a protective effect of antileukotoxin antibodies against experimentally induced liver abscesses...|$|R
40|$|Most {{commercial}} vaccines {{offered to}} the aquaculture industry include inactivated antigens (Ag) formulated in <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvants.</b> Safety concerns {{are related to the}} use of <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvants</b> in multivalent <b>vaccines</b> for fish, since adverse side effects (e. g., adhesions) can appear. Therefore, there is a request for vaccine formulations for which protection will be maintained or improved, while the risk of side effects is reduced. Here, by using an inactivated salmonid alphavirus (SAV) as the test Ag, the combined use of two Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand adjuvants, CpG oligonucleotides (ODNs) and poly I:C, as well as a genetic adjuvant consisting of a DNA plasmid vector expressing the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) glycoprotein (G) was explored. VHSV-G DNA vaccine was intramuscularly injected in combination with intraperitoneal injection of either SAV Ag alone or combined with the <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvant,</b> Montanide ISA 763, or the CpG/polyI:C combo. Adjuvant formulations were evaluated for their ability to boost immune responses and induce protection against SAV in Atlantic salmon, following cohabitation challenge. It was observed that CpG/polyI:C-based formulations generated the highest neutralizing antibody titres (nAbs) before challenge, which endured post challenge. nAb responses for VHSV G-DNA- and oil-adjuvanted formulations were marginal compared to the CpG/poly I:C treatment. Interestingly, heat-inactivated sera showed reduced nAb titres compared to their non-heated counterparts, which suggests a role of complement-mediated neutralization against SAV. Consistently elevated levels of innate antiviral immune genes in the CpG/polyI:C injected groups suggested a role of IFN-mediated responses. Co-delivery of the VHSV-G DNA construct with either CpG/polyI:C or oil-adjuvanted SAV vaccine generated higher CD 4 responses in head kidney at 48 h compared to injection of this vector or SAV Ag alone. The results demonstrate that a combination of pattern recognizing receptor (PRR) ligands, such as CpG/polyI:C, increases both adaptive and innate responses and represents a promising adjuvant strategy for enhancing the protection of future viral vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory disease {{complex is}} {{a major cause of}} {{mortality}} and economic losses in the commercial broiler industry. In 1991 a previously unidentified bacterium associated with respiratory disease and cranial cellulitis was isolated from broilers in the then Transvaal Province (van Beek, van Empel, van den Bosch, Storm, Bongers, du Preez, 1994.). In 1994 the organism was named Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (Vandamme, Segers, Vancanneyt, van Hove, Mutters, Hommez, Dewhirst, Paster, Kersters, Falsen, Devriese, Bisgaard, Hinz, Mannheim, 1994.). Since then Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale has been isolated worldwide from chickens and turkeys showing respiratory signs and has become well established as contributing to the respiratory disease complex in both species (van Empel, Hafez, 1999). In South Africa respiratory disease and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale in particular is routinely controlled by the inclusion of antibiotics such as Oxtetracycline into the feed of broilers during rearing. Concerns about antibiotic residues in poultry meat for human consumption as well as evidence that suggests that Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale readily develops resistance to antibiotics (Devriese, Hommez, Vandamme, Kersters, Haesebrouck, 1995), make this strategy unsustainable. It was with a view to reducing producers’ dependence on long term prophylactic antibiotic therapy that this study to determine the safety and efficacy of an OR bacterin vaccine was carried out. Injection of the bacterin into broilers was deemed impractical on a commercial scale, so it was applied to broiler breeder parent stock in order that they could protect their progeny through vertically transmitted immunity developed as a result of vaccination. Breeder flocks were vaccinated intramuscularly at nine and 18 weeks with a monovalent bacterin based on OR serotype A with <b>oil</b> <b>adjuvant.</b> <b>Vaccine</b> safety was evaluated by palpation of vaccination sites and clinical observation of breeders for two weeks after vaccination. The serological response of breeders to vaccination was monitored using an ELISA test for Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale optimised for use under South African conditions. Vaccine efficacy was determined by monitoring of broiler progeny of vaccinated breeders raised under commercial conditions as well as through controlled challenge studies with Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale under laboratory conditions. In order to determine the financial consequences of using the test vaccine, a partial farm budget was drawn up from available broiler data and possible outcomes were modelled using a stochastic model. The vaccine proved to be safe for use in commercial broiler breeders and vaccinated birds developed a good humoral response to vaccination. As a result of cross-contamination of isolators with Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale the results of the challenge studies were inconclusive. No evidence of protection of broiler progeny of vaccinated breeder flocks could be detected through the challenge trials. In the absence of in-feed medication, broilers hatched from vaccinated breeders did, however, performed better under commercial conditions than those hatched from unvaccinated breeder flocks. The partial farm budget showed that broilers raised from OR vaccinated breeder flocks were more profitable than the negative control flocks. The quantitative risk analysis showed that the probability of making a relative profit from broilers as a result of OR vaccination of parent stock was 74 %, from the use of in-feed medication in broilers from unvaccinated parents was 70 % and from a combination of the interventions was 99 %. It can be concluded that the last of these options was most profitable. Copyright 2003, University of Pretoria. All rights reserved. The copyright in this work vests in the University of Pretoria.
