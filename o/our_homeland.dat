2500|$|That the {{ordinances}} were enacted [...] "'because of,' {{not merely}} 'in spite of'", their suppression of Santería religious practice is {{revealed by the}} events preceding enactment of the ordinances. The minutes and taped excerpts of the June 9 session, {{both of which are}} in the record, evidence significant hostility exhibited by residents, members of the city council, and other city officials toward the Santería religion and its practice of animal sacrifice. The public crowd that attended the June 9 meetings interrupted statements by council members critical of Santería with cheers and the brief comments of Pichardo with taunts. When Councilman Martinez, a supporter of the ordinances, stated that in pre-revolution Cuba [...] "people were put in jail for practicing this religion", the audience applauded. Other statements by members of the city council were in a similar vein. For example, Councilman Martinez, after noting his belief that Santería was outlawed in Cuba, questioned, [...] "if we could not practice this [...] in <b>our</b> <b>homeland</b> , why bring it to this country?" [...] Councilman Cardoso said that Santería devotees at the Church [...] "are in violation of everything this country stands for." [...] Various Hialeah city officials made comparable comments. The chaplain of the Hialeah Police Department told the city council that Santería was a sin, [...] "foolishness", [...] "an abomination to the Lord", and the worship of [...] "demons." [...] He advised the city council that [...] "We need to be helping people and sharing with them the truth that is found in Jesus Christ." [...] He concluded: [...] "I would exhort you [...] [...] [...] not to permit this Church to exist." [...] The city attorney commented that Resolution 87-66 indicated that [...] "This community will not tolerate religious practices which are abhorrent to its citizens...." [...] Similar comments were made by the deputy city attorney. This history discloses the object of the ordinances to target animal sacrifice by Santería worshippers because of its religious motivation.|$|E
