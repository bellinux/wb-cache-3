5|$|After the Second World War, new {{government}} turned toward Soviet influence and the Stalinist monumentalism. The doctrine of Socialist realism in Poland, {{as in other}} countries of the People's Republics, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements {{were made in the}} field <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> design. The guidelines for this new trend were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing the new social order by the communists. The ideological impact <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> design was valued more than aesthetics. It aimed at expressing persistence and power. This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with apartment blocks constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint, with repetitious courtyards and wide, tree-lined avenues.|$|E
