5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of Côte d'Ivoire {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international market prices <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist international tariffs on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Côte d'Ivoire lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d'Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann told Brand that {{he wanted}} 10,000 new trucks for the Waffen-SS to use on the Eastern front, one truck for every 100 Jews, as well as 200 tons of tea, 200 tons of cocoa, 800 tons <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> 2,000,000 cases of soap. If Brand {{returned}} from Istanbul with confirmation that the Allies had accepted the proposal, Eichmann said he would release 10 percent of the one million. The deal would proceed with 100,000 Jews released for every 1,000 trucks.|$|E
5|$|Emerald {{took two}} French sloops in July 1809. Deux Freres, en route for Guadeloupe from Rochelle when {{captured}}, arrived in Plymouth on 26 July. A week later, Emerald captured the French schooner Balance, {{which had been}} sailing to France from Guadeloupe. Both captures carried letters of marque, a government licence authorising the attack and capture of enemy vessels. The first, of four guns, was carrying a small reinforcement for Guadeloupe's garrison. The second, also of four guns, was carrying a cargo <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> other colonial produce.|$|E

5|$|Right {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the march, the volunteers faced many disruptions. When they reached Koviladi, a small village on the banks of Kaveri, they were denied accommodation at a famous inn. However, they found alternative accommodation on the banks of the river, while Rajaji stayed at a private house. Rajaji also had a code of conduct for the volunteers under which consumption <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> tobacco products, and smoking were prohibited.|$|E
5|$|We {{did a lot}} of {{recording}} at his house. I'd come by in the morning and Stuart would answer the door in his stocking feet– as he'd been up all night. I'd bring him a cup <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> say, 'Stuart, your house is a mess, there's no food in the cupboard.' Then I'd call someone from my house to bring food over for him. And then we'd work all day. We're very much the odd couple.|$|E
5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a cup <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then he should go to the Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing Dreamtime.|$|E

25|$|The Kouilou, in {{addition}} to being a land of immigration, is also a land of emigration and expatriation during colonization.

25|$|The Rwandan {{economy is}} based on the largely rain-fed {{agricultural}} production of small, semi-subsistence, and increasingly fragmented farms. It has few natural resources to exploit and a small, noncompetitive industrial sector. While the production <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> tea is well-suited to the small farms, steep slopes, and cool climates of Rwanda and has ensured access to foreign exchange over the years, farm size continues to decrease.|$|E
25|$|Textiles and {{garments}} are {{intricate and}} require one individual operator, {{in contrast to}} the collective farming <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> cocoa beans. Textiles are not a straightforward commodity because to be fairly traded, there must be regulation in cotton cultivation, dyeing, stitching, and every other step in the process of textile production. Fair trade textiles must not be confused with the sweat-free movement although the two movements intersect at the worker level.|$|E

25|$|Ivory Coast is a {{republic}} {{with a strong}} executive power invested in its President. Through the production <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> cocoa, the country was an economic powerhouse in West Africa during the 1960s and 1970s. Ivory Coast went through an economic crisis in the 1980s, contributing to a period {{of political and social}} turmoil. Changing into the 21st-century Ivorian economy is largely market-based and still relies heavily on agriculture, with smallholder cash-crop production being dominant.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, the {{government}} decided {{to regulate the}} export <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> protect the small and marginal farmers by passing the Coffee VII Act of 1942, under which the Coffee Board of India got established, operated by the Ministry of Commerceand Industry. The government dramatically increased their control of coffee exports in India and pooled the coffees of its growers. In doing so, they reduced the incentives for farmers to produce high-quality coffee, so quality became stagnant.|$|E

In addition, in mid-2004 it was announced that Vanderbilt's chemical biology research may have serendipitously opened the door to the breeding of a blue rose, something that has long been coveted by horticulturalists and rose lovers.|$|E

25|$|For {{many decades}} in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Brazil was the biggest {{producer}} <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> a virtual monopolist in the trade. However, a policy of maintaining high prices soon opened opportunities to other nations, such as Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Indonesia and Vietnam, now second only to Brazil as the major coffee producer in the world. Large-scale production in Vietnam began following normalization of trade relations with the US in 1995. Nearly all of the coffee grown there is Robusta.|$|E
25|$|Tanala social {{structure}} {{is characterized by}} a harmonious interrelationship between the nobles of the Tanala who migrated into the forest where they settled, and the commoner chiefs {{of the people who were}} already settled there. This relationship is traditionally reinforced through marriage between the groups and particular roles given to each in the governance of the community. The Tanala speak a dialect of the Malagasy language and adhere to numerous fady such as a prohibition against visiting a nobleman when he is ill, or closing the door to the house during mealtimes to prevent others from watching one eat. Their main livelihoods are the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> rice.|$|E
