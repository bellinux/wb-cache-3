25|$|Later Greek historians {{consider}} Democritus to {{have established}} aesthetics {{as a subject}} of investigation and study, as he wrote theoretically on poetry and fine art long before authors such as Aristotle. Specifically, Thrasyllus identified six works in the philosopher's oeuvre which had belonged to aesthetics as a discipline, but only fragments of the relevant works are extant; hence of all Democritus's writings on these matters, {{only a small percentage}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> and ideas can be known.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Fles {{carried on}} correspondences with other leading thinkers of his day, {{including}} an extended debate with Henri Polak regarding {{the nature of}} socialism and Fles' determined opposition to Zionism. Fles felt himself to be Dutch, and saw Zionism as further separating Jews from their non-Jewish Dutch neighbors while reinforcing {{the image of the}} Jew as a foreigner. Instead, Fles favored assimilation into the cultures in which Jews found themselves. He endorsed mixed marriages to accelerate this process. Fles gathered many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> from this correspondence into the 1939 pamphlet Weg met het zionisme! (Down with Zionism!).|$|E

25|$|Nicolas Fatio {{presented}} the first formulation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> on gravitation {{in a letter}} to Christiaan Huygens in the spring of 1690. Two days later Fatio read the content of the letter before the Royal Society in London. In the following years Fatio composed several draft manuscripts of his major work De la Cause de la Pesanteur, but none of this material was published in his lifetime. In 1731 Fatio also sent his theory as a Latin poem, in the style of Lucretius, to the Paris Academy of Science, but it was dismissed. Some fragments of these manuscripts and copies of the poem were later acquired by Le Sage who failed to find a publisher for Fatio's papers. So it lasted until 1929, when the only complete copy of Fatio's manuscript was published by Karl Bopp, and in 1949 Gagnebin used the collected fragments in possession of Le Sage to reconstruct the paper. The Gagnebin edition includes revisions made by Fatio as late as 1743, forty years after he composed the draft on which the Bopp edition was based. However, {{the second half of the}} Bopp edition contains the mathematically most advanced parts of Fatio's theory, and were not included by Gagnebin in his edition. For a detailed analysis of Fatio's work, and a comparison between the Bopp and the Gagnebin editions, see Zehe The following description is mainly based on the Bopp edition.|$|E

In February 1883 Julius Dresser, a former patient of Quimby's, accused Eddy in letters to the Boston Post of teaching Quimby's work as her own. In response Eddy disparaged Quimby as a mesmerist and said she had experimented with mental healing in or around 1853, nine years before she met him. She wrote later: [...] "We caught some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>thoughts,</b> and he caught some of ours; and both of us were pleased to say this to each other." ...|$|E

It was described as a [...] "show about grief" [...] when it first started airing and that the [...] "cause of the car crash didn't really matter" [...] at that time. Now, however, The A.V.

500|$|The New England {{response}} to the assembly was Cotton's book The Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven published in 1644. It was Cotton's attempt to persuade the assembly to adopt the Congregational way of church polity in England, endorsed by English ministers Thomas Goodwin and Philip Nye. [...] In it, Cotton reveals some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> on state governance. [...] "Democracy I do not conceive that ever God did ordain as a fit government either for church or commonwealth." [...] Despite these views against democracy, congregationalism later became important in the democratization of the English colonies in North America. This work on church polity {{had no effect on}} the view of most Presbyterians, but it did change the stance of Presbyterian John Owen who later became a leader of the independent party at the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660. [...] Owen had earlier been selected by Oliver Cromwell to be the vice-chancellor of Oxford.|$|E
500|$|Foreigners like Coey {{who volunteered}} for the Rhodesian Army {{received}} the same pay and conditions of service as local regulars. Ideologically and religiously motivated, Coey viewed himself {{as a kind of}} latter-day crusader. He kept a thorough journal <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> and experiences throughout his army service. [...] "I believe God intended me to come here for some purpose," [...] he wrote soon after enlisting. [...] "This action has cost me an Officer's Commission, and ... my citizenship may be revoked, [...] this is the most I can do for my country under the circumstances." [...] He told the historian Gerald Horne that he believed communists had already compromised top levels of the US government, and that by serving in Rhodesia he was helping to unify [...] "his people" [...] against a foreign conspiracy. His religious views also affected his views on Zionism: he believed that the State of Israel's existence prior to the Second Coming of Christ was contrary to scriptural prophecies, and that it should therefore be destroyed.|$|E
500|$|The {{historical}} record of Goya's later life is relatively scant; no accounts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> {{from this time}} survive. He deliberately suppressed {{a number of his}} works from this period – most notably the Disasters of War series– which are today considered amongst his finest. He was tormented by a dread of old age and fear of madness, the latter possibly from anxiety caused by an undiagnosed illness that left him deaf from the early 1790s. Goya had been a successful and royally placed artist, but withdrew from public life during his final years. From the late 1810s he lived in near-solitude outside Madrid in a farmhouse converted into a studio. The house had become known as [...] "La Quinta del Sordo" [...] (The House of the Deaf Man), after the nearest farmhouse had coincidentally also belonged to a deaf man. Art historians assume Goya felt alienated from the social and political trends that followed the 1814 restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, and that he viewed these developments as reactionary means of social control. In his unpublished art he seems to have railed against what he saw as a tactical retreat into Medievalism. It is thought that he had hoped for political and religious reform, but like many liberals became disillusioned when the restored Bourbon monarchy and Catholic hierarchy rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812.|$|E
