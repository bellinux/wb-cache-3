5|$|A small {{contingent}} of Autobots remains behind <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> investigate allegations that Skywatch head Spike Witwicky illegally executed Scrapper, discovering that his crimes go far deeper, {{and that he}} has been trading weapons technology with Swindle. Spike goes on the run, and Jazz, already compromised after killing a human in the heat of battle, dissolves the Autobots' alliance with Skywatch.|$|E
5|$|Some Overlords remain <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> {{study the}} {{children}} from a safe distance. When the evolved children mentally alter the Moon's rotation and make other planetary manipulations, it becomes too dangerous to remain. The departing Overlords offer to take Rodricks with them, but he chooses to stay to witness Earth's end, and transmit a report of what he sees.|$|E

5|$|A three-part series {{published}} between May and July 1996, it references the symbiote {{invasion in}} Planet of the Symbiotes as a symbiote-eating alien (the Xenophage) arrives <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> <b>to</b> hunt the remaining symbiotes. Scream returns as an anti-hero {{after the events}} of Venom: Separation Anxiety to protect the hosts of the invasion symbiotes. Venom is hunted by the police, who blame it for the murders committed by the Xenophage. Venom and Scream kill the Xenophage and escape their police pursuit.|$|E
5|$|In their spare time, {{crews were}} able {{to catch up with}} work, observe the Earth below, respond to letters, {{drawings}} and other items brought from Earth (and give them an official stamp to show they had been aboard Mir), or make use of the station's ham radio. Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.|$|E

5|$|The mission's only Extra-Vehicular Activity, or spacewalk, {{took place}} on May 12, between 10:44 and 15:36 UTC. The primary {{objectives}} of the spacewalk were to repair damage to Mir's exterior components and record panoramas of the station's hull in order for experts <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> analyze the effects of space on the station itself. The cosmonauts inspected a malfunctioning solar array on the Kvant-1 module of the station. They discovered that a burnt-through wire connecting the array with its steering system was preventing its proper rotation. The array was subsequently deemed a loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} of Madagascar {{is a subject}} of ongoing research and debate. Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000BC. Traditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves throughout the period between 350BC and 550AD, while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250AD. In either case, these dates make Madagascar {{one of the last}} major landmasses <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> be settled by humans.|$|E
5|$|WALL-E was {{the most}} complex Pixar {{production}} since Monsters, Inc. because {{of the world and}} the history that had to be conveyed. Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, WALL-E required 125,000. Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> be romantic, and that of the second act on the Axiom to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the Axiom environment. Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage. Eggleston bleached out the whites <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.|$|E

5|$|Dana discovers Em {{was killed}} by Lester Majak, an aging local celebrity. Majak was a {{physical}} trainer who was convinced his fitness regime would extend his life. When he began to notice his growing frailty, he researched a legend of immortality from India. A particular creek near Wausau met the requirements for the legend, and Majak murdered Em near it in a ritual to extend his life. However, Em's recent pregnancy provided additional life force and caused an imbalance that resulted in Revival Day. The imbalance is still affecting the river, and will grow to threaten all life <b>on</b> <b>Earth.</b> <b>To</b> restore balance, Em must give birth before she reunites with her soul and permanently dies. As she delivers her daughter, the remaining revivers merge with their souls as well.|$|E
5|$|Prime {{decides to}} send Verity {{and her two}} friends Hunter and Jimmy home. Ironhide and Sunstreaker are given this task, but the Machination strikes and {{seemingly}} destroy Sunstreaker and Hunter. Ratchet realizes that Sunstreaker's corpse is a fake and that he and Hunter have simply been kidnapped. Megatron uses the Ore-13 {{to give him the}} rare ability of mass-displacement to transform into an earthen pistol, and decides to stay <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> escalate tensions, using a human facsimile to stir up a war between the United States and El Jira. The Autobots, with newly arrived allies, battle the Decepticons in the Russian breakaway state of Brasnya where the super-powered Megatron beats Prime to near death. Prime manages to recover and puts Megatron to flight. However, the facsimile Georgi Koska arrives dead at the Autobot base.|$|E
5|$|The cover also {{features}} a blue dragon eating a human, the design {{of which was a}} direct reference to the sea serpent image from Olaus Magnus's book History of the Northern Peoples. The use of a dragon eating a man is to symbolise former member Hester being consumed by depression, symbolised by the dragon being blue, and this brought his time <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> <b>to</b> an early end. The cover art is almost completely composed of newspaper cuttings collaged together, even the image of the man and the dragon are newspaper cuttings which Seymour painted onto. Only the tree on the right, and the title text are not composed of newspaper cuttings. The tree is to pose as a simile for the tree under which Hester took his life in 2005.|$|E

5|$|In the fleet, President Roslin (Mary McDonnell) burns {{her book}} of Pythia, and {{is unable to}} address the fleet because of feeling that she led the fleet nowhere, and believing the prophecy is a lost cause. Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) and Anastasia Dualla (Kandyse McClure) revisit their relationship, and after their evening together, Dualla returns to her quarters, and commits suicide. Devastated by this, Admiral Adama acquires a handgun from a Marine and {{attempts}} to coerce Tigh (Michael Hogan) into killing him, which fails. Adama breaks down relieved and converses with Tigh about past memories, and Tigh reminding Adama of his duties as commander of the fleet. Adama eventually steps back into the CIC, and makes an announcement that he will find {{a home for the}} fleet, gives instructions to search for any nearby habitable star systems, and invites their new Cylon allies to join them. As the fleet prepares to leave Earth, which is determined to be uninhabitable, D'Anna (Lucy Lawless), devastated by the knowledge that history repeats itself endlessly, decides to remain <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> die, rather than being hunted by Cavil.|$|E
5|$|The Decepticon {{scientist}} Shockwave {{begins the}} secretive Operation: Regenesis — seeding Energon on various planets, including Earth. While stabilizing Earth's seeding, the Dynobots attack Shockwave, {{and they are}} all buried in molten lava for thousands of years. Bludgeon is assigned by Megatron to investigate Operation: Regenesis and Soundwave is told to spy on him. In 1984, Soundwave learns to his horror that Bludgeon intends to use the Ultra-Energon <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>to</b> re-animate Thunderwing, but is silenced and put into stasis-lock in his cassette player mode. The following year, an organization named Skywatch find Laserbeak and Ravage's bodies. Starscream and his unit later come to Earth, discover Shockwave's Energon and mine it in Nebraska. When they exhaust this supply in 2006, they move to Oregon, entering siege mode to protect their discovery. As part of their plan to acquire a Transformer, an agent working for the Machination takes a photo of a Decepticon transforming and locates the original Decepticon base. As a response he is targeted and killed by Thundercracker, Runabout and Runamuck. Before his death, his laptop with the photo is stolen by a girl named Verity Carlo and she is taken to the Autobots - inadvertently leading the Machination straight to them via a homing device in the laptop.|$|E
