As a small child, {{living in his}} parents' house on Muirthemne Plain, he begs {{to be allowed to}} join the boy-troop at Emain Macha. However, he sets <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own, and when he arrives at Emain he runs onto the playing field without first asking for the boys' protection, being unaware of the custom. The boys take this as a challenge and attack him, but he has a ríastrad and beats them single-handed. Conchobar puts a stop to the fight and clears up the misunderstanding, but no sooner has Sétanta put himself under the boys' protection than he chases after them, demanding they put themselves under his protection.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}}, 6. Staffel {{at the time}} was based in Petsamo, present-day Pechenga in Murmansk Oblast, Russia. Weissenberger took <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> first Bf109 combat mission at 14:00 on 15 September 1942 after he had spent a few days familiarizing himself with the {{single-engine}} fighter aircraft. The mission, flown by 10 Bf109 fighters from 6. Staffel, was a combat air patrol in the vicinity of Murmashi. The flight encountered enemy aircraft and Weissenberger filed claims over two Curtiss P-40 Warhawk Lend-Lease fighters shot down at 14:31 and 14:33. These were his first victories claimed on the Bf109, taking his total to 25 victories. A week later, on 22 September, Weissenberger and 6.

5|$|In Wonder Boy in Monster Land, players control Wonder Boy as he {{destroys the}} monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, Wonder Boy starts {{out in the}} City of Wonder Land without any items or gold, but {{to give him a}} chance, at the {{beginning}} of the game, the city's mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move Wonder Boy on the main screen, to enter doors by pressing upward, and to use Magic Weapons by pressing downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when in a shop. Players also have two buttons: one which makes Wonder Boy attack with his sword and buy items in the shop; and one which makes Wonder Boy jump and skip through storylines.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{took over}} as player-manager at King's Lynn in September 1998 and was sent <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> playing debut, a 3–2 away defeat to Worcester City in the Southern League Premier Division on 26 September. His first goal for the club came after {{shooting}} into the bottom corner from a Lee Wilson back-heel in a 3–3 home draw with Salisbury City on 6 March 1999. He made 30 appearances and scored one goal in 1998–99, as his team finished 10th in the Southern League Premier Division. King's Lynn improved on their league performance in 1999–2000, finishing in fifth place in the table. Mills continued to appear frequently in the team, playing in 34 matches and scoring one goal. He resigned as King's Lynn manager on 8 November 2000 due to major financial problems at the club, and had made 16 appearances and scored one goal {{up to that point}} in 2000–01. He returned to playing just three days later by signing for Football Conference club Boston United, making his debut the same day in a 2–2 home draw with Scarborough.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and hot weather. Michael Schumacher clinched his ninth pole position of the season, his second at the circuit, with a time of 1:37.397. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen who recorded a lap time 0.463 seconds slower than the pole sitter. Coulthard qualified third and suffered a worrying moment when a fire on his McLaren caused petrol to seep into his eye and admitted the incident could have escalated if not dealt with quickly. Barrichello, who was still suffering from flu, qualified fourth having been pushed from second position in the closing seconds of the session. Wurz qualified fifth, in his best qualifying performance of the season. Villeneuve secured the sixth fastest time despite having to walk to the pit lane when his BAR's engine was turned <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> final run. Irvine made changes to his set-up and secured seventh although he believed he could have been quicker as he backed off through turn 15. Ralf Schumacher lost four-tenths of a second on his fastest lap and managed eighth. Trulli and Frentzen rounded out the top ten qualifying positions for Jordan. Zonta missed qualifying in the top ten by two-tenths of a second and lost time with a braking issue. Herbert, in his final Formula One race, qualified twelfth and struggled with understeer following an engine change. He was ahead of Fisichella, de la Rosa and Verstappen. Jenson Button qualified 16th and encountered traffic during the session which prevented him from setting a faster lap time. The Sauber, Prost and Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid, covering positions 17 to 22.|$|E

5|$|The crusaders' {{march through}} Anatolia was {{thereafter}} unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything {{he left behind}} in his army's flight. It {{was the middle of}} summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died. Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the Cilician Gates, Baldwin of Boulogne set <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own towards the Armenian lands around the Euphrates; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by Thoros of Edessa, a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his Greek Orthodox religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated. Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the County of Edessa, the first of the crusader states.|$|E
5|$|The safety car was {{withdrawn}} {{at the end}} of the second lap and the race got underway again with Häkkinen in the lead. Button, meanwhile, was immediately overtaken by Barrichello and Frentzen for sixth position. At the completion of the third lap, the race order was Häkkinen, Coulthard, Salo, de la Rosa, Herbert, Barrichello, Frentzen, Button, Marc Gené, Wurz, Heidfeld, Alesi, Villeneuve, Burti, Zonta, Ralf Schumacher, Mazzacane, Diniz and Verstappen. Both McLaren drivers began to pull away from the rest of the field and exchanged fastest laps, as de la Rosa passed Salo for third at the start of lap four. Frentzen in the Jordan became the fourth retirement of the race with an engine failure on lap five and spun <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> car's oil. Barrichello passed Herbert for fifth position on the same lap, while Zonta passed Burti for 13th. Verstappen set a new fastest lap of the race on lap six as he immediately closed on Diniz in 17th. Alesi overtook his teammate Heidfeld for tenth position on the following lap. Häkkinen continued to set fastest laps and opened the gap between Coulthard and de la Rosa to five seconds by lap eight. Barrichello claimed fourth position after passing Salo on the same lap and Ralf Schumacher made a pit stop for a new front wing. Ralf Schumacher made a pit stop for further repairs on the following lap.|$|E
