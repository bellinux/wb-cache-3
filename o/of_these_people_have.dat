5|$|Six {{of these}} {{original}} handwritten copies were uniquely dedicated and given by Rowling to six {{people who were}} most involved with the Harry Potter series. The recipients of these copies were not initially identified. Since then, two <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been named. One is Barry Cunningham, Rowling's very first editor. Another is Arthur A. Levine, editor for Scholastic, the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter books. Cunningham and Levine had lent their personal copies as part of Beedle the Bard exhibits in December 2008.|$|E
25|$|Permanent {{nerve damage}} after a {{peripheral}} nerve block is rare. Symptoms {{are likely to}} resolve within a few weeks. The vast majority of those affected (92%–97%) recover within four to six weeks; 99% <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> recovered within a year. An estimated one in 5,000 to 30,000 nerve blocks results in some degree of permanent persistent nerve damage.|$|E

25|$|Its use in {{children}} is generally advised against, {{although it may}} be done under the supervision of a specialist. On September 21, 2015 the FDA started investigating the safety of tramadol in use in persons under the age of 17. The investigation was initiated because some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> experienced slowed or difficult breathing. The FDA lists age under 12 years old as a contraindication.|$|E
25|$|Between 10 and 30% {{of people}} who have status epilepticus die within 30 days. The great {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> an underlying brain condition causing their status seizure such as brain tumor, brain infection, brain trauma, or stroke. However, people with diagnosed epilepsy who have a status seizure also have an increased risk of death if their condition is not stabilized quickly, their medication and sleep regimen adapted and adhered to, and stress and other stimulant (seizure trigger) levels controlled.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} human habitation on Lewis {{is found in}} peat samples which indicate that about 8,000 years ago much of the native woodland was torched {{to make way for}} grassland to allow deer to graze. The earliest archaeological remains date from about 5,000 years ago. At that time, people began to settle in permanent farms rather than following their herds. The small houses <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been found throughout the Western Isles; in particular, at Dail Mhor, Carloway. The more striking great monuments of this period are the temples and communal burial cairns at places like Calanais.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{court case}} that began on March 24, 2011, in the Vantaa Local Court, the {{prosecutor}} Mikko Sipila accused Storsjö altogether of three cases of arranging an illegal entry, of which one he {{considered to be a}} gross one. He demanded that Storsjö be given a jail sentence. The alleged crimes had taken place from 2007 to 2010. According to the prosecution, Storsjö had brought 22 Chechens from Turkey to Finland on three separate occasions, and 9 <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> been minors. None <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> carried travel documents that would have entitled them to enter Finland. The prosecution also deemed that even though Storsjö had not benefited from this activity financially, he had reaped benefits in other ways, such as gaining a reputation and the respect of certain circles.” ...|$|R
25|$|In the 6th and 7th centuries AD, Slavic people invaded {{northern}} Greece and {{competed with}} the Greek ethnic population of Macedonia, although over time adopting the Christian Orthodox religion and Cyrillic script from Greek Macedonians. and Slavic languages have been spoken {{in the area}} alongside Greek in the region ever since. In parts of northern Greece, in the regions of Macedonia (Μακεδονία) and Thrace (Θράκη), Slavic languages continue to be spoken by people {{with a wide range}} of self-identifications. The actual linguistic classification of these dialects is unclear, although most linguists will classify them as either Bulgarian or Macedonian Slavic taking into account numerous factors, including the resemblance and mutual intelligibility of each dialect to the standard languages (abstand), and the self-identification of the speakers themselves. As however the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a Greek national identity, linguists will make their decisions based on abstand alone. The Slavic-speaking minority of northern Greece can be divided in two main groups: Orthodox Christians and Muslims, primarily the Pomaks of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. The latter has no reported connection to ethnic Macedonians.|$|E

She later explained choosing which producers to work with, saying [...] "All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a reputation for being visionaries and knowing them well, I felt 'Okay, now it's time to put together a project that not only takes us to another place, another dimension, but highlights these sights.'

Some of these attackers have a Reverse Bear Trap and some have a Venus flytrap. Others are equipped with new, unique traps, and some have no traps at all. While not an attacker, a masked figure called [...] "Pighead" [...] is the antagonist. Pighead pursues Tapp around the asylum and watches over Tapp's game as per Jigsaw's instructions. At {{the end of the}} game, Pighead becomes the only boss battle.|$|E

5000|$|This {{documentary}} series was presented by Malcolm Muggeridge and concerned Christian religious faith. The series discussed {{the lives of}} Augustine of Hippo, Blaise Pascal, William Blake, Søren Kierkegaard, Leo Tolstoy and Dietrich Bonhoeffer.

In the episode, filmmaker Declan Desmond (Eric Idle) returns to Springfield to film the continuation of his documentary series Growing Up Springfield, which chronicles the lives of several Springfield residents. He visits the town with a film crew every eight years {{to see how the}} lives <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> changed, a plot which parodies Up Series in Britain.

2500|$|Michael Neumann, a {{philosophy}} professor at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario {{expressed support for}} the boycott. Neumann stated that [...] "If people believe these are extreme circumstances and it will do some good, then I think it's reasonable and perhaps justified." [...] He argued that a boycott is not anti-semitic, stating that [...] "It targets Israeli, not Jewish, professors." [...] He further stated that [...] "People may always have bad motives underlying good motives. And it's not absolutely impossible that some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> anti-Semitic feelings deep down, but do I think that plays a large part? No, I certainly do not." ...|$|E
5|$|The favored {{sources of}} {{recruitment}} for the cavalry of the auxilia were Gauls, Germans, Iberians and Thracians. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>had</b> long-established skills {{and experience of}} fighting from horseback - {{in contrast to the}} Romans themselves. The alae were better paid and mounted than the more numerous horsemen of the cohortes equitatae (see below).|$|R

2500|$|In December 2005, John Pace, {{human rights}} {{chief for the}} United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), criticized the U.S. military's {{practice}} of holding Iraqi prisoners in Iraqi facilities such as Abu Ghraib. Pace stated that this practice was not mandated by UN Resolution 1546, according to which the U.S. government has claimed a legal mandate permitting its ongoing occupation of Iraq. Pace said, [...] "All except those held by the Ministry of Justice are, technically speaking, held against the law because the Ministry of Justice is the only authority that is empowered by law to detain, to hold anybody in prison. Essentially none <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> any real recourse to protection and therefore we speak ... of a total breakdown in {{the protection of the}} individual in this country." ...|$|E

50|$|These above several {{references}} attest {{that the}} Bahlikas were originally located beyond the seven mouths of river Indus {{in the country}} of Bactria and the land was watered by the river Oxus.

You were telling me yourself that many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> very large flocks and herds.

Some of them sleep during the greater part of the sitting; others carry small portable dinners wrapped in pocket-handkerchiefs or sticking out of their worn-out pockets, and munch and listen with equal relish; but no one among them was ever known to have the slightest personal interest in any case that was ever brought forward. Whatever they do, there they sit from the first moment to the last. When it is heavy, rainy weather, they all come in, wet through; and at such times the vapours of the court are like those of a fungus-pit.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know not," [...] {{the knight}} said, gloomily.

Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been out to Blackheath; some have stayed there with the mob, while others have brought back news of their doings. Among the rabble on Blackheath are many hedge priests; notably, I hear, one John Ball, a pestilent knave, who preaches treason to them, and tells them that as all men are equal, so all the goods of those of the better class should be divided among those having nothing, a doctrine which pleases the rascals mightily." ...|$|E
