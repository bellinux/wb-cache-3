5|$|In 1042 Grand Prince Yaroslav forced Duke Casimir of Poland {{to settle}} for a {{peaceful}} deal. Casimir recognised Ruthenian control of Red Ruthenia and returned 800 Ruthenian prisoners who had been in Polish custody since being captured two decades before by Boleslaw. Peace was secured by two marriages. Casimir was married to Yaroslav's sister, while Casimir gave his <b>own</b> <b>sister</b> Gertruda to Yaroslav's son, Izyaslav.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} the first to mention the {{character}} of Tina, Elaine's actress roommate, although she does not appear in this episode. It is also the first episode to feature Kramer making a sliding entrance into Jerry's apartment, which became a trademark in all the later episodes. Carolyn the waitress, played by Anita Wise, and her husband Larry, are named after Seinfeld's <b>own</b> <b>sister</b> and brother-in-law.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone along with Dan Sterling. The episode served as both a parody of genetic {{engineering}} and a statement against its potential evils. The scenes of Stan getting beat up by his sister were inspired by Parker's real-life childhood experiences with his <b>own</b> <b>sister,</b> who is also named Shelley.|$|E

5|$|Gotoh then arrives {{to inform}} Marth that Gharnef has kidnapped several female clerics, {{including}} Princess Nyna and his <b>own</b> <b>sister</b> Elice, {{to serve as}} sacrifices for the revival of Medeus. Marth leads his army to an ancient temple where Gharnef holds the ceremony. After killing Gharnef, retrieving Falchion, and rescuing the clerics, Marth confronts Medeus, who has taken {{the form of an}} enormous dark dragon. Using the Falchion and Shield of Seals, Marth slays Medeus. With peace restored to the land, Marth and Caeda, now married, become the rulers of all Archanea.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus had {{relied on}} the support of some major figures of the court in his bid for power. However, he quickly lost most of them. First, Basiliscus alienated his <b>own</b> <b>sister</b> Verina's support, {{executing}} the Magister Officiorum Patricius. Patricius was the lover of Verina, and the empress had planned to raise him to the imperial rank and to marry him: the very revolt against Zeno was organised to make Patricius emperor. Basiliscus, however, had out-witted his sister, and, after the flight of Zeno, had the ministers and the Senate choose him, and not Patricius, as Emperor. Basiliscus ordered the death of Patricius, as the officer was a natural candidate to overthrow the new Emperor; as a consequence, Verina later intrigued against Basiliscus, because of her lover's execution.|$|E
5|$|Meyer is a driven, arrogant surgeon, {{with high}} {{expectations}} of his colleagues. His major storylines see him operate on his <b>own</b> <b>sister,</b> {{fear that he}} may have Motor Neurone Disease, lose his spleen after being shot in a road rage incident, and ultimately depart from Holby for Michigan when the hospital Board make impositions on his autonomy. Irving made the decision to leave the series as he struggled to set the character aside outside of work, which had a negative impact on his personal life. He ruled out the possibility of returning to Holby City in future, preferring his memory of Meyer to remain untarnished.|$|E

5|$|Meyer's major storylines include {{operating}} on his <b>own</b> <b>sister</b> when she falls ill, despite a long-term enmity with his brother-in-law, Greg. He seeks {{help from his}} friend, neurologist Professor Charles Merrick (Simon Williams), when he fears he may have Motor Neurone Disease, but Merrick deduces he has an easily treatable thyroid problem instead. Merrick's daughter Victoria (Lisa Faulkner) works on Meyer's firm for a period as a Senior house officer (SHO). When she is murdered by the irate father {{of one of her}} patients, Meyer becomes involved when he is trapped in a lift with her killer, James Campbell. Campbell overdoses on pills and dies in the lift before Meyer can revive him to face justice.|$|E
5|$|Consumed with remorse, {{the king}} sought {{to rectify the}} {{situation}} by arranging a marriage between his brother's orphaned son and Andriamanelo's <b>own</b> <b>sister</b> (the orphan's aunt), Rafotsindrindramanjaka. He declared that the child from this union would, if female, be wed to his own son Ralambo; if male, he would become Ralambo's successor. A girl was born, and she was promised to Ralambo as his future wife with the stipulation that the child born of their union would rule after Ralambo. In this way Andriamanelo established a tradition of succession that indirectly respected the queens' decree by ensuring that a child of his brother's line (and his own) would rule after him. Because of this decree, Ralambo's first son by his second wife was passed over {{in the line of}} succession in favor of Andrianjaka, Ralambo's son by Rafotsindrindramanjaka. Andriamanelo was also reportedly the first to formally establish the andriana as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society. From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a spoiled, materialistic princess, the writers eventually re-wrote Jasmine into a stronger and more prominent heroine following the elimination of Aladdin's mother from the script, while borrowing story elements from the romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953). Several months after securing the role, Larkin was nearly fired from the project because Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg felt that her voice was not suitable for a princess, but Clements and Musker managed to convince him otherwise. Discovered by casting director Albert Tavares, Salonga was cast as Jasmine's singing voice based on her performance in the musical Miss Saigon; this unprecedented casting decision made Jasmine the first Disney character to have her speaking and singing voices provided by two different actors. Animated by Mark Henn, Jasmine's design is an eclectic combination of unique sources, including an anonymous theme park guest, Henn's <b>own</b> <b>sister,</b> and actress Jennifer Connelly, while elements of the Taj Mahal were incorporated into the character's hair, clothing and physique.|$|E

One {{of the things she}} liked to do was disappear into the streets of Paris in the throngs of revelers during the Carnival, wearing her modeling fashions. Elbe was sometimes introduced by Gottlieb as her <b>own</b> <b>sister</b> when she was dressed in female attire. Only her closest friends knew once she had transitioned.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} {{minister of}} the time, Thomas Parker, was also against the idea of women writing and {{sent a letter to}} his <b>own</b> <b>sister</b> saying that publishing a book was outside of the realm of what women were supposed to do. No doubt he was opposed to the writing of Bradstreet as well. These negative views were likely augmented by the fact that Puritan ideologies stated that women were vastly inferior to men.|$|E

He gained great prestige in recovering the looted stock from the Ethiopians {{and he used}} it along with his charisma and powers of oratory to improve his undisputed authority among the Ogaden. To harness Ogaden enthusiasm into final commitment, Hassan married {{the daughter of a}} prominent Ogaden chieftain and in return gave his <b>own</b> <b>sister,</b> Toohyar Sheikh Adbile, to Abdi Mohammed Waale, a notable Mohammed Subeer elder.|$|E
25|$|In 1727, Mosley {{completed}} her apprenticeship, became a member, or mistress, {{in her own}} right of the Clockmakers' Company, and set up her own business in London. That same year, she took on her <b>own</b> <b>sister,</b> Catherine, as an apprentice and one month later took a second apprentice, Mary Bate, the daughter of a clergyman from Kent. She was paid £50 for each girl. At least two other of Mosley's sisters were also milliners - Elizabeth, who was apprenticed to a milliner in York; and Dorothy, who eventually took over Mosley's business.|$|E
25|$|After his release, Abu Firas was {{restored}} to {{his position and}} was named governor of Homs, but the situation was rapidly changing: {{less than a year}} after his release, Sayf al-Dawla died, and the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo began to crumble. Abu Firas quickly quarrelled with Sayf al-Dawla's 15-year-old heir, Abu'l-Ma'ali, the son of Abu Firas' <b>own</b> <b>sister,</b> Sakhinah. Overestimating the support he enjoyed among the Arab tribes, Abu Firas revolted against his nephew, but was defeated and killed on 4 April 968 by Abu'l-Ma'ali's general Karghawayh. At the news of his death, Sakhinah was reportedly so overcome with grief, that she plucked out one of her own eyes.|$|E

It soon turned out Bree {{had no intention of}} donating and blackmailed Boyd for thousands of dollars in exchange for the operation. Nonetheless, Bree bailed and Brooke paid her off to leave Ferndale. Bree returned claiming she had suffered another psychotic episode, though it was soon clear she had in fact murdered Travis Corfield (John Tui) and had returned to steal his money. Bree eventually confessed this to Brooke and tried to escape, only for her <b>own</b> <b>sister</b> to hand her into the police.|$|E
25|$|Rostislav and {{his father}} went to Masovia where his father decided that the {{expedient}} course of action was to seek reconciliation with Daniil Romanovich who had been controlling his domains by that time and holding Mikhail Vsevolodovich’s wife (and his <b>own</b> <b>sister)</b> captive. Mikhail Vsevolodovich sent envoys to his brother-in-law admitting that he had sinned against him on many occasions by waging war and by reneging on his promises. He pledged never again to antagonize Daniil Romanovich and forswore making any future attempts on Halych. Daniil Romanovich invited him to Volhynia, returned his wife, and relinquished control of Kiev and he gave Lutsk to Rostislav, evidently, in compensation for taking away Halych.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that, indeed, the Younger Lady is Nefertiti, as incest was not uncommon. This would mean that Akhenaten did marry his <b>own</b> <b>sister</b> and that he and Nefertiti are the parents of Tutankhamun. Furthermore, Nefertiti, who may have survived her husband, may be identical with Smenkhare and may have adopted this name if she took over the reign after Akhenaten's death (and having her daughter move into her official roles of chief priestess and 'wife'). All this is not proven, but should be mentioned as a further plausible scenario. One difficulty posed by this identification is the mummy's age at death, because Nefertiti gave birth to Meritaten no later than year 1 of Akhenaten's reign and {{there is evidence that}} she was still alive during year 16.|$|E
