60|$|These are {{sinister}} suggestions, {{but there}} is really no end to what might now be done to us by any country which deliberately set its own interests and safety above all considerations of international right, especially if such country were moved to the soul by longing for revenge, and believed success certain. After this world-tragedy let us hope nations may have a little sense, less of that ghastly provincialism whence this war sprang; that no nation may teach in its schools that it is God's own people, entitled to hack through, without consideration of others; that professors may be no longer blind to all sense of proportion; Emperors things of the past; <b>diplomacy</b> <b>open</b> and responsible; a real Court of Nations at work; Military Chiefs unable to stampede a situation; journalists obliged to sign their names and held accountable for inflammatory writings. Let us hope, and let us by every means endeavour to bring about this better state of the world. But there is many a slip between cup and lip; there is also such a thing as hatred. And to rely blindly on a peace which, at the best, must {{take a long time to}} prove its reality, is to put our heads again under our wings. Once bit, twice shy.

This dissertation examines US efforts to promote social and economic reconstruction in Siberia between 1917 and 1922. After the collapse of the Provisional Government, Siberia became a focal point in the Great Powers' struggle to redivide the existing spheres of influence. This study views the American assistance policy as part of this broader imperial rivalry and necessarily implies a wider perspective on the debate over the American involvement in revolutionary Russia. It demonstrates that this policy simultaneously represented the primary response of American statesmen to events in revolutionary Russia and an important new dimension in their efforts to promote an Open Door political economy. Since American policy-makers considered Bolshevism to be epiphenomenal, the byproduct of widespread instability, the counter-revolutionary tendencies inherent in Wilson's policy toward Siberia were subordinate to the progressive role American <b>Open</b> Door <b>diplomacy</b> played in its struggle against the efforts of the European Powers and Japan to establish spheres of influence in the Russian Empire. Therefore, the American plan for Siberia should be viewed as a distinctly Wilsonian experiment in foreign assistance policy. The Wilson Administration's assistance policy focused on two complementary initiatives: the restoration of operations on the Trans-Siberian Railway and the provision of commercial assistance to the Siberian population via the region's prominent peasant cooperatives. These forms of assistance were aimed at promoting the recovery of Russian civil society in order to help Russia develop its own form of "self-government. " American statesmen believed Siberia would rapidly develop a post-Tsarist civil society because of its rich natural resources and its relatively egalitarian social structure. As this social and economic transformation proceeded, Siberia would provide an unparalleled outlet for American investment and thereby help to solidify an Open Door system. Between 1919 and 1922, the US sponsored the establishment of the inter-Allied Railway Committee for supervision of the Trans-Siberian Railway, an institutional innovation which foreshadowed post-WW II developmental agencies. Finally, this study draws important parallels between the reconstruction efforts in Siberia and the developmental policy the US had been promoting in China since 1900...|$|R

Prosperity {{of the country is}} dependent on ability to enforce sales for its products on the far-away markets especially as the Czech economy is relatively high <b>opened.</b> The economic <b>diplomacy</b> {{plays a key role in}} this process. On the other hand, the Indian Republic is one of the countries in the world which will affect economic and political development in the 21 st century. On the present, Indian market is also regarded one of the most attractive in the world. On a basis of macroeconomic indicators, notions of Czech entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial organizations and representation of the Czech state administration India has been put into the list of prior exporting countries and key trading partners of the Czech Republic. The aims of the thesis are as follows: to characterize the system of the Czech economic diplomacy, to introduce activities of the Czech economic diplomacy in India and to evaluate an observance of the Czech economic interest in India. There are used methods of description, analysis and abstraction in the paper. The thesis is divided into three main parts to be well arranged. Presentation of the Czech economic diplomacy as such and the introduction of its activities in the territory of India are the outputs of this thesis. On grounds of above mentioned is afterwards possible to evaluate the activity of Czech economic diplomacy in India as positive, in the sense the Czech economic interests in India are largely fulfilled. The activity of the Czech economic diplomacy is considered to be effective...|$|R

This hopeful change experienced its halcyon days around 1925 - 1928, when Europe as well as the Pacific encountered a true détente. This thesis deals with these changes in international security matters, incited by World War I and the subsequent creation of the League of Nations, and their consequences for Dutch foreign policy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{transparency}} projects retain a political hue from the social-technological context {{from which they}} are created. Thus, radical transparency is considered {{as an opportunity to}} evolve both journalistic and democratic practices. Transparency in practice reveals diverse expectations of how journalists reporting should be used, and these expectations in turn, seem dependent on specific worldviews. This paper presents a comparative analysis {{of the effects of the}} current exemplar of radical journalism, WikiLeaks. It compares Wikileaks to its historical equivalents, including Hansard in the 18 th century, and the reporting of <b>open</b> <b>diplomacy</b> in the early 20 th century. This analysis shows how journalism evolves along with radical transparency projects, and how the current context of networked radical transparency can, and will, be made into news with specific political effects. In conclusion, this paper argues that practitioners should be aware of the political hues that new transparency mechanisms afford. Being cognizant of context and design choices can increase the degree to which new initiatives can have a deep systemic impact—as well as acknowledge the qualities and repercussions of that impact...|$|E
