40|$|To {{understand}} the jumpingmechanisms and strategies of adult caddis flies, leg morphology and movements were analysed in three species with mean masses of 3. 9 to 38 mg. Two distinct jumping strategies were found. First (67 % of 90 jumps), take-off was propelled solely {{by the middle}} and hind legs while the wings remained closed. Second (33 % of jumps), the same leg movements were combined with wing movements <b>before</b> <b>take-off.</b> The hind legs were 70 % and the middle legs were 50 % longer than the front legs and represented 105 % and 88 %, respectively, of body length. Both hind and middle trochantera were depressed together, approximately 15 ms <b>before</b> <b>take-off.</b> The front legs apparently did not contribute to thrust in either strategy and {{were the first to}} be lifted from the ground. The hind legswere the next to lose contact, so that the middle legs alone provided the final thrust <b>before</b> <b>take-off.</b> Jumping performance did not differ significantly in the two jumping strategies or between species, in acceleration times (range of means for the three species 14. 5 – 15. 4 ms), take-off velocities (range 0. 7 – 1 m s− 1) and trajectory angles. A significant difference in jumps propelled only by the legswas the lowerangle (9. 3 ± 1. 9 deg) of the body relative to the horizontal at take-off compared with jumps involvingwingmovements (35. 3 ± 2. 5 deg). Calculations from the kinematics indicated that jumps were produced by direct muscle contractions and did not require power amplification or energy storage...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to flight}} density in the European airspace, {{numerous}} conflicts between aircraft arise.

50|$|If air-cooling proves {{sufficient}} {{for much of}} the running time (such as for an aero-engine in flight, or a motorcycle in motion), then oil cooling is an ideal way to cope with those times when extra cooling is needed (such as an aero-engine taxying <b>before</b> <b>take-off,</b> or a motorcycle in a city traffic jam). But if the engine is a racing engine that is always producing huge amounts of heat, water or liquid cooling may be preferable.|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} jump {{performances of}} {{three groups of}} subjects (N = 12) were analyzed by cinematographic technique in order to investigate the relationship between maximal angular velocities of segments and vertical jump, and the sequence of maximal angular velocities during vertical jump. Vertical jump scores were determined by measuring the dispacement of center of gravity of each subject, and maximal angular velocities of segments were determined by computer program. Significant correlations were found between maximal angular velocities of upper arm, shank, thigh, foot and vertical jump (p<;O. 5). No significant correlation was found between maximal angular velocity of trunk and vertical jump. The recommended sequence of maximal angular velocities of segments for the best vertical jump was as follows: trunk (0. 15 sec. <b>before</b> <b>take-off),</b> upper arm (0. 12 sec. <b>before</b> <b>take-off),</b> shank, thigh and foot (at take-off). Significant time {{differences were found in}} reaching maximal arm and trunk angular velocities between GI and GIII (p<;. 01), and GII and VIII (p<. 01).

5|$|Pellerin was {{originally}} scheduled {{to fly in}} this mission, {{as he had done}} on the 17 June flight. Pellerin was unavailable for the flight on 24 June and Wolff was selected as the replacement aircrew member. Due to the short notice of his assignment to the mission, Wolff did not participate in the pre-flight briefing and boarded the aircraft after the engines were started. Thus, Wolff was not aware of the planned mission profile and did not have an opportunity to raise any objections <b>before</b> <b>take-off.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the rear}} doors were {{eventually}} {{recovered from the}} sea, investigation determined {{that some of the}} locks had not engaged properly. Maintenance records showed that locks had been cannibalized for spares, then subsequently improperly refitted so that not all the door locks were engaging correctly. Furthermore, the flight crew confirmed that they had encountered difficulty closing the doors <b>before</b> <b>take-off.</b> As the air pressure differential increased with altitude, the few locks that were working correctly were unable to bear the load, and the door failed.|$|R
5000|$|After noticing {{what the}} pilot later {{described}} as a [...] "catastrophic failure of the engine" [...] well <b>before</b> <b>take-off</b> speed, the flight crew aborted the take-off by using the aircraft's brakes and ordered an evacuation of the aircraft. All passengers and crew escaped, with some suffering minor injuries from the evacuation. The aircraft {{is thought to have}} reached a speed of approximately 90 mph when the decision to abort was made; far below the takeoff decision speed of the aircraft, which is approximately 180 mph.|$|R
5000|$|After the crash, Continental Airlines reiterated its {{procedures}} for handling deicing {{and developed a}} computerized assignment program that would keep pilots with less than 100 hours flying time in type from being assigned to the same flight. The cockpit voice recorder from this crash was discussed in the cockpit of another flight that crashed the following year - Delta Air Lines Flight 1141. The fact that [...] "almost 3 minutes of nonpertinent social conversation" [...] had occurred <b>before</b> <b>take-off</b> was mentioned in the official NTSB report.|$|R
40|$|Refuelling by {{migratory birds}} <b>before</b> <b>take-off</b> on long flights is {{generally}} considered a two-phase process, with protein accumulation preceding rapid fat deposition. The first phase expresses the demands for a large digestive system for nutrient storage after shrinkage during previous flights, the second phase the demands for fat stores to fuel the subsequent flight. At the last staging site in northward migration, this process may include expression of selection pressures both en route to and after arrival at the breeding grounds, which remains unascertained. Here we investigated changes in body composition during refuelling of High Arctic breeding red knots (Calidris canutus piersmai) in the northern Yellow Sea, before their flight to the tundra. These red knots followed a three-phase fuel deposition pattern, with protein being stored {{in the first and}} last phases, and fat being deposited mainly in the second phase. Thus, they did not shrink nutritional organs <b>before</b> <b>take-off,</b> and even showed hypertrophy of the nutritional organs. These suggest the build up of strategic protein stores before departure to cope with a protein shortage upon arrival on the breeding grounds. Further comparative studies are warranted to examine {{the degree to which the}} deposition of stores by migrant birds generally reflects a balance between concurren...|$|R
