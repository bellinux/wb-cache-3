2500|$|Eye {{patching}} {{is used in}} the <b>orthoptic</b> {{management of}} children at risk of lazy eye (amblyopia), especially strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia. [...] These conditions can cause visual suppression of areas of the dissimilar images by the brain such as to avoid diplopia, resulting in a loss of visual acuity in the suppressed eye and in extreme cases in blindness in an otherwise functional eye. Patching the good eye forces the amblyopic eye to function, thereby causing vision in that eye to be retained. It is important to perform “near activities” (such as reading or handiwork) when patched, thereby exercising active, attentive vision.|$|E

They may assist ophthalmologists in surgery, teach <b>orthoptic</b> students, students of other allied health professions, medical students, and ophthalmology residents and fellows, act as vision researchers, perform vision screening, perform low vision assessments and act as clinical administrators.|$|E

50|$|In geometry, the {{director}} circle of an ellipse or hyperbola (also called the <b>orthoptic</b> circle or Fermat-Apollonius circle) is a circle consisting of all points where two perpendicular tangent {{lines to the}} ellipse cross each other.|$|E

50|$|The <b>orthoptic</b> {{property}} of a parabola is that If two tangents to the parabola are perpendicular to each other, then they intersect on the directrix. Conversely, two tangents which intersect on the directrix are perpendicular. This implies that, seen from any point on its directrix, any parabola subtends a right angle.|$|E
