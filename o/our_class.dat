500|$|Creating the Kim Possible {{universe}} and environment {{was very much}} a collaborative process between Schooley and McCorkle, Disney Channel, the character designers and cast, who were also encouraged to contribute their own ideas. Although Schooley and McCorkle participated in designing Kim, the majority of that particular task was the combined efforts of Loter, inaugural season director Chris Bailey, art director Alan Bodner and character designer Stephen Silver, each of whom had worked together on previous animated projects. Due to their extensive animation experience, Schooley and McCorkle were aware that [...] "Kim had to be an appealing character", while Ron would be more-so [...] "goofy-appealing". Evolving dramatically over the course of three months, Kim, who had originally been designed to resemble a [...] "standard" [...] athletic-looking blonde heroine, underwent several changes. At one point, the character's appearance was based on that of video game character Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider franchise until Disney Channel abandoned this concept in favor of one more akin to that of a 14 year-old girl as opposed to a bombshell. Admitting that Kim would have been their dream girl in high school, the creators joked, [...] "She would have been way out of <b>our</b> <b>class</b> though." [...] A super suit designed for the character was introduced in earily Season 4 but quickly abandoned once the writers realized that the costume would detract from the character's established [...] "she can do anything" [...] reputation. However, her original mission outfit consisting of a crop top and cargo pants is permanently replaced by a T-shirt and pants. Meanwhile, the outfits of Team Impossible were influenced by the X-men's [...] "classic" [...] blue and gold uniforms.|$|E
500|$|Aware of {{what does}} {{and does not}} work in {{television}} animation, Schooley and McCorkle knew that Kim needed to be a physically attractive character. Kim's appearance evolved dramatically {{over the course of}} three months. The character was originally designed to look like [...] "a pretty standard-looking athletic blonde", which was gradually changed in favor of a more distinctive appearance. At one point, Kim's design was based on that of video game character Lara Croft from Tomb Raider. However, the Disney Channel eventually determined that Lara [...] "is ... not a very real character." [...] Finally, the creators decided to give Kim a more realistic appearance akin to that of a 14-year-old girl as opposed to a bombshell, concluding, [...] "She has a nice, very appealing design, but we just wanted to keep it out of that realm of video game heroine." [...] The creators admitted that Kim would have been their [...] "dream girl" [...] in high school, joking, [...] "She would have been way out of <b>our</b> <b>class</b> though." [...] Director Chris Baily wanted Kim to be designed with [...] "graphic sensibilities" [...] {{similar to those of the}} show's backgrounds, creating a 3D character [...] "whose feet can be planted on the ground and communicate a sense of space." [...] For example, when the character is dressed in all-black, Kim was drawn without a white outline so that she virtually disappears when she moves in front of a black background, yet her [...] "simple design" [...] and flesh allows audiences to [...] "fill in where her body is" [...] naturally. The show's female characters are the only characters drawn with lips, only the upper of which is visible. Describing Kim as [...] "a mostly graphic heroine", Animation: A World History: Volume III: Contemporary Times author Giannalberto Bendazzi agreed that the character's [...] "limited animation" [...] was intentional. In the fourth season, the character's signature crop top and cargo pants are replaced by a T-shirt and pants because the former outfit was damaged during a fight with Shego. Some viewers noted that Kim's face appeared to be [...] "rounder" [...] than it had been drawn in previous seasons. Kim was animated by Rough Draft Korea.|$|E

40|$|By {{analyzing}} how the Borel regulator classes vanish {{on various}} groups related to GL(n,Z), we define three series of secondary characteristic classes for subgroups of automorphism groups of free groups.

The second case is the mapping <b>class</b> groups and <b>our</b> <b>classes</b> also {{turn out to be}} his higher torsions which are non-zero multiples of the Mumford-Morita-Miller classes of even indices. Our construction gives new group cocycles for these still mysterious classes. The third case is the outer automorphism groups of free groups of specific ranks. Here we give a conjectural geometric meaning to a series of unstable homology classes called the Morita classes. We expect that certain unstable secondary classes would detect them.
