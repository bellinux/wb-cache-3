40|$|AbstractIn vertebrates, pre-placodal {{ectoderm}} and {{neural crest}} development requires morphogen gradients and several transcriptional factors, while {{the involvement of}} histone modification remains unclear. Here, we report that histone-modifying factors play crucial roles {{in the development of}} pre-placodal ectoderm and neural crest in Xenopus. During the early neurula stage, PRDM 12 was expressed in the lateral pre-placodal ectoderm and repressed the expression of neural crest specifier genes via methylation of histone H 3 K 9. ChIP-qPCR analyses indicated that PRDM 12 promoted the occupancy of the trimethylated histone H 3 K 9 (H 3 K 9 me 3) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foxd</b> 3, Slug, and Sox 8 promoters. Injection of the PRDM 12 MO inhibited the expression of presumptive trigeminal placode markers and decreased the occupancy of H 3 K 9 me 3 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foxd</b> 3 promoter. Histone demethylase Kdm 4 a also inhibited the expression of presumptive trigeminal placode markers in a similar manner to PRDM 12 MO and could compensate for the effects of PRDM 12. ChIP-qPCR analyses revealed that promotion of the occupancy of H 3 K 9 me 3 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foxd</b> 3, Slug, and Sox 8 promoters was inhibited by Kdm 4 a overexpression. Taken together, these data indicate that histone modification was essential for pre-placodal ectoderm and neural crest development...|$|R
