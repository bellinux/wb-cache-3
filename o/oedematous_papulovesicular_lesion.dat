40|$|We {{report a}} 38 -year-old woman with lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) who had nodular and <b>papulovesicular</b> <b>lesions</b> develop on the genital area and oral commissure. Mucosal {{involvement}} in LyP {{is a rare}} event, and its clinical relevance is still unknown. Aggressive therapies are not recommended in patients with LyP with either cutaneous or mucosal involvement...|$|R
40|$|Diffuse Cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM) occurs due to {{abnormal}} {{accumulation of}} mast {{cells in the}} skin. We report an 8 -month-old infant presented <b>papulovesicular</b> <b>lesions,</b> predominantly on the trunk. Skin biopsy revealed subepidermal bulla, interspersed with mast cells, eosinophils and neutrophils. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy of perilesional skin revealed nonspecific deposition of IgM in granular pattern along the dermoepidermal junction...|$|R
50|$|Autoimmune {{progesterone}} dermatitis {{may appear}} as urticarial papules, deep gyrate <b>lesions,</b> <b>papulovesicular</b> <b>lesions,</b> an eczematous eruption, or as targetoid lesions. Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis initially manifests with eye symptoms, e.g. burning, and progresses into rashes. Its relapsing-remitting pattern in women {{correspond to the}} progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle, which spike twice a month. It is an extremely rare disease, only perhaps 50 cases have ever been reported.|$|R
40|$|Background: Chickenpox {{is a very}} {{contagious}} {{viral disease}} that caused by varicella-zoster virus, which appears {{in the first week}} of life secondary to transplacental transmission of infection from the affected mother. When mother catches the disease five days before and up to two days after the delivery, the chance of varicella in neonate in first week of life is 17 %. A generalized <b>papulovesicular</b> <b>lesion</b> is the most common clinical feature. Respiratory involvement may lead to giant cell pneumonia and respiratory failure. The mortality rate is up to 30 % in the case of no treatment, often due to pneumonia. Treatment includes hospitalization, isolation and administration of intravenous acyclovir. The aim of this case report is to introduce the exogenous surfactant replacement therapy after intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure in neonatal chickenpox pneumonia and respiratory distress. Case Presentation: A seven-day-old neonate boy was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Amirkola Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Babol, north of Iran, with generalized <b>papulovesicular</b> <b>lesions</b> and respiratory distress. His mother has had a history of Varicella 4 days before delivery. He was isolated and given supportive care, intravenous acyclovir and antibiotics. On the second day, he was intubated and connected to mechanical ventilator due to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Because of sever pulmonary involvement evidenced by Chest X-Ray and high ventilators set-up requirement, intratracheal surfactant was administered in two doses separated by 12 hours. He was discharged after 14 days without any complication with good general condition. Conclusion: Exogenous surfactant replacement therapy can be useful as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of respiratory failure due to neonatal chickenpox...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} unusual case of Rickettsia conorii {{infection}} that {{was associated with}} cutaneous <b>papulovesicular</b> <b>lesions</b> on a patient who had returned from the bushveld of South Africa. The lesions were diffusely scattered across the trunk, extremities, and both palms. Several recent reports have documented similar papulovesicular or pustulovesicular rashes that occurred on travelers returning from southern Africa. These rashes resemble the lesions of rickettsialpox. Evidence suggests that these atypical exanthems {{may be due to}} variant strains ofR. eonorii or to an unusual host response to infection with this organism; thus, infection with R. eonorii {{should be included in the}} list of diseases that cause poxlike lesions. The increase in international travel and the resultant in-crease in imported endemic infectious diseases make it imper-ative that clinicians be aware of the spectrum of presenta-tions of these infections. One such group of imported infections is the rickettsioses. Tick typhus (also referred to as boutonneuse fever, Mediterranean spotted fever, South Afri-can tickbite fever, Kenya tick typhus, or Indian tick typhus...|$|R
40|$|Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) {{is a rare}} immunobullous {{disorder}} of the skin {{that is associated with}} gluten hypersensitivity. Subepidermal IgA-type antibody deposition against tissue transglutaminase leads to dense neutrophilic microabscess and eventually into vesicles in dermal papillae, which may occasionally merge into bullae. Being a subepidermal vesiculobullous disorder, DH is frequently associated with postinflammatory pigmentary changes, particularly hypopigmentation. However, the association of DH with true vitiligo is extremely rare. Here, we report a 21 -year-old male with vitiligo and comorbid DH, and review the literature. This new case had severely pruritic, papular and <b>papulovesicular</b> <b>lesions</b> that were localized symmetrically and partly confined to the pre-existing vitiliginous areas. The skin biopsy specimen taken from an erythematous papule on the elbow showed characteristic findings of DH and vitiligo. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy of the perilesional skin revealed granular IgA deposition of dermal papillae. There are only 10 reports in the literature of DH and vitiligo comorbidity...|$|R
40|$|Relapsing {{varicella}} {{may occur}} {{in children with}} HIV infection and more rarely in younger adults. Our aim was to report unusual clinical, histologic, and virologic aspects of 4 elderly patients with malignant hemopathies who had an unusual form of recurrent varicella develop. Conventional microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization were applied to smears and skin biopsy specimens. The patients presented a few dozen, scattered, large, <b>papulovesicular</b> <b>lesions</b> with central crusting. No zoster-associated pain or dermatomal distribution of the lesions was noted. Conventional microscopy revealed vascular changes and epidermal alterations typical for alpha-herpes virus infection. The varicella zoster virus major viral envelope glycoproteins gE and gB, and the immediate-early varicella zoster virus IE 63 protein and the corresponding genome sequence for gE were detected on Tzanck smears; they were localized in endothelial cells and keratinocytes on skin biopsy specimens. The varicella zoster virus infection in endothelial cells, the vascular involvement, and the widespread distribution of the lesions suggest that the reported eruptions are vascular rather than neural in origin. These findings invalidate the diagnosis of herpes zoster but strongly support the diagnosis of recurrent varicella in an indolent and yet unreported presentation. Furthermore, these eruptions differ from relapsing varicella in {{children and young adults}} by the age of the patients, the paucity of clinical lesions, the larger diameter of the lesions and their peculiar clinical aspect, the significantly longer time interval between primary varicella and the recurrence, the prolonged healing time of the lesions, their mild disease course, and the fact that all the lesions are in the same stage of development.

40|$|Gastric {{involvement}} with the varicella-zoster virus is an uncommon clinical condition where early suspicion and diagnosis are important to prevent the consequences deriving from its high morbidity and mortality, which in immunocompromised patients oscillate between 9 % and 41 % according to the various series. Two cases of gastric {{involvement with}} the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in two patients with blood cancer are reported below. Gastric lesions are usually preceded by typical <b>papulovesicular</b> skin <b>lesions.</b> When gastric involvement is the first symptom of the disease its diagnosis and management may be delayed, which may entail severe consequences for immunocompromised patients. It is therefore that we suggest its inclusion in the algorithm for immunocompromised patients with abdominal pain and ulcer-like endoscopic lesions...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{cutaneous}} actinomycosis {{caused by}} Actinomyces israelii occurs most commonly in the cervicofacial area. It commonly presents as "lumpy jaw" with draining sinuses which discharge the characteristic "sulfur granules". A low index of suspicion {{and a low}} sensitivity in culturing the organism, due to its fastidious nature often delays the diagnosis. An atypical clinical presentation mimicking lymphangioma circumscriptum with grouped <b>papulovesicular</b> and nodular <b>lesions</b> along the lower jaw extending from skin to the inner buccal mucosa, confirmed on histology and an excellent therapeutic response to penicillin is reported...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Diaper {{dermatitis}} (Nappy Rash) is {{an acute}} {{inflammation of the}} skin in the diaper area and is the most common cutaneous disease among infants and children (Concannon et al., 2001). It is estimated that 7 % - 35 % of diaper wearing infants are affected by Diaper dermatitis during the period of wearing diapers (Barkin and Rosen, 2003). The exact prevalence is not known as many cases are selfmedicated by parents or guardians (Wolf et al., 2000). Diaper dermatitis causes severe discomfort to the infants as well as anxiety and worry for the parents. Diaper dermatitis is characterised by redness, inflammation, dryness, scaling, itching, irritability, pain, satellite <b>lesions,</b> <b>papulovesicular</b> or pustular eruptions, and in severe cases ulceration of the skin (Visscher and Hoath, 2006). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a Homoeopathic complex cream as a topical treatment for Diaper dermatitis. The complex consisted of Atropa belladonna 6 cH, Calendula officinalis D 1 and Sulphuricum acidum 6 cH. Madaji milking cream was used as a base which contained: chlorhexidene; vitamin E; and lanolin. The treatment group received the medicated Madaji milking cream whereas the control group received the unmedicated Madaji milking cream. The Diaper dermatitis was evaluated using a 4 -Point Grading Scale (Appendix D) and The Modified Lund and Browder Chart (Appendix E). Forty participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited to participate in this double blind control study by means of advertisements (Appendix A) that were placed on notice boards at the various campuses of the University of Johannesburg, nursery schools and hospitals, with relevant permission given. Participants were also recruited via word of mouth. Once participants were accepted into the study they were allocated to either Group A or Group B using matched pairs according to severity in order to ensure equal v distribution in both groups. There were 20 participants in each group. Group A was the treatment group which received the medicated Madaji milking cream. Group B was the control group which received the unmedicated Madaji cream. The study was completed over a seven day period. The ten areas most commonly affected by Diaper dermatitis were evaluated on the initial visit, day two, day four and day seven...|$|R
