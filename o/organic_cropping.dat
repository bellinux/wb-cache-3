50|$|The general trend {{noticed by}} the {{analysis}} of biodiversity present in different cropping systems (e.g., industrial agriculture and organic farming) was that a greater the diversity of crops (temporally and spacially) resulted in a greater overall biodiversity of the agroecosystem, though {{this is not always}} the case. A meta-analysis of studies comparing biodiversity noted that, when compared to <b>organic</b> <b>cropping</b> systems, conventional systems had significantly lower species richness and abundance (30% greater richness and 50% greater abundance in organic systems, on average), though 16% of studies did find a greater level of species richness in conventional systems. Another study found that cropping systems that required heavy use of chemical amendments (e.g., the widespread broadcasting of pesticides and glyphosate, a practice ubiquitously found throughout the United States and Canada) had significantly greater levels of pollination deficits, whereas organic fields of the same crop (Canola) witnessed no pollination deficits. Other cropping systems like permaculture have undergone little study to determine relative levels of biodiversity compared to other cropping systems, but because they continue to reinforce the goals of increasing overall crop biodiversity, it can be extrapolated that an even greater level of biodiversity would be observed.|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of the weed flora of dry pea (Pisum sativum L.) fields and cropping practices were investigated in southwestern Finland. Surveys were done in 2002 – 2003 in 119 conventionally cropped fields and 64 fields under <b>organic</b> <b>cropping.</b> Herbicides were applied to 92 % of conventionally cropped fields where they provided relatively good control but were costly. Weeds were controlled mechanically only in five fields under organic production. A total of 76 weed species were recorded, of which 29 exceeded the 10 % frequency level of occurrence. The average number of weed species per field was 10 under conventional cropping and 18 under <b>organic</b> <b>cropping.</b> The most frequent weed species in both cropping practices were Chenopodium album, Stellaria media and Viola arvensis. Elymus repens was the most frequent grass species. The difference in species composition under conventional and <b>organic</b> <b>cropping</b> was detected with Redundancy Analysis. Under conventional cropping, features of crop stand and weed control explained 38. 7 % and 37. 6 % of the variation respectively. Under <b>organic</b> <b>cropping</b> the age of crop stand and field location (y co-ordinate) respectively explained best the variation. Weeds could be efficiently managed with herbicides under conventional cropping, but they represented a significant problem for organic production.

40|$|Between 1980 and 2010, {{organic farming}} {{has become one}} of the fastest growing {{segments}} in agriculture in the United States. Although a national standard for organic agriculture was established by the USDA in 1997 and amended in 2005, organic farming systems are extremely heterogeneous compared to conventional farming methods. A variety of strategies that comply with the USDA guidelines of organic production practices can be applied ranging from high input systems to those with greater reliance on internal processes. This thesis examines the economics of four alternative <b>organic</b> <b>cropping</b> systems that comply with USDA guidelines. The analysis compares the profitability and land management capability of four different <b>organic</b> <b>cropping</b> systems used to produce winter squash, cabbage, potatoes and lettuce. Interactive crop budgets were developed to document both production costs and income streams for each cropping system. The analysis using data from trials between 2005 and 2009 indicate that different systems generate different economic outcomes across the crops, and sometimes the differences are substantial. The ridge-tillage system that relied on cover crops for nitrogen (System 4) yielded the highest revenues for squash production, while System 1, which relies on compost for nitrogen, occasional cover crops and uses conventional tillage, had the highest revenues for cabbage. The economic analysis used here develops a framework to outline the financial implications of adopting each of the four <b>organic</b> <b>cropping</b> systems. When the economics for a full crop rotation across the systems are examined as a whole, large differences are not detected. However, individual crops do respond differently to the different systems, but overall, the high intensity system generated the highest profits...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of MAFF/Defra project OF 0157. Genetically {{modified}} (GM) crops cannot be released into the environment and used as food, feed, medicines or industrial processing before they have passed through a rigorous and internationally recognised regulatory process designed to protect human and animal health, and the environment. The UK body that oversees standards in organic farming, the United Kingdom Register of Organic Food Standards (UKROFS), has ruled that genetically modified (GM) crops have no {{role to play in}} organic farming systems. They, therefore, have concerns about the possibility and consequences of the mixing of GM <b>crops</b> with <b>organic</b> <b>crops.</b> The two main sources of mixing are through pollen and seed. Pollen from GM crops may pollinate an <b>organic</b> <b>crop.</b> Seed from a GM crop, or plants established from them, may become mixed with <b>organic</b> <b>crops</b> or their products. Minimising genetic mixing is an important feature of the production of all high quality seed samples of plant varieties supplied to farmers. Extensive experience has been obtained over many decades in the production of high purity seed samples. Crop isolation distances, and crop rotational and management practices are laid down to achieve this. These procedures for the production of seed of high genetic purity could be used for the production of <b>organic</b> <b>crops.</b> No system for the field production of seed can guarantee absolute genetic purity of seed samples. Very rarely long distance pollination or seed transfer is possible, so any criteria for <b>organic</b> <b>crop</b> production will need to recognise this. There has always been the possibility of hybridisation and seed mixing between <b>organic</b> <b>crops</b> and non-organic <b>crops.</b> <b>Organic</b> farming systems acknowledge the possibility of spray or fertiliser drift from non-organic farming systems, and procedures are established to minimise this. In practice, detecting the presence of certain types of GM material in <b>organic</b> <b>crops,</b> especially quantification, is likely to be difficult. Some seed used by organic farmers are currently obtained from abroad. After January 2001, or a modified deadline thereafter, UK organic farmers will be required to sow seed produced organically. There is little or no organic seed produced in the UK at present, so it has to be obtained from abroad. Seed obtained from outside the UK or the European Union, may have different seed production criteria. This may make it difficult to guarantee that it is absolutely free from any GM material. Organic farmers and/or GM crop producers will need to ensure that their crops are isolated from one another by an appropriate distance or barrier to reduce pollen transfer if the crop flowers. To reduce seed mixing, shared equipment will need to be cleaned and an appropriate period of time allowed before <b>organic</b> <b>crops</b> are grown on land previously used for GM crops. Responsibility for isolation will need to be decided before appropriate measures can be implemented.

In addition to the production risks covered for conventional producers, organic farmers who sign up for coverage are compensated for production losses from damage due to insects, disease, and/or weeds. However, the incorporation of organic production into the crop insurance rating structure has been limited. Organic producers are charged an arbitrary 5 % premium surcharge over conventional crop insurance. The actuarial fairness of this premium is, at least, questionable. In addition, in the case of <b>crop</b> failure, <b>organic</b> farmers receive compensation based on the prices of conventionally produced crops. Thus, price premiums that organic producers are able to obtain in the market are not compensated for under the current insurance policy structure.
