5|$|Charles's arrival was well-prepared. He was {{accompanied}} by his Hungarian supporters and Elizabeth was unable to raise an army against him or prevent him from convoking a diet, in which he obtained an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support.</b> Mary was forced to abdicate, opening the path for Charles to be crowned on 31 December 1385. Elizabeth and Mary were compelled to attend the ceremony and swear allegiance to him.|$|E
5|$|Following his January 1860 {{resignation}} from Parliament, Ollivier spearheaded a requisition, broadly {{supported by}} influential people, to have Brittan make himself {{available for the}} resulting by-election in the Christchurch Country electorate. Brittan declined the requisition, mostly because he was opposed to the rail tunnel scheme which had <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support</b> by the population, {{and he could not}} see himself being their representative if he disagreed with this popular public opinion. Isaac Thomas Cookson, who had earlier supported the Brittan requisition, was elected.|$|E

5|$|When the Republican {{convention}} {{began in}} Philadelphia that June, no {{vice presidential candidate}} had <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support,</b> but Roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country. McKinley affirmed that the choice belonged to the convention, not to him. On June 21, McKinley was unanimously renominated and, with Hanna's reluctant acquiescence, Roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot. The Democratic convention convened the next month in Kansas City and nominated William Jennings Bryan, setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest.|$|E
5|$|One of Greer Stadium's most {{distinctive}} features was its guitar-shaped scoreboard. After First Tennessee Park was approved, the team {{announced it would}} not be relocating the original Greer scoreboard, which was technologically outdated and difficult to maintain, to the new stadium. While plans for First Tennessee Park's scoreboard were initially undisclosed, following <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support</b> for Greer's guitar from the community, the team announced plans for a larger, more modern guitar-shaped scoreboard for the new ballpark. The new guitar scoreboard, paid for entirely by the Sounds, was designed by TS Sports in conjunction with Panasonic, and was installed beyond the right-center field wall on the concourse.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was unable}} to secure the {{nomination}} at the national convention, so Breckinridge switched his support to Stephen Douglas, but the combination of Pierce and Douglas supporters did not prevent James Buchanan's nomination. After Douglas's floor manager, William Richardson, suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice president would help Buchanan secure the support of erstwhile Douglas backers in the general election, Louisiana's J. L. Lewis nominated him. Breckinridge declined in deference to Linn Boyd but received 51 votes on the first ballot, behind Mississippi's John A. Quitman with 59, but ahead of third-place Boyd, who garnered 33. On the second ballot, Breckinridge received <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support,</b> and opposition delegates changed their votes to make his nomination unanimous.|$|E

50|$|Mr O'Dowd, has {{in light}} of <b>overwhelming</b> parental <b>support</b> for the Dickson plan, backed down from abolishing the system. Over 80% of parents were in favour of {{maintaining}} the present system. Mr O'Dowd has had to bow to this support.|$|R
5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} in the down-ballot races. Democratic city commissioners Maurice S. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry were reelected as was Republican Walter I. Davidson. William M. Lennox was reelected county sheriff and Joseph A. Scanlon was reelected {{clerk of the court}} of quarter sessions (a court whose jurisdiction is now exercised by the court of common pleas). The Democrats also took four of the seven magisterial district judge positions up for election that year (a local court, the duties of which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court). The ballot contained two referendums authorizing the city to take loans for construction of medical facilities, streets, sewers, playgrounds, and other civic improvements. They passed with <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support,</b> each tallying 84% affirmative votes.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{reported}} that Dr. Ademola Aremu, the National Treasurer of the Union, {{said that the}} story of Prof. Adewole 'IFA' as we popularly called him is the story of someone who has been destined to serve humanity. His achievements as a provost of the college of medicine made him to receive <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support</b> from the university community when he indicated interest to serve on the university governing council and later on as vice chancellor. As vice chancellor, he totally turned the university around in terms of staff and student welfare, academically, University of Ibadan unarguably became the best in Nigeria {{and one of the best}} in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support.</b> However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
25|$|The Victorian Government of Sir Thomas Bent {{approved}} {{an application}} by Mr Morgan {{to build a}} tramway system in the Essendon area on 29 March 1904, with a poll of ratepayers <b>overwhelming</b> <b>supporting</b> the proposition on 29 July 1904 (2874 votes to 146). Mr Morgan transferred the concession to the NMELT, which had been formed to build the system and provide electricity to the area. Under the concession the NMELT was to construct a tramway and provide electricity within the municipalities of Essendon and Flemington for 30 years, it also mandated a service at least every 20 minutes and had provisions for the undertaking to become property of the municipalities involved earlier than the prescribed 30 years.|$|R

5|$|In July 2016 García, who was Real Sociedad's only {{representative}} in the squad, captained Spain to {{a silver medal}} at the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship, losing 2–1 in the final to hosts France. She had two opportunities to draw Spain level but found herself {{the victim of a}} waterlogged pitch, missing a penalty in the opening half before skying a near-open goal opportunity in injury-time {{as a result of the}} on-field conditions. The match was suspended for over two hours after half-time due to the weather conditions and upon the players' return to the pitch certain sections of the field were entirely waterlogged. García was ridiculed by large sections of the media for the miss but received <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support</b> from her fan-base, prompting her to take to Instagram following the tournament to thank those who stood behind her and the team. The showpiece match was her third appearance in a continental final, having previously ended as runner-up in the tournament's previous edition and as well as in the UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship in 2014. The record is one which she shares with teammates Andrea Sánchez Falcón and Naria Garrote.|$|E
5|$|In September 1991, Bosnian Serbs proclaimed a Serbian Autonomous Oblast with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the Bosnian {{referendum}} on independence was passed with <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support</b> from Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats, although Bosnian Serbs either boycotted it or were prevented from voting by Bosnian Serb authorities. A poorly organized, local Bosniak Patriotic League paramilitary group {{had been established}} {{in response to the}} Bosnian Serb proclamation. On 31 March, the Patriotic League in Bijeljina was provoked into fighting by local Serbs and the SDG. On 1–2 April, the SDG and the JNA took over Bijeljina with little resistance; murders, rapes, house searches, and pillaging followed. These actions were described as genocidal by the historian Professor Eric D. Weitz of the City College of New York. Professor Michael Sells of the University of Chicago concluded that they were carried out to erase the cultural history of the Bosniak people of Bijeljina.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April 1978 Mir Akbar Khyber, {{the chief}} ideologue of the Parcham faction, was killed; he was {{commonly}} {{believed to have}} been assassinated by the Daoud government. Khyber's assassination initiated a chain of events which led to the PDPA taking power eleven days later, on 27 April. The assassin was never caught, but Anahita Ratebzad, a Parchamite, believed that Amin had ordered the assassination. Khyber's funeral evolved into a large anti-government demonstration. Daoud, who did not understand the significance of the events, began a mass arrest of PDPA members seven days after Khyber's funeral. Amin, who organised the subsequent revolution against Daoud, {{was one of the last}} Central Committee members to be arrested by the authorities. His late arrest can be considered as proof of the regime's lack of information; Amin was the leading revolutionary party organiser. The government's lack of awareness was proven by the arrest of Taraki – Taraki's arrest was the pre-arranged signal for the revolution to commence. When Amin found out that Taraki had been arrested, he ordered the revolution to begin at 9am on 27 April. Amin, in contrast to Taraki, was not imprisoned, but instead put under house arrest. His son, Abdur Rahman, was still allowed freedom of movement. The revolution was successful, thanks to <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support</b> from the Afghan military; for instance, it was supported by Defence Minister Ghulam Haidar Rasuli, Aslam Watanjar the commander of the ground forces, and the Chief of Staff of the Afghan Air Force, Abdul Qadir.|$|E
40|$|Smallholder {{farmers in}} the {{developing}} world are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate fluctuations and weather extremes. While these farming communities have survived by mastering the ability to adapt to an increasingly uncertain climate, their indigenous knowledge and traditional coping practices has been <b>overwhelmed.</b> <b>Supporting</b> farmers with effective weather and climate information and advisory services for agricultural decision making is a key strategy for reducing risk and enhancing food security in already vulnerable areas. However, broadening the impact of climate services in vulnerable communities has been a challenge. Several initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America have used innovative approaches to overcome these challenges. By communicating and applying seasonal forecast information in these two regions through pilot-scale projects, they demonstrate good practice and provide valuable insights such as it has been evidenced in Senegal...|$|R

5|$|Initial {{parliamentary}} {{discussion of}} the design focused less on the anticipated cost of the ships than the idea that France was being {{left behind in the}} technological arms race, particularly in regard to the innovative Parsons steam turbines used by HMS Dreadnought. In response the navy sent a technical mission to inspect the Parsons factory, several shipyards, and gun factories as well as the Barr & Stroud rangefinder factory in May 1906 and concluded that the turbines offered more power in a smaller volume than triple-expansion steam engines at a significant increase in fuel consumption at low speeds. Two ships had already been ordered from the naval dockyards three months previously when the navy decided to use the turbines in July. To further complicate things, Gaston requested a study using the heavier and more powerful 45-caliber 305-millimeter Modèle 1906 gun on 3 August while not endorsing the navy's decision to use turbines. On 6 October the director of naval construction, M. Dudebout, urgently requested a decision while recommending that three ships use steam engines and the others turbines. He felt that this would minimize delays and expense as the design needed to be modified to accommodate the turbines and their four propeller shafts, no company in France knew how to build the turbines, and the latter were three times as expensive as steam engines. Gaston was inclined to accept Dudebout's recommendation, but prevaricated until December, after parliamentary debates showed <b>overwhelming</b> <b>support</b> for turbines in all six ships. Contracts for the remaining four ships were signed on 26 December, the day after the conclusion of the debate. Gaston also delayed in deciding on which boilers to use. He sent another technical mission to Britain to look at Babcock & Wilcox's design in April 1907, but did not make a decision in favor of French-built boilers until 3 June 1908, after all the ships had been laid down.|$|E
