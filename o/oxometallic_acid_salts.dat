50|$|Some <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> {{are used}} in baking. They are found in baking powders and are {{typically}} divided into low-temperature (or single-acting) and high-temperature (or double-acting) <b>acid</b> <b>salts.</b> Common low-temperature <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> react at room temperature to produce a leavening effect. They include cream of tartar, calcium phosphate, and citrates. High-temperature <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> produce a leavening effect during baking and are usually aluminium salts such as calcium aluminium phosphate. Some <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> may {{also be found in}} non-dairy coffee creamers.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>salt</b> is a {{class of}} salts formed by the partial {{neutralization}} of diprotic or polyprotic acids. Because the parent acid is only partially neutralized, one or more replaceable hydrogen atoms remain. Typical <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> have one or more alkali (alkaline) metal ions {{as well as one}} or more hydrogen atoms. Well known examples are sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), sodium bisulfate (NaHSO4), monosodium phosphate (NaH2PO4), and disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4). Often <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> are used as buffers.|$|R
40|$|Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae {{are used}} as koji fungi in the spot of the brewing. Since koji-muro (room for making koji) was {{a low level of}} airtightness, {{microbial}} contamination has long been a concern to the alcoholic beverage production.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of oxidation of 2 -hydroxy butyric <b>acid</b> <b>salt</b> (2 -HBAS) and 3 -hydroxy butyric <b>acid</b> <b>salt</b> (3 -HBAS) by ditelluratocuprate(III) (DTC) {{were studied}} spectrophotometrically between 298. 2 K and 313. 2 K in alkaline medium. The reaction rate showed rst order dependence in DTC and a fractional order in HBAS. It {{was found that}} the pseudo-rst order rate constant kobs increased with an increase in the concentration of OH − and a decrease in the concentration of TeO 2 − 4. The reaction rate changed with the position of the hydroxyl group. There was a negative salt eect. A plausible mechanism involving a pre-equilibrium of adduct formation between the complex and HBAS was proposed. The rate equations derived from the mechanism can explain all experimental observations. The activation parameters along with the rate constants of the rate-determining step were calculated.

40|$|Two commercially {{available}} organic <b>acid</b> <b>salts,</b> potassium lactate (PURASAL HiPure P) and a potassium lactate–sodium diacetate blend (PURASAL Opti. Form PD 4), were assessed as potential inhibitors of Listeria monocytogenes growth in {{modified atmosphere packaged}} (MAP) sliced ham in challenge studies. The influence of the initial inoculation level of L. monocytogenes (101 or 103 CFU g− 1) and storage temperature (4 or 8 °C) was also examined. The addition of either organic <b>acid</b> <b>salt</b> to MAP sliced ham strongly inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes during the normal shelf life of the product under ideal refrigeration conditions (4 °C) and even under abusive temperature conditions (i. e., 8 °C). During the challenge studies {{and in the absence}} of either organic <b>acid</b> <b>salt,</b> L. monocytogenes numbers increased by 1, 000 -fold after 20 days at 8 °C and 10 -fold after 42 days at 4 °C. Both organic <b>acid</b> <b>salt</b> treatments were found to be listeriostatic rather than listericidal. The addition of either organic <b>acid</b> <b>salt</b> to the MAP ham also reduced the growth of indigenous microflora, i. e., aerobic microflora and lactic acid bacteria. The influence of these compounds on the risk of listeriosis in relation to product shelf life is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{spray-drying}} process and acidic solvent system on physicochemical properties of chitosan salts were investigated. Chitosan used in spray dryings {{was obtained by}} deacetylation of chitin from lobster (Panulirus argus) origin. The chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> were prepared in a laboratory-scale spray drier, and organic acetic acid, lactic acid, and citric acid were used as solvents in the process. The physicochemical properties of chitosan salts were investigated by means of solid-state CP-MAS 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and near-infrared spectroscopy. The morphology of spray-dried chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> showed tendency toward higher sphericity when higher temperatures in a spray-drying process were applied. Analysis by XRPD indicated that all chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> studied were amorphous solids. Solid-state 13 C NMR spectra revealed {{the evidence of the}} partial conversion of chitosan acetate to chitin and also conversion to acetyl amide form which appears to be dependent on the spray-drying process. The FTIR spectra suggested that the organic acids applied in spray drying may interact with chitosan at the position of amino groups to form chitosan salts. With all three chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts,</b> the FTIR bands at 1, 597 and 1, 615  cm− 1 were diminished suggesting that –NH groups are protonated. The FTIR spectra of all chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> exhibited ammonium and carboxylate bands at 1, 630 and 1, 556  cm− 1, respectively. In conclusion, spray drying is a potential method of preparing <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> from chitosan obtained by deacetylation of chitin from lobster (P. argus) origin...|$|R

40|$|A new {{absorption}} liquid {{based on}} amino <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> {{has been studied}} for CO 2 removal in membrane gas–liquid contactors. Unlike conventional gas treating solvents like aqueous alkanolamines solutions, the new absorption liquid does not wet polyolefin microporous membranes. The wetting characteristics of aqueous alkanolamines and amino <b>acid</b> <b>salt</b> solutions for a hydrophobic membrane was studied by measuring the surface tension of the liquid and the breakthrough pressure of the liquid into the pores of the membrane. The dependence of the breakthrough pressure on surface tension follows the Laplace–Young equation. The performance of the new absorption liquid in the removal of CO 2 was studied in a single fiber membrane contactor {{over a wide range}} of partial pressures of CO 2 in the gas phase and amino <b>acid</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations in the liquid. A numerical model to describe the mass transfer accompanied by multiple chemical reactions occurring during the absorption of CO 2 in the liquid flowing through the hollow fiber was developed.
