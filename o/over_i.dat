5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all <b>over.</b> <b>I</b> dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E
5|$|The meat ant {{was first}} {{described}} in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of Hymenopterous Insects in the Collection of the British Museum part VI, under the binomial name Formica purpurea from a holotype worker ant he collected in Melbourne, Victoria. The type material is currently {{housed in the}} Natural History Museum, London. In 1862, Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr erected the genus Iridomyrmex, and reclassified the meat ant {{as a member of}} Iridomyrmex rather than the genus Formica. The ant was named Iridomyrmex purpurea in 1862; however, Mayr renamed the ant as Iridomyrmex purpureus one year after. I. purpureus was later classified as a synonym of Iridomyrmex detectus, and this taxon was designated as the type species of Iridomyrmex in 1903. In 1993, I. detectus was synonymised with I. purpureus and grouped into the I. purpureus species complex. I. detectus was described as a separate species by Smith the same year as I. purpureus from two syntype queens he collected from the Hunter River in New South Wales. Although the name I. purpureus was used by many authors, Karl Wilhelm von Dalla Torre reused I. detectus and this was adopted by several authors, replacing I. purpureus. By the 1960s, however, I. purpureus once again became preferred <b>over</b> <b>I.</b> detectus. While the two names were described in the same year and publication, the name I. purpureus is the valid name for the species in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Entomologist B.T. Lowne {{was the first person to}} revise I. purpureus and I. detectus, and he synonymised the two species.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the decomposition of noncommutative gauge potential (A) <b>over</b> cap (<b>i),</b> {{and find that}} it has inner structure, namely, (A) <b>over</b> cap (<b>i)</b> can he decomposed in two parts, (b) <b>over</b> cap (<b>i)</b> and (a) <b>over</b> cap (<b>i),</b> where (b) <b>over</b> cap (<b>i)</b> satisfies gauge transformations while (a) <b>over</b> cap (<b>i)</b> satisfies adjoint transformations, so close the Seiberg-Witten mapping of noncommutative, U(1) gauge potential. By, means of Seiberg-Witten mapping, we construct a mapping of unit vector field between noncommutative space and ordinary space, and find the noncommutative U(1) gauge potential and its gauge field tensor can be {{expressed in terms of}} the unit vector field. When the unit vector field has no singularity point, noncommutative gauge potential and gauge field tensor will equal ordinary gauge potential and gauge field tensorTalent Introduction Project of Xianyang Normal University 07 XSYK 21...|$|R

25|$|I {{remember}} {{just how}} those men looked as we rode up the little hill where their camp was. The red {{light of the}} morning sun was streaming upon them as they lay head towards us on the ground. And every man had a round red spot {{on top of his}} head, about as big as a dollar where the redskins had taken his scalp. It was frightful, but it was grotesque, and the red sunlight seemed to paint everything all <b>over.</b> <b>I</b> remember one man had on buckskin breeches.|$|E
25|$|The IA allele gives type A, IB gives type B, and i gives type O. As both IA and IB are {{dominant}} <b>over</b> <b>i,</b> only ii {{people have}} type O blood. Individuals with IAIA or IAi have type A blood, and individuals with IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes, because A and B express a special dominance relationship: codominance, {{which means that}} type A and B parents can have an AB child. A couple with type A and type B can also have a type O child if they are both heterozygous (IBi,IAi) The cis-AB phenotype has a single enzyme that creates both A and B antigens. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen {{at the same level}} that would be expected on common group A1 or B red blood cells, which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was <b>over</b> <b>I</b> thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|While Schmidt {{said before}} the game's release that the team wanted to develop [...] "a whole series of games {{that take place in}} the Terra Nova world", the game's poor sales made the {{creation}} of a sequel [...] "impractical", according to Paul Neurath. As the game's publisher, Looking Glass took on the full burden of its commercial underperformance, which contributed to the company's bankruptcy and closure in May 2000. Neurath later said, [...] "If we could do Terra Nova <b>over,</b> <b>I</b> would have dumped the cinematics and done online team play instead.

500|$|Phillips, meanwhile, {{was always}} on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader {{audience}} the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, [...] "Over and <b>over</b> <b>I</b> remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'" [...] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, [...] "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield [...] "Scotty" [...] Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.|$|E
500|$|Sayers had {{the most}} {{productive}} rushing yardage game of his career on November 3, 1968, against the Green Bay Packers, during which he carried 24 times for 205 yards. His season ended prematurely the following week against the 49ers when he tore the ligaments in his right knee. Garry Lyle, the teammate nearest Sayers at the time, said, [...] "I saw his eyes sort of glass <b>over.</b> <b>I</b> heard him holler. I knew he was hurt." [...] Sayers had again been leading the league in rushing yards through the first nine games, and finished the year with 856 yards. After surgery, Sayers went through a physical rehabilitation program {{with the help of}} Piccolo, who had replaced him in the starting lineup. Despite missing the Bears' final five games, he earned first-team All-Pro recognition from several media outlets, including the AP, and UPI, and NEA.|$|E

Lamb suggested that Stead meet with a [...] "critique group" [...] who would help read and revise the drafts Stead wrote. After Stead created a revised copy of the novel in 2005, she sent it to Lamb again and a contract was drawn up. More revisions were made {{in order to make}} the new world created in the novel easier to understand. Stead found it hard [...] "to maintain a sense of 'the whole'.
