5|$|James {{was born}} in Kirkdale, Liverpool, {{the son of the}} Rev. Dr. David James, who was rector of Panteg, Monmouthshire, from 1856 to 1871. Herbert James was educated at King Henry VIII Grammar School, Abergavenny, and then studied at two Oxford colleges. He matriculated at Jesus College in 1863, before winning a {{scholarship}} and moving along Turl Street to Lincoln College in 1864, obtaining a first-class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1867. He was appointed a Fellow of St John's College in 1869 and was President of the Oxford Union Society in 1871 (where he nominated H. H. Asquith to the Standing Committee). He was then ordained, and received his Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1874. Later, on 31 May 1895, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity, having previously been excused by the University from satisfying the requirements normally set for the award <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E

5|$|Penney {{and some}} of his staff {{returned}} by air on 9 October. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the British Empire on 23 October 1952 for his role in Operation Hurricane. Torlesse was supposed to accompany him, but in view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of radioactive contamination, he felt he could not leave his command. He sent Captain D. P. Willan, the skipper of Narvik in his stead. The Royal Navy ships departed the Monte Bello Islands on 31 October. Most of the scientific staff were dropped off at Fremantle, and returned to Britain on RAF Transport Command aircraft. The rest returned on Campania, which arrived in the United Kingdom on 15 December. Hawkesbury continued to patrol the area until 15 January 1953.|$|E
5|$|The Bonville-Courtenay feud {{is often}} given {{as an example}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> to which law and order {{and respect for the}} king had broken down in the provinces. As a result, modern historians have often {{considered}} it a cause of the later Wars of the Roses; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud is perhaps most well known for culminating in an armed encounter at Clyst (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near Exeter, which resulted in loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set {{the rules and regulations}} that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. Untouchability was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With {{the exception of a few}} who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) is an indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of social fluidity in the society.|$|E
