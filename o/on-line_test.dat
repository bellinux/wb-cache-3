Participants first give their year of birth, and then are challenged to match dates to 60 famous events that happened {{between the time}} they were five years old and the present day. To qualify as potentially hyperthymestic, participants must achieve a score at least three standard deviations above the average. To prevent people from searching for answers on-line during the test, reaction time for each question is measured; answers must be chosen within 11 seconds to qualify for consideration. However, many of the questions are sourced in American culture and test results could have a strong cultural bias against non-Americans.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} testing as {{a technique}} to check that a software component satisfies a specification of safety properties.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the state of}} the art and future trends of <b>on-line</b> <b>testing</b> techniques for VLSI. It cautions that emerging technological constraints and application requirements will expend dramatically the use of these techniques. In particularly, various industrial (e. g. railway control, satellites, avionics, telecommunications, control of critical automotive functions, medical electronics, industrial control, etc.), have increasing needs of various <b>on-line</b> <b>testing</b> features. Some of these applications concern mass production and should support the standardization of such techniques and the development of commercial CAD tools supporting them. Furthermore, drastic device shrinking and increasing operating speeds that accompany the technological evolution to deeper submicron, reduces significantly the noise margins and increases dramatically the soft error rates. As a consequence, technological progress will be blocked quickly if no particular actions are undertaken to cope with increasingly high soft-error rates.

40|$|ABSTRACT Built-In-Self-Test (BIST) is an {{efficient}} and practical technique for testing VLSI circuits and systems. Among the different BIST techniques, the Comparative Concurrent BIST (CBIST) has many advantages since {{it can provide}} <b>on-line</b> and off-line <b>testing</b> with the same hardware. However, in CBIST when {{the width of the}} circuit lines increases, <b>on-line</b> <b>testing</b> becomes inefficient. The problem is that finding a match between input data and test sequence has a low chance when the input line width increases. In this paper, we propose MCBIST (Multi CBIST) a new on-line BIST scheme that addresses the problem of concurrent <b>on-line</b> <b>testing</b> in CBIST. In addition, our method improves the performance of non-concurrent online testing. A distributed version of MCBIST is also discussed in this paper. 1...|$|R
