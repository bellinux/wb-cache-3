5|$|Philosophical Transactions is {{the oldest}} and longest-running {{scientific}} journal in the world, having first been published in March 1665 by the first secretary of the society, Henry Oldenburg. It now publishes themed issues on specific topics and, since 1886, has been divided into two parts; A, which deals with mathematics and the physical sciences, and B, which deals with the biological sciences. Proceedings of the Royal Society consists of freely submitted research articles and is similarly divided into two parts. Biology Letters publishes short research articles and opinion pieces on all areas of biology and was launched in 2005. Journal of the Royal Society Interface publishes cross-disciplinary research at {{the boundary between the}} physical and life sciences, while Interface Focus, publishes themed issue in the same areas. Notes and Records is the Society's journal on the history of science. Biographical Memoirs is published annually and contains extended obituaries of deceased Fellows. Open Biology is an open access journal covering biology at the molecular and cellular level. Royal Society <b>Open</b> <b>Science</b> is an open access journal publishing high-quality original research across the entire range of science on the basis of objective peer-review. All the society's journals are peer-reviewed.|$|E

25|$|The LHC Computing Grid was {{constructed}} {{as part of}} the LHC design, to handle the massive amounts of data expected for its collisions. It is an international collaborative project that consists of a grid-based computer network infrastructure initially connecting 140 computing centres in 35 countries (over 170 in 36 countries as of 2012). It was designed by CERN to handle the significant volume of data produced by LHC experiments, incorporating both private fibre optic cable links and existing high-speed portions of the public Internet to enable data transfer from CERN to academic institutions around the world. The <b>Open</b> <b>Science</b> Grid is used as the primary infrastructure in the United States, and also as part of an interoperable federation with the LHC Computing Grid.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} addition, {{completed}} {{in the summer of}} 2008, is the Cramlington Junior Learning Village. Costing £102 million, the centre contains resources for teaching Years 7 and 8 after the council reforms of 11 September 2001 which moved the education system in Northumberland to the two-tier system after decades of using the three-tier system. Also contained within are resources for music and performing arts. The building is made up of other isolated 'blocks' called Enquire, Explore, Discover, Create, Communicate and Care. Other features of the JLV include its “Village” street, <b>open</b> <b>science</b> Learning Plaza, Cyber Café, and flexible learning spaces. The school also boasts its very own 3D screen used across the curriculum and the 'Biome' which {{was the result of a}} successful bid through the “Faraday” project designed to take the teaching of science into the 21st Century. The building also has a multipurpose space called 'The Hub' which is used for assemblies, conferences, socialising at lunchtimes and hosting live shows and performances for music and drama/performing arts.|$|E
