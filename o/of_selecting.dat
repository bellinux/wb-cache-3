40|$|Objective: Evaluate the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Patient Safety Indicator that {{identifies}} patients with selected infections {{that result from}} medical care during hospital inpatient treatment (secondary diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> infection/infection not present at admission). Method: Using unique patient identifiers in New York inpatient hospitalization data, patients identified with a principal diagnosis <b>of</b> a <b>selected</b> infection (present at admission) were linked to any antecedent inpatient discharge. Results: Many patients with a principal diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> infection (present at admission) were linked to a previous recent inpatient encounter. The hospital-level estimate <b>of</b> cases <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> infection resulting from inpatient treatment (secondary diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> infection) increased 25 percent when patients identified with a principal diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> infection were linked to antecedent inpatient discharges.

With {{the rise of}} Adolf Hitler in Germany in the 1930s a few readers (including Donald Wollheim) wrote letters complaining about the inclusion of German stories.

5|$|Following {{the death}} of his namesake Nicholas, Bishop of Dunblane (and former Abbot of Arbroath), Nicholas de Balmyle was among the canons of Dunblane with the {{responsibility}} <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> a successor. Bishop Nicholas had died sometime between 1306 (after his last attestation on 26 January) and late 1307. The election was done by compromissarii (a short-list of canons delegated to perform election), with John, Abbot of Arbroath excluded from the vote, perhaps because of his known pro-English tendencies.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{approach}} of maximization of total selection response (response from selection between crosses plus response from selection within crosses), optimum number of crosses and progeny per cross in the breeding of self-fertilizing crops have been determined. Optimum numbers of crosses and maximum selection responses depend on testing capacity, number <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> crosses, number <b>of</b> lines <b>selected</b> from each selected cross, and heritability. For the general case of various numbers <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> crosses and various numbers <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> lines from each selected cross, the main results are: The maximum selection response increases (i) with an increasing testing capacity, (ii) with an increasing heritability, (iii) with a decreasing number <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> crosses and (iv) with a decreasing number <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> lines from each selected cross. If a certain predetermined {{fraction of the total}} testing capacity should be finally selected, the maximum selection response (a) exhibits a maximum for very small numbers <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> crosses and then steadily decreases (very slowly) with increasing number <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> crosses, (b) increases with increasing heritability, (c) increases with decreasing selected fraction, and (d) increases with increasing testing capacity...|$|R

5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E

5|$|Among Wetherby's other accomplishments {{were the}} {{creation}} of a Department of Mental Health and the construction of fifteen hospitals and thirty health centers throughout the state. In 1952, he created the Youth Authority as a central point for the administration of services to delinquent children. He constructed new state prisons, modernized the probation and parole systems, and established a more orderly system <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> grand and petit juries. He also oversaw some voting reform measures, including the provision of funds to purchase voting machines in areas where they were desired. He was not as successful in the area of government reform. He failed in his efforts to amend the state's constitution to allow the governor to succeed himself in office. He was also unable to win support for a plan to consolidate some of Kentucky's counties. In 1955, the state's voters approved a constitutional amendment granting suffrage to eighteen-year-olds over Wetherby's objections.|$|E
5|$|From 1959 to 1968 {{the champions}} and runners-up of the Taça Brasil were the Brazilian {{representatives in the}} Copa Libertadores; the {{national}} competition had been created with the purpose <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> the country's entrants in the continental tournament. Brazilian clubs did not enter the 1966, 1969 or 1970 editions of the competition, and in 1971 the champion and runner-up of the Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa filled Brazil's berths. From 1972 to 1989, the champions and runners-up of the Campeonato Brasileiro became the representatives; from 1990 to 1999, the champions of the Copa do Brasil, the national cup, occupied the second Brazilian berth.

5|$|In 1970 state {{constitutional}} amendments reorganized the Court. The constitution renamed the Appellate Court the Indiana Court of Appeals. With {{the formation of}} the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court could choose which cases it would hear and which cases it would leave to the lower courts. Constitutional amendments also lengthened judicial terms to ten years and changed the limits {{on the size of the}} Court to a minimum of five members and a maximum of nine. The method <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> justices was changed from statewide election to appointment by the governor. The amendment also provided for a Judicial Nominating Commission to choose candidates. Justices also became subject to a retention election. In addition, the office of chief justice became permanent. Previously the title rotated among the justices. In 2004 the Indiana General Assembly created the Supreme Court Division of Administration, legalizing and expanding the role of the clerks of the Court.|$|E

5|$|In the 1792 constitution, the {{governor}} and state senators were chosen by electors, {{in a manner similar}} to the operation of the United States Electoral College. In the 1795 gubernatorial election, Benjamin Logan received 21 electoral votes, James Garrard received 17, Thomas Todd received 14, and John Brown received 1. The constitution did not specify whether election required a plurality or a majority of the electoral votes cast; in the absence of any instruction, the electors held a runoff vote, wherein most of Todd's electors voted for Garrard, giving him a majority. The secretary of state certified Garrard's election, though Attorney General John Breckinridge questioned the legality of the second vote and Logan formally protested it. Ultimately, Breckinridge determined that he was not empowered by the state constitution to intervene, and Logan gave up the challenge. The 1799 constitution changed the method <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> {{the governor}} to direct election by majority vote and prescribed that, in the event of a tie vote, the governor would be chosen by lot in the Kentucky General Assembly. This provision has remained since 1799.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 1918, {{incumbent}} senator Ollie M. James died. Stanley appointed George B. Martin {{to finish}} James' term, {{which was to}} expire on March 3 of the following year. James had already been nominated for re-election in 1918 by the Democratic primary, and the task <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> the party's new nominee fell to the Democratic State Committee, which nominated Stanley. Stanley enjoyed {{the advantage of a}} united Democratic party; J. C. W. Beckham supported Stanley for this seat so Stanley would not challenge him for his own seat when he faced re-election. The Republicans chose a relative unknown, Dr. Ben L. Bruner. Stanley was attacked for his veto of the German language bill and for his long-standing views against temperance. Though the national mood was against the Democrats, a letter of support from President Woodrow Wilson bolstered Stanley's campaign, and he defeated Bruner by more than 5,000 votes. He resigned as governor to assume the Senate seat in May 1919. As a Democrat in a mostly Republican Senate, he wielded little influence.|$|E
5|$|On December 4 (November 21 O.S.), about 2,000 people {{arrived in}} Vilnius; {{half of them}} were officially elected as delegates by their local communities. Because no {{standard}} elections procedures were offered, the process <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> the representatives varied greatly. Despite irregularities, {{it was the first}} election in the history of Lithuania. People from Aukštaitija were most active, while participation from Samogitia and Suvalkija somewhat lacked. Some of the delegates came from areas that are now part of Poland and Latvia, as well as from areas that were then within the lands of the German Empire (Lithuania Minor). As a result, a wide variety of communities, political groups, government layers, social classes, and organizations were represented. This parliament may have been the first in Europe to include women—there were seven female delegates.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} text-based {{graphics}} and is open-ended with no main objectives. Before playing, the player has {{to set in}} motion a process which generates worlds with continents, oceans and histories documenting civilizations. The main game mode, Fortress mode, consists <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> a suitable site from the generated-world, establishing a successful colony or fortress, combating threats like goblin invasions, generating wealth and taking care of the dwarves. Each dwarf is modeled down to its individual personality, has likes or dislikes and specific trainable skills in various labors. The second main game mode, Adventure mode, is a turn-based, open-ended roguelike where the player starts off as an adventurer in the world and is free to explore, complete quests, or even visit old abandoned fortresses. The combat system is anatomically detailed with combat logs describing organs getting pierced, fat getting bruised and limbs getting severed.|$|E

5|$|The process <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> a third jury {{consumed}} a {{year and}} a half. During the delay, Desha attempted suicide by cutting his throat and severed his windpipe. Doctors used a silver tube to repair his windpipe, and Desha survived. On {{the last day of the}} court's term in June 1827, the judge announced another continuance, since the court had not yet empaneled a jury. Governor Desha stood and produced a pardon for his son. Although legend holds that Governor Desha resigned immediately after issuing the pardon, records show that he served out the rest of his term. The pardon damaged the governor's reputation and that of the Relief Party, which lost a number of legislative seats in the subsequent elections.|$|E
