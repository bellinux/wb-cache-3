5|$|In 1961, Smith {{moved to}} MIT as an Institute Professor with {{appointments}} {{in both the}} Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. His focus was to transplant the techniques of metallurgy into {{the study of the}} production methods used to create artefacts discovered by archaeologists such as samurai swords. In his role of teaching the history of science, he argued that important advances were often the result of curiosity rather than the pursuit of defined goals. He was interested in the scientific aspects of fine arts, and published several works linking the arts with the sciences. He lectured about this at the Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E

A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge. MIT has more modest cross-registration programs with Boston University, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Massachusetts College <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.|$|E
5|$|Somerset House {{was built}} by Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, regent of England from 1547 to 1549, {{demolishing}} three inns and {{the church of the}} Nativity of Our Lady and the Innocents in the process. After Somerset was executed in 1552, it became an occasional residence for Princess Elizabeth. When she became Queen in 1558, she returned part of the house to Seymour's family (with ownership passing to his son, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford); the remainder was an occasional meeting place for the Royal Society. After Elizabeth's death in 1603, it was owned by Anne of Denmark, wife of James VI and I. The building was renamed Denmark House in commemoration of Anne's brother, Christian IV of Denmark. After James died in 1625, his body lay there intestate for a month. The building was taken over by Parliament in 1645 following the Civil War, renaming it back to Somerset House. It had an irregular series of owners and residents for much of the 18th century until it was demolished in 1775. The house was rebuilt as a series of government buildings. The Stamp Office, later to become the Inland Revenue was established in Somerset House in 1789. In the late 20th century, a number of art galleries were set up on vacant parts, including the Courtauld Institute <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> King's College London School of Law.|$|E

German postgraduate Master's <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Master's <b>of</b> Science degrees were introduced in 2001. Therefore, <b>the</b> new Master <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old Magister Artium degrees existed side by side until the phase out of the old degrees since 2010; Magister Artium degrees are still awarded (as of 2014). <b>The</b> new Bachelor <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> degrees together also require 5 years of studies, which is the reason why <b>the</b> new Master <b>of</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old Magister Artium degrees are considered equivalent.|$|R
