A relationship between landscape structure and Bactrocera oleae, the main olive grove pest, indicated a general association between complex landscapes and reduced abundance of the insect. In this work we have characterised the relationship between spatial structure of specific land uses and the olive fruit fly abundance at different scales (from 600 to 2000 m radius). We paid {{special attention to the}} dominant land use in the studied area, the olive crop, and the surrounding natural land uses. In the landscape analysed the spatial arrangement of olive and scrubland patches showed a gradient of situations from areas with an abundance of <b>olive</b> <b>area</b> distributed in very few patches close to each other to landscapes with less <b>olive</b> <b>area</b> arranged in many patches and with larger scrubland areas. Linear mixed-effects models showed that the abundance of B. oleae is positively related to the proximity of olive patches at all studied scales. However, other landscape characteristics (total area of olive groves and scrublands) were differentially related to pest abundance depending on considered scales. According to the obtained results it is advisable to plan olive groves at a 1000 – 1500 m radius spatial scale, in which the role of scrublands regarding B. oleae population is favoured.

The management intensity classes were developed in view of a differentiated accounting of olive groves when delineating High Nature Value Farmland areas (HNV) at pan-European level. The remote sensing input data used was the Green Vegetation Fraction (GVF), derived in 10 -day intervals from a long term time series of NOAA AVHRR data. The key physical parameters for the intensity assessment were obtained by parameterization of the observed annual growth cycle. These parameters represent two functional proportions in olive groves, a seasonally changing annual component and a permanent perennial vegetation component, which were interpreted to classify data in three olive farming intensity levels. 27 % of the assessed EU-Mediterranean wide <b>olive</b> <b>areas</b> were found to be of very high intensity, 12 % were classified as low intensity <b>olive</b> <b>areas</b> and 61 % form an intermediate intensity class.

40|$|Abstract Floral phenology, as most {{of natural}} phenomena, shows, as an {{inherent}} feature, {{a high degree of}} spatial continuity. Geostatistics are a family of statistics that describe correlations through space/ time and they can be used for both quantifying spatial correlation and interpolating no monitored sampling points. The combined use of Geographical Informa-tion Systems (GIS) and geostatistics can be an essential tool for spatial analysis in phenological and aerobiological studies. In the present work, Kriging interpolation by using linear geostatistic analysis has allow us to estimate phenological data of a wide olive crop area of the province of Cordoba (Andalusia, Southern Spain), {{on the basis of a}} limited number of phenology sampling points. The main a priori hypothesis was that 7 traditionally observed sampling points (with 10 olive trees in each site) uniformly distributed through the main olive crop areas could be enough for interpolating phenological information of the whole Cordoba <b>olive</b> <b>area.</b> Geostatistical results reject this hypothesis. The optimum/minimum number and location of sampling points was deter-mined in 13 sites (including the original 7 sites and 6 new sites). The obtained phenological maps will improve olive pollen aerobiological information and forecasting in the area. The application of such new combined space analysis tools on floral phenology allows optimising human and economic resources on field phenology campaigns. Moreover, an appropriate use of GIS and geostatistic software to create phe-nological maps will be an essential complement in pollen aerobiological studies, given the increased interest in obtaining automatic aerobiological fore-casting maps...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{valuation}} of irrigation water is done {{through the use}} of production functions for the case of the olive grove. In order to do so the integration of an agronomic model (based on the production function) and an economic model linked to the profitability of the crop (the ratio of revenue and operating costs) in the area under study is proposed. The study case encompasses the Guadalbullon River Sub-basin area, belonging to the Guadalquivir River Hydrologic Demarcation (Southern Spain). Within the overall deficit of the Guadalquivir River basin, the Guadalbullon River poses a special problem as it is unregulated and there are important irrigated fields on its banks, most of them olive groves. Net marginal value of water obtained (having deducted the variable costs of production including harvesting and irrigation) is € 0. 60 m- 3 for the allocation of 1, 000 m 3 ha- 1 and € 0. 53 m- 3 for the water right allowance of 1, 500 m 3 ha 3 (average for period 2005 / 2008).

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} as {{a review of the}} current situation regarding the impact of olive cultivation in Southern Spain (Andalusia) on soil degradation processes and its progression into yield impacts, due to diminishing soil profile depth and climate change in the sloping areas where it is usually cultivated. Finally, it explores the possible implications in the regional agricultural policy these results might have. It tries to show how the expansion and intensification of olive cultivation in Andalusia, especially since the late 18 th century, had as a consequence an acceleration of erosion processes that can be identified by several indicators and techniques. Experimental and model analysis indicates that the rate of soil erosion accelerated since the expansion of mechanization in the late 1950 s. In addition, that unsustainable erosion rates have prevailed in the region since the shift to a more intense olive cultivation systems {{by the end of the}} 17 th Century. Although agroenvironmental measures implemented since the early 2000 s have reduced erosion rates, they are still unsustainably high in a large fraction of the <b>olive</b> <b>area</b> in the region. In the case of olive orchards located in steeper areas with soils of lower water-holding capacity (due to coarse texture and stone content), cumulative erosion has already had a high impact on reducing their potential productivity. This is one of the factors that contributes towards increasing the gap between these less intensified orchards in the mountainous areas and those in the hilly areas with more gentle slopes, such as for instance the lower stretches of the Guadalquivir River Valley. In the case of olive orchards in the hilly areas with better soils, easier access to irrigation and lower production costs per unit, the efforts on soil conservation should be oriented towards limiting off-site damage, since the soil water-storage function of these soils may be preserved in the medium term even at the current soil erosion rates. The assessment made in this manuscript should be regarded as an initial approximation, since additional efforts in terms of increasing experimental records (for current or historical erosion) and of improving model analysis, with more comprehensive studies and more robust calibration and validation processes, are required.

40|$|Hyperpolarization-activated cation currents, termed Ih, were {{discovered}} in the heart and brain. These currents contribute to various physiological properties and functions, including neuronal pacemaker activity, the setting of resting potential and dendritic integration. The Hyperpolarization-activated and Cyclic-Nucleotide-gated nonselective cation channels (HCNs: HCN 1 - 4), which generate Ih, have been cloned recently. To understand the functional diversity of Ih in the brain, precise immunohistochemical localization of all four HCNs is needed. Here I present the distribution and subcellular localization of immunoreactivity for HCNs in the rat brain using newly raised guinea pig polyclonal antibodies against fusion proteins containing rat HCN sequences. Immunoblot analyses of the rat brain with these antibodies showed single bands, which disappeared after adsorption of the antibodies with the respective antigens, suggesting specificity of these antibodies to each HCN subunit. Then, I performed immunohistochemical investigation of HCNs in the rat brain. Immunoreactivity for all HCN subunits was detected with various intensities in neuropil throughout the brain. For HCN 3 and HCN 4 but not for HCN 1 and HCN 2, immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies and processes were clearly visible in light microscopic level in many brain regions. HCN 1 : Intense HCN 1 -like immunoreactivity (LI) was observed in the main olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, lacunosum moleculare (LM) of the hippocampal CA areas, superior colliculus, inferior <b>olive,</b> <b>area</b> postrema, hypoglossal nucleus and molecular layer of the cerebellum. HCN 2 : HCN 2 -LI was widely distributed throughout the brain being most intense in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, inferior colliculus, brain stem and granular layer of the cerebellum. The immunoreactivities for HCN 1 and HCN 2 were overlapped in layer I of the neocortex and the LM of CA areas. In electron microscopic level, immunogold particles for HCN 1 and HCN 2 were found dense along the plasma membrane of distal dendrites of pyramidal cells in the neocortex and CA 1 area. The HCN 2 -immunopositve small glia-like cells were observed throughout the brain including the white matter. HCN 3 :HCN 3 -LI was mainly distributed in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs, piriform cortex, preoptic area, habenular nucleui, hypothalamus, interpeduncular nuclei and inferior olivary complex. In the flocculus of the cerebellum, intense HCN 3 -LI was observed in the cholinergic terminal and axon. HCN 4 : The distribution pattern of HCN 4 -LI was restricted to the thalamic nuclei and some other regions such as the external plexiform layer of the main olfactory bulb, nucleus of the olfactory tract, fasciculus retroflexous, lateral lemniscus, ventral cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex and area postrema. I found that all four HCN-LIs were localized to presynaptic elements {{as well as to}} postsynaptic elements. In presynaptic elements, immunoreactivity for HCNs was often found in preterminal and axonal parts rather than axon terminals. For example, in cerebellar basket cells, most of immunogold particles for HCN 1 were found in the ponceau of the basket cell, but only rarely localized to their terminals with symmetrical synapses. I also found immunoreactivity for HCNs in plasma membrane of myelinated axons in various regions including the fasciculus retroflexus and hippocampus. Next, to identify HCN 2 -immunopositive small cells, I tried double immunostaining using the guinea pig anti-HCN 2 antibody and mouse or rabbit antibodies for various markers including NeuN for matured neurons, GFAP for astrocytes, NG 2 for oligoprogenitors, IbaI for microglia-macrophages, and GST-π for oligodendrocytes. I found that all of the HCN 2 -positive cells were labeled only for GST-π throughout the brain except the amygdaloid areas and cingulated, prirhinal, and lateral entorhinal cortices, where I found only single labeled cells GST-π. In addition, some of the double-immunopositive cells were particularly close to neuronal cell bodies and processes in the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer and cerebellar granule cell layer. In electron microscopic level, the HCN 2 -immunopositive cells had some clumps of heterochromatin along nuclear membrane and those clumps were eccentrically located in the soma, having similar properties to those of previously described perineuronal oligodendrocytes. These results suggest that HCN 2 -immunopositive smallcells belong to a subpopulation of oligodendrocytes, including perineuronal oligodendrocytes. In conclusion four HCNs have distinct distribution patterns in neuropil and neuronal cell bodies throughout the brain consistent with the reported patterns of distribution of mRNAs for HCNs. My results indicate that HCNs are localized not only in somato-dendritic compartments, but also in axonal compartments of neurons. The HCN 1 and HCN 2 are co-localized in the hippocampus and neocortex and had similar distribution patterns in electron microscopic level, suggesting that these subunits could form the heteromeric channels. Interestingly, HCN 2 is extensively expressed in a subpopulation of oligodendrocytes including perineuronal oligodendrocytes. These results support previous electrophysiological findings and further suggest diversified roles of Ih channels in the brain, which are not yet fully identified...|$|E

40|$|Olive {{growing in}} Sicily is spread in 180 000 {{hectares}} and {{is located in}} a wide range of environmental conditions, both from a climatic and a pedological point of view, owing to the particular morphological and topographical features of the region. The complexity in the environmental characters of <b>olive</b> growing <b>areas</b> in Sicily leads to the development of cultural techniques aiming to adapt the environmental resources available in each cultural area to the ecological requirements of the species. The geographic location of Sicily, an Island in the middle of the Mediterranean, has favoured the introduction and, along the centuries, the development of an olive germplasm that, according to a recent survey, is composed by about 40 cultivars (Barone et al., 1994). This high environmental diversity, apart from ensuring good productive levels in each cultural area, promoted the high cultivar differentiation which can be observed among the several olive oils which, thanks to the appropriate cultural practices, can reach very high qualitative levels. Several oils are protected by their Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) seal and are appreciated both on the national and the international market (Caruso et al., 2002). In spite of the high variability of the Sicilian olive varietal pool, only few cultivars (about 10), are adopted in the majority of <b>olive</b> growing <b>areas</b> of Sicily and among them, in order o...|$|R
