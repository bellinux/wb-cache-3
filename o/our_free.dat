5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected <b>our</b> <b>free</b> choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising <b>our</b> <b>free</b> will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E

Multiple Supreme Court decisions have cited the case {{as evidence of the}} Framers' ideas on free speech. In the 1957 Roth v. United States opinion by William Brennan, Madison's Report is cited as evidence that [...] "the fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well-being of <b>our</b> <b>free</b> society and are indispensable to its continued growth." [...] Other cases to cite the Report for a similar purpose include Thornhill v. Alabama (1940) and Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC (2000).|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, Leslie's {{opponent}} Republican John Marshall Harlan was blasted as a [...] "political weathercock" [...] {{for having}} changed his stance on many issues. In one joint debate, Leslie quoted an antebellum speech wherein Harlan {{had called the}} Republican platform [...] "revolutionary, and if carried out, {{would result in the}} destruction of <b>our</b> <b>free</b> government." [...] Harlan admitted his inconsistent stands, declaring that he would rather be right than consistent. Meanwhile, Leslie began moving closer to the [...] "New Departure" [...] wing of his party {{during the course of the}} campaign. Ultimately, Leslie's supporters deemed him [...] "sober, conservative, and safe", and this perception enabled him to defeat Harlan by a considerable margin in the first election in which blacks were allowed to vote.|$|E
500|$|According to biographer, William S. McFeely, Grant {{and many}} in the north {{believed}} the American Civil War extended democracy to the African American freedmen. Grant worked to ensure ratification of the pending constitutional amendment approved by Congress {{and sent to the}} states during {{the last days of the}} Johnson administration, that would prohibit the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's [...] "race, color, or previous condition of servitude". On February 3, 1870 the amendment reached requisite number of state ratifications (then 27), and was certified as the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Grant hailed it's ratification as [...] "a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of <b>our</b> <b>free</b> government to the present day". Many in the south, however, were determined that the African American males' right to vote would be unenforceable.|$|E

500|$|McCain was {{a staunch}} {{promoter}} {{of the importance}} of a strong naval presence, and indeed became known in military-congressional circles, sometimes not approvingly, as [...] "Mr. Seapower". [...] He gave regular speeches on the subject with an increasing fervor, and worked with his large number of political contacts in what some saw as an effort to get a final promotion. [...] During the Cold War, McCain stressed the importance of maintaining naval superiority over the Soviet Union. [...] He was especially concerned in light of the growing number of submarines deployed by the Soviet Navy, calling them [...] "a direct threat to <b>our</b> <b>free</b> use of the oceans of the world." [...] During a long U.S. policy debate regarding the merchant marine force, he continued to stress the importance of that fleet, giving an illustrated talk entitled [...] "Total Wet War" [...] that said the Soviets would soon overtake the fleet in numbers and concluding that [...] "our free use of the seas will play an ever increasing role in the world situation of the future." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevada was {{the first}} state to ratify the amendment, on March 1, 1869. The New England states and most Midwest states also {{ratified}} the amendment soon after its proposal. Southern states still controlled by Radical reconstruction governments, such as North Carolina, also swiftly ratified. Newly elected President Ulysses S. Grant strongly endorsed the amendment, calling it [...] "a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of <b>our</b> <b>free</b> government to the present day." [...] He privately asked Nebraska's governor to call a special legislative session to speed the process, securing the state's ratification. In April and December 1869, Congress passed Reconstruction bills mandating that Virginia, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia ratify the amendment as a precondition to regaining congressional representation; all four states did so. The struggle for ratification was particularly close in Indiana and Ohio, which voted to ratify in May 1869 and January 1870, respectively. New York, which had ratified on April 14, 1869, tried to revoke its ratification on January 5, 1870. However, in February 1870, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas ratified the amendment, bringing the total ratifying states to twenty-nine—one more than the required twenty-eight ratifications from the thirty-seven states, and forestalling any court challenge to New York's resolution to withdraw its consent.|$|E
500|$|In March 1869, President Grant made {{it known}} he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed, stating {{it was a}} [...] "stride toward a {{revolution}} in <b>our</b> <b>free</b> system". The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867, sponsored by Radical Republicans, to curb {{the power of the}} President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments. The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868. [...] On March 5, 1869, a bill was brought before Congress to repeal the act, but Senator Charles Sumner was opposed, unwilling to give Grant a free hand in making appointments. Grant, to bolster the repeal effort, declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies, until the law was overturned, thus, agitating political office seekers to pressure Congress to repeal the law. Under national pressure for governmental reform, a compromise was reached and a new bill was passed that allowed the President to have complete control over removing his own cabinet, however, government appointees needed the approval of Congress within a thirty-day period. Grant, who did not desire a party split over the matter, signed the bill; afterwards, he received criticism for not getting a full repeal of the law. The unpopular measure was completely repealed in 1887. Grant was criticized for appointing many family members considered unqualified to highly sought government posts, a practice known as nepotism.|$|E

Initially unpopular, it {{evolved in the}} early 1860s into an important religious and patriotic hymn. The final verse, which originally begged [...] "Save, Oh Lord, our King", was substituted with [...] "Return us, Oh Lord, <b>our</b> <b>free</b> Fatherland" [...] while the melody was replaced {{with that of a}} Marian hymn.

This is a far bolder philosophy than despotic rulers can afford to follow. It {{is the heart of}} the system on which our freedom depends." [...] Citing DeJonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937), Black noted that a unanimous Court had already struck down laws which banned citizens from attending Communist Party meetings. It should strike down the relevant portions of the Taft-Hartley Act as well, he concluded.|$|E
2500|$|Catholicism's way of {{thinking}} is better expressed through the Principle and Foundation of St. Ignatius of Loyola: [...] "The human person is created to praise, reverence, and serve God Our Lord, and by doing so, to save his or her soul. All other things {{on the face of}} the earth are created for human beings in order to help them pursue the end for which they are created. It follows from this that one must use other created things, in so far as they help towards one's end, and free oneself from them, in so far as they are obstacles to one's end. To do this, we need to make ourselves indifferent to all created things, provided the matter is subject to <b>our</b> <b>free</b> choice and there is no other prohibition. Thus, as far as we are concerned, we should not want health more than illness, wealth more than poverty, fame more than disgrace, a long life more than a short one, and similarly for all the rest, but we should desire and choose only what helps us more towards the end for which we are created." ...|$|E
