5000|$|The {{drawing and}} music-making {{portions}} {{were made to}} be based on the drawing and music-making portions of Mario Paint. However, they found difficulty in designing the portion of the game where players designate the objectives of the microgames. Originally, they intended to make characters and items, which they designated as [...] "objects", able to move depending on the players wishes, but they needed to make the game interactive and approachable for players. After Smooth Moves, development of D.I.Y. took two years to complete; one of those years was spent attempting to figure out how to make such interaction and approachability doable. Eventually, they decided on splitting the microgame design process into three phases - the <b>object</b> <b>phase,</b> the background phase, and the sound phase. They created a test model which they viewed as successful after a designer created a microgame in a few hours. At this point, the development had picked up, Sugioka commenting that the team was amazed by this since he was just a designer and not a programmer, meaning he did not have access to special techniques to do this. As the development continued, the game design mechanics grew from the simple test model, as if like they were adding to a puzzle, in Sugioka's words. The developers intended on keeping it simple, however, only implementing six buttons. For example, for a microgame that features a jumping character, players may dictate where the character may jump by selecting the [...] "Boing!" [...] button. While Hatakeyama wanted to add more functionality, Abe retorted by commenting either that the player could combine two functions to do what Hatakeyama wanted or that the microgames only lasted a few seconds and did not need to get too complex. The development team attempted to recreate microgames from WarioWare: Touched! to test how easy it would be for players to do so. For some they could recreate, while others they could not. In response, they adjusted the game to make the ones they could not recreate workable. The debugging process was a difficult part of the development due to how many possibilities there were in creating microgames.|$|E

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{spatial and}} cognitive {{function of the}} septal nuclei, neural activity was recorded from alert monkeys during performance of a place-dependent go/no-go (PGN) task. Response/reinforcement contingencies of given objects were conditional upon {{the location of a}} motorized, movable device (cab) containing a monkey in one of four places. The task was initiated by presentation of the outside view (place phase) followed by presentation of an object (<b>object</b> <b>phase)</b> selected from a total of four. A lever press was reinforced only if the correct object was seen in its corresponding place, and the same object was never reinforced in any of the other three places. Of 430 septal neurons recorded, the responses during the place phase in the four places were significantly different in 58 neurons. Responses of eight of these neurons were also place-differential during the <b>object</b> <b>phase</b> as well as the place phase. Furthermore, when the outside view was not presented before the <b>object</b> <b>phase,</b> differential responses in the <b>object</b> <b>phase</b> disappeared. Responses of 91 neurons in the <b>object</b> <b>phase</b> were differential in terms of go/no-go responses and reward availability. Of these 91 neurons, 72 were further tested on a place-independent asymmetrical go/no-go (AGN) task, which required no conditional discrimination. Forty-three neurons responded differentially only in the PGN task. It is thus concluded that this PGN-specific activity reflected conditional place-object relations. Of the remaining 29 neurons that responded differentially in both tasks, 21 were further tested by a place-independent symmetrical go/no-go task (no-go responses were also rewarded). Responses of 19 of these 21 neurons were related to the reward/nonreward contingency but not to the response contingency. The results suggest that septal nuclei are involved in integrating spatial information, conditional place-object relations, and reward/ nonreward contingency...|$|E

40|$|The {{uses of the}} bispectrum for {{recovering}} {{the images}} of one-dimensional infrared astronomical speckle data are examined in detail. An analytic model for the bispectral transfer function, the variance, and the covariance of the bispectrum are developed. The models are evaluated by Monte Carlo integration {{and the results are}} compared to sample estimates of the same quantities obtained from simulated data. For comparison, the same sample quantities are computed from observed data. The bispectrum is shown to be useful for determining estimates of the <b>object</b> <b>phase.</b> A recursive method which is used to obtain the <b>object</b> <b>phase</b> estimates is introduced. Since the bispectrum provides multiple estimates of each <b>object</b> <b>phase,</b> a number of methods for combining the multiple estimates are developed and compared. Many techniques have been proposed to determine the phase of images which have been atmospherically distorted. Among these techniques are the Knox-Thompson, and the Simple Shift-and-Add algorithms. These methods are compared to the bispectrum via an objective measure which is developed. Optimization techniques are used to great success. A model for the bispectrum of a binary star is developed and fit to the image bispectrum by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for non-linear least squares. The ability of the algorithm to determine binary star parameters from the bispectrum is tested with both simulated and observed data. Since the bispectrum may not always be available, a method is developed which determines binary star parameters from the image Fourier transform. The full set of object phases and moduli are determined by use of the conjugate gradient and conjugate direction algorithms in the last section. Two starting points for each algorithm are employed. The first starting point uses the estimates of the object phases obtained from the recursive bispectrum technique. The second assumes no information is known about the object. The speed of convergence of each algorithm is analyzed and recommendations are made for future use...|$|E

Flames, gases and liquids are examples of transparent media, often called <b>phase</b> <b>objects</b> in an optical context. <b>Phase</b> <b>objects</b> often have non-uniform refractive index distributions. Variations in density, temperature or pressure affect the refractive index. The phase of the optical wave is affected by the refractive index and therefore measurement of the phase of an optical wave gives useful information about the behaviour of the medium. Also the propagation direction of the optical wave is affected by a change in the refractive index. The aim with this thesis is to develop measurement methods, for the study of <b>phase</b> <b>objects,</b> which use only one observation direction and two recordings on a CCD, before and after a change in the <b>phase</b> <b>object.</b> In this thesis, the different optical measurement methods are based on digital speckle photography, interferometry and digital holography to visualize refractive index changes and to obtain <b>phase</b> <b>object</b> data. A <b>phase</b> <b>object</b> inserted in a laser speckle field introduces speckle displacement, from which information about the object may be extracted. The speckle displacements obtained from this defocused digital speckle photography technique are used to determine the phase gradients and the position of <b>phase</b> <b>objects.</b> For the study of transient events, like rapid changes of refractive index in gases, pulsed TV holography is a useful technique. Holograms are recorded, before and after a change in the <b>phase</b> <b>object.</b> The speckle patterns are reconstructed and numerically refocused to different imaging planes, where speckle displacement fields are calculated by digital speckle photography. A numerical refocusing technique that uses a numerical ideal lens in the Fourier domain is exploited. Interferometry is a useful method to measure phase changes between two <b>object</b> states. The <b>phase</b> change, which is affected by the refractive index, may be used to create a wrapped phase map {{and the quality of the}} map may be poor if the <b>phase</b> <b>object</b> is out of focus during the measurement. The plane of maximum speckle correlation, which also is the position of the <b>phase</b> <b>object,</b> has to be found to get a phase map of best quality. A technique to improve the quality by first finding the right reconstruction distance and thereafter propagate the wave field to the determined distance is demonstrated. The results from the measurements show that the methods are suitable for the study of transparent media. The determination of phase gradients and positions from speckle displacement fields are applicable on <b>phase</b> <b>objects</b> that can be treated as thin sheets.
