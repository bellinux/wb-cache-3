2500|$|The {{eventual}} {{choice of}} the BMW 801 14-cylinder radial over the more troublesome BMW 139 also brought with it a BMW-designed cowling [...] "system" [...] which integrated the radiator used to cool the motor oil. An annular, ring-shaped oil cooler core was built into the BMW-provided forward cowl, just behind the fan. The outer portion of the oil cooler's core was {{in contact with the}} main cowling's sheet metal. Comprising the BMW-designed forward cowl, in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a C-shaped cross-section, with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl, and the inner side {{on the inside of the}} oil cooler core. Together, the metal ring and cowling formed an S-shaped duct with the oil cooler's core contained between them. Airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine forward across the oil cooler core to provide cooling for the 801's motor oil. The rate of cooling airflow over the core could be controlled by moving the metal ring in order to open or close the gap. The reasons for this complex system were threefold. One was to reduce any extra aerodynamic drag of the <b>oil</b> <b>radiator,</b> in this case largely eliminating it by placing it within the same cowling as the engine. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the radiator to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the radiator behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The disadvantage to this design was that the radiator was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|E

25|$|The Il-2 is a single-engine, propeller-driven, low-wing {{monoplane}} {{of mixed}} construction {{with a crew}} of two (one in early versions), specially designed for assault operations. Its most notable feature was the inclusion of armor in an airframe load-bearing scheme. Armor plates replaced the frame and paneling throughout the nacelle and middle part of the fuselage, and an armored hull made of riveted homogeneous armor steel AB-1 (AB-2) secured the aircraft’s engine, cockpit, water and <b>oil</b> <b>radiators,</b> and fuel tanks.|$|R

50|$|The F.370 was a low-wing {{monoplane}} {{that first}} flew on the 22 April 1933. Powered by a Farman 8 Vee-piston engine it had streamlined features, including a shallow fin faired {{into the open}} cockpit headrest and fixed main monowheel landing gear faired into the engine and <b>oil</b> <b>radiators</b> of the engine. It was entered into the 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe air race in which it averaged over 300 km/h (187 mph), on the fifth circuit the engine overheated and the F.370 withdrew from the race.|$|R
50|$|For 1975 the 308 was updated to 308B specifications, with revised {{bodywork}} and repositioned <b>oil</b> <b>radiators.</b> The car {{was even}} more competitive and Hunt challenged for the victory in Argentina and Brazil before he broke his and the team's duck at the 1975 Dutch Grand Prix. It would be the team's only win however. He rounded off the season with several solid placings, which helped Hesketh finish fourth in the constructors' championship. The team folded {{at the end of}} the season as Hesketh could not afford to keep financing his unsponsored team, and Hunt moved to McLaren for 1976.|$|R

50|$|A Lycoming O-235-C2A {{air-cooled}} engine, {{rated at}} 115 hp (85.8 kW), drives a Sensenich Propeller model 72 CK-050, metallic fixed-pitch twin-bladed propeller. The fuel system uses a FACET MA 3PA carburetor, equipped with carburetor heat. Electrical {{power is supplied}} by a Prestolite alternator. The ignition system is driven by dual Bendix Scintilla S5LN magnetos; the starter motor is also by Prestolite. The engine incorporates a wet crankcase, and the lubricant is cooled by an <b>oil</b> <b>radiator</b> {{in the front of}} the engine's air intake, which is triggered by a bi-metallic thermostatic valve.|$|E
5000|$|Another visual {{hallmark}} of the 701 was its combined oil tank and de-aerator. This large, cylindrical tank was mounted vertically to the right hand side of the Hewland transaxle, filling {{the space between the}} right rear wheel, the gearbox and the wing. Autocar sporting editor Innes Ireland described it as [...] "enormous" [...] and looking [...] "like an old fashioned coffee percolator". The <b>oil</b> <b>radiator</b> itself was mounted atop the gearbox, to avoid the surge and starvation problems associated with the lengthy pipes needed to mount the radiator in the nose, alongside the water radiator.|$|E
50|$|The Lancia HF Integrale {{incorporated}} some of {{the features}} of the Delta HF 4WD into a road car. The engine was an 8-valve 2 L fuel injected 4-cylinder, with balancing shafts. The HF version featured new valves, valve seats and water pump, larger water and <b>oil</b> <b>radiators,</b> more powerful cooling fan and bigger air cleaner. A larger capacity Garrett T3 turbocharger with improved air flow and bigger inter-cooler, revised settings for the electronic injection/ignition control unit and a knock sensor, boost power output to 185 bhp (DIN) (136 kW) at 5300 rpm and maximum torque of 31 m·kgf (304 N·m, 224 lbf·ft) at 3500 rpm.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, a {{mid-engined}} Group 6 racing car, the GTR, was being developed {{but only a}} handful were produced before this was abandoned {{following the death of}} company owner Brian Sherwood in late 1969. The GTR was only 30 inches high, and had a drag co-efficient of only 0.28. Designer Hilder achieved this by moving all the mechanical parts, such as the water and <b>oil</b> <b>radiators</b> {{to the rear of the}} car. The car was entered for the 1969 Le Mans 24 Hours Race, but overheating problems and the failure of driver John Burton to record a qualifying time meant that the car did not start the race.|$|R
5000|$|The F.380 was a low-wing {{monoplane}} {{that first}} flew in 1933.

5000|$|Broom Development Engineering was {{established}} in 1982 by Mick Broom, the Hesketh engineer and test rider. The company continued both to improve the V1000 engine and frame performance and to update earlier motorcycles to the latest specification. The company has annually produced about a dozen V1000 EN10 motorcycles, an updated V1000 with oil cooling improvements such as an <b>oil</b> <b>radiator</b> to cool the rear cylinder. Some fifty Hesketh Vampire tourers were built to customer specifications. Amendments to the Vulcan model include radial tyres, more modern suspension and brakes, digital engine management, a bigger engine, and changes to the running gear.|$|E
50|$|The FJ1200 uses a four {{cylinder}} in-line {{layout and}} is air-cooled. Sixteen valves are {{operated by a}} chain-driven double overhead camshaft; valve clearances are adjusted using shims. The four constant-velocity carburettors are mounted in a bank behind the cylinders and feed each cylinder through short intake manifolds. Four exhaust downpipes join a box below the engine where the gases are split to exit through two silencers (mufflers). The crankshaft is geared directly to the clutch, no counter balancer shaft is used. Starting is by electric starter only. Lubrication is wet sump using a trochoid pump; an <b>oil</b> <b>radiator</b> assists with cooling. Both the FJ1100 and FJ1200 were fitted with an additional fuel vapour recovery system to comply with California emission regulations.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in 1996 the DR200SE was a {{derivative}} of the DR200 and has remained mostly unchanged until production stopped in 2013 {{with the introduction}} of the DR200S which is essentially the same bike mechanically with a few minor upgrades to the seat and the plastics. This lightweight, low-cost motorcycle is often used by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation to teach beginners how to ride. Like most low-displacement dual sport bikes, it has a four-stroke, [...] single-cylinder engine and can be ridden offroad or licensed for street use in the United States. It has a five-speed transmission and push-button start with electronic-ignition.

5|$|The Brabham BT46 is a Formula One {{racing car}} {{designed}} by Gordon Murray for the Brabham team, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, for the 1978 Formula One season. The car featured several radical design elements, {{one of which}} was the use of flat panel heat exchangers on the bodywork of the car to replace conventional water and <b>oil</b> <b>radiators.</b> This concept did not work in practice and was removed before the car’s race debut, never to be seen again. The cars, however, powered by a flat-12 Alfa Romeo engine, raced competitively with modified nose-mounted radiators for most of the year, driven by Niki Lauda and John Watson, winning one race in this form and scoring sufficient points for the team to finish third in the constructors championship.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the chassis}} monocoques for 701/2 and 701/4 had been {{manufactured}} by March, the final buildup {{of the cars}} was by Tyrrell mechanics. As a result, the blue Tyrrell cars incorporated {{a significant number of}} differences and tweaks in their configuration to the cars run by the works March team and those supplied to other customers. The first major difference was the specification of Dunlop tyres, rather than the Firestone rubber with which the works cars were equipped and the 701 had been designed around. In an attempt to develop the car and improve its handling the Tyrrell team made adjustments to the position of the suspension mounting points and added a damper to the steering system. More subtle variations related to the positioning of exhaust pipe brackets, wing struts, the <b>oil</b> <b>radiator,</b> and the pipe runs for lubrication and coolant fluids.|$|E
50|$|In 1943, Yakovlev {{designed}} the Yak-1M {{which was a}} lighter version of the Yak-1. It incorporated a wing of similar design, but with smaller surface area and had further aerodynamic refinements, like the new placement of the <b>oil</b> <b>radiator,</b> from the chin to the wing roots (one of the visual differences with the Yak-1, -7, -9). A second Yak-1M prototype was constructed later that year, differing from the first aircraft in that it had plywood instead of fabric covering of the rear fuselage, mastless radio antenna, reflector gunsight and improved armor and engine cooling. The chief test pilot for the project Petr Mikhailovich Stefanovskiy {{was so impressed with}} the new aircraft that he recommended that it should completely replace the Yak-1 and Yak-7 with only the Yak-9 retained in production for further work with the Klimov VK-107 engine. The new fighter, designated the Yak-3 entered service in 1944, later than the Yak-9 in spite of the lower designation number.|$|E
50|$|Broom Development Engineering is a British {{motorcycle}} manufacturer, {{and provides}} {{research and development}} services to the automotive and aerospace industries. Established in 1982 by engineer, Hesketh test rider and motorcycle racer Mick Broom, the company is based at Turweston Airfield near Brackley, Northamptonshire {{not far from the}} Silverstone racing circuit and has continued to improve the Hesketh V1000 engine and frame performance as well as updating earlier motorcycles to the latest specification. It produced each year about a dozen new V1000 EN10 motorcycles which were the V1000 with oil cooling improvements including an <b>oil</b> <b>radiator</b> to cool the rear cylinder. It has also produced fifty Hesketh Vampire tourers to customer specifications. Mick Broom put the Hesketh business up for sale in September 2008. The Hesketh motorcycle side of Broom Development Engineering was taken over by Mr Paul Sleeman who relocated the business south of London and intends to continue the improvements to the present models, with back-up and spares to present Hesketh owners and in time introduce new models.|$|E

5000|$|Various {{crankshaft}} vibration problems [...] dogged {{the engine}} from the start, and to compound matters quick-fix balancing weights {{attached to the}} crankshafts developed the unfortunate habit of detaching themselves and flying off within the engines causing several catastrophic engine failures. Each side of the engine had {{to have its own}} water radiator, fuel metering unit, distributor and water pump, with a common <b>oil</b> <b>radiator.</b> The sheer complexity of the engine led to a truly terrible record of unreliability; engine, transmission and related problems caused 27 of the powerplant's 30 retirements from 40 entries. Jackie Stewart said of the engine [...] "it was unnecessarily large, used more fuel, carried more oil and needed more water - all of which added weight and diminished the vehicle's agility"The initial 32 valve engine produced 395 horsepower at 10,250 RPM, with a later 64 valve variant raising this to 420 hp at 10,500 RPM. While these constituted reasonable figures compared to the Ferrari, Honda and Weslake V12s and the Cosworth V8 of 1967, the H16 had an extremely narrow power band and was by some distance the heaviest engine on the grid, starting out weighing 555 lb when introduced in 1966 with the final lightweight version lowering this to 398 lb.|$|E
50|$|The Latécoère 490 first flew in March 1931, piloted by Louis Perriot. At {{the end of}} April 1931 it went to Villacoublay for {{official}} tests and comparison with its competitors. It {{was found to be}} fast, but judged lacking yaw stability. In October the 490 crashed on take off due to fuel starvation, though it was not badly damaged, and Latécoère took the opportunity to increase the fin area during the repairs. The new fin had the shape of an equilateral right angled triangle, and the now deeper rudder was slightly reduced in chord. At that point it was registered as F-AKDD before returning to Villacoublay to complete the tests early in 1932. It was the fastest machine in level flight, though the ANF Les Mureaux 113 climbed faster. The only criticisms were of the high take off and landing speeds. Encouraged, and very optimistic of orders, Latécoère built a second prototype numbered 491, very similar to the (revised) first prototype apart from some refinement to the shape of the engine cowling and spinner and a repositioning of the <b>oil</b> <b>radiator.</b> It was a little (5 km/h) faster than the 490 and was over 3% quicker in the climb. Despite its excellent performance in terms of the original specification and its ability to perform aerobatics like a fighter, the production order went to Les Mureaux {{on the basis of their}} machine's superior climb rate.|$|E
5000|$|Building {{the car is}} {{not obvious}} as the player must {{literally}} build the car from the ground up. At {{the start of the}} game, the car is entirely disassembled down to the last bolt, and the player must place each part in its correct location, including bolting them in one-by-one with the correct size spanner. While most parts only fit together correctly, it is entirely possible to assemble the car wrong, e.g. leave out an engine gasket or a bolt, which will in turn break the car. In addition to gasoline, the car also requires maintenance of additional fluids, including motor <b>oil,</b> <b>radiator</b> coolant, and hydraulic fluids for the brakes and clutch, which deplete in use and time. The player also has access to various other pre-assembled vehicles that only require refueling as maintenance, such as a cargo van capable of carrying large loads, a tractor and a vacuum truck for utilitarian uses, a two-stroke [...] "Jonnez ES" [...] moped (a Suzuki-based model which namesake is based on the term [...] "mopojonne", a moped teen who drinks energy drinks), and a small two-stroke launch at a nearby dock that allows for travel across the map's massive lake. Both the moped and the boat require two-stroke fuel. All of the player's road-going vehicles have the added ability to tow each other as well as salvageable car wrecks. High speed crashes will likely kill the player (though this also includes dying from hunger, dehydration, fatigue, or even killed by speeding drivers or hostile NPCs); the game optionally features permadeath (deletes save data when dying).|$|E
5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and <b>oil</b> <b>radiators</b> mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|R
5000|$|The other feature {{was a new}} cooling {{arrangement}} (aft positioned, single ducted {{water and}} <b>oil</b> <b>radiators</b> assembly) that reduced the cooling drag. It was later [...] discovered that, after lot of development, the cooling assembly {{could take advantage of}} the [...] "Meredith Effect", in which heated air exited the radiator with a slight amount of jet thrust. Because NAA lacked a suitable wind tunnel to test this feature, it used the GALCIT 10 ft wind tunnel at the California Institute of Technology. This led to some controversy over whether the Mustang's cooling system aerodynamics were developed by NAA's engineer Edgar Schmued or by Curtiss, although NAA had purchased the complete set of P-40 and XP-46 wind tunnel data and flight test reports for US$56,000. The NA-73X {{was also one of the}} first aircraft to have a fuselage lofted mathematically using conic sections; this resulted in smooth, low drag surfaces. To aid production, the airframe was divided into five main sections—forward, center, rear fuselage and two wing halves—all of which were fitted with wiring and piping before being joined.|$|R
