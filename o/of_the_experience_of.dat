The production starred Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Wraysford and Clémence Poésy as Isabelle Azaire, and {{was directed by}} Philip Martin, based on a screenplay by Abi Morgan. The historian Edward Madigan favourably compared the television adaptation to Steven Spielberg's War Horse as a successful evocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the World War I trenches.|$|E

25|$|The precise {{formulae}} {{of commercial}} perfumes are kept secret.

25|$|Tennessee's {{current state}} {{constitution}} was adopted in 1870. The state had two earlier constitutions.

This may be a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> Tennessee residents and other Southerners {{during the period of}} military control by Union (Northern) forces of the U.S. government after the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Heavy beef- or pork-based brown gravies {{are rarely}} used. To {{maintain}} {{the texture of}} the fries, the cheese curd and gravy are added immediately prior to serving the dish.

25|$|Benedict's {{idea was}} to build a model monastery for England, sharing his {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the Church in Europe. It was the first ecclesiastical building in Britain {{to be built in}} stone, and the use of glass was a novelty for many in 7th-century England. It eventually possessed what was a large library for the time – several hundred volumes – and it was here that Benedict's student Bede wrote his famous works. The library became world-famous and manuscripts that had been copied there became prized possessions throughout Europe, including especially the Codex Amiatinus, the earliest surviving manuscript of the complete Bible in the Latin Vulgate version.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Marie-José Malis toured, with a French-language version {{created with}} the help of Alain Badiou, {{explicitly}} asking whether there were any other possibility than the death of the Prince, and making discussion on the topic part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the play. The day before the staging in Arles, on May 14, 2009, she held a public discussion in the theatre, asking the public whether they had any suggestions as to how the play should end, as she herself was still undecided as to how to end the play. This fostering of discussion was itself an important element of the re-staging of the play. In the event, on that first night in Arles at least, the Prince and Natalia and a soldier friendly to their cause shoot {{their way out of the}} place in which the Prince is to be executed.|$|E
25|$|Kirkpatrick has {{developed}} this approach further {{in connection with}} computer, or video games. In his Aesthetic Theory and the Video Game {{he argues that the}} aesthetic appeal of games does not lie where we expect to find it – in sumptuous on-screen imagery – but in the physical sensations of gameplay. Because most video game analysis is informed by conventional media theory it tends to interpret games in terms of their ‘content’, or message, viewing the game as a sign system. This overlooks the most important part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> gameplay {{and the fact that we}} can often enjoy a game without ever thinking about what it, or the activity of playing it, ‘means’. In his second book on games, Computer Games and the Social Imaginary, Kirkpatrick presents a history of digital games that links their rise to the spread of neo-liberalism, a version of capitalism that fosters and relies upon a playful disposition on the part of its subjects.|$|E

25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows {{everything there is to know}} about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E
