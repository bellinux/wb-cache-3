30|$|We used panel {{data about}} the 26 Swiss cantons over the period 1980 – 2013. This setting is {{interesting}} since the individual cantonal legislation sets out or tolerates depreciations management operations especially designed to inflate expenses—with the so-called additional depreciation charges—and thus to worsen the financial performance {{in a way to}} specifically manage surpluses. Two different models of fiscal performance were estimated. The first model relies on a single equation with the balance (deficit or surplus) as the dependent variable. In the second model, the impact on the balance is indirectly considered since a set of two simultaneous equations is used: one with the operating revenues as the dependent variable and the <b>other</b> with <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> as the dependent variable. This simultaneous strategy allowed us to disentangle the respective effect of depreciations management on revenues and expenses and therefore provide more precise estimations compared to the single-equation model. The econometric results are based on several estimators and proved to be robust. They confirm that a positive and significant correlation exists between previous additional depreciation charges and the subsequent level of revenues, whereas a negative correlation exists with the level of subsequent expenses, with a similar order of magnitude. Consequently, depreciations management seems to produce a significant positive impact on the future balance.|$|R

40|$|Measuring and bench marking {{efficiency}} of bank branches {{has always been}} one of the key areas of concern of the top management of banks. It has also been on the research agenda of many scholars across many countries who have published their work in various academic journals. In Malaysia, a country which is one of key emerging nations in south-east Asia, there are many studies which dealt with measuring efficiency and productivity of banks using various operational research techniques including non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique. However, so far there is no published work which addressed the efficiency drivers at the branch level. Present paper aims to fill-in this gap in the literature. A two-stage approach has been adopted in analyzing the financial performance of 247 branches in 2014 spread over 14 states of the country of a large commercial banking group in Malaysia. In the first stage of analysis, the study has adopted DEA technique input oriented variable returns to scale formulation to estimate the technical {{efficiency of}} these branches. Four input parameters viz., Interest Expense, Personnel Expenses, Establishment <b>expenses</b> and <b>Other</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Expense</b> have been used as input parameters and Total Deposit, Total Loan, Amount of Wealth Management Business, Interest Income and Non-Interest Income have been used as output parameters. These parameters are reflective of the Inter mediation and Profit efficiency of the branches. In view of potential bias in the estimation process, the efficiency scores obtained in Stage- 1 of the analysis were bootstrap corrected using the formulation of Bogetoft & Otto before they were used as dependent variable in Stage- 2 of the analysis where Tobit Regression was carried-out to decipher the drivers of efficiency of bank branches. Four possible driver variables like log of total business (to assess the effect of ‘size’ on efficiency), log of Current and Savings account deposit (CASA) to Total deposits (to assess the impact of deposit mix on efficiency), log of Deposit per employee, log of Loans per employee and Income per employee (to assess the impact of Productivity of manpower on efficiency), Business per transaction (to assess the impact of Transaction efficiency) have been used in the Tobit regression. In addition, two environmental dummies viz., Per Capita State Gross Domestic Product and the level of Competition in garnering business in each state (measured in terms of percentage of branches in each state of the country) to reflect the impact of spatial parameters as possible drivers of efficiency have been used {{at this stage of the}} analysis.
