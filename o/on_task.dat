HMAS Melville arrived <b>on</b> <b>task</b> the morning of 15 December 2006, equipped with a Towed Pinger Locating Drone supplied from the United States Navy set about locating the downed Black Hawk. Melville detected the locator beacon during its first pass over the crash site and pinpointed its exact location in subsequent passes. The helicopter is sitting in around 2900 metres of water.|$|E
5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls <b>on</b> <b>task</b> during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E

25|$|Students {{with special}} needs {{struggle}} not only with writing and reading acquisition, but with social and emotional development and confidence about their writing. Dialogue journals as an individualized means of private, mutual communication can provide students with support in handling emotions, conflicts, and frustrations. For students with limited writing confidence and proficiency, the opportunity to express ideas and thoughts with teacher elaboration and modeling, and without correction, {{has been shown to}} increase their time <b>on</b> <b>task,</b> writing length, and writing quality. Using a single-subject baseline and intervention design, Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, and Young explored the value of dialogue journals in developing a more supportive student-teacher relationship with emotionally and behaviorally challenged middle school students.|$|E
25|$|Independent twin {{cylinders}}, (Two cylinders {{of about}} the same capacity mounted together {{on the back of}} the diver, each with its own regulator) are unquestionably a redundant gas supply configuration, as there is no possibility of flow from one to the other during the dive. Use of independent twins for bailout requires the diver to ensure that at all times during the dive both cylinders have sufficient gas remaining to ensure a safe ascent, including any decompression that may be required. This requirement is based on the possibility that either of the cylinders may become unusable without warning. This requirement means that the cylinders are usually breathed in turn, and changed before the pressure drops to the critical pressure for that stage of the dive. This system is economical on gas, and highly reliable when done correctly, but relatively heavy <b>on</b> <b>task</b> loading.|$|E
25|$|Anderson, Franks, and McShea {{have broken}} down insect tasks (and subtasks) into a {{hierarchical}} taxonomy; their focus is <b>on</b> <b>task</b> partitioning and its complexity implications. They classify tasks as individual, group, team, or partitioned; classification of a task {{depends on whether}} there are multiple vs. individual workers, whether there is division of labor, and whether subtasks are done concurrently or sequentially. Note that in their classification, in order for an action {{to be considered a}} task, it must contribute positively to inclusive fitness; if it must be combined with other actions to achieve that goal, it {{is considered to be a}} subtask. In their simple model, they award 1, 2, or 3 points to the different tasks and subtasks, depending on its above classification. Summing all tasks and subtasks point values down through all levels of nesting allows any task to be given a score that roughly ranks relative complexity of actions.

25|$|No. 13 Squadron was {{severely}} {{affected by the}} Japanese air raids on Darwin on 19 February 1942, with the squadron's headquarters, stores and spares being destroyed. Its aircraft were undamaged, having been moved inland to Daly Waters the previous week, or over Timor <b>on</b> <b>task.</b> In March, No. 13 Squadron moved to Hughes Airfield. As {{a result of the}} squadron's heavy losses during the defence of the NEI and the raids on Darwin, No. 13 Squadron generally only had one or two aircraft operational on most days in early 1942. Nevertheless, the squadron continued to fly operational attack and reconnaissance missions over the NEI, including an anti-shipping raid around Beco, in Timor, on 10 August 1942, which sunk one Japanese transport and damaged another in a mast-height attack that was launched in response from intelligence information provided by Australian commandos deployed on the island as part of Sparrow Force. No. 13 Squadron was later awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation for its operations over Timor during August and September 1942. No. 13 is one of only two RAAF squadrons to have received this honour; the other unit was No. 2 Squadron which received the award for its performance in the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|A new {{scientific}} understanding of collective intelligence defines it as a group's general {{ability to perform}} {{a wide range of}} tasks. Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence. Hereby, an individual's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure general cognitive ability indicated by the general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis. In the same vein as g serves to display between-individual performance differences on cognitive tasks, collective intelligence research aims to find a parallel intelligence factor for groups c factor' (also called 'collective intelligence factor' (CI)) displaying between-group differences <b>on</b> <b>task</b> performance. The collective intelligence score then is used to predict how this same group will perform on any other similar task in the future. Yet tasks, hereby, refer to mental or intellectual tasks performed by small groups even though the concept is hoped to be transferrable to other performances and any groups or crowds reaching from families to companies and even whole cities. Since individuals' g factor scores are highly correlated with full-scale IQ scores, which are in turn regarded as good estimates of g, this measurement of collective intelligence can also be seen as an intelligence indicator or quotient respectively for a group (Group-IQ) parallel to an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ) even though the score is not a quotient per se.|$|E

2500|$|In animals, the {{appearance}} of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (PGO waves) is related {{to that of the}} bioelectric outputs of rapid eye movements. These waves are most clearly seen during the transition from non-REM to REM sleep. Although these phasic waves are observed in many portions of the animal brain, they are most noticeable in the pons, lateral geniculate bodies, and the occipital cortex. Peigneux et al., 2006, reported that the lateral geniculate nucleus and occipital cortex display higher levels of activity during REM sleep than during wakefulness. This would add to the theory that activation in these areas is similar to PGO wave activation in animals. Pontine waves are commonly seen in animals as a mechanism to help facilitate learning and memory consolidation. [...] An improvement <b>on</b> <b>task</b> performance was seen to be a result of increased P waves between REM sleep sessions. In a study using post learning REM sleep deprivation the effects of stimulating the P wave generator (located in the pontine tegmentum) of a rat were observed. Two groups of rats underwent an avoidance learning task and then allowed a sleep period while another group of rats were deprived sleep. When comparing the two groups the sleep deprived rats showed a significant deficit in learning from having not undergone REM sleep. In another rat group, the P wave generator was stimulated using a carbachol injection and the rats then underwent a sleep deprivation stage. When these rats were again tested on their learning it was shown that activation of the P wave generator during sleep deprivation resulted in normal learning being achieved. This would point {{to the fact that the}} activation of P waves, even without REM sleep, was enough to enhance the memory processes that would not normally have happened.|$|E

We found that Patient 1, whose performance was asymmetrical on the OClock Test, performed poorly <b>on</b> <b>tasks</b> involving the mental generation, inspection and manipulation of objects but showed no deficit <b>on</b> <b>tasks</b> involving the mental generation, inspection and manipulation of environments. On the other hand, Patient 2, whose performance was asymmetrical on the Familiar Squares Description Test, performed poorly <b>on</b> <b>tasks</b> involving the mental generation, inspection and manipulation of environments, but not <b>on</b> <b>tasks</b> involving the mental generation, inspection and manipulation of objects.
