However, after resting in a secondary roost, these birds that failed joined other birds and flew off in a completely different direction. White wagtails and cattle egrets are two species proposed to demonstrate advertisement, with their coloring and pattern making them very noticeable and the two species often choosing open places for assemblages. There is also a large variety of finch species that have large, long-term roosting sites as well as large food searching areas.|$|E

Design: Prospective studies. Setting: Patients from gastro surgical, gastro medical and <b>observation</b> <b>wards</b> and relatives from the intensive care unit at Ullevål University Hospital. Methods: A questionnaire was developed by the authors and used with small modifications for the three groups. All together it was 176 patients, 68 relatives and 95 staff members answering. The patients were also given the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and 119 returned a second questionnaire four weeks later. The degree of satisfaction was measured on a five-point scale (0 - 4). Main results: The average satisfaction score was 3, 4 +/- 0, 08 SE for relatives and 3, 0 +/- 0, 04 for patients. The staff expected significantly lower degrees of satisfaction (2, 9 +/- 0, 08 for relatives and 2, 4 +/- 0, 05 for patients) (p< 0, 01).

40|$|Background: Pains {{are one of}} the commonest {{symptoms}} of illness in any branch of the ‎medicine. International Association for the Study of Pain defines pains as an unpleasant ‎sensations and emotions associated with the real and potentially possible tissue damage or are ‎described as such damage. In spite of different causes and mechanisms, pains always are ‎subjective sensations with multidimensional nature, formed by physical, emotional and cognitive ‎components. Post-operational pains represent a kind of acute pains and are related to extensive ‎lung tissue injuries and traumatic edemas of surgical wounds that turn into the sources of long ‎lasting pathological impulsations. There is a certain risk for intensive care unit patients to evaluate ‎their pains and it is based on utilization of pain assessment scales and pain management resulting ‎from the severity of patient’s condition. ‎Aim of the study: The aim of the work was to study the pain management in post-operational ‎period of intensive care unit patients. ‎Material and methods: Study utilizes quantitative research method. As an investigation tool was ‎chosen questionnaire. Study took place in intensive care and post-operative <b>observation</b> <b>wards</b> in ‎two university type clinics in Latvia. In research were involved 50 intensive care unit nurses and ‎‎ 50 postoperative period patients (74 % - female, 26 % – male) undergoing treatment in intensive ‎care and post-operative <b>observation</b> <b>wards.</b> ‎In the research participated nurses, 10 % of them were with lenght of service in health care 0 - 3 ‎years, 26 % - 4 - 15 years, 34 % - 16 - 29 years, but 24 % - 30 years. But, nurses particularly from ‎the intensive therapy ward and anesthesiology: 26 % of respondents had length of service 0 - 3 ‎years, 28 % - 4 - 15 years, 30 % - 16 - 29 years and 16 % over 30 years. Professional education of ‎respondents: secondary vocational education – 58 %, 1 st level higher professional education – ‎‎ 28 %, higher education – 14 %. 98 % of respondents were women, 2 % men. ‎P. Stradiņš Medical College of the University of Latvia Ethics commission has given the ‎permission to conduct the study. There are no risks associated with this study. Data is collected ‎only via survey and responses to the survey will be confidential. Participation is voluntary. ‎Statistical data analyses were performed using MS Office Excel program. For assessment of ‎statistical credibility was utilized x 2 test method (Chi-square method). ‎Results: One of the preoperational stage tasks is to provide patients with the information about ‎the post-operational stage pain assessment and possibility of pain relief therapies. Research data ‎present that information was rather sufficient and patients felt safe. Such answers were given by ‎the 32 % nurses and 72 % patients. 62 % patients consider that pains are normal sensation in post-‎operational stage and 14 % of nurses agree with them. ‎In pain management of intensive care patients 5 % of nurses utilize pain assessment scales (verbal ‎or visual analogue scale). 59 % of respondents like to question patients about their pains, whereas ‎‎ 25 % mention, that they assess pains by performing activation of patient or by changing their ‎position. 8 % of respondents use special equipment but did not inform patients about it. ‎Evaluating the mutual connection between the nurse’s length of service and visual, as well as ‎analogous pain scale, the acquired data point at mutual connection between the nurses with ‎working experience more than 15 years and the use of analogous and verbal pain evaluation scale ‎‎(p < 0. 02). ‎Conclusions: Efficiency of pain management in post-operational stage increases due to ‎psychological preparation and information of patients about the post-operational stage pains and ‎methods {{that can be used in}} assessment of pain intensity and possible pain relief therapies already ‎in pre-operational stage. In intensive care practice verbal and visual analogue scales are utilized ‎less while more common and for patients more understandable are nursing staff’s questions about ‎the pains they experience. Pain management is mostly based on World Health Organization’s ‎advised “analgesic ladder” guidelines, monitoring data and it’s analyze. ...|$|R

40|$|The ADHM {{constraints}} which implicitly specify instanton gauge field configurations are solved for {{the explicit}} general form of instantons with topological charge two and gauge group U(N). Instantons {{have proved to}} be an important phenomenon in Yang-Mills field theory ever since their discovery [1]. In recent years their use in supersymmetric gauge theories has been considerable. The method for constructing instantons of any given topological charge and for any gauge symmetry was established by Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin and Manin (ADHM) [2]. The ADHM construction of instantons uses techniques from algebraic geometry and the <b>observation</b> by <b>Ward</b> [3] that gauge fields can be considered as bundles (via a twistor space construction; see also [4, 5]). The ADHM method provides the most general instanton field configurations with the required topological charge.

40|$|IN EUROPEAN cities {{accidental}} poisoning {{has been}} a matter of increasing concern. The incidence has been steadily rising in recent years, and from figures supplied by the Medical Officer of Health for Belfast, accidental poisoning accounts for 15 per cent of all home accidents, and there {{has been a}}n increase of approximately 300 per cent in the years 1963 - 66. Perhaps of more importance is that accidental poisoning accounts for 43 per cent of paediatric hospital admissions (Dodge 1966), and it is the child of the toddler age group that is the victim {{in the vast majority of}} instances. Fortunately death due to such poisoning is rare. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accident reports that of 724 children accidentally poisoned in Northern Ireland, between 1960 - 63, only seven died. In this report the children admitted to the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children (R. B. H. S. C.) due to accidental poisoning are compared with children admitted to the <b>observation</b> <b>ward</b> of the University College Hospital (U. C. H.), Kingston, Jamaica.

40|$|Background: Delirium is {{a common}} {{complication}} for older people in hospital. Evidence suggests that delirium incidence in hospital may be reduced by about a third through a multi-component intervention targeted at known modifiable risk factors. We describe the research design and conceptual framework underpinning it that informed {{the development of a}} novel delirium prevention system of care for acute hospital wards. Particular focus of the study was on developing an implementation process aimed at embedding practice change within routine care delivery. Methods: We adopted a participatory action research approach involving staff, volunteers, and patient and carer representatives in three northern NHS Trusts in England. We employed Normalization Process Theory to explore knowledge and ward practices on delirium and delirium prevention. We established a Development Team in each Trust comprising senior and frontline staff from selected wards, and others with a potential role or interest in delirium prevention. Data collection included facilitated workshops, relevant documents/records, qualitative one-to-one interviews and focus groups with multiple stakeholders and <b>observation</b> of <b>ward</b> practices. We used grounded theory strategies in analysing and synthesising data. Results: Awareness of delirium was variable among staff with no attention on delirium prevention at any level; delirium prevention was typically neither understood nor perceived as meaningful. The busy, chaotic and challenging ward life rhythm focused primarily on diagnostics, clinical <b>observations</b> and treatment. <b>Ward</b> practices pertinent to delirium prevention were undertaken inconsistently. Staff welcomed the possibility of volunteers being engaged in delirium prevention work, but existing systems for volunteer support were viewed as a barrier. Our evolving conception of an integrated model of delirium prevention presented major implementation challenges flowing from minimal understanding of delirium prevention and securing engagement of volunteers alongside practice change. The resulting Prevention of Delirium (POD) Programme combines a multi-component delirium prevention and implementation process, incorporating systems and mechanisms to introduce and embed delirium prevention into routine ward practices. Conclusions: Although our substantive interest was in delirium prevention, the conceptual and methodological strategies pursued have implications for implementing and sustaining practice and service improvements more broadly...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study investigates {{the subject of}} Clinical Communication {{and how it is}} taught, learned and practised in one London Medical School and Hospital. It is informed by theoretical perspectives from workplace learning and in particular the theoretical construct of Recontextualisation. Five clinical communication teachers and five fourth year medical students took part in a series of semi structured interviews and <b>ward</b> <b>observations</b> over a period of four months. Teachers were interviewed about their teaching practice, they were asked to observe students in the clinical workplace and finally were asked to reflect upon whether these observations had informed their teaching practice. Students were interviewed about how they had learned and subsequently practised clinical communication in the clinical workplace. In total fifteen interviews and nine <b>ward</b> <b>observations</b> were carried out and nine reflective accounts were collected. Data from the interviews and observations were analysed using Responsive Interviewing Analysis. Results suggest that teachers wished to develop a more authentic and integrated teaching practice focused on the clinical workplace and wanted to go beyond the traditional notion of clinical communication as 'skills' based only. Students seemed able to apply the clinical communication skills they had been previously taught to the clinical workplace, but the patient centred philosophy underpinning these was lost and was also not reflected in the clinical workplace culture. Conceptually, the research shifts focus to the clinical workplace as the legitimate location for teaching and learning clinical communication and proposes a new and expanded way of understanding learning in this context. Significant implications for discussion are raised about the theoretical stance taken by the clinical communication community of practice {{and the way in which}} it understands and articulates fundamental beliefs about clinical communication.

DESIGN [...] Non-participant observer (MM) carried out regular periods of continuous comprehensive <b>observation</b> in <b>wards</b> where there were dying patients, recording {{the quantity and quality}} of care given. Observations were made in 1983. SETTING [...] 13 wards (six surgical, six medical, and one specialist unit) in four large teaching hospitals (bed capacity 504 - 796) in west of Scotland. SUBJECTS [...] 50 dying patients (29 female, 21 male) with mean age of 66 (range 40 - 89); 29 were dying from cancer and 21 from non-malignant disease. RESULTS [...] Final period of hospitalisation ranged from 6 hours to 24 weeks. More than half of all patients retained consciousness until shortly before death. Basic interventions to maintain patients' comfort were often not provided: oral hygiene was often poor, thirst remained unquenched, and little assistance was given to encourage eating. Contact between nurses and the dying patients was minimal; distancing and isolation of patients by most medical and nursing staff were evident; this isolation increased as death approached. CONCLUSIONS [...] Care of many of the dying patients observed in these hospitals was poor. We need to identify and implement practical steps to facilitate high quality care of the dying.
