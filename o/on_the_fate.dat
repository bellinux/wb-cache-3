5|$|There {{had already}} been public debate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of retired cricketers, and {{counties}} had improved pay and conditions for their professional players. For example, several counties, including Yorkshire, had instituted winter pay before Pullin's writings were published. However, former players did not benefit from these reforms.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, Anne {{sometimes}} exploited court factionalism {{for her own}} ends, {{in particular}} by supporting the enemies of the Earl of Mar. As a result, James did not trust her with secrets of state. Henry Howard, active in the highly secret diplomacy concerning the English succession, subtly reminded James that though Anne possessed every virtue, Eve was corrupted by the serpent. In practice, Anne was little interested in high politics unless they touched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of her children or friends.|$|E

His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of the tomb are hazy.|$|E

5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E
5|$|For his {{selection}} of sailing master, Hall first turned to Sidney O. Budington, then to George Tyson, who both initially declined due to prior whaling commitments. When those commitments fell through, Hall named Budington as sailing master and Tyson assistant navigator. Budington and Tyson had decades of experience between them captaining whaling vessels. In effect, the Polaris now had three captains, a fact which would weigh heavily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of the expedition. Further complicating matters, in 1863 Budington and Hall had quarrelled because Budington had denied permission for Hall {{to bring his}} Inuit guides, Joseph Ebierbing and Tookoolito, with him on an expedition {{at a time when}} they were ill and in Budington's care.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to England, Spurr {{worked as a}} journalist. In 1952 The London Daily Express sent him to Japan as its China and Far East correspondent, but he found that he had little time to resume his pursuit of information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of Yamato. In the mid-1970s Spurr returned to the Far East again, this time as {{a writer for the}} Far Eastern Economic Review. He began conducting interviews about Yamato with former Japanese naval commanders and survivors of the battleship's last mission. He also gained access to Japanese naval documents and records seized by the United States, plus US interrogation transcripts. For the American side of the story, he interviewed US naval commanders and personnel involved in the sinking of Yamato. Satisfied with what he had, Spurr began writing the book in the late 1970s, over 30 years after he first found out about the battleship.|$|E
5|$|As {{the force}} which {{was sent to}} {{reinforce}} and extract the reconnaissance platoon took further casualties, the total Croatian losses in the fighting and its immediate aftermath amounted to 20 killed. The fate of the reconnaissance platoon was not immediately known to Croatian authorities or relatives of the troops for months, adding fuel to an already volatile atmosphere {{in the city of}} Bjelovar, where the 105th Brigade was originally based. This tension erupted a week later, with the blockade and capture of the JNA barracks in Bjelovar. The JNA denied it had any knowledge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> of the Croatian soldiers. Details of their deaths became known in December 1991. Croatian forces recaptured Kusonje on 30 December in Operation Papuk-91, and their bodies were exhumed in January 1992. Along with the soldiers, the bodies of 23 civilians were also exhumed from a mass grave in the village of Rakov Potok. The soldiers were re-interred in Bjelovar on 5 February 1992. According to JNA intelligence reports, during the period from the exhumation to the re-interment, 32 Serb-owned houses in Bjelovar were demolished in retribution for the killings.|$|E
