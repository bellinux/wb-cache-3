5|$|In {{addition}} to his mythopoeic compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children. He wrote annual Christmas letters from Father Christmas for them, building {{up a series of}} short stories (later compiled and published as The Father Christmas Letters). Other stories included Mr. Bliss and Roverandom (for children), and Leaf by Niggle (part of Tree and Leaf), The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, On Fairy-Stories, Smith of Wootton Major and Farmer Giles <b>of</b> <b>Ham.</b> Roverandom and Smith of Wootton Major, like The Hobbit, borrowed ideas from his legendarium.|$|E
5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) {{had crossed}} the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} the river at this point had {{historically}} been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners <b>of</b> <b>Ham</b> House) and off limits to the public. Consequently, despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and consequently had little interest in promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1911, Sanh {{formed a}} secret society on the unverified pretense {{that he was}} a {{descendant}} <b>of</b> <b>Hàm</b> Nghi, the boy emperor of the 1880s. Led by Tôn Thất Thuyết and Phan Đình Phùng—two high-ranking mandarins—Hàm Nghi's Cần Vương movement battled against French colonisation in the decade leading up to 1895. Their objective was to expel the French authorities and establish Ham Nghi as the emperor of an independent Vietnam. This failed, and the French exiled the boy emperor to Algeria, replacing him with his brother Đồng Khánh. From then on, the French retained the monarchy of the Nguyễn Dynasty, exiling any emperors who rose against colonial rule and replacing them with more cooperative relatives. Sanh also claimed descent from the Lê Dynasty, which ruled Vietnam in the 15th and 16th centuries. He was a strong warrior, further presenting himself as the founder of China's Ming Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to {{customers}} at outrageous prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 expiration date on a package <b>of</b> <b>ham</b> and then lowers the price instead of throwing it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer {{returns to the}} Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the buzzing of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back into the hot dog cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E
5|$|The newest {{bridge across}} the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a {{pedestrian}} footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill {{has been the subject}} of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built <b>of</b> <b>Ham</b> stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{irradiation}} dose (0, 5 and 10 kGy) of vacuum-packaged Iberian dry-cured ham slices from pigs fed on concentrate (CON) or free-range reared (FRG) was studied {{in relation to}} TBA-RS, hexanal content and instrumental colour changes. TBA-RS values increased after irradiation in the two sets <b>of</b> <b>hams</b> and the increase was dose-dependent. FRG samples showed higher TBA-RS values than CON samples in all treatments, although differences {{in the rate of}} formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were different in the two types <b>of</b> <b>hams,</b> being higher in CON samples than in FRG ones. Irradiation <b>of</b> dry-cured <b>ham</b> slices significantly increased hexanal contents in both sets <b>of</b> <b>hams.</b> Irradiation produced statistically significant increases in vacuum-packed dry-cured ham slices lightness (L*-value), yellowness (b*-value) and chroma (C*-value). Irradiation resulted in significantly lower hue angle (h°) values and higher a*-values in both sets <b>of</b> <b>hams</b> indicating a redder colour of irradiated samples than non-irradiated, and these changes were greater in FRG samples than in CON samples. Differences in composition characteristics of raw material could {{play an important role in}} the irradiation-induced changes on colour and lipid oxidation <b>of</b> vacuum-packaged dry-cured <b>ham</b> slices. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|During the Atlantic slave trade, many Christians began {{teaching}} that black Africans were descendants of Canaan {{and used the}} Curse <b>of</b> <b>Ham</b> to justify enslaving black Africans. This belief was especially strong in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who canonized the Book of Abraham, which teaches that Canaan was a descendant of Cain, that his descendants settled Africa, {{and that they were}} cursed. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young both used the Curse <b>of</b> <b>Ham</b> to justify slavery in Mormonism.

40|$|A maximal partial <b>Hamming</b> packing <b>of</b> Zn 2 {{is defined}} by us {{to be a family}} S of {{mutually}} disjoint translates <b>of</b> <b>Hamming</b> codes <b>of</b> length n, such that any translate <b>of</b> any <b>Hamming</b> code <b>of</b> length n intersects {{at least one of the}} translates <b>of</b> <b>Hamming</b> codes in S. The number <b>of</b> translates <b>of</b> <b>Hamming</b> codes in S is the packing number, and a partial Hamming packing is strictly partial if the family S does not constitute a partition of Zn 2. A simple and useful condition describing when two translates <b>of</b> <b>Hamming</b> codes are disjunct or not disjunct is proved. This condition depends on the dual codes <b>of</b> the corresponding <b>Hamming</b> codes. Partly by using this condition, it is shown that the packing number p, for any maximal strictly partial <b>Hamming</b> packing <b>of</b> Zn 2, n = 2 m − 1, satisfies m+ 1 ≤ p ≤ n − 1. It is also proved that for any n equal to 2 m− 1,m ≥ 4, there exist maximal strictly partial <b>Hamming</b> packings <b>of</b> Zn 2 with packing numbers n− 10, n− 9, n− 8, [...] ., n− 1.
