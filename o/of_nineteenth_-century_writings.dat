In 1815, he {{organized}} a Negro school at Pisgah in Woodford County, Kentucky, and in 1816 he opened a school for African-American girls at Transylvania. His 1824 history {{of the church in}} Kentucky gave credit to the slaves Peter Durrett and his wife for founding and building up the First African Baptist Church of Lexington, Kentucky. Late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>-century</b> histories noted only white churches in Kentucky.|$|R
40|$|In the Polish {{literary}} criticism, racist {{discourse is}} strictly related to nationalist discourse and principally comes {{to play in}} the mainstream of interwar nationalist literary criticism. 1 This symptomatic configuration of race, nation and literature in the aesthetics of the West is conditioned - according to Anthony Appiah - by "the dual connection made in eighteenth and <b>nineteenth</b> <b>-century</b> thought between, on the one hand, race and nationality, and, on the other, nationality and literature. In short, the nation is the key middle term in the relations between the concept of race and the idea of literature"...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of applying variation {{to a given}} musical statement {{is one of the}} oldest of musical concepts. Before written notation was developed, the aural transmission of musical ideas naturally involved some degree of personal interpretation and variation. Documented history of variations as a musical form begins in the sixteenth century when the variation was established as an important musical procedure which increased the length and expression of a musical idea. In The Technique of Variation, Robert Nelson distinguishes seven categories of variation types developed from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries: 1. Renaissance and baroque variations on secular songs, dances, and arias. 2. Renaissance and baroque variations on plain songs and chorales. 3. The baroque basso ostinato variation. 4. The ornamental variation of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 5. The <b>nineteenth</b> <b>-century</b> character variation. 6. The <b>nineteenth</b> <b>-century</b> basso ostinato variation. 7. The free variation <b>of</b> the late <b>nineteenth</b> and early twentieth centuries. Variation remains an important process in music in the twentieth century [...] as a viable compositional technique, as a virtuosic showpiece for the concert stage, and as a basic element of jazz music, where ornamentation and variation are integral elements of improvisation. The theme and variations is particularly suited to the harp. Elements of the form, such as its sectional aspects, allow the exposition of many facets of the instrument in one composition. The harp is endowed with an outstanding capacity for tone color and interpretive effects. Certain techniques available only to the harp, such as the glissando, bisbigliando, and pedal slide can be incorporated into a theme and variation, presenting a vast range of interpretive possibilities. The following four variation works offer a comprehensive representation of Theme and Variations originally written for the harp: Tema con Variazioni, G. F. Handel, Variations on a Theme of Mozart, M. I. Glinka, Fantaisie pour Harpe sur un theme de Haydn, M. Grandjany, Variations sur un theme dans le Style Ancien, C. Salzedo. These works span a period from the early eighteenth century to the twentieth century, during which time many advancements were made in the construction of the harp and also in the development of harp technique. Themes and variations are extremely worthwhile for pedagogical purposes as well as for performance on the concert stage. Suitability of the form for the harp and the virtuosic nature of the works have made them an important part of the harp repertoire...|$|R
40|$|What do Disneyland, the Abu Ghraib U. S. {{military}} prison, the Mall ofAmerica, and the Y- 12 {{nuclear security}} complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee have in common? They have wildly different purposes, but {{they share a}} common characteristic as employers of private police. This answer-indicative of the prevalence and numbers of private police today-would have struck the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>-century</b> observer as evidence of a gross failure by the state. Yet that reaction, in turn, would seem odd to us. Vocal support of private police can be found among public police chiefs, lawmakers, and even President Bush. What kinds of criticisms were once leveled at private police by public officials? How did one attitude, deeply skeptical of private police, evolve into another that sees heavy reliance upon private policing as beneficial, or at least benign? Here, I take {{a fresh look at}} the dynamics of that change, and by doing so, restore to their proper place fundamental questions about the use of police who are privately financed and organized in a democratic society. These questions, and the violent history that midwived them, have been largely and undeservedly forgotten by the legal literature. Using this historical perspective, I examine the shifting status of private policing: first, by examining the history of public criticism directed against them; second, by recounting the partnership model that first gained a foothold in studies sponsored by the federal government in the 1970 s and 1980 s; and third, by questioning the meaning and intentions behind the idea of partnership advanced today...|$|R
