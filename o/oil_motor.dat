5000|$|In April 1916, Kahler, {{acting in}} his {{capacity}} as Secretary of the German-American Realty Company, solicited bids for the construction of its new six-story building in New Albany.

40|$|A time-resolved {{fluorescence}} (TRF) {{technique is}} presented for classifying <b>motor</b> <b>oils.</b> The system is constructed {{with a third}} harmonic Nd:YAG laser, a spectrometer, and an intensified charge coupled device (ICCD) camera. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) measurements are reported for several <b>motor</b> <b>oils.</b> It is found that steady-state fluorescence is insufficient to distinguish the <b>motor</b> <b>oil</b> samples. Then contour diagrams of TRF intensities (CDTRFIs) are acquired to serve as unique fingerprints to identify <b>motor</b> <b>oils</b> by using the distinct TRF of <b>motor</b> <b>oils.</b> CDTRFIs are preferable to steady-state fluorescence spectra for classifying different <b>motor</b> <b>oils,</b> making CDTRFIs a particularly choice {{for the development of}} fluorescence-based methods for the discrimination and characterization of <b>motor</b> <b>oils.</b> The two-dimensional fluorescence contour diagrams contain more information, not only the changing shapes of the LIF spectra but also the relative intensity.

5000|$|Following the {{oil price}} hikes of 1973/1974 and of 1979/1980 and the reduced supply from the Soviet Union, {{substantial}} investments {{were made in the}} oil processing industry. New, more sophisticated cracking plants were imported from the Federal Republic of Germany, from Japan, Austria, and Sweden, and were operated with modern distributed control systems originating in the FRG and the United States. Thereby, the fraction of so-called [...] "black products" [...] such as bitumen and heavy fuel oil was reduced to almost zero in favour of the [...] "white products" [...] such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and light heating <b>oil.</b> <b>Motor</b> fuels produced in Leuna II were also exported outside the socialist block to bankroll the new plants and to earn hard currency. For instance, Leuna gasoline was sold in West Berlin. Even the heaviest residues from oil processing were used as raw material for the production of syngas in the new low-pressure methanol plant. This hydrogenation-based technology required a large amount of hydrogen and was not profitable.|$|E
50|$|In cocurrent systems, the {{purge gas}} is 50 °F to 100 °F hotter than the soil {{discharge}} temperature. The {{result is that}} the purge gas exit temperature may range from 400 °F to 1,000 °F and cannot go directly to the baghouse. Purge gas first enters an afterburner to decontaminate the fine particles, then goes into a cooling unit prior to introduction into the baghouse. Because of the higher temperature and volume of the purge gas, the baghouse and all other downstream processing equipment must be larger than in a countercurrent system. Cocurrent systems do have several advantages over countercurrent systems: The afterburner is located upstream of the baghouse ensuring that fine particles are decontaminated; and because the heated purge gas is introduced at the same end of the drum as the feed soil, the soil is heated faster, resulting in a longer residence time. Higher temperatures and longer residence time mean that cocurrent systems can be used to treat soils contaminated with heavier petroleum products. Cocurrent systems are effective for light and heavy petroleum products including No. 6 fuel oil, crude <b>oil,</b> <b>motor</b> oil, and lubricating oil.|$|E

30|$|This work {{presents}} {{a simple and}} reliable method for directly generating polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers with secondary surface morphology (e.g., porous surfaces, rough surfaces, grooved surfaces, and interior porosity) by using single/binary solvent systems and relative humidity. We clarified the mechanisms responsible {{for the formation of}} these morphologies by systematically exploring the molecular interactions among the polymer, solvent(s), and water vapor. Our results proved that the formation of secondary surface morphology needed the presence of water vapor, a non-solvent of the polymer, at an appropriate level of relative humidity. The formation of secondary surface morphology was dependent on the speed of evaporation of the solvent(s) (ACE, DMF, and their mixtures), as well as the inter-diffusion and penetration of the non-solvent (water) and solvent(s). The results of N 2 physical adsorption-desorption isotherms showed that the macro-porous fibers (>[*] 300  nm) exhibited the highest specific surface area of 23.31 [*]±[*] 4.30  m 2 /g and pore volume of 0.0695 [*]±[*] 0.007  cm 3 /g, enabling the high oil absorption capacities of 50.58 [*]±[*] 5.47  g/g, 37.74 [*]±[*] 4.33  g/g, and 23.96 [*]±[*] 2.68  g/g for silicone <b>oil,</b> <b>motor</b> oil, and olive oil, respectively.

30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} an appropriate and reliable method {{for the formation}} of macro-porous, rough, and grooved PVDF nanofibers with internal pores. In order to understand the mechanism responsible {{for the formation of}} PVDF fibers, we tested three solvent systems (i.e., ACE, DMF, and ACE-DMF mixture) under different levels of relative humidity (5 %, 25 %, 45 %, and 65 %). We discovered that no phase separation occurred at the relative humidity of 5 % by using the previous solvents, resulting in the formation of smooth fibers with a solid interior. We found that the formation of macro-pores {{on the surface of the}} fibers with solid interior at the relative humidity of 25 % should be attributed to TIPS due to the high vapor pressure of ACE and nucleation mechanism, while the formation of macro-pores on the fibers surface with interior pores at the relative humidity of 45 % and 65 % should be ascribed to the coexistence of both TIPS and VIPS mechanisms. Additionally, we found that the low vapor pressure of DMF played a core role in the production of the rough fibers with pores in the interiors by VIPS. While wrinkle-based elongation mechanism played a key role in fabricating the grooved fibers with a porous interior structure. The macro-porous fibers (>[*] 300  nm) exhibited the highest performance of oil absorption of 50.58 [*]±[*] 5.47  g/g, 37.74 [*]±[*] 4.33  g/g, and 23.96 [*]±[*] 2.68  g/g for silicon <b>oil,</b> <b>motor</b> oil, and olive oil, respectively. Importantly, our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the formation of the macro-porous, rough, and grooved PVDF fibers with interior porosity can serve as an important reference for the fabrication of electrospun fibers by regulating the solvent and relative humidity.|$|E
