40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study the Weyl groups <b>of</b> reduced <b>extended</b> affine root systems, the root systems <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> affine Lie algebras. We start by {{describing}} the extended affine Weyl {{group as a}} semidirect product of a finite Weyl group and a Heisenberg-like normal subgroup. This provides a unique expression for the Weyl group elements (in terms of some naturally arisen transformations) which is crucial in the further study <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> affine Weyl groups. We use this to give a presentation, called a presentation by conjugation, for an important subclass <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> affine Weyl groups. Using a new notion, called the index which is an invariant <b>of</b> the <b>extended</b> affine root systems, we show {{that one of the}} important features of finite and affine root systems (related to Weyl group) holds for the class <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> affine root systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between several ideas about the mind and cognition.

It has recently been suggested that the hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> cognition is entailed by one of the foremost philosophical positions {{on the nature of the}} mind: functionalism, the thesis that mental states are defined by their functional relations rather than by their physical constituents. Furthermore, it has been claimed that functionalism entails a version <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> cognition which is sufficiently radical as to be obviously false. I survey the debate and propose several ways of avoiding this conclusion, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing the hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>extended</b> cognition from the related notion <b>of</b> the <b>extended</b> mind...|$|R

The line would be built with a higher standard than the Sørlandet Line and have a shorter route, allowing travel time from Stavanger to Oslo to be reduced to four to five hours. A detailed plan was made for the extension from Ålgård to the county border with Telemark. To consider the proposal, parliament established a committee in 1949 {{to look at the}} various proposals. After considering the impact and value of the various railways that had been proposed in the 1940s, it recommended not building the Inner Trunk Line, as the expansion had been christened.|$|E
5|$|For the Australians, {{the attack}} had been successful, {{as they had}} gained {{possession}} of the main Ottoman line, and after being halted at The Cup they began preparing to defend their gains. Hastily erecting sandbag barriers along the parapet, they settled down {{to wait for the}} first counterattack. As they did so, the brigade reserve—the 1st Battalion—was brought up. Due to crowding in the tunnels that had been used for the attack, the reinforcements were sent via the open ground that had been in front of the old Ottoman positions; despite being behind the recently captured position, the ground was still subjected to heavy Ottoman artillery and machine-gun fire, which was being poured down from positions in overwatch on the flanks. Nevertheless, in company lots, the 1st Battalion moved up and began filling in the gaps between the assault battalions, while engineers from the 2nd Field Company began the task <b>of</b> <b>extending</b> the tunnels from The Pimple towards the new Australian line.|$|E
