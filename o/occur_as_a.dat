5|$|Cerebellar atrophy {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other neurological disorders including Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, essential tremor, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and Niemann–Pick disease. Cerebellar atrophy can also <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of exposure to toxins including heavy metals or pharmaceutical or recreational drugs.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes: age, weight loss and the diet itself. First, younger women are likely to {{experience}} menstrual irregularities due to their diet. Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss. For example, anovulatory cycles can <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of adopting a restricted diet, as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise. Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.|$|E
5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles. These blockages are thought to <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the following four abnormal processes: a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin.|$|E

50|$|Fluorapatite <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mineral is {{the most}} common {{phosphate}} mineral. It <b>occurs</b> widely <b>as</b> <b>an</b> accessory mineral in igneous rocks and in calcium rich metamorphic rocks. It commonly <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> detrital or diagenic mineral in sedimentary rocks and is an essential component of phosphorite ore deposits. It <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> residual mineral in lateritic soils.|$|R
50|$|It <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{precipitate}} around volcanic fumaroles and solfataras. It also <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alteration in {{argillaceous sediments}} or coal beds which contain oxidizing sulfide minerals (pyrite or marcasite). Occurs associated with alunogen, pickeringite, epsomite, melanterite, gypsum and native sulfur.|$|R
5|$|Banksia brownii, {{commonly}} known as feather-leaved banksia or Brown's banksia, is a species of shrub that grows in southwest Western Australia. An attractive plant with fine feathery leaves and large red-brown flower spikes, it usually grows as an upright bush around two metres (7ft) high, but can also <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> small tree or a low spreading shrub. First collected in 1829 and published the following year, it is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, section Oncostylis, series Spicigerae. There are two genetically distinct forms.|$|E
5|$|Barium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBa and atomic number56. It {{is the fifth}} element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery alkaline earth metal. Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern history as baryta, does not <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mineral, but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for breast}} or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the {{treatment}} area. In {{the case of}} breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E
5000|$|Its native {{distribution}} is in southern and western Europe and North Africa. [...] It <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> scarce plant in south-west England, southern Wales, southern Ireland {{and in the}} Channel Islands. [...] It also <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> introduced species in Hawaii and Australia.|$|R
5000|$|The Tits group <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> maximal {{subgroup}} of the Fischer group Fi22. The groups 2F4(2) also <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> maximal {{subgroup of}} the Rudvalis group, {{as the point}} stabilizer of the rank-3 permutation action on 4060 = 1 + 1755 + 2304 points.|$|R
5000|$|Every profinite group <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Galois {{group of}} some Galois extension, however not every profinite group <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{absolute}} Galois group. For example, the Artin-Schreier theorem {{asserts that the}} only finite absolute Galois groups are the trivial one and the cyclic group of order 2.|$|R
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for skin}} cancer {{may result in}} a {{shedding}} of the outer layers of skin (desquamation) around the area of treatment in the weeks following therapy, which typically heals in 5–8 weeks. If the cancer is located on the lip, ulceration may <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of brachytherapy, but usually resolves after 4–6 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{given that}} the way {{airborne}} ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will <b>occur,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> function of distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence the ash properties have large variations.|$|E
5|$|SAH may <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{result of}} a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and cocaine use. Generally, the diagnosis can be determined by a CT scan of the head if done within six hours. Occasionally a lumbar puncture is also required. After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the underlying cause.|$|E

5|$|Seizures {{may also}} <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{consequence}} of other health problems; if they occur right around a specific cause, {{such as a}} stroke, head injury, toxic ingestion or metabolic problem, they are known as acute symptomatic seizures and are in the broader classification of seizure-related disorders rather than epilepsy itself.|$|E
5|$|Several {{complications}} can <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{result of}} SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, brain herniation, infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and most serious complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where {{pressure in the}} brain is severely decreased. This complication leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches.|$|E
5|$|Snake scales <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> motif {{regularly}} in computer action games. A snake scale was {{portrayed as a}} clue in the 1982 film Blade Runner.

5|$|The Whigs also {{maintained}} {{control of}} the General Assembly, and although Governor Powell was largely able to cooperate with his political opponents, some clashes did <b>occur.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of the 1850 census, the General Assembly re-apportioned the state into ten congressional districts. Powell vetoed the redistricting, noting that the districts had been gerrymandered to give the fading Whig party control over the state delegation. The legislature overrode the veto. The governor was successful, however, in vetoing legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} MS is unknown; however, it is {{believed}} to <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of some combination of genetic and environmental factors such as infectious agents. Theories try to combine the data into likely explanations, but none has proved definitive. While {{there are a number}} of environmental risk factors and although some are partly modifiable, further research is needed to determine whether their elimination can prevent MS.|$|E
5|$|The date of {{the draft}} was set for June 2–4, and would <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conference call to the Commissioner of Baseball's office in New York. Unlike the 1987 NFL Draft, which aired on ESPN, no network {{televised}} the MLB draft. High school seniors, college juniors and seniors, and anyone who had never played under a professional contract were considered eligible to be drafted. For the first time, junior college players would also {{be included in the}} June draft; in years past, teams would select junior college players in a separate draft.|$|E

50|$|Pulmonary {{radiation}} injury {{is a general}} term for damage to the lungs which <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of exposure to ionizing radiation. In general terms, such damage is divided into early inflammatory damage (radiation pneumonitis) and later complications of chronic scarring (radiation fibrosis). Pulmonary {{radiation injury}} most commonly <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of radiation therapy administered to treat cancer.|$|R
5|$|The most {{frequent}} symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, and muscle spasms. The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens. Severe symptoms usually <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. Abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of a density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E
5|$|Although Roanoke {{has never}} had {{international}} passenger service, in 2001, the Airport Commission was prepared to change the airport's name to Roanoke International Airport. This was the case as the U.S. Customs Service increased the radius covered by the inland port in Dublin to include Roanoke. This expansion allowed for the airport to add customs officials to accommodate both international travel and cargo to pass through Roanoke's facilities. However, the renaming did not <b>occur</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the economic downturn {{in the wake of}} the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2007, the prospect of changing the airport's name was again mentioned as a possibility by the Airport Commission.|$|E
