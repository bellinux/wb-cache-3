40|$|This thesis aims to {{familiarize}} {{the reader with}} the topic of life insurance, especially insurance taken out for more people. Its focus is empirical rather as combining the use of several actuarial and statistical methods through three statistical software and applications created in MS Excel using VBA. First, thesis is focused to multiple life insurance with intention to show reader the diversity of this interesting but rarely offered product in business world, especially through the application created {{for the purpose of}} this work. Sense of mentioned application lies in the fact it is able to calculate amount of the net premium for a user-selected type of insurance. Based on this outcome insurer can determine the net price corresponding to the chosen risk coverage (regardless of the amount of the costs associated with this type of insurance and required profitability). Age <b>of</b> <b>insured</b> <b>person</b> isn't usually part of calculation of premium for accident insurance. One of the aims of this study is to assess whether this parameter actually has or doesn't have any effect on the price of insurance. With help of SPSS and RStudio software relationship between age <b>of</b> <b>insured</b> <b>person</b> and amount of indemnification from daily compensation insurance has been researched. Based on the test of variable independence were detected dependencies of these variables where all of which used measure of association suggests a weak dependence amount of indemnification on the age of the insured. It surely worth insurer should consider different insurance rates for various ages <b>of</b> <b>insured</b> <b>person.</b> Following by examination whether the rate used to calculate premiums in case of hospitalization extra insurance corresponds to the actual risk coverage. It has been calculated the rate could be lower than currently used due to the loss experience of insurance for the past 9 years and the assumption of certain expenses and desired profit. It would be cheaper for insurance group contracts than it is today, when the insurer has done so. It could also attract new clientele. The last stated goal in this thesis is to create prognosis of the amount of indemnity paid for injuries covered by additional daily compensation insurance. Using the software EViews is analyzed this trend in the past 32 months first. Based on its outcome there is a future level forecast created for the next four years. These resulting values indicate the insurance indemnity for group contract will grow. Therefore, based on this analysis insurer should to conclude in the contract it would be appropriate to increase the premium of the insurance coverage. With these practical tasks the reader can get idea not only of problems solved in the scope of multiple life insurance and group insurance but also to become familiar with some statistical software used for analyzes carried out not only in the insurance industry. The conclusions of this thesis can also be beneficial for insurer who may adjust premium prices of analyzed insurances...|$|E

40|$|The Bachelor's work {{is called}} "Experience of the {{application}} of the Act on Health Insurance". The work describes targets and principles, concept and structure of the new Act on Health Insurance. A separate part deals with health insurance benefits, obligations <b>of</b> employers, <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> and social security authorities. For comparison the work presents the health insurance system before the new enforceable health insurance legal regulations came into force, i. e. before 31 st December 2008.

Discussions were held with 12 respondents from <b>insured</b> <b>persons,</b> employers and employees of social security authorities. The research shows that after the new Act on Health Insurance took effect the expenses for health insurance benefits have decreased and the <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> have been motivated to decrease their temporary sickness leave.

There are two fictitious families which want to use the benefits from six comparative health insurances. The both fictitious families will find out, which financial amount oh the benefit they could achieve, according to facts that are mentioned about them.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: In 2005, 52 % {{of workers}} in the Veneto Region {{reported}} one or more sick leave spells in the previous 12 months, compared with 16 % reported in the European Survey on Working Condition in 2000 (ESWC), although health conditions were better in the Veneto Region than in the ESWC. OBJECTIVES: Since the above findings were based on answers to a questionnaire, we used an objective source of information {{in order to further}} investigate the problem. METHODS: The source of data consisted of the sick leave records {{of workers in}} the Veneto Region, 1997 - 2002, which were obtained from the Italian National Social Security Institute (INPS). Four measurements were used: (1) frequency = number of sick-leave spells during the study period/number <b>of</b> <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> at risk for sickness absence during the study period; (2) cumulative incidence = number of persons with at least one new sick-leave spell during the study period/number <b>of</b> <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> at risk for sickness absence during the study period; (3) sick-leave rate = number of sick-leave days during the study period/number <b>of</b> <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> at risk for sickness absence during the study period; (4) duration of absence = number of sick-leave days in new sick leave spells during the study period/number of new sick-leave spells during the study period. Cumulative incidence could only be analyzed by statistical methods (binomial regression). RESULTS: The first three measurements gave overlapping results. The values were highest in industry, lowest in agriculture, and intermediate in crafts and services; they were highest in middle-aged subjects and lowest in younger and older individuals; the time trend increased up to 1999 and then decreased slowly. Cumulative incidence was 52. 0 %, 38. 0 %, 36. 4 % and 22. 9 %, in industry, services, crafts, and agriculture, respectively, and 42. 8 % in the total population. The results of binomial regression confirmed the above pattern, as well as an excess in women, in white collar workers, and in various occupational categories which, however, were probably not due to occupational exposures since in each occupational category the risk was always higher in industry than in crafts. By contrast, the sick-leave rate was higher in crafts and agriculture and lower in services and industry; it increased exponentially with age and did not show real differences between males and females. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of measurements influences the results; duration of absence could be used to detect areas of suspected work-related diseases, while cumulative incidence might be more helpful to detect areas of suspected absenteeism/presenteeism...|$|R
