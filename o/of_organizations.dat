40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{debate on}} the social ontological foundations <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> does not, for methodological reasons, sufficiently {{get a grip on}} the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>organization.</b> The original determinacy <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> remains presupposed.

Indeed, it is a challenge to construct the idea <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> from the perspective of German idealism: the perspective of reason, and with that, of freedom.

40|$|This Introduction {{argues for}} the {{importance}} of theology for the study <b>of</b> <b>organization.</b> It also draws the contours of a possible 'theology of organization'. Theology <b>of</b> <b>organization,</b> as we use it here, does not refer to a study <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> that is rooted in faith, nor does it refer to a study of religious practices in <b>organizations.</b> Instead, theology <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> recognizes that {{the way we think about}} and act in organizations is profoundly structured by theological concepts. In this editorial to the special issue we have three aims: to outline what theology <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> is, to show how it builds upon Carl Schmitt's 'political theology' and Giorgio Agamben's 'economic theology' and finally to propose three different forms that theology <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> can take. These forms <b>of</b> theology <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> respectively (1) analyse organizational concepts as secularized theological concepts, (2) show how theological concepts have survived unaltered in organizational contexts and (3) show how theological concepts have been corrupted or lost their original meaning when deployed in organizational contexts. In the final section of this editorial, we introduce the five contributions to this issue and indicate how they connect to the three forms <b>of</b> theology <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> that we have proposed...|$|R
50|$|According to practopoietic theory, {{creation}} of adaptive behavior involves special, poietic interactions among different levels <b>of</b> system <b>organization.</b> These interactions are {{described on the}} basis of cybernetic theory in particular, good regulator theorem. In practopoietic systems, lower levels <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> determine the properties of higher levels <b>of</b> <b>organization,</b> but not the other way around. This ensures that lower levels <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> (e.g., genes) always possess cybernetically more general knowledge than the higher levels <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> - knowledge at a higher level being a special case of the knowledge at the lower level. At the highest level <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> lies the overt behavior. Cognitive operations lay in the middle parts of that hierarchy, above genes and below behavior. For behavior to be adaptive, at least three adaptive traverses are needed.|$|R
