Secondly, this Colour may be awarded to younger students as recognition of their success at what might be considered to be the developmental stage of their school career.|$|E

Kowalewicz stated, in an interview, that the first three albums would form a trilogy and that the new album would not be named Billy Talent IV.|$|E

500|$|Almendra was {{released}} on November 29, 1969 on Vik, a subsidiary of RCA Records.

500|$|As {{a product}} of the Conservatory, Tchaikovsky was viewed rather negligently if not haughtily by our circle, and, owing to his being away from St. Petersburg, {{personal}} acquaintanceship was impossible.... proved to be a pleasing and sympathetic man to talk with, one who knew how to be simple of manner and always speak with evident sincerity and heartiness. The evening <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> meeting [...] played for us, at Balakirev's request, the first movement of his Symphony in G minor it proved quite to our liking; and our former opinion of him changed and gave way to a more sympathetic one, although Tchaikovsky's Conservatory training still constituted a considerable barrier between him and us.|$|E

500|$|Battlefield Earth {{swept the}} 2000 Golden Raspberry Awards and {{received}} seven [...] "Razzies", including Worst Movie of the Year, Worst Actor (Travolta), Worst Supporting Actor (Pepper), Worst Supporting Actress (Preston), Worst Director (Christian), Worst Screenplay (Mandell and Shapiro) and Worst Screen Couple (Travolta and [...] "anyone sharing {{the screen with}} him").

However, examination by the set-lighting crew revealed the lightbulbs used were internally modernized, having been designed to hold T-8 bulbs measuring two feet each. [...] "Getting more than 800 2-foot color-corrected T-8 tubes became a major issue, and none of the regular suppliers had enough in stock," [...] recalled Mike Ambrose, the gaffer for the production team in Los Angeles.

500|$|For the {{constitution}} to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for {{the addition of a}} bill of rights. Several state conventions specifically proposed a provision against the quartering of troops in private homes. At the 1788 Virginia Ratifying Convention, Patrick Henry stated, [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> complaints, under the former government, was the quartering of troops among us. [...] This was one of the principal reasons for dissolving the connection with Great Britain. [...] Here we may have troops in time of peace. [...] They may be billeted in any manner — to tyrannize, oppress, and crush us." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics on Primary Colours often {{focus on}} mundane topics {{pertaining}} {{to the lives of}} ordinary people, including watching TV and eating ice cream, while its music often features shredding power chords. According to The Washington Posts Chris Richards, the music represents a new, gentler type of punk rock in the vein of No Age and Abe Vigoda. Richards also wrote that Suppression [...] " [...] these upbeat rock tunes from becoming too saccharine with a nervy delivery that's part David Byrne, part Iggy Pop". A similar sentiment was expressed by David Bevan of Pitchfork Media, who wrote [...] "there's a softening of edges taking place throughout, a band testing limits after having already refined them". He also described it as an [...] "artfully polished extension of its predecessor". Current described the album as [...] "a bit more '82ish than the '76ish sound <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> LP, slightly less frantic and maybe a bit more palatable".|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Gray {{spoke with}} TV Guide (Canada) and recounted: [...] "At first, {{they had no}} idea what to do with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy were the goody-goodies. Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes were parental. Hagman was the villain. And I was the redhead on the couch." [...] However, Gray was {{upgraded}} to a starring role once Dallas was picked up for a full season following the five episode arc miniseries. The actress later stated that on-screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during the start of the series, and called it [...] "terrible", though he denied it. She joked, [...] "I'm sorry. He said it to me loud and clear, and made me feel terrible, and it started one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> fights on the way back [...] I swear to you—he devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I could have killed him!" ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1963, Waters and Mason {{moved into}} a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens near Crouch End in London, owned by Mike Leonard, a {{part-time}} tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the Regent Street Polytechnic. Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist Bob Klose moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters' switch to bass. Sigma6 went through several names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five, before settling on the Tea Set. In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, guitarist Syd Barrett joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens. Barrett, two years younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the Camberwell College of Arts. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house. Mason said about Barrett: [...] "In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> encounter {{is the fact that}} he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me." ...|$|E
