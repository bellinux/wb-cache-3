40|$|In this paper, a {{cost-effective}} {{implementation of a}} programmable filterbank front-end for speech recognition is presented. The objective has been to design a real-time bandpass filtering system with a filterbank of 16 filters, with analog audio input and analog output. The output consists of 16 analog signals, which are the envelopes of the filter outputs of the audio signal. These analog signals are then led to an analog <b>neural</b> <b>computer,</b> which performs the feature-based recognition task. One of the main objectives has been to allow the user to easily change the filter specifications without affecting the remaining system, thus a software implementation of the filterbank was preferred. In addition, the <b>neural</b> <b>computer</b> requires analog input. Therefore, we implemented the filterbank on a PC, with the input A/D and the output D/A performed by the PC stereo soundcard. Since multiple analog outputs are necessary for the <b>neural</b> <b>computer</b> (one for each filter), it then follows that the soundcard output should contain the multiplexed 16 filter outputs, while a hardware module is needed for demultiplexing the soundcard output into the final 16 analog signals...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{potential}} speed of an <b>optical</b> <b>neural</b> network {{that uses the}} longitudinal cavity modes of an external-cavity laser diode as neurons. For this purpose, we used a laser diode coupled to two external cavities, each corresponding to one longitudinal cavity mode. The process of longitudinal mode switching is investigated for the case of intracavity optical modulation. In this experiment, the feedback for the mode in one cavity is modulated, {{and the length of}} the other cavity can be controlled. Three limitations are imposed on the switching speed. A number of external-cavity round trips are needed to switch from one mode to the other. It is observed that, depending on the amount of optical feedback in both cavities, between 7 and 21 round trips are needed. When the experimental results for varying cavity length are extrapolated to zero cavity length, a residual delay of a few nanoseconds remains. It is believed that this delay is due to a change in carrier density, needed to switch from one mode to another. Modified rate equations are used to model our experiments. The results of numerical simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results and predict the residual delay. The model also predicts a turn-on delay that is related to relaxation oscillations and imposes a third limitation on the operation speed of our <b>optical</b> <b>neural</b> network.
