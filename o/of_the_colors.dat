5|$|The {{meanings}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> {{are interpreted}} {{in many different}} ways. For example, red stands for {{the blood of the}} 1.5 million Armenians killed in the Armenian Genocide, blue is for the Armenian pure sky, and orange represents the country's courage.|$|E
5|$|Other {{examples}} of flags {{that could be}} confused with the Polish one include the civil flags of the following regions: Cantabria, Spain; Kranj, Slovenia; Thuringia, Germany; Upper Austria and Tyrol, Austria; as well the city of Honda, Colombia. Furthermore, the Dutch city of Maastricht used a similar design between 1938–1994 but reinstitated its old flag to avoid confusion. There are currently two independent states – Indonesia and Monaco – whose national flags are horizontal bicolors of red and white, reversing the Polish flag. The Monaco and Indonesia flags differ in proportions and shades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> (see Flag of Indonesia and Flag of Monaco).|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the design}} and {{significance}} of maritime flags flying on ships in Tunis are unknown. However, various sources {{have been able to}} distinguish certain similarities among the flags: they were designed with a crescent-oriented shape in the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> blue, green, red, and white. Thereafter, and until the early 19th century, the flag was composed of horizontal blue, red and green stripes, identifying the Ottoman regency in Tunis. This kind of flag with multiple bands and irregular contours floated on top of ships all along the coast of North Africa; similar flags with different colors and arrangements were also used on the continent.|$|E

5|$|Early in the {{development}} of Dick Tracy, Beatty decided to make the film using a palette limited to just seven colors, primarily red, green, blue and yellow—to evoke the film's comic strip origins; furthermore each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> was to be exactly the same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked with on his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.|$|E
5|$|White-and-red flags {{were first}} waved during a {{patriotic}} demonstration on May 3, 1916 in Warsaw. The organizing committee advised participants about the correct alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colors,</b> that {{is with the}} white stripe above the red one. Still, many demonstrators brought flags with the red stripe on top. On August 1, 1919, almost a year after Poland regained independence in November 1918, the Sejm officially introduced a white-and-red bicolor as the Polish national flag. In order to avoid confusion with the white-and-red maritime signal flag used internationally by harbor pilots and tugboats, the same act of Sejm introduced {{a variant of the}} flag with the coat of arms in the white stripe for use as a civil ensign and by Polish diplomats and consuls abroad.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{modulation}} technique <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> subcarrier is quadrature amplitude modulation (QUAM [...] ) both in PAL and NTSC systems. <b>The</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> signal represents <b>the</b> saturation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> and <b>the</b> phase lag <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> signal {{with respect to}} a certain reference which is called colorburst represents the hue; i.e., each phase lag is assigned for a different color hue. So, in order to reproduce <b>the</b> original <b>color</b> in <b>the</b> receiver, the phase difference between the colorburst and <b>the</b> <b>color</b> signal must be kept constant throughout the broadcasting.|$|R
