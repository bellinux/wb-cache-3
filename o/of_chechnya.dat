25|$|He was {{credited}} by many with the Chechen {{victory in the}} First Chechen War, which allowed {{for the establishment of}} the de facto independent Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Maskhadov was elected President <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> in January 1997. Following the start of the Second Chechen War in August 1999, he returned to leading the guerrilla resistance against the Russian army. He was killed in Tolstoy-Yurt, a village in northern Chechnya, in March 2005.|$|E

25|$|Palazzi {{noted that}} {{although}} in present days support for Israel among Muslims is a minority orientation, {{there are some}} exceptions, such as former President of Indonesia and leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, Shaykh Abdurrahman Wahid, and the Grand Mufti of the Russian Federation, Shaykh Talgat Tajuddin, the Mufti of European Russia, Shaykh Salman Farid, who wrote a fatwa against the intifadah. According to Palazzi, more examples for Pro-Israeli Muslim clerics are the Muftis <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.|$|E
25|$|Polygyny was legalized and {{documented}} in unrecognised Chechen Republic of Ichkeria but Russian authorities had annulled these polygynous marriages after they regained control over territory of Ichkeria. Later Ramzan Kadyrov, President of the Chechen Republic, has been quoted on radio {{as saying that}} the depopulation <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> by war justifies legalizing polygamy. Kadyrov has been supported by Nafigallah Ashirov, the Chairman of the Council of Grand Muftis of Russia, who has said that polygamy is already widespread among Muslim communities of the country.|$|E
25|$|In early 1997 he was {{appointed}} vice-Prime Minister <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya</b> by Maskhadov. In January 1998 he became the acting head of the Chechen government for a six-month term, after which he resigned. Basayev's appointment was symbolic because it {{took place on the}} eve of the celebrations of the 200th anniversary of his renowned namesake. Basayev subsequently reduced the government's administrative departments and abolished several ministries. However, the collection of taxes and the Chechen National Bank's reserves shrunk, and theft of petroleum products increased seriously.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{casualties}} {{of this conflict}} are difficult to ascertain {{due to lack of}} records and the long time period of the clashes. One source indicates that at least 60,000 Chechens were killed in the First and Second Chechen War in the 1990s and 2000s alone. [...] High estimates of these two wars range of up to 150,000 or 160,000 killed, as put by Taus Djabrailov, the head <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya's</b> interim parliament.|$|R
50|$|June 22 - Four federal {{officers}} and two civilians were injured, when militants fired {{an apartment building}} {{in the city of}} Tyrnyauz, Kabardino-Balkaria.

50|$|Until 2010, Emir Khamzat was {{a little-known}} field commander. In {{the summer of}} that year, there was a dispute between Dokka Umarov and several commanders of the Chechen wing of the Caucasus Emirate. They were Tarkhan Gaziyev, Muhannad, Aslambek Vadalov and Khuseyn Gakayev. That led to Byutukayev's rapid {{promotion}} to the commander <b>of</b> <b>Chechnya's</b> Southwestern Front. He also succeeded the slain Said Buryatsky {{as leader of the}} Caucasus Emirate's unit of suicide bombers, the Riyad-us Saliheen.|$|R
