5|$|Although Herrerasaurus {{shared the}} body {{shape of the}} large {{carnivorous}} dinosaurs, it lived {{during a time when}} dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the slightly later Los Colorados Formation consisted mainly of a variety of crurotarsal archosaurs and synapsids. In the Ischigualasto Formation, dinosaurs constituted only about 6% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fossils, {{but by the end of}} the Triassic Period, dinosaurs were becoming the dominant large land animals, and the other archosaurs and synapsids declined in variety and number.|$|E
5|$|Ants first arose {{during the}} mid-Cretaceous, more than 100 million years ago, {{associated}} {{with the rise of}} flowering plants and an increase in forest ground litter. The earliest known ants evolved from a lineage within the aculeate wasps, and a recent study suggests that they are a sister group of Apoidea. During the Cretaceous ants were confined to the northern Laurasian supercontinent, with only a few widespread primitive species. By the middle Eocene, around 50 million years ago, ants had diversified and become ecologically dominant as predators and scavengers. Ant species are less than 2% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insect species but make up one third of the insect biomass.|$|E
