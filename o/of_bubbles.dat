The effects <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> size, rheological properties of shear-thinning fluids, and orifice structure arrangements on multiple bubbles interaction and coalescence were analyzed, and the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> coalescence and breakup were fully discussed and elucidated. The variation <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> rising velocity during coalescence process and freely rising processes for different orifice arrangements was also deeply investigated. The critical initial horizontal intervals for coalescence <b>of</b> multiple horizontal <b>bubbles</b> with various orifice arrangements were attained by simulation, which {{could serve as}} the critical criterion <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> coalescence or noncoalescence.

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of decompression sickness {{are known to}} be caused by damage resulting from the formation and growth <b>of</b> <b>bubbles</b> of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other emboli consequential to bubble formation and tissue damage. The precise mechanisms of bubble formation and the damage they cause {{has been the subject of}} medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested. Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered to be acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. In the paper it has been analysed the influence of: nozzle diameter and height of liquid over the nozzle on the chaotic character <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> departures. The analysis has been conducted based on the numerical model <b>of</b> chaotic <b>bubble</b> departures proposed in the paper [3]. The following forces in the model <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> growth have been considered: drag force, Boussinesq–Basset force, added-mass forces and {{the changes in the}} gas momentum. The influence of Boussinesq–Basset and added-mass forces on the frequency <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> departures has been discussed. It has been shown that the intensity of appearance <b>of</b> the chaotic <b>bubble</b> departures is caused by increase in the nozzle diameter and height of liquid over the nozzle. The increase of the nozzle diameter causes the decrease <b>of</b> the <b>bubble</b> departure frequency and the depth of liquid penetration into the nozzle. It has also been shown that the increase of liquid height over the nozzle outlet modify the character <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> departure. The increase of liquid height over the nozzle modify the frequency <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> departure and depth of liquid penetration into the nozzle. Both forces: Boussinesq–Basset and added mass promote the bubble departures and decrease the depth of liquid penetration into the nozzle. The added mass force is greater than the Boussinesq–Basset force. dc 201...|$|R
