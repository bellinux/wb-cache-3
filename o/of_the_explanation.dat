5|$|The {{genetic code}} {{is a key}} part of the story of life. The main {{hypothesis}} for life's origin is the RNA world hypothesis. Any model for the emergence of genetic code is intimately related to a model of the transfer from ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> of its patterns.|$|E
5|$|In total, Crawford {{played in}} eight games in 1919, scoring 488 runs and taking 20 wickets. Wisden commented that his batting {{was as good}} as it had ever been, but his bowling lacked spin and accuracy. He played only four more times in {{first-class}} cricket. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> was that he joined Dunlop Rubber as a manager at one of its mills in Rochdale. He played as an amateur for Rochdale Cricket Club in 1920, but by 1921 he had left the club—the Manchester Guardian speculated that he had returned to Surrey. He returned to live with his family in Merton Park, and played for the local cricket club. Of his first-class matches, one was for Surrey against the Australian touring team of 1921 and the others were for teams representing the Gentlemen. In his entire first-class career, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an average of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at 20.66.|$|E

5|$|The Renaissance left {{a legacy}} across {{intellectual}} fields including poetry, historical writing and architecture, which {{continued into the}} seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. A growing number of Scottish scholars emerged who had an increasing confidence in their own literature. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> for the sudden flowering of the Scottish Enlightenment, is that the country already had a history of achievements in philosophy, poetry, music, mathematics and architecture and was in close touch with intellectual trends in the rest of Europe. From this period Scotland would make major contributions in the fields of medicine, law, philosophy, geology and history. Among these ideas the limitation of royal sovereignty over the people remained present in Scottish intellectual life and resurfaced to contribute to the major debates of the eighteenth century.|$|E

25|$|Parasitism {{has been}} {{suggested}} as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> {{of the evolution of}} secondary sex characteristics in breeding male animals, such as the plumage of peacocks and the manes of male lions. The argument is that female hosts select males for breeding based on such characteristics because they act as honest signals of costly handicaps. A possible mechanism for this, suggested by Ivar Folstad and Andrew Karter, is that the male hormone testosterone encourages the growth of secondary sex characteristics such as manes, but at the price of reducing an animal's immune defences.|$|E
25|$|To this day, {{the death}} toll has been in dispute. About 5,000 bodies were {{recovered}} from the debris and represent the total of legally certified deaths but does not include those who were missing and never recovered. Reports have numbered the dead anywhere from 5,000 to 30,000 (claimed {{by a number of}} citizens' groups) to 45,000 claimed by the National Seismological Service. However, the most commonly cited figures are around 10,000. While high as an absolute number, it compares to other earthquakes of similar strength in Asia and other parts of Latin America where death tolls have run between 66,000 and 242,000 for earthquakes of magnitude 7.8 or above. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> for that was the hour in which the earthquake struck, approximately 7:20am, when people were awake but not in the many schools and office buildings that were severely damaged.|$|E
25|$|Freud {{began his}} study of {{medicine}} at the University of Vienna in 1873. He took almost nine years to complete his studies, due to his interest in neurophysiological research, specifically investigation of the sexual anatomy of eels and the physiology of the fish nervous system, and because of his interest in studying philosophy with Franz Brentano. He entered private practice in neurology for financial reasons, receiving his M.D. degree in 1881 at the age of 25. Amongst his principal concerns in the 1880s was the anatomy of the brain, specifically the medulla oblongata. He intervened in the important debates about aphasia with his monograph of 1891, Zur Auffassung der Aphasien, in which he coined the term agnosia and counselled against a too locationist view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> of neurological deficits. Like his contemporary Eugen Bleuler, he emphasized brain function rather than brain structure.|$|E

25|$|Sverdrup {{enrolled}} as a student, {{and graduated}} with the cand.theol. degree in 1869. Inspired by Grundtvigianism, he founded a {{folk high school}} in Sogndal in 1871. Serving as savings bank director as well as mayor of Sogndal, he was the manager of Sogndal folk high school from its foundation, but left that post to his brother Hersleb Sverdrup after a few years, before Henrik Mohn Dahl took over. In 1878 Jakob Sverdrup left Sogndal to become vicar in Leikanger. As a theologian, Sverdrup was a pietist, and sided with the laity movement, proposing that lay priests be given the right to preach. Together with Ole Vollan he had started the magazine Ny Luthersk Kirketidende in 1877, an organ which spoke against the Conservative High Church Lutheranism of the time. Sverdrup also published several pamphlets during his life, and in 1897 he published Forklaring over Luthers lille katekisme af J. R. Sverdrup, a revision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> of Luther's Small Catechism originally written by his father.|$|E

500|$|Jardine missed {{most of the}} 1922 season {{owing to}} a serious knee injury; he played only four matches {{at a time when}} he was {{expected}} to make a big impression. He missed the Cambridge match and was unable to play for Surrey that season. Even so, in 1922 he was selected by The Isis as one of its men of the year. After some problems with his troublesome knee, Jardine returned to cricket by May of the 1923 season. He was not given the Oxford captaincy in his final year, which has led to later speculation that his manner and unfriendliness was held against him. However, his injury and the availability of other deserving candidates may have provided some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation.</b> Jardine gradually found his batting form, and contributed to Oxford's only win over Cambridge in the decade. During one innings of another match, he received criticism for using his pads to stop the ball from hitting the wickets: this was within the laws of the game but was controversial and seen by critics to be against the spirit of the game. Christopher Douglas traces Jardine's hostility towards the press and critics to this incident. He also received criticism for his slow batting for Oxford, again being singled out due to his known ability to play attacking shots. Partly this was because Jardine held a responsible position, the team often reliant on his success. The complaints were a manifestation of wider criticism of young amateur batting at the time for its lack of enterprise, as commentators began to hark back to the [...] "golden age" [...] before the war. Jardine left Oxford in 1923 having scored a total of 1,381 runs and was awarded a fourth class degree in modern history.|$|E

The SABER tool is being developed using an explanation-based reasoning approach to assist in making such decisions. Explanation-based reasoning is modeled after an explanation-based decision making process through which people are believed to perform some decision making tasks. SABER constructs and evaluates alternative explanations to account for input data that may be incomplete or inconsistent. <b>The</b> <b>explanations</b> are evaluated according to three criteria: simplicity, completeness, and significance. Users are given all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanations</b> in ranked order. SABER is designed to allow users to easily change the data and to modify <b>the</b> rankings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanations.</b> This emphasis on modifiability effectively enables users to train SABER...|$|R

The first law denotes the law of diminishing marginal utility, the second law denotes the law of increasing total utility." ...|$|E
2500|$|The pimp–prostitute {{relationship}} is widely {{understood to be}} abusive and possessive, with the pimp/madam using techniques such as psychological intimidation, manipulation, starvation, rape and/or gang rape, beating, confinement, threats of violence toward the victim's family, forced drug use and the shame from these acts. Marcus et al., however, suggested that these assumptions about abusive relationships represent stereotyped oppression narratives that may only represent {{a small percentage of}} the relationships between pimps and sexworkers. Pimps can be arrested and charged with pandering and are legally known as procurers. This, combined with the tendency to identify pimping with African American masculinity, may provide some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> for why 62% of all [...] "confirmed" [...] human traffickers in the United States are African American men. In fact, it has recently been argued that some of the extreme examples of violence cited in the article below come primarily from such stereotyping supported by Hollywood screenwriters, selective and decontextualized trial transcripts, and studies that have only interviewed parties to sex commerce in institutions of rescue, prosecution, and punishment, rather than engaging rigorous study in situ.|$|E
2500|$|Shockley, {{angered by}} not being {{included}} on the patent applications, secretly continued his own work to build {{a different sort of}} transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts; he expected this kind of design {{would be more likely to}} be commercially viable. The point contact transistor, he believed, would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture. Shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority carrier injection. On February 13, 1948 another team member, John N. Shive, built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium, proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought. Shive's invention sparked Shockley's invention of the junction transistor. A few months later he invented an entirely new, considerably more robust, type of transistor with a layer or 'sandwich' structure. This structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s, and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor. Shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were [...] "mixture of cooperation and competition." [...] He also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his [...] "hand was forced" [...] by Shive's 1948 advance. Shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the [...] "sandwich" [...] transistor, and a first proof of principle was obtained on April 7, 1949.|$|E
