5|$|As {{the first}} shooter {{game in the}} Final Fantasy series, the game's staff had various {{problems}} during development, although producer Yoshinori Kitase found the experience challenging, and added role-playing elements {{in order to make}} the game more entertaining for traditional fans of the main series. When Dirge of Cerberus was released outside Japan, several aspects of the gameplay were modified in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more appealing. A mobile phone tie-in was also released in 2006, while in 2008, Square republished the game in Japan with the updates made for the Western versions. Although the game has sold 1.5 million copies worldwide as of 2011, it has received a mixed critical reaction.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the owners}} of One Times Square filed for {{bankruptcy}} protection. In March 1995, One Times Square was sold to the financial services firm Lehman Brothers for $27.5 million. The new owners felt {{that it would not}} be cost-effective to house new tenants in the tower due to the cost of the extensive renovation required in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> suitable for tenants as compared to the relatively small rental revenue that its limited floor space would have brought in. Instead, they decided to market the tower as a location for advertising to capitalize on its prominent location within the Square. The entire exterior of One Times Square above the ticker was modified to add a grid frame for mounting billboard signs.|$|E
5|$|The Oakwood City Council {{wanted the}} Playhouse as a {{community}} center. Thomas appeared before the council and assured them {{that it would not}} be damaged, although he could not disclose what he was intending to use it for. When Talbott Realty proved reluctant to sell, the United States Army Corps of Engineers condemned the property, which became Unit IV on 15 February 1944. Remodeling began on 17 March and the Production Group began moving in on 1 June. Three guard houses were added, along with a wire fence. Changes to the site were minimized in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier to restore later. Because it was located in a residential area, efforts were also made to minimize noise and other disruptions.|$|E

50|$|Plans {{to build}} a {{skyscraper}} {{on the site of}} the destroyed Ginzburg Hotel emerged in 1948, but the design was finalized by Anatoly Dobrovolsky as late as 1954, when Stalinist architecture was already doomed. Building work proceeded slowly, with numerous political <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> simpler and cheaper. It was completed in 1961, without a tower, steeple and any original ornaments.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the series}} had premiered, some media critics {{stated that the}} series had {{potential}} to become a ratings hit and possibly raise NBC from being the fourth highest-rated network out of five. Greenblatt has also stated that he has high hopes for the series. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more likely the series will be a success, NBC picked the series up for 15 episodes and opted to hold the show for mid-season in order to pair {{it up with the}} hit reality show The Voice on Monday nights. Despite this, other media critics have said unless the series receives a rating above a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, it will be considered a failure, and only two other NBC series ranked above a 3.0 rating at the time; Fear Factor and The Office. The series has also been put on Monday nights against CBS, with Monday featuring Two and a Half Men, one of the highest-rated shows of the season. Also, musical shows have a known record for failures, like Cop Rock.|$|E

Here he {{defeated}} Tomáš Berdych in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to his first final of an ATP 500 level tournament or higher after returning from his wrist injury in 2010. He lost to Federer in straight sets in the final. At the Open 13 in Marseille, del Potro defeated Davydenko, Gasquet, Tsonga, and Michaël Llodra in the final to get his tenth ATP championship. Del Potro then had a good run in Dubai, reaching the semifinals, then losing to Roger Federer again in straight sets. Del Potro lost in {{the quarterfinals of the}} BNP Paribas Open to Federer for the fourth time that year. He made it to the fourth round of the Sony Ericsson Open, but lost to David Ferrer in two sets.|$|E
5|$|Kunjunni S. Kumar, son of cinematographer S.Kumar, {{was hired}} as Loham's cinematographer. Kunjunni had first worked with Ranjith as an {{associate}} director during the production of Indian Rupee (2011) while his father worked behind the camera. Earlier, {{he was supposed to}} debut as a cinematographer on Ranjith's Leela in 2012, but the project was shelved ten days before production. In an interview with the Deccan Chronicle, Kunjunni said that after the script narration, Ranjith told him to avoid gimmicks in framing and shots in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more realistic. Mythili, who was cast by Ranjith in her debut film, acted in and served as an assistant director for the film which was her debut behind the camera. She also sang a duet song in the film's soundtrack. Sreevalsan J. Menon was selected by Ranjith to compose the film's original music score. Renji Panicker suggested Menon to Ranjith during the film's pre-production stage. C. Rajamani composed the film score.|$|E

50|$|Bacon, {{sometimes}} called American Euchre, is a trick-taking card game which resembles a simplified version of Euchre. It differs from Euchre {{in that it}} uses a full 52-card Anglo-American deck, has a slightly modified scoring system and trump selection system, uses a normalized card <b>ordering</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier <b>to</b> learn, and adds the aspect of permission. It originated in the mid-to-late 1900s and is somewhat popular in the Eastern United States. It {{is one of the}} simpler trick-taking games and is a good game for introducing the concept of trumps to inexperienced players.|$|R

5|$|Several {{plans were}} introduced, {{with the most}} {{important}} plan being that of James Madison (the Virginia Plan). The Convention's work was mostly a matter of modifying this plan. Charles Pinckney also introduced a plan, although this wasn't considered and its exact character has been lost to history. After the Convention was well under way, the New Jersey Plan was introduced though never seriously considered. It was mainly a protest to what some delegates thought was the excessively radical change from the Articles of Confederation. Alexander Hamilton also offered a plan after the Convention was well under way, though it included an executive serving for life and therefore the delegates felt it too closely resembled a monarchy. Historians are unsure how serious he was about this, and some have speculated {{that he may have}} done it to make Madison's plan look moderate by comparison. The Connecticut Compromise wasn't a plan but one of several compromises offered by the Connecticut delegation. It was key to the ultimate ratification of the constitution, but was only included after being modified by Benjamin Franklin in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more appealing to larger states.|$|E
5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|Fontana, who had {{previously}} worked {{on a number of}} episodes of the original series, was tasked with writing the script for the pilot. The production team met in full {{for the first time on}} February 18, 1987, having received the first draft of Fontana's script a few days earlier. The original premise involved the Enterprise and the USS Starseeker approaching an alien lifeform captured by a race called the Annoi and turned into a weapon. After the Annoi told the Starfleet ships to surrender, the Starseeker opened fire and was destroyed, while Troi contacted the alien and convinced it to crash on a nearby planet so that the Enterprise can help it to free itself along with rescuing other prisoners the Annoi were using as slaves on the surface. Despite numerous changes taking place to the plot before the final version, some of the introductions for various characters made it through to the final version. The plot involving Q was added subsequently to the episode in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> longer. Roddenberry was aiming for an hour-long pilot, but Paramount wanted a two-hour show and eventually won out. Other items were also added in order to lengthen the episode, including the saucer separation sequence and the appearance of Admiral Leonard McCoy.|$|E

5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure <b>it</b> was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure <b>it</b> stayed dry.|$|R
5|$|Sienna grows {{feelings}} for Darren and they kiss, although Darren later reunites with Nancy after she recovers. Desperate {{to get rid}} of Nancy, Sienna frames Nancy for several dilemmas, including leaving Oscar trapped in a fire, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> look like she is still addicted to painkillers. Tom catches Sienna trying to breast feed Oscar, although Sienna accuses Tom of trying to take topless pictures of her. Darren believes Sienna's lies that Nancy is still a painkiller addict, resulting in Nancy moving out and Darren and Sienna beginning a relationship. Sienna begins faking a pregnancy although is devastated when she overhears Darren saying he doesn't want the baby. In order to get Darren closer, Sienna attempts to officially get rid of Nancy and she frames Nancy for trying to kill Oscar, Charlie and herself. Nancy is taken to a mental institute because of this. Darren later finds out that Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth) is his mother and disowns Jack for lying to him for years. Darren, Sienna and Oscar move out because of this. Tom realizes what Sienna has done to Nancy and attempts to expose her by putting a video camera in her bedroom. Darren finds the video camera, however, and assumes that Tom had been trying to film Sienna topless again leaving Darren furious with Tom. Darren later makes up with Jack when he is nearly killed in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|Vale lost by {{a single}} goal at Redheugh Park against Gateshead on 12 September; Vale, playing in their change kit, were beaten by a 57th-minute goal from John Ingham. This brought to an end the club's then-record streak of 16 games unbeaten. Four days later Vale {{recorded}} a 2–1 win over Bradford Park Avenue at the Horsfall Stadium despite Reg Potts being injured with a swollen ankle early in the match. A 2–0 home win over Workington on 19 September began a sequence of five clean sheets, with Jim Elsby standing in for Potts as Steele changed the starting line-up {{for the first time}} in eight games – this brought Potts' run of 73 consecutive appearances to an end. The defensive fivesome of keeper Ray King, Tommy Cheadle, Reg Potts, Stan Turner and Roy Sproson began to be known as 'the Iron Curtain' or 'the Steele Curtain' (a play on the manager's name). A 21 September game against nearby unbeaten Crewe Alexandra was billed as a 'crunch clash' between first and second, and a Sproson goal on 87 minutes won the match for the Vale. For the return a week later a stadium record 17,883 packed into Gresty Road to witness a goalless draw at Crewe. The attendance figures were helped by the management team of the Crewe Works, who allowed their workforce to leave work an hour early in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> for the 5:10pm kick-off. The draw was achieved despite injuries to Albert Leake, Hayward and John Cunliffe, who were replaced by Derek Tomkinson, Roland Lewis and Mick Hulligan.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from bad to worse when an anti-roll bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the finish, only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E

50|$|Napoleon I himself, having {{defeated}} the Allies at Montereau on 17 February, {{forcing them to}} retreat toward Troyes beyond the river Aube, had turned north to {{the valley of the}} Marne to try to impede the renewed drive toward Paris by the Army of Silesia (mostly Prussians) under Field Marshal Gebhard von Blücher; the marshals he left behind were <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> appear as though he was still with them. Schwarzenberg tested that assumption by advancing upon Bar-sur-Aube (in part because Alexander I of Russia and Frederick William III of Prussia wanted him to do so), and on the twenty-sixth Napoleon <b>ordered</b> Oudinot <b>to</b> follow Schwarzenberg to the town, near Troyes.|$|R
