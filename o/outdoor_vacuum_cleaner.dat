25|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> uses {{a partial}} vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.|$|R

We performed a randomized field study {{to determine whether a}} conventional (non-HEPA) <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> could achieve cleaning results comparable with those of a HEPA <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> We compared the lead loading reductions of these two <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> in a total of 127 New Jersey homes of lead-exposed children. We used wet towelettes and a vacuum sampler to collect lead dust from carpets and upholstery before and after vacuum cleaning. The vacuum sampling data showed that the HEPA and non-HEPA <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> resulted in 54. 7 % (p = 0. 006) and 36. 4 % (p = 0. 020) reductions in lead loading, respectively, when used on soiled carpets, although the overall difference in lead loading reduction between the two <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> was not statistically significant (p = 0. 293). The wipe sampling data did not show any significant lead loading reduction for either of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners,</b> suggesting that both <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> fail to clean the surfaces of carpet effectively, considering that wipe sampling media simulate surface contact.

5000|$|Many <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{also use}} HEPA filters {{as part of}} their {{filtration}} systems. This is beneficial for asthma and allergy sufferers, because the HEPA filter traps the fine particles (such as pollen and dust mite feces) which trigger allergy and asthma symptoms. For a HEPA filter in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> to be effective, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> must be designed so that all the air drawn into the machine is expelled through the filter, with none of the air leaking past it. This {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Sealed HEPA" [...] or sometimes the more vague [...] "True HEPA". <b>Vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> simply labeled [...] "HEPA" [...] may have a HEPA filter, but not all air necessarily passes through it. Finally, <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> filters marketed as [...] "HEPA-like" [...] will typically use a filter of a similar construction to HEPA, but without the filtering efficiency. Because of the extra density of a true HEPA filter, HEPA <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> require more powerful motors to provide adequate cleaning power.|$|R

40|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{are widely}} used {{household}} appliances and they usually generate quite unpleasant sound. The four most common sources of <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> noise are the motor, the fan, the airflow and the surface vibrations. Connections between the motor and such vibrating surfaces of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> allow very efficient transmission of the force and the motion, which are then transformed to sound. The surface velocity, the sound pressure and the acoustic power of the vibrating surfaces are very important parameters in the noise control and source location problems. The {{purpose of this study}} is to asses the vibro-acoustical characteristics of a sample wet and dry type <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> and to determine the acoustic power radiated from this type of <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> For this purpose, the near-field sound pressure, the surface velocity and the sound intensity levels are measured.

40|$|Nowadays, {{products}} {{should not}} only be attractive in design, but {{also be able to}} provide comfort and pleasant feeling to its users while functioning. However, some products have difficulty in providing comfort and pleasantness to their users such as noisy products. Noisy products refer to products that produce noise while functioning such as the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> The noise emitted by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> has a potential to influence the user's response both in a positive and negative way. Thus, this study focuses on investigating the visual (form design) and auditory (noise) interaction through the response of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> users.
