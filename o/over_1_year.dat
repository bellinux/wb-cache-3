25|$|Thymus {{transplantation}} {{results in}} that T cells {{are taught to}} avoid reacting with donor antigens instead, and may still react with many self-antigens in the body. Autoimmune disease is a frequent complication after thymus transplantation, found in 42% of subjects <b>over</b> <b>1</b> <b>year</b> post-transplantation. However, this is partially explained by that the indication itself, that is, complete DiGeorge syndrome (absence of thymus), {{increases the risk of}} autoimmune disease.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{attempted}} human {{liver transplant}} {{was performed in}} 1963 by Dr. Thomas Starzl, although the pediatric patient died intraoperatively due to uncontrolled bleeding. Multiple subsequent attempts by various surgeons remained unsuccessful until 1967, when Starzl transplanted a 19 month old girl with hepatocellular carcinoma {{who was able to}} survive for <b>over</b> <b>1</b> <b>year</b> before dying of metastatic disease. Despite the development of viable surgical techniques, liver transplantation remained experimental through the 1970s, with one year patient survival in the vicinity of 25%. The introduction of ciclosporin by Sir Roy Calne, Professor of Surgery Cambridge, markedly improved patient outcomes, and the 1980s saw recognition of liver transplantation as a standard clinical treatment for both adult and pediatric patients with appropriate indications. [...] Liver transplantation is now performed at over one hundred centers in the US, as well as numerous centres in Europe and elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIntroductionUnicentric Castleman's disease (CD) {{is a rare}} benign {{lymphoproliferative}} disorder. A cervical location {{has rarely}} {{been reported in the}} pediatric literature. Case reportA 13 -year-old boy presented with a mass in the right neck region of 3 months’ evolution. Clinical examination revealed a smooth mobile 5 cm node deep in the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The diagnosis of hyaline vascular type CD was confirmed by complete surgical excision and histopathologic examination. Postoperative course was simple, without recurrence <b>over</b> <b>1</b> <b>year's</b> follow-up. Discussion and conclusionCervically located CD often shows few symptoms, and is rarely suggested by a cervical mass found in children. Definitive diagnosis is histopathological. The hyaline vascular type of unicentric CD has a good prognosis after complete resection of the lesion...|$|R

Serum concentrations of thyroid hormones (T_ 3 and T_ 4) in 6 -week-old mutant hamsters were 2 -fold (T_ 3) to 3 -fold (T_ 4) higher than those of age-matched normal animals.
