40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to deal with the {{analysis}} of the performance of twin thermoacoustic prime mover (TAPM) which are measured in terms of frequency and pressure amplitude by varying the parameters such as temperature gradient along the length of stack and the <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of fluid medium argon using CFD simulation. With the help of CFD researchers and engineers can evaluate the performance of a wide range of thermoacoustic systems on the computer without the time, expense, and disruption required to make actual changes onsite (stack) which is tedious to fabricate. Design/methodology/approach - For the present simulation, the <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of argon such as 1, 3, and 5 bar, and the temperature gradient is varied from 600 to 1, 400 K with the regular intervals of each 200 K. The geometry of twin TAPM is created using GAMBIT processor, and the simulation is carried out using FLUENT. The geometrical parameters of twin TAPM are kept constant throughout the simulation. The results for frequency and pressure amplitude obtained from the CFD simulation of twin TAPM for various temperature gradient and <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> are analyzed and reported. Findings - The computational results of twin TAPM shows an increase in pressure amplitude with an increase in the temperature gradient and also it increases with an increase in <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of the fluid medium. The parameter <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> of the working fluid medium and the stack hot end temperature has no significant effect on the output, frequency. Originality/value - Though several experimental works had been published based on the twin TAPM, an attempt has been made in the present investigation for the first time to estimate the performance of twin TAPM using CFD package (ANSYS-FLUENT) by varying temperature gradient. The temperature gradient and <b>operating</b> <b>pressures</b> were varied and the performance of twin TAPM was measured in terms of frequency and pressure amplitude...|$|R
25|$|The {{vacuum system}} for {{evacuating}} a TEM to an <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or roughing vacuum is achieved {{with either a}} rotary vane pump or diaphragm pumps setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a turbo-molecular or diffusion pump establishing high vacuum level necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump. Sections of the TEM may be isolated {{by the use of}} pressure-limiting apertures to allow for different vacuum levels in specific areas such as a higher vacuum of 10−4 to 10−7 Pa or higher in the electron gun in high-resolution or field-emission TEMs.|$|E

The new 187hp engine was of the crosshead type, with a 36-inch bore, 6-foot stroke and steam cut-off of 3 feet. The new boiler had a greater fire surface area (720 vs. 499 square feet) than the original, and a slightly higher <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi. The paddlewheel diameter was also enlarged by a foot, and the number of paddles reduced by one to thirteen. The new machinery appears to have been less efficient than the original, consuming twice the fuel for only a one-half knot increase in maximum speed. General Taylors hull dimensions remained the same after the rebuild as before.|$|E
