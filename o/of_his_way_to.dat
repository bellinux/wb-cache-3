5|$|As he {{prepared}} {{to run for president}} in 2000, Vice President Al Gore attempted to maintain good relations with the Jackson family, hoping to discourage Jackson's father from running for president against him. Jackson received a congratulatory call from Gore after his election in 1995. In 1998, Gore campaigned for and advised Jackson, and went out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> instruct aides to create a vice presidential event in Jackson's district to boost Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Having {{become the}} Goblin, he {{generally}} views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking in creative vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence. He goes out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> remind others {{of their personal}} failures and shortcomings and to remind those in close relationships with him, such as his son, that they are incapable of measuring up to his achievements. When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that, when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys, or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the Human Torch, {{despite the fact that}} he always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself.|$|E
5|$|When Veronica discovers new {{evidence}} that suggests that Lilly's convicted killer is innocent, she decides to investigate the case. As Veronica delves deeper into the murder, she also works on other investigations, seeks her mother's whereabouts and deals with the aftermath of being drugged and raped during an 09er party. Veronica, no longer part of the school's wealthy in-crowd, makes some new friends: Wallace, Neptune High basketball star; Weevil, leader of the PCHers, a Latino biker gang; and Mac, Neptune High's resident computer genius. Using her friends' resources, {{as well as those}} provided by her father and his contacts, Veronica gains a reputation for sleuthing and finds her skills in increasingly high demand at her school. Things get more complicated when Veronica falls into a relationship with Lilly's ex-boyfriend Logan, who for a time held Veronica partly responsible for Lilly's death and went out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> harass her.|$|E

5|$|Don Vito {{brought the}} {{organization}} to its highest perfection without undue recourse to violence. The Mafia leader who scatters corpses all over the island {{in order to achieve}} his goal is considered as inept as the statesman who has to wage aggressive wars. Don Vito ruled and inspired fear mainly by the use of his great qualities and natural ascendancy. His awe-inspiring appearance helped him. … His manners were princely, his demeanour humble but majestic. He was loved by all. Being very generous by nature, he never refused a request for aid and dispensed millions in loans, gifts and general philanthropy. He would personally go out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> redress a wrong. When he started a journey, every major, dressed in his best clothes, awaited him at the entrance of his village, kissed his hands, and paid homage, {{as if he were a}} king. And he was a king of sorts: under his reign peace and order were observed, the Mafia peace, of course, which was not what the official law of the Kingdom of Italy would have imposed, but people did not stop to draw too fine a distinction.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, La Sombra and Rush were {{involved}} in an incident in Guadalajara, where the two attacked fans who were throwing beers at them. The following day, Jalisco's Boxing and Wrestling Commission suspended the two from wrestling in the state for three months. While the commission only suspended them from wrestling in Jalisco, CMLL decided to pull both La Sombra and Rush from their Super Viernes show three days later. CMLL did not offer an official explanation for the change. Over the summer of 2015 Los Ingobernables started to wrestle against tecnico teams instead of generally facing rudo teams {{as they had been}} up to that point. By August, 2015 Los Ingobernables found themselves facing off against Atlantis on multiple occasions, often with La Sombra going out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> attack Atlantis, tearing Atlantis' mask apart during matches to show his disdain for the veteran tecnico. On August 19, 2015 CMLL held a press conference where they announced that the winner of the main event of the 80th Anniversary, La Sombra, would put his mask on the line against the winner of the main event of the 81st Anniversary Show, Atlantis, in the main event of the CMLL 82nd Anniversary Show on September 18, 2015. On August 31, La Sombra lost the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship to Último Guerrero, ending his two and a half year reign. La Sombra lost the Lucha de Apuestas match to Atlantis. As a result, La Sombra was forced to unmask and reveal his real name. In early November, La Sombra and Rush began having issues with each other, which led to a singles match between the two on November 13, where Rush was victorious. After the match, {{which turned out to be}} La Sombra's final with CMLL, the two founding members of Los Ingobernables made peace with each other.|$|E

Susan is a tour guide but seems {{to spend most of}} her time at home. She is a terrible cook.

25|$|His {{portraits of}} such Tory {{politicians}} as Lord Eldon are unrelenting, {{as might be}} expected. But elsewhere his characterisations are more balanced, more even-tempered, than similar accounts in past years. Notably, there are portraits of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey, which are, to an extent, essences of his former thoughts about these poets—and those thoughts had been profuse. He had earlier directed {{some of his most}} vitriolic attacks against them for having replaced the humanistic and revolutionary ideas of their earlier years with staunch support of the Establishment. Now he goes out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> qualify his earlier assessments.|$|E

He attended St. Bernard's RC Primary School until age 11, then The Barlow RC High School in Didsbury; despite common reports that he was expelled at age 16 for fighting, Liam was actually suspended for three months. He then returned to school, where he completed his last term in Spring 1990. He gained 4 GCSEs.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s Gryce reinvented {{himself as}} a public school teacher in New York. He was {{somewhat}} interested in education throughout his life, and {{was said to be}} an excellent music instructor. He received a master's degree in education from Fordham University in 1978 and developed an incredible passion for teaching. He left a lasting legacy at Elementary School No. 53 in the Bronx, which was renamed in his honor after his death. Students, colleagues, and parents who encountered Gryce during this time knew him as a very private, serious, passionate, and caring man. Believing that music aided literacy, Gryce was a strict but caring teacher, and went out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> aid students at educational risk, working at an under-resourced mostly black and Hispanic school.|$|E
25|$|It was in {{this type}} of terrain that aerial attacks were used with limited effectiveness. French made Mirage 2000H of the IAF were tasked to drop laser-guided bombs to destroy well-entrenched {{positions}} of the Pakistani forces. The IAF lost a MiG-27 strike aircraft, which it attributed to an engine failure, and a MiG-21 fighter which was shot down by Pakistan; initially Pakistan said it shot down both jets after they crossed into its territory. One Indian Mi-8 helicopter was also lost due to Stinger SAMs. On 27 May 1999, Flt. Lt. Nachiketa developed engine trouble in the Batalik sector and bailed out of his craft. Sqn Ldr Ajay Ahuja went out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> locate his comrade but was shot down by a shoulder-fired Stinger missile. According to reports, he had bailed out of his stricken plane safely but was apparently killed by his captors as his body was returned riddled with bullet wounds.|$|E
25|$|On several {{occasions}} the Riglers maintained that their home {{had been the}} best available option for Genie at the time, and said that both they and everyone who worked with her thought she was doing well. They also said they genuinely loved Genie and always provided her the best care possible, pointing out {{that she had made}} substantial progress in every aspect of her development while living with them, and they and Curtiss both said Genie's mother had prevented them from continuing to work with Genie as they had wanted. While representing the Riglers in court in 1977 and 1978 John Miner went out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> give them credit for acting as foster parents to Genie for four years, and when Curtiss spoke to Rymer in the early 1990s she praised their work with Genie and their willingness to take her into their home, although she also felt they had not done enough when she told them about Genie's abuse in foster care. Justin Leiber argued that the scientists' inability to do more for Genie was largely out of their control, and primarily the result of legal and institutional processes surrounding her placement.|$|E

25|$|Rana Prasad Rao of Amarkot duly welcomed Humayun {{into his}} home and {{sheltered}} the refugees for several months. Here, in the household of a Hindu Rajput nobleman, Humayun's wife Hamida Bano, daughter of a Sindhi Shia family, {{gave birth to the}} future Emperor Akbar on 15 October 1542. The date of birth is well established because Humayun consulted his astronomer to utilise the astrolabe and check the location of the planets. The infant was the long-awaited heir-apparent to the 34-year-old Humayun and the answer of many prayers. Shortly after the birth, Humayun and his party left Amarkot for Sindh, leaving Hamida and her child in the custody of their Hindu hosts. A couple of years later, at Humayun's behest, Hamida would leave her infant son in the safety of remote Amarkot and join her husband as he fled into Persia, where her Shia and Persian background would bring influence. The infant Akbar was to live for more than five years, all alone, in the care of a Hindu, Rajput foster-family. This was to have a profound, indelible influence on his views and personality, and a momentous effect on the subsequent history of India. In particular, Akbar developed a strong affinity for the Rajputs, going out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> forge alliances (including marriage alliances) with them, and they would form the bedrock of support for his dynasty for two centuries.|$|E
