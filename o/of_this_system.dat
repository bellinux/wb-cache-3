5|$|The {{distance}} to the IK Pegasi system can be measured directly by observing the tiny parallax shifts <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>system</b> (against the more distant stellar background) as the Earth orbits around the Sun.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on May16 and crossed Central America into the Pacific Ocean on May24. That day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather about 150mi (240km) southwest of the Costa Rican coastline. At that time, this system was associated with a monsoon trough embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Despite being disorganized, gradual development <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>system</b> was anticipated by the NHC. On May25, a broad low pressure area formed southwest of Nicaragua, after the tropical wave interacted with an eastward-moving Kelvin wave. Convection soon became organized around the newly formed low, and the NHC noted that the formation of a tropical cyclone within the subsequent 48hours was likely. The NHC estimated that Tropical Depression Two-E developed at 1200UTC on May28 about 125mi (205km) south-southeast of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca.|$|E

Afterward, the representatives on mission were given extraordinary powers over army commanders.
