This integrated field, petrographic, chemical, stable C, O and Sr isotopes, and fluid inclusion study aims to link dolomitization to {{the origin and}} geochemical evolution of fluids and oil migration in the Upper Cretaceous Bekhme carbonates. Flux of hot basinal (hydrothermal) brines, which is suggested to have occurred during the Zagros Orogeny, resulted in dolomitization and cementation of vugs and fractures by coarse-crystalline saddle dolomite, equant calcite and anhydrite. The saddle dolomite and host dolostones have similar stable isotopic composition and formed prior to oil migration from hot (81 – 115 °C) basinal NaCl–MgCl 2 –H 2 O brines with salinities of 18 – 22 wt. % NaCl eq. The equant calcite cement, which surrounds and hence postdates saddle dolomite, has precipitated during oil migration from cooler (60 – 110 °C) NaCl–CaCl 2 –H 2 O brines (14 – 18 wt. % NaCl eq). The yellowish fluorescence color of oil inclusions in the equant calcite indicates that the oil had API gravity of 15 – 25 ° composition, which is lighter than present-day oil in the reservoirs (API of 10 – 17 °). This difference in oil composition is attributed to oil degradation by the flux of meteoric water, which {{is evidenced by the}} low δ 13 C values (− 8. 5 ‰ to − 3. 9 ‰ VPDB) as well as by nil salinity and low temperature in fluid inclusions of late columnar calcite cement.

40|$|Historical {{review of}} {{petroleum}} exploration The documented history of systematic pet-roleum exploration {{in that part}} of southern Asia now known as Pakistan, see Fig. 1, is here divided into five stages. (1866 - 1947) British Companies, pre-Independence In 1866 some seven or eight holes were dug in and around the seepages near Fatehjang, 25 miles west of Islamabad, yielding a few gallons of oil per day (Pascoe 1920). Then, in 1870, B. S. LYman, an American from Pennsylvania w s hired/to investigate the oil prospects of the Punjab. His report is of special interest o a meeting on Classic Petroleum Provinces, since its maps were probably the first ever published on which subsurface structure was delineated by contours, Owen (1975). During {{the last quarter of the}} 19 th Century there were spor-adic attempts to drill shallow boreholes in the northern parts of the Central Fold Belt. This activity culminated in the drilling of thirteen wells at Kattan in the Marri Tribal Territory of northeast Baluchistan near <b>oil</b> <b>seepages</b> and from which 25 000 barrels of oil were produced between 1885 and 1892. The impetus for this drilling was to establish a convenient source of fuel for the railway system which the then Indian Government was constructing to help secure the Afghan/Indian border. Immediately prior to World War I, various investment syndicates (mainly British financed) were formed to explore in the Punjab and it is from these origins that the first significant company was established on 1 December 1913 to acquire extensive exploration rights; The Attock Oil Company. In 1915, oil was discovered in quantity at Khaur by Attock and oil exploration com-menced in earnest. Burmah Oil Company then undertook geological surveys in the Punjab, thereby broadening its exploration interests outside Burma, where it had been successfully exploring for 30 years, in contrast o Attock which was established with the express intent of exploring only within the Punjab.

40|$|Abstract Petrographic and geochemical {{analyses}} per-formed on a North Sea core {{from the}} Gryphon Field re-veal {{the presence of}} palaeo-degassing features surrounded by injected sandstones in the Eocene interval. The injected sandstones are oil-stained and poorly cemented by car-bonate and quartz. 18 O isotope analyses indicate that carbonate cementation occurred during shallow burial (likely less than about 300 m). Depleted 13 C (around) 30 & V-PDB) carbonate cement suggests that bicar-bonate {{was derived from the}} microbial oxidation of oil and gas. Late quartz overgrowths enclose oil present in the injected units. The tubular degassing conduits are com-posed of zoned cements and have d 18 O and d 13 C isotope values similar to the injected sandstones, indicating that <b>oil</b> and gas <b>seepage</b> induced the precipitation of authigenic carbonate in the shallow subsurface. Oil inclusions in inter- and intra-crystal cement sites in both injected sandstones and degassing conduits indicate that oil seep-age was an ongoing feature at shallow burial.

A variety of additives was tested including inorganic and organic binders, fillers and, in some experiments, also surfactants. The solidified materials were tested for mechanical stability using different standard procedures. As a central aspect of this study, different elution testing procedures are compared and discussed. The results of these tests demonstrate that model oil can be absorbed by brown coal dust {{in such a way as}} to almost completely inhibit volatile oil constitutents and other toxic organic pollutants from being mobilized. This is also evident from sorption/desorption equilibria. The results indicate that besides hydrophobic interactions other bonding mechanisms (e. g. chemical forces) also become effective.

5000|$|... Barely {{seven years}} after Edwin L. Drake drilled the world's first oil well in 1859 at Titusville, Pennsylvania, USA, history {{registered}} another exploration of the black liquid gold, in the largest continent. More than a century ago, history was made in a remote corner of Assam {{in the midst of}} the dense and malaria infested jungles, by a band of intrepid pioneers searching for black gold. In 1867 Italian Engineers, commissioned by the Assam Railways and Trading Company, to build a railway line from Dibrugarh to Margherita (Headquarters of Assam Railways and Trading Company) accidentally discovered oil at Digboi around 10 miles from Margherita.‘Dig boy, dig’, shouted the English engineer, Mr W L Lake, at his men as they watched elephants emerging out of the dense forest with oil stains on their feet".This is possibly the most distilled - though fanciful - version of the legend explaining the siting and naming of Digboi. Two events separated by seven years have become fused, but although neither is likely to be provable, such evidence that does exist appears sufficiently detailed to be credible. Various web sites offer variations on the elephant’s foot story, a consensus of which would be that engineers extending the Dibru-Sadiya railway line to Ledo for the Assam Railways and Trading Company (AR&TC) in 1882 were using elephants for haulage and noticed that the mud on one pachyderm’s feet smelled of oil. Retracing the trail of footprints, they found oil seeping to the surface. One of the engineers, the Englishman Willie Leova Lake, was an ‘oil enthusiast’ and persuaded the company to drill a well. Oil India Ltd makes no reference to elephants’ feet in its company history, although on its previous web site the company noted that Lake had noticed [...] "the <b>oil</b> <b>seepages</b> around Borbhil". Once the project had been approved, Lake assembled equipment, boilers, and local labour, and engaged elephants to haul the machinery to the site. The first well was started in September 1889, but an encouraging first strike at 178 ft turned out to be a small pocket, and drilling recommenced. This continued until November 1890 when the well was completed at a total depth of 662 ft, and it was during this extended period of drilling that Oil India's old web site placed the legend of Lake exhorting one or more of his labourers to [...] "Dig, boy!" ...|$|R
