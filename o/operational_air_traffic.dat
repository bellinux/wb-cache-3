The analysis used <b>operational</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> data from over 1, 082, 000 flights {{during the month of}} January, 2011. Specific metrics included the frequency of tactical departure scheduling, site specific variances in the technology’s utilization, departure time prediction compliance used in the tactical scheduling process and the performance with which the current system can predict the airborne slot that aircraft are being scheduled into from the airport surface. Operational data analysis described in this paper indicates significant room for improvement exists in the current system primarily in the area of reduced departure time prediction uncertainty. Results indicate that a significant number of tactically scheduled aircraft did not meet their scheduled departure slot due to departure time uncertainty. In addition to missed slots, the operational data analysis identified increased controller workload associated with tactical departures which were subject to traffic management manual re-scheduling or controller swaps.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to ascertain the relationship between the difference in the way leaders think they are being perceived by their followers and how they are actually being perceived, and the level of morale of such followers. It was completed in an <b>operational</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Control (ATC) centre in Johannesburg, South Africa, and focused on four middle managers and their team of ATC followers. The process was viewed from a followership perspective, and the Attribution Theory of leadership applied to study follower perceptions of leader attributions. Methodology: A parallel-convergent mixed-method approach was utilised, with primary quantitative and qualitative data collected concurrently from leaders and followers in interview and survey format. Results were merged using triangulation, before being autoethnographically interpreted. Scope and Limitations: The study researched individual ATC middle managers and their followers at the researched ATC centre, resulting in a scope that includes four leaders and 105 followers. It did not include any other staff as part of the research, and focused on a specific set of people within the researched centre. The study was limited to the researched ATC centre at the researched company only. The low morale in the researched centre could be due to various other causes such as working conditions, unhappiness with upper management (not middle management), compensational disagreements and company policy issues. Whilst excluded in this study, they are conceded and suggested for future research. Originality and Value: This research is original, and will add value to the researched company by enabling them to understand and address one of the causes for low morale in the researched centre. Its value to the body of knowledge resides therein that it is the only research to date in the narrow field of followership and the Attribution Theory of leadership combined and applied in the South African ATC leadership environment. Findings and Recommendations: Research data points to a definite discrepancy between leader perception of follower attributions and actual follower attributions. Additionally, it proves that in this specific setting the more negative this discrepancy, the lower follower morale becomes. ATNS should consider remedial training for affected managers to develop deficient attributions and sufficiently equip them to deal with the low morale problem.

40|$|AbstractAirport {{capacity}} {{is a key}} performance indicator for {{the ability of the}} airport to handle an expected traffic demand. The classical way to quote airport capacities and flows on the airside is to count the number of potential airframe movements per unit of time (e. g. per hour or per year). This approach seems to be historically reasonable from a perspective of planning and organizing predicted aircraft movements and available airside resources. However from an economic point of view a more sophisticated indicator system could be beneficial to represent and compare future airport performance. The method presented here uses additional parameters like aircraft size, number of passengers, cargo load or value of passengers (e. g. premium vs. economy) to indicate the economic performance of the airport system (social welfare optimization). The results can be used to address possible improvements in ATM with respect to economic relevance for the <b>operational</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> stakeholders (airport, airline, air navigation service provider). Since a single flight movement is now differently rated regarding to the calculated airport performance contribution, it is expected that the accompanied prioritization procedures could significantly influence airline and airport operations. Further on, the mutual dependencies between airlines (concurrent demand for sufficient airport resources) and airline-airport (provide efficient air transport) will be emphasized in a transparent and reliable way. To exemplarily show the consequences and the benefits of the introduced metric exemplarily, we will use different airports (airport categories, runway configurations and operational scenarios), different parameter settings (short/medium/long haul flights, heavy/medium/light aircraft) and relevant combination of the identified input parameters. Special emphasis will be given to the discussion of the weighting of parameters depending on the needs of the stakeholders in air traffic management and in air transportation. It will be sketched how the results of the new method can be used in various time horizons for planning airside movements at an airport, i. e. from pre-tactical flow management in a performance based airport management environment to the evaluation of long-term strategic expansion options of an airport. A comparison of a set of airports having similar performance using the conventional capacity scale will demonstrate the significance of the new indicator set and the possibilities of its application...|$|E

To gain a deeper understanding of self-directed team learning, I investigated the role and contribution of self-directed team learning principles and strategies that were present in the South African Air Force air traffic control team-based work environment. This research study was directed by the following primary research questions: Does self-directed team learning impact on the air traffic control work environment, and {{what is the nature of}} self-directed team learning’s impact on the air traffic control work environment? Insights gained as a result of this study contributed to the body of research concerned with learning design, development, implementation and evaluation by self-directed teams as well as the air traffic control discipline. In this mixed-method study quantitative data collection was performed by means of a self-directed team learning questionnaire and a learning approach questionnaire, whereas qualitative data collection relied on individual interviews and focus group interviews. This study involved 25 South African Air Force air traffic controllers (from three <b>operational</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control centres). The nature of self-directed team learning’s impact on the air traffic control work environment was illustrated by individual and collective (team) views and dynamics. The impact of air traffic control team performances was traced in terms of identified teamwork characteristics, activities, dynamics, performance measures and focus areas and reflective practices. Results of this study indicated that self-directed team learning offered opportunities to individuals and teams to influence air traffic control performances in an air traffic control work environment. A perceived positive relationship between self-directed team learning and air traffic control operational outputs could be traced.

40|$|Rapid {{technological}} change and increasing traffic volumes worldwide are {{adding to the}} safety challenges for air traffic control. The night shift has traditionally been a period of low workload and work practices have evolved to reflect this. Thus, despite the exemplary safety record, {{there is a need}} to consider further systemic defences for maintaining performance and safety on the night shift. One possible strategy is the provision of a scheduled nap at work. In order to investigate the consequences of a scheduled nap on the night shift, 28 <b>operational</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers were monitored across four roster cycles. Each roster cycle included one of two night shifts. Air traffic controllers were given a nap opportunity on one night shift of each type, and did not nap on the other. Information on the timing, quantity, and quality of sleep during the work week and days off was collected using actigraphy, and supported with logbook data. Sleep during the nap was measured using polysomnography, and the EEG and EOG were further utilised to determine neurophysiological alertness over the latter part of the night shift. Reaction time performance was measured three times across the night shift (beginning, middle, and end) with the psychomotor vigilance test. Actigraphy data indicated that the backward, rapidly-rotating work schedule of air traffic controllers resulted in a progressive loss of sleep across the work week. The reduction in sleep lead to an increasing cumulative sleep debt that was at a maximum prior to the night shift. This sleep debt was not related to reaction time performance at the end of the night shift, but was found to influence neurophysiological alertness. It was determined that the large majority of air traffic controllers were able to sleep during the scheduled 40 minute nap opportunity. However, the latency to sleep onset was long, the sleep short, and of relatively poor quality. Circadian and homeostatic factors increased the likelihood of entry into, and waking from, slow wave sleep (SWS). They were also found to influence reaction time performance and neurophysiological alertness. More variable performance and lowered alertness were seen at the end of the later starting (and finishing) night shift, possibly due to the combined influence of circadian and time-on-task factors. Homeostatic variables had less influence on performance at the end of the night shift, but greater acute sleep loss and higher cumulative sleep debts were related to increased neurophysiological sleepiness. performance and greater neurophysiological alertness in a dose-dependent manner, with even small amounts of stage 1 sleep effecting a performance improvement. Performance improvement was consistent across a range of reaction time measures and consistent improvements were also evident in the neurophysiological data, with the occurrence of SEMs declining, and lower spectral power evident in all frequency bands and single frequencies. These findings clearly demonstrate that a minimal quantity of sleep benefits the performance and alertness of air traffic controllers despite the "noise" of a field setting, thus providing a link between laboratory studies of napping and the actual work environment. The findings also fully support management endorsing a 40 minute napping opportunity for air traffic controllers working the night shift. The short nap sleep had no measurable effect on sleep subsequent to the night shift. However, the amount of sleep obtained in the nap was related to improved reaction time...|$|E

It relies on a lexicographic modeling architecture based on efficiency (i. e., meeting airline scheduling preferences), equity (i. e., balancing scheduling adjustments fairly among the airlines), and on-time performance (i. e., mitigating airport congestion) objectives, subject to scheduling and network connectivity constraints. Theoretical results show that, under some scheduling conditions, equity and efficiency can be jointly maximized. Computational results suggest that, under a wide range of current and hypothetical scheduling settings, ignoring inter-airline equity can lead to highly inequitable outcomes, but that our modeling approach achieves inter-airline equity at no, or small, losses in efficiency.

This paper describes the Surface Management System, which is an element of the FAA's Free Flight Phase 2 program, and its concept of use. Detailed information about future departure demand on airport resources is not currently available in real-time to <b>operational</b> specialists at <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control (ATC) facilities and air carriers. SMS provides controllers, <b>traffic</b> managers, and <b>air</b> carrier decision-makers with accurate predictions of the future departure situation (e. g., queuing and delays for individual aircraft, and aggregate demand for each runway or other constrained resource), as well as advisories to help manage surface movements and departure operations. Two controller-in-the-loop simulations of SMS have been conducted in the Future Flight Central ATC tower simulator at NASA Ames Research Center, leading to refinements in the concept and implementation that are described in this paper. The paper also outlines plans for field evaluations. SMS will be evaluated operationally at Memphis International Airport, first in FedEx's ramp tower beginning in August, 2002 and, subsequently, in the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control tower (ATCT) in 2003...|$|R
40|$|Surface Management System (SMS). This paper {{reports on}} two recent SMS field tests {{as well as}} final {{performance}} and benefits analyses. Field tests and analysis support the conclusion that substantial portions of SMS technology are ready for transfer to the FAA and deployment throughout the National Airspace System (NAS). Other SMS capabilities were accepted in concept but require additional refinement for inclusion in subsequent development spirals. SMS is a decision support tool that helps <b>operational</b> specialists at <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Control (ATC) and NAS user facilities to collaboratively manage the movements of aircraft {{on the surface of}} busy airports, thereby improving capacity, efficiency, and flexibility. SMS provides accurate predictions of the future demand and how that demand will affect airport resources – information that is not currently available. The resulting shared awareness enables the <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> Control Tower (ATCT), Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), <b>Air</b> Route <b>Traffic</b> Control Center (ARTCC), and air carriers to coordinate traffic management decisions. Furthermore, SMS uses its ability to predict how future demand will play out on the surface to evaluate the effect of various traffic management decisions in advance of implementing them, to plan and advise surface operations. The SMS concept, displays, and algorithms were evaluated through a series of field tests at Memphis International Airport (MEM). An operational trial in September, 2003 evaluated SMS traffic management components, such as runway configuration change planning; shadow testing in January, 2004 tested tactical components (e. g., Approval Request (APREQ) coordination...|$|R
40|$|The ‘‘dynamic risk {{modelling}} project” {{was a research}} activity aimed at developing a simulation approach able to provide a quantitative analysis of some critical activities of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> control (ATC) operators considering the organizational {{context in which they}} take place, the main cognitive processes underneath, and the possibility to inform the analysis using retrospective accident data. The pilot study presented in the present paper is aimed at providing an overview of possible opportunities related to the use of a cognitive simulator within the Eurocontrol framework called ConOps (which is a detailed description of future <b>operational</b> concept for <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> in Europe). The approach chosen within the field of HRA (Human Reliability Analysis) made use of a cognitive simulator developed within the epartment of Industrial Engineering in Politecnico di Milano. The simulator was built based on an Information Processing Level very much compatible with the one embedded in a method used by Eurocontrol for collecting accident data named HERA. Thanks to this similarity the pilot application was able to modify the calibration process of the simulator and make use of the retrospective accident data that was available in Eurocontrol collected using the HERA classification scheme. The resulting approach can interact with standard risk assessment methodologies in order to analyze the criticalities arising from human performance in the ATC working contexts in the light of past experience...|$|R
