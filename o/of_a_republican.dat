5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v. Holland, which he claimed could give international treaties and agreements precedence over the United States Constitution and {{could be used by}} foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> president and Congress in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for ratification.|$|E
5|$|Long {{began his}} {{involvement}} in politics {{at the local level}} in Hingham in 1870. Temperance was a major issue which dominated his political beliefs. His early politics was somewhat independent: he supported the reformist Republican Benjamin Butler for governor in 1871, but received an unsolicited Democratic nomination later that year for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He did not campaign, and lost the election. Nominated by both Democrats and reformist Republicans in 1872, he lost again. He thereafter became more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> stalwart, convinced that reform would be best accomplished from within the party organization.|$|E

5|$|McKinley campaigned widely for Republicans in the 1894 midterm congressional elections; many party {{candidates}} in districts where he spoke were successful. His political efforts in Ohio were rewarded {{with the election}} in November 1895 <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> successor as governor, Asa Bushnell, and a Republican legislature that elected Foraker to the Senate. McKinley supported Foraker for Senate and Bushnell (who was of Foraker's faction) for governor; in return, the new senator-elect agreed to back McKinley's presidential ambitions. With party peace in Ohio assured, McKinley turned to the national arena.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. V. Hickman {{took over}} from Caine as {{commanding}} officer on 26 August 1968 {{and the rest}} of the year was uneventful for the RLI. The same was not true, however, for the Rhodesian government, which on 20 September 1968 accepted an invitation from Wilson for a new round of talks, this time aboard HMS Fearless, anchored off Gibraltar, for four days starting on 9 October 1968. These ended without agreement on the evening of 13 October 1968, when Smith flew back to Rhodesia. Unsuccessful attempts by both sides to salvage an accord from the Fearless talks continued for months afterwards but ultimately Smith's government resolved that compromise was impossible. It prepared a new constitution of its own and on 20 June 1969 called a constitutional referendum, polling public opinion on both the new constitution and the adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> form of government. The electorate firmly backed both of these proposals. As a result, Rhodesia became a republic with the new constitution in place on 2 March 1970.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} Positivists in Brazil was Lieutenant-colonel Benjamim Constant, a professor in the Military Academy. Although admired to the point of veneration by the young cadets, he was completely unknown to the public. Constant and other Positivist instructors inculcated students with his ideology. Gradually consigned to the background of the Academy's curriculum were military exercises and military studies of Antoine-Henri Jomini and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, replaced by a focus on political discussions and readings from Auguste Comte and Pierre Lafitte. The cadets soon became insubordinate political agitators. Even so, Positivists still expected to make a peaceful transition to their fantasy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> dictatorship and Constant, who had also taught the emperor's grandsons, met with Pedro II and tried to convince him join their cause. Unsurprisingly, given Pedro II's character, this proposal was steadfastly refused, and Constant began to believe that there was no remaining alternative to a coup d'état.|$|E

5|$|Political party {{strength}} in Virginia has likewise been in flux. In the 2007 state elections, Democrats regained {{control of the}} State Senate, and narrowed the Republican majority in the House of Delegates to eight seats. Yet elections in 2009 resulted in the election of Republican Bob McDonnell as Governor by a seventeen-point margin, the election <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, as well as Republican gains of six seats in the House of Delegates. In 2011, the Republican caucus took over two-thirds (68–32) of {{the seats in the}} House of Delegates, and a majority of the Senate based on the Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling as the tie-breaker. Following the 2013 elections, Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected Governor by two percentage points, and Democrat Ralph Northam was elected Lieutenant Governor by double digits. Republicans, however, maintained their super-majority (68–32) in the House of Delegates. State election seasons traditionally start with the annual Shad Planking event in Wakefield.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{effectively}} {{became the}} entirety of Rhodesia in 1964 when Northern Rhodesia became independent as Zambia. After Southern Rhodesia's colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, the anniversary became celebrated as Independence Day. The penultimate Monday in October was designated Republic Day in 1970 following the adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> system of government. All of these holidays were celebrated until 1979, when Rhodesia reconstituted itself under majority rule as the unrecognised state of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. The country's national holidays were replaced soon after with alternatives intended to be more inclusive: President's Day, Unity Day and Ancestors' Day. These were in turn superseded in April 1980, when the country became the recognised state of Zimbabwe. The modern Zimbabwean holiday calendar differs radically from that of Rhodesia, but retains {{every one of the}} traditional holidays defined by name in the 1895 Bills of Exchange Regulations, with the exception of Whit Monday.|$|E
5|$|The army {{is said to}} have {{increased}} from 3,000 to 4,000 men in the 5th century BC, and then again from 4,000 to 6,000 men sometime before 400 BC. This later army of 6,000 men were then divided into 60 centuries of 100 men each. According to Historian P. Fraccaro's hypothesis, when the Roman monarchy was replaced by two praetores in c. 500 BC, the royal legion was divided into two (one for each praetor), each legion comprising 3,000 hoplites. The velites and cavalry were also split equally (1,200 velites and 300 cavalry each), for a total of 4,500 men. This remained the normal size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> legion {{until the end of the}} Social War (88 BC). However, Livy states that a legion at the time of Marcus Furius Camillus (early 4th century BC) consisted of only 3,000 infantry and 300 cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Cooper's {{supporters}} {{believed he}} would again seek the governorship of Kentucky or be {{appointed to the}} Supreme Court of the United States in the early 1950s; some even formed a committee to elect Cooper president. Cooper considered running for governor in 1951, but when Chapman {{was killed in an}} automobile accident on March 8, 1951, he decided to make another run for the Senate against Thomas R. Underwood, Governor Lawrence Wetherby's appointee to fill the vacancy. Underwood was considered a heavy favorite in the race. Some Republicans faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democrat Truman. Both the Louisville Times and the Louisville Courier-Journal recanted their statements in 1950 for Cooper to seek election to the Senate in 1954. They now feared that the election <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> would allow that party to organize the Senate, giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed to continued US involvement in the Korean War. Nevertheless, Cooper defeated Underwood by 29,000 votes in the election and served out the remainder of Chapman's term. His victory marked the first time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been elected to the Senate more than once.|$|E
5|$|Disappointed with Russia's lack {{of support}} for any serious reforms in Poland, he shifted to favoring an {{alliance}} with the Kingdom of Prussia instead. Although this resulted in the split of the anti-royalist opposition, he {{was seen as the}} leader of opposition (the Patriotic Party) when the Great Sejm begun in 1788. After some initial political manevrouving, the issues of a closer relation with Prussia (that would eventually grew into the Polish-Prussian alliance) and a major reform of the government, both with which he was closely involved, begun accelerating in 1789. At first supportive more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> form of a government, political reality (such as royal faction victory at the elections of 1790) resulted in his acceptance of a more constitutional monarchy approach. In 1790, through the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, the king and Potocki begun drifting closer together, working on a draft document that would eventually become the 3 May 1791 constitution. Alongside Poniatowski, Kołłątaj and Piattoli, he is seen as one of the major authors of that document. He supported the quasi-coup d'état in which the constitution was passed on 3 May 1791.|$|E
5|$|Introducing {{more taxes}} {{proved to be}} hugely unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans, {{and the people of}} the state simply did not have that much money to give. Bond issues {{generated}} controversy and were the source of scandals in the administration. All of the old railroad and infrastructure bonds, including the controversial Holford bonds which had already been declared illegal by the Arkansas Supreme Court, were gathered into a funding act and passed by the legislature. Many bonds were issued for roads and railroads that were never built, or were constructed and then torn up and rebuilt in another direction. Some projects even received the same amount of funding from different bonds, such as embankments built for railroads where roads were funded to be built by a different bond. One of the most controversial bonds involved the purchase of slate for a state penitentiary roof, which was diverted for the construction of a mansion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> official J.L. Hodges, who eventually served jail time for the incident. Promissory notes, or scrip, were issued to raise money. The money was used for construction projects, and invested in public infrastructure. Article VI, Sec 10 of the new constitution stated that the credit of the state could not be loaned without the consent of the voters, making these promissory notes illegal. Their introduction also caused actual currency to go out of circulation.|$|E
