5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did, that he had virtually {{nothing to do with}} the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred was {{the first}} {{archbishop}} to place his portrait on the pennies struck in his name which, unlike those of previous archbishops, never made reference to the ruling Mercian king. Wulfred also rebuilt some buildings at Christ Church, Canterbury, {{although it is not}} known whether these were support buildings, such as the dormitory and refractory, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> rebuilt the cathedral itself.|$|E
5|$|A member may be disqualified if he {{is found}} to be of unsound mind, if he becomes {{insolvent}} or is an undischarged bankrupt, {{if he is}} convicted and sentenced to imprisonment of not less than one year or a fine of not less than S$2,000, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has lost his Singaporean citizenship or declared himself allied to a foreign country. Any questions as to membership or disqualification are determined by a tribunal convened in secret that consists of a Supreme Court judge appointed by the Chief Justice and two members appointed by the Council. The Constitution does not stipulate any procedure for the removal of a member besides disqualification and the member's own resignation.|$|E

5|$|Companions {{would have}} {{followed}} commands {{to the best}} of their ability, but in accordance with their personality; for example, a berserker-type companion told to attack aggressively would charge into melee combat, while an assassin-type companion would attempt to hide, and then creep about knocking foes unconscious or backstabbing. In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support by attacking the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> or she came close to dying.|$|E
5|$|David John Cawdell Irving (born 24 March 1938) is an English Holocaust denier {{and author}} {{who has written}} on the {{military}} and political history of World War II, {{with a focus on}} Nazi Germany. His works include The Destruction of Dresden (1963), Hitler's War (1977), Churchill's War (1987), and Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich (1996). In his works, he argued that Hitler did not know of the extermination of Jews <b>or,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did, opposed it. Though Irving's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany and his ability to unearth new historical documents.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{was later}} named Archdeacon of Oxford in the Lincoln diocese, {{sometime}} before 1 October 1151, owing the appointment to Chesney. He {{was also a}} canon of Hereford Cathedral, appearing in that capacity in 1173, but it is unclear when exactly he acquired the position. It is also unclear whether he owed this position to his relative Gilbert Foliot, who was bishop of Hereford from 1148 to 1163, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> received the canonry after 1163 through royal influence. Foliot served as a clerk for Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, witnessing three documents for Becket during the period 1162–1164.|$|E

5|$|Guðrøðr Magnússon (fl. 1275), {{also known}} as Godred Magnusson, was an illegitimate son of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles. In 1275, whilst Mann was under Scottish overlordship, Guðrøðr led an {{unsuccessful}} revolt on the island. According to a near contemporary source, over five hundred people {{lost their lives in}} the subsequent Scottish invasion and suppression of the Manx. It is not certain whether Guðrøðr escaped the decisive defeat of the rebels at Battle of Ronaldsway with his life <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was among the slain.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2014 Rudd {{was charged}} with {{attempting}} to procure a murder, threatening to kill, possession of methamphetamine and possession of cannabis, following a police raid on his home. The charge of attempting to procure a murder was withdrawn the following day, but the other charges remained. AC/DC released a statement clarifying that the tour promoting Rock or Bust would continue, but did not say whether or not Rudd would participate, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was still {{a member of the}} band.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} chronicles that mention Breton's death {{also note that}} he was the author of a legal {{treatise}} entitled le Bretoun, but this cannot be the surviving work called Britton, {{at least not in the}} current form, as that work discusses laws composed 15 years after Breton's death. It is unclear why he was credited with the work, and whether this attribution is just a confusion of Breton with the real author <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did in fact author the work, which was later revised. The fact that the Britton is written in French, not Latin, and that it contains little information about the theory of law, being mostly concerned with the practical application of laws, points rather strongly to an author who was a royal justice, which Breton was.|$|E

5|$|After the {{rejection}} of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 {{he was able to}} tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.|$|E
5|$|During Godwin's exile, Robert {{is said to}} {{have been}} sent by the king on an errand to William, Duke of Normandy. The reason for the embassy is uncertain. William of Jumièges says that Robert went to tell Duke William that Edward wished William to be his heir. The medieval writer William of Poitiers gives the same reason, but also adds that Robert took with him as hostages Godwin's son Wulfnoth and {{grandson}} Hakon (son of Sweyn). The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is silent on the visit however, so it is uncertain whether Robert visited Normandy or not, or why he did so. The entire history of the various missions which Robert is alleged to have made is confused, and complicated by propaganda claims made by Norman chroniclers after the Norman Conquest in 1066, leaving it unclear if Robert visited Normandy on his way to receive his pallium or after Godwin was in exile, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> went twice or not at all.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Hokies {{averaged}} 29.3 {{points per game}} and scored at least 21 points in 22 consecutive games—a streak dating to the 1995 season. Virginia Tech's offense was led on the field by quarterback Al Clark, who passed for 1,476 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also ran for 344 yards during the regular season. At the beginning of December, however, Clark underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in order to repair damaged cartilage in the joint. Due to the long recovery time involved with the surgery, it was questioned if he would play in the Gator Bowl <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{would be able to}} play at full strength. Four days prior to the game, Clark's presence at the game was put even more in doubt when he caught the flu and developed a 102-degree fever. Clark's backup, redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Sorensen, completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts during the season for 140 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
5000|$|He has not {{appeared}} publicly {{since the}} court case and his current whereabouts are of considerable interest to fans of early Deep Purple. In 2015, Ian Paice said: [...] "If anyone knows where Rod is <b>or</b> even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{is still on}} the planet, that would be good news. We haven't had contact with him since the late 1970s. Nobody seems to know where the hell <b>he</b> is, <b>or</b> even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is still alive. Not a clue." ...|$|R

5|$|Eorpwald was {{the first}} English king to be killed because of his Christian faith. The {{circumstances}} are not recorded, {{so that it is}} not known whether Ricberht was representative of an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was an emissary from abroad wishing to diminish Edwin of Northumbria's influence over the East Angles. The return of East Anglia to pagan rule {{does not necessarily mean that}} there was an overt struggle between the worship of the Anglo-Saxon gods and the worship of Christ, but could express a reaction away from Christianity amongst the East Angles, prompted by Edwin's rise to power and his subsequent dominance over their king. The ancestry of Ricberht is unknown and it is unclear as to whether he ever ruled after he killed Eorpwald, but in 630 or 631, three years after Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from exile in Gaul and became king of the East Angles.|$|E
5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska was a 1946 sorrel mare sired by Leo {{and out of}} Jenny Dee, a {{daughter}} of Jimmie Allred. Her dam (mother) was out of a mare named Big Bay, who was of unknown breeding. Jimmie Allred was sired by Dan whose father was Old Joe Bailey. Jimmie Allred's dam was Alice McGill who was sired by Little Hickory Bill, a son of Hickory Bill who was sired by Peter McCue Garrett's Miss Pawhuska was bred by Bill Rowe of Carlsbad, New Mexico, {{but by the time}} she was a yearling she was owned by Earl Jackson, of Pawhuska, Oklahoma. It isn't clear if Jackson bought Garrett's Miss Pawhuska as a foal <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> bought Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's dam while she was still carrying Garrett's Miss Pawhuska.|$|E
5|$|Jardine was not {{successful}} in the final Test, won by Australia. He {{was used as an}} opener, due to an injury to Sutcliffe, and made just 19 and a first ball duck. Once both of his innings were completed, on the fifth day of a match which lasted eight days, he left the match and set off across Australia to catch a boat to India for a holiday. It is not clear if this was planned <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had simply had enough. Jardine never provided an explanation, to the Australian press nor afterwards. Later, Jardine wrote about the Australian crowds, complaining over their involvement, but praising their knowledge and judgement of the game and describing them as more informed than English crowds. He also expressed later reservations to Bob Wyatt about Percy Chapman, saying that he would have shot him if a gun was available. Jardine did not appear in first-class cricket in the 1929 season due to business commitments.|$|E

Dragon also shares a connection with Axel's father, being that he knows {{who he is and}} knowledgeable and at least one Jo-Lan attack that only Manning knew. Eventually it was revealed that Dragon was actually a clone of Manning. Though many, including Axel and Paine, think he's dead, there is no real clear answer <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> alive.|$|R
