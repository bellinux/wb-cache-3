Among other notable MPs who failed to hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> seats were former Minister for Agriculture Juha Korkeaoja of the Centre Party, the vice-chairman of the Centre Party Timo Kaunisto and Marja Tiura of the NCP, who had been elected with {{the highest number of}} votes for a female candidate in the 2007 election.|$|E
5|$|Barbadian {{traditional}} {{folk songs}} are {{heavily influenced by}} the music of England. Many traditional songs concern events current {{at the time of}} their composition, such as the emancipation of the slaves of Barbados, and the coronations of Victoria, George V, and Elizabeth II; this song tradition dates back to 1650. The most influential Barbadian folk songs are associated with the island's lower-class laborers, who have held <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> folk heritage.|$|E
5|$|The new {{research}} suggests that the rocky centres of super-Earths are unlikely to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of our Solar System because they appear to hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of rock with a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope.|$|E

5|$|While recent discoveries {{have made}} it more {{difficult}} to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton, or are clear descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> descendants. Such modifications, originating in the most recent common ancestor of a certain taxonomic group, are called the synapomorphies of such a group.|$|E
5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen {{to focus on}} the element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the LCP(R)s in {{the first}} wave veered off course to the left, landing between Siki Creek and the rocks of the {{headland}} between Siki Cove and Arndt Point. All the boats landed successfully except for one carrying 11 Platoon of the 2/15th Infantry Battalion, which had broken down and was towed by the LCP(R) carrying 10 Platoon, delaying both. Another LCP(R) appeared and took the platoon in. But {{only three of the}} sixteen landed on Scarlet Beach. In some ways this was good, as it meant that the plywood landing craft were not subjected to intense machine gun fire, which might have caused heavy casualties; but there were still serious disadvantages to landing on the wrong beach. On the right, Captain T. C. Sheldon's B Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, accompanied by the anti-tank platoon and 10 Platoon the Papuan Infantry Battalion, landed roughly where they were supposed to, and pushed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> objective, North Hill.|$|E

5|$|From 1921–22, {{the third}} tier of The Football League {{consisted}} of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the Second Division and also battling to hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> league status. There was a re-election system in place which meant the bottom two teams {{in each of the}} two divisions had to apply for re-election to the league. Watford finished outside the top six league positions in every season between 1922 and 1934. Following Kent's departure in 1926, they finished 21st out of 22 clubs in 1926–27, but were unanimously re-elected to the league after a ballot of clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League. By contrast, under Neil McBain and subsequently Bill Findlay, the team recorded five consecutive top six finishes between 1934–35 and 1938–39, and won the Football League Third Division South Cup in 1937. The Football League was suspended in 1939 due to the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton {{assigned}} {{himself as}} navigator on the older EB-66C, which was configured to gather signals intelligence. The newer EB-66E was tasked with jamming surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar guidance systems so their missiles could not accurately target the aircraft. The EB-66's {{mission was to}} troll for missiles, let them lock <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aircraft, and then execute a SAM break, a violent turn and dive designed to throw off the pursuing missile. The SA-2 {{was the size of}} a telephone pole and carried a proximity fused warhead that was lethal within about , but their guidance systems failed at about 2 Gs, while the EB-66 could achieve 5 Gs in its avoidance maneuver. The crew had successfully pulled a SAM break more than 100 times. The presence of North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles south of the DMZ had been tracked by Hambleton, but not everyone agreed they were present that far south.|$|E
5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E

5|$|In January 2004, he {{was voted}} by league fans to the {{starting}} lineup of the NHL All-Star Game. Representing the Western Conference alongside Näslund and Canucks head coach Marc Crawford, they were defeated by the East 6–4. Bertuzzi had two assists while playing on a line with Näslund and Joe Sakic. Nearing {{the end of the}} 2003–04 season, Bertuzzi was indefinitely suspended by the NHL for punching Colorado Avalanche forward Steve Moore from behind during a game on March 8, 2004. His actions were a retaliation to a hit from Moore on Näslund during a previous game. Sitting out the remainder of the regular season and playoffs due to his suspension, he finished 2003–04 with 60 points over 69 games. Vancouver replaced Bertuzzi on the team's top line with Matt Cooke and went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> first Northwest Division title, before being eliminated {{in the first round of}} the 2004 playoffs by the Calgary Flames.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 173, the Iazyges {{launched}} a raid across the frozen Danube, but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed {{them back to the}} Danube. The Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack and scatter them as they tried to cross the frozen Danube, knowing that the Roman legionaries were not trained to fight on ice, and that their own horses had been trained to fight on ice without slipping. However the Roman army formed a solid square and dug into the ice with their shields, so that they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counterattacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> spears, clothing and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after having slipped on the ice, and the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, literally tooth and nail battles, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges, and presumably the Sarmatians in general, were declared the primary enemy of Rome.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of March 12, elements of the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division were dropped off at designated landing zones around Phuoc An. Initially about 100 South Vietnamese helicopters participated in the operation, and 81 fighter-bombers were deployed to strike at North Vietnamese positions to cover the landings. At 3:10pm, Phu took off in his Cessna U-17 to direct the operation over the skies of Ban Me Thuot. As he approached the battlefield, Phu phoned the South Vietnamese units at Hoa Binh airfield to notify them that an operation was underway, and he encouraged the soldiers to hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> positions. On the morning of March 13, another 145 helicopters were used to complete {{the first phase of}} the operation with the entire 44th Infantry Regiment, the last soldiers of the 45th Infantry Regiment, and the 232nd Artillery Battalion dropped off at various points in Nong Trai, Phuoc An and along Highway 21. At the completion of the landing operation, Phu returned to Pleiku to have a meeting with Thieu, during which they discussed the sudden appearance of the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} day of the battle, news reached the Allies that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened; they {{therefore}} resolved to maintain their position. They staged a hit-and-run attack on some Cilician ships, capturing and destroying them. On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked the Allies lines in full force. In a day of savage fighting, the Allies held <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> position, but suffered severe losses (half the Athenian fleet was damaged); nevertheless, the Allies inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet. That evening, the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allies at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{threatened}} by humans indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern fur seals and brown fur seals. Pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are {{near the top of}} food chains and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers, decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and underwater noise.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, {{had managed}} to block the North Korean's advance to Yongsan while the 19th Infantry was able to push it back and inflict {{substantial}} casualties. However, by the evening of August 6, KPA held firmly <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> bridgehead. Attempted crossings that night were repulsed to the south by South Korean forces, but {{an unknown number of}} reinforcements were moved across the river the night of August 6–7. On August 7–8, the North Koreans tried to move two more battalions across the river to the north, but were repulsed by 21st Infantry, which was still in place. The KPA battalions were shifted south to cross at the bridgehead, instead. By August 8, an estimated regiment of North Korean troops were across the Naktong.|$|E

5|$|The {{morning of}} December 30, the 4th South Vietnamese Marine Battalion {{moved out to}} Biên Hòa Air Base, waiting to be airlifted into the battlefield. The 1/4th Marine Battalion was the first unit to arrive on the {{outskirts}} of Bình Giã, but the 1st Company commander decided to secure the landing zone, to wait {{for the rest of the}} battalion to arrive instead of moving <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> objective. After the rest of the 4th Marine Battalion had arrived, they marched towards the Catholic church to relieve the besieged Rangers. About one and a half hours later, the 4th Marine Battalion linked up with the 30th, 33rd and 38th Ranger Battalions, as the Viet Cong began withdrawing to the northeast. That afternoon the 4th Marine Battalion recaptured the village, but the Viet Cong was nowhere to be seen, as all their units had withdrawn from the village during the previous night, linking with other Viet Cong elements in the forest to attack the government relief forces. On the evening of December 30, the Viet Cong returned to Bình Giã and attacked from the south-eastern perimeter of the village. The local villagers, who discovered the approaching Viet Cong, immediately sounded the alarm to alert the ARVN soldiers defending the village. The South Vietnamese were able to repel the Viet Cong, with support from U.S. Army helicopter gunships flown out from Vung Tau airbase.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Roman {{education}} was moral and practical. Stories about great men and women, or cautionary tales about individual failures, {{were meant to}} instil Roman values (mores maiorum). Parents and family members were expected to act as role models, and parents who worked for a living passed their skills <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> children, who might also enter apprenticeships for more advanced training in crafts or trades. Formal {{education was}} available only to children from families who could pay for it, {{and the lack of}} state intervention in access to education contributed to the low rate of literacy.|$|E
5|$|Whales {{can also}} be {{threatened}} by humans more indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries as bycatch and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in whales and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include beaked whales. Whales are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are high in the food chain. They have large reserves of blubber, more so for toothed whales as they are higher up the food chain than baleen whales. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. They {{can also be}} poisoned by swallowing litter, such as plastic bags. Environmentalists speculate that advanced naval sonar endangers some whales. Some scientists suggest that sonar may trigger whale beachings, and they point to signs that such whales have experienced decompression sickness.|$|E
