5|$|Although {{the bailout}} support {{programme}} feature sufficient financial transfers until March 2016, Cyprus began slowly to regain its {{access to the}} private lending markets already in June 2014.

The Cypriot minister of finance recently confirmed, that the government plan to issue two new European Medium Term Note (EMTN) bonds in 2015, likely shortly ahead of the expiry of another €1.1bn bond on 1 July and a second expiry of a €0.9bn bond on 1 November.

40|$|Abstract—The method <b>of</b> <b>completing</b> {{the squares}} {{is a method}} {{that is used to}} {{transform}} a math formula directionally in order to obtain a perfect square formula by making rational use of “splitting items ” and “adding items”. Least square estimation consists of the method of projection, the method of derivative and the method <b>of</b> <b>completing</b> the squares. By comparing and analyzing the three methods, the conclusion has been drawn that the method <b>of</b> <b>completing</b> the squares is the best, as it provides the necessary conditions in which the objective function can reduce to minimum. Such methods as solving Wiener filtering and system identification have been taken as examples to illustrate that not only optimal estimation but also the extreme value of the objective function can be obtained if the method <b>of</b> <b>completing</b> the squares is applied rationally into solving problems of least squares.

5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of the partial aether-dragging hypothesis, another major problem arose with the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887). In Fresnel's theory, the aether is almost stationary, so the experiment should have given a positive result. However, the result of this experiment was negative. Thus from the viewpoint of the aether models at that time, the experimental situation was contradictory: On one hand, the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment and the repetition by Michelson and Morley in 1886 appeared to support partial aether-dragging. On the other hand, the Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is at rest with respect to Earth, apparently supporting the idea <b>of</b> <b>complete</b> aether-dragging (see aether drag hypothesis). So the very success of Fresnel's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis, which was not resolved until the development of the theory of special relativity.|$|E
5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} significant amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies <b>of</b> <b>complete</b> vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption that common genetic variation plays {{a large role in}} explaining the heritable variation of common disease. This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure. Alternative strategies suggested involve linkage analysis. More recently, the rapidly decreasing price <b>of</b> <b>complete</b> genome sequencing have also provided a realistic alternative to genotyping array-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the use of this new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the shortcomings of non-sequencing GWA.|$|E
5|$|In these diseases, {{antibodies}} {{are mainly}} directed against {{two of the}} proteins of the complex, called PM/Scl-100 (the RNase D like protein) and PM/Scl-75 (one of the RNase PH like proteins from the ring) and antibodies recognizing these proteins are found in approximately 30% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Although these two proteins are the main target of the autoantibodies, other exosome subunits and associated proteins (like C1D) can be targeted in these patients. At the current time, the most sensitive way to detect these antibodies is by using a peptide, derived from the PM/Scl-100 protein, as the antigen in an ELISA, instead <b>of</b> <b>complete</b> proteins. By this method, autoantibodies are found in up to 55% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, {{but they can also}} be detected in patients suffering from either scleroderma, polymyositis, or dermatomyositis alone.|$|E

The slow movements of the quintet and the B-flat Sonata bear striking similarities in their main sections: both employ the same unique textural layout, in which two-three voices sing long notes in the middle register, accompanied by the contrasted, short pizzicato notes of the other voices, in the lower and upper registers; in both movements, the long notes over the relentless ostinato rhythm, convey an atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>complete</b> stillness, of arrest of all motion and time. String quintet textures also appear elsewhere, throughout the sonata trilogy.|$|E

Greece became the “motherland of the arts” and “the teacher of taste”.|$|E

40|$|Background: Competitive boxers from {{southern}} region of Sweden, performed three different strength and power {{tests in the}} upper and lower body - body weight-relative standing rotational power (RSRP), countermovement jump (CMJ) and handgrip strength (HGS) - to evaluate correlations between number <b>of</b> <b>completed</b> bouts and the tests. Aim: The aim of this thesis was to investigate the linear correlation between number <b>of</b> <b>completed</b> bouts and three different tests – RSRP, CMJ and HGS in 16 male senior boxers. Methods: Male boxers, (n= 16; 23 ± 5 years; 76 ± 11 kg bodyweight; 177 ± 5 cm tall) from three different boxing competitive levels (C≤ 5 contests, B= 6 - 14 contests and A ≥ 15 contests) in the senior ranks (age 17 - 40) volunteered from several boxing clubs in Sweden. Participants performed the tests RSRP, CMJ and HGS and a correlation was made between the tests results and number <b>of</b> <b>completed.</b> Results: There was a positive moderate correlation (rs= 0. 406) between CMJ and number <b>of</b> <b>completed</b> bouts and positive weak correlations (rs= 0. 268, rs= 0. 200) between RSRP and HGS and number <b>of</b> <b>completed</b> bouts. Conclusions: Weak and moderate correlations between the number <b>of</b> <b>completed</b> bouts in boxers and the strength and power tests in this study show that these tests do not necessary measure attributes needed in boxing. The three tests RSRP, CMJ and HGS can be relevant tests for evaluating upper and lower body strength and power, but their relevance should be reevaluated. There can be study designs with lower risk for bias as number <b>of</b> <b>completed</b> bouts {{does not seem to be}} the right variable for such correlation. ...|$|R
