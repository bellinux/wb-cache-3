5|$|The {{story is}} about Dylan, a {{depressed}} college student who attempts suicide. He survives due to unlikely events, but is soon visited by a demon who explains he spared Dylan's life. In exchange, Dylan {{will be allowed to}} live one more month for every person he kills. Brubaker said he chose to make the character young because he wanted to include the <b>optimism</b> <b>of</b> youth. The comic examines the consequences of vigilante violence and its effects on Dylan’s loved ones. The story debuted to mostly positive reviews. Some reviewers felt it was too similar to Brubaker and Phillips' previous collaborations.|$|E
5|$|The prose play Edwards Dream (Eduards Traum) was {{released}} in 1891, composed of several small grouped episodes, rather than one linear storyline. The work received mixed reception. Joseph Kraus felt it was the peak of Busch's life's work, his nephews called it a masterwork of world literature, and the publisher of a critical collective edition spoke of a narrative style that is not found in contemporary literature. Eva Weissweiler saw in the play Busch's attempt to prove himself in the novella genre, believing that everything that angered or insulted him, and his accompanying emotional depths, are apparent in the story. The 1895 story The Butterfly (Der Schmetterling) parodies themes and motifs and ridicules the religious <b>optimism</b> <b>of</b> a German romanticism which contradicted Busch's realistic anthropology influenced by Schopenhauer and Charles Darwin. Its prose is more stringent in narrative style compared to Edwards Dream. Both were not popular amongst readers, because of their unfamiliar style.|$|E

40|$|This article {{builds on}} earlier research, which concludes that {{societies}} cannot sustain themselves without cultures <b>of</b> <b>optimism.</b> These cultures are reproduced by {{a complex of}} ‘optimism promoters’, {{all of which can}} be seen to be engaged in a kind of unstated or ‘implicit’ cultural policy, with the production <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> as one <b>of</b> its goals. The institution of religion is part of this complex. Its role in the production <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> is the focus of this article, with particular reference to soteriology (theories of salvation) and eschatology. From a ‘detached’ and ‘functionalist’ perspective, it analyses how religions manufacture hope through (1) the production of meaning; (2) through their models of divine justice; and (3) through theories of ultimate destiny. These matters are discussed in relation to Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. The article concludes that the <b>optimisms</b> <b>of</b> religion are of a quite different order from those promoted by other institutions...|$|R
40|$|One hundred twenty-two {{undergraduate}} {{students at the}} University of North Texas were administered several different optimism scales and also measures of similar constructs such as hope.

Additionally, factor analysis confirmed that the measures <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> actually appear to be assessing multiple factors and not necessarily <b>optimism</b> alone.

In the city budget, which is still having to make provisions for the repair of the damage done in the horrendous 1988 earthquake, the metro clearly lacks any priority. All of the major works started in the late 1980s are currently frozen.|$|E

40|$|Optimism is a {{cognitive}} construct (expectancies regarding future outcomes) that also relates to motivation: optimistic people exert effort, whereas pessimistic people disengage from effort. Study <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> began largely in health contexts, finding positive associations between <b>optimism</b> and markers <b>of</b> better {{psychological and physical}} health. Physical health effects likely occur through differences in both health-promoting behaviors and physiological concomitants of coping.

25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and the {{beginning}} of the era of sustained economic expansion coincided during the 1990s.

In 2000, Vicente Fox became the first non-PRI candidate to win the Mexican presidency in over 70 years. The <b>optimism</b> <b>of</b> the 1990s was shattered by the 9/11 attacks of 2001 on the United States, which prompted military intervention in Afghanistan, which also involved Canada.

25|$|In the Preface to Civilization and Ethics (1923) {{he argued}} that Western {{philosophy}} from Descartes to Kant had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be {{found to have a}} special meaning within it. But no such meaning was found, and the rational, life-affirming <b>optimism</b> <b>of</b> the Age of Enlightenment began to evaporate. A rift opened between this world-view, as material knowledge, and the life-view, understood as Will, expressed in the pessimist philosophies from Schopenhauer onward. Scientific materialism (advanced by Herbert Spencer and Charles Darwin) portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics, entirely an expression of the will-to-live.|$|E
25|$|Although {{research}} {{has suggested that}} {{it is very difficult to}} eliminate the bias, some factors may help in closing the gap of the optimistic bias between an individual and their target risk group. First, by placing the comparison group closer to the individual, the optimistic bias can be reduced: studies found that when individuals were asked to make comparisons between themselves and close friends, there was almost no difference in the likelihood of an event occurring. Additionally, actually experiencing an event leads to a decrease in the optimistic bias. While this only applies to events with prior experience, knowing the previously unknown will result in less <b>optimism</b> <b>of</b> it not occurring.|$|E

Combined with the effects of a slowdown in the global economy in 1970, the voters elected the PNP (People's National Party) in 1972. They tried to implement more socially equitable policies in education and health, but the economy suffered under their leadership. By 1980, Jamaica's gross national product had declined to some 25% below the 1972 level. Due to rising foreign and local debt, accompanied by large fiscal deficits, the government sought International Monetary Fund (IMF) financing from the United States and others.|$|E
25|$|Malthus came to {{prominence}} for his 1798 essay on population growth.

25|$|The <b>optimism</b> <b>of</b> la belle époque was destroyed, {{and those}} who had fought in the war were {{referred}} to as the Lost Generation. For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled. Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from shell shock (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to posttraumatic stress disorder). Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status. Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, Paul Fussell, and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.|$|E
