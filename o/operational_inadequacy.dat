40|$|Plasmodium vivax is {{the most}} {{widespread}} human malaria, putting 2. 5 billion people at risk of infection. Its unique biological and epidemiological characteristics pose challenges to control strategies that have been principally targeted against Plasmodium falciparum Unlike P. falciparum, P. vivax infections have typically low blood-stage parasitemia with gametocytes emerging before illness manifests, and dormant liver stages causing relapses. These traits affect both its geographic distribution and transmission patterns. Asymptomatic infections, high-risk groups, and resulting case burdens are described in this review. Despite relatively low prevalence measurements and parasitemia levels, along with high proportions of asymptomatic cases, this parasite is not benign. Plasmodium vivax {{can be associated with}} severe and even fatal illness. Spreading resistance to chloroquine against the acute attack, and the <b>operational</b> <b>inadequacy</b> of primaquine against the multiple attacks of relapse, exacerbates the risk of poor outcomes among the tens of millions suffering from infection each year. Without strategies accounting for these P. vivax-specific characteristics, progress toward elimination of endemic malaria transmission will be substantially impeded...|$|E

Their attention can be distracted away from the educational focus intended by designers and teachers through poor design and <b>operational</b> <b>inadequacy.</b> In this paper we describe a study of groups of learners using a multimedia CD-ROM research tool called Galapagos. This tool was developed to enable us to observe groups of learners interacting with {{different versions of the}} same multimedia content. These different versions implemented different forms of guidance for learners both within the presented narrative structure of the material and in the tools offered to learners to help them build the individual content elements into a coherent whole. Our empirical work was conducted with groups of learners within their educational establishment using the Galapagos CD-ROM as part of their studies for national examinations in Biology. Their sessions with Galapagos were recorded using video and audio and our analysis of their dialogue has enabled us to gain a greater understanding of the factors that contribute to productive, educationally focused learning interactions. Through the construction of different representations {{we have been able to}} coordinate information about interactivity between learners and system at the interface wit...|$|E

5|$|The {{project that}} {{eventually}} led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the <b>operational</b> <b>inadequacies</b> of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful Pegasus engine to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Due to budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.|$|R
40|$|In 1996, the Victorian Liberal Kennett Government {{embarked}} on an ambitious experiment on the State&# 039;s land use planning system by introducing the Victoria Planning Provisions (VPP). Since then, seven official reports have been made on aspects of this system. All have referred to <b>operational</b> <b>inadequacies</b> but none has proposed major changes. The Whitney Committee (2002), for example, argued that the system was inefficient and uncertain but concluded that the system was experiencing "teething problems" and was not in crisis. Better Decisions Faster (DSE 2003) recommended 18 measures to reduce the volume of permits and processing delays, and increase consistency in decision making. But despite promises by both the former Victorian Liberal (Maclellan 1996) and the current Labor (Thwaites 1999) governments, {{the system is not}} properly monitored and no comprehensive review of its performance by a state government has been carried out...|$|R
50|$|The {{technical}} and <b>operational</b> <b>inadequacies</b> of the pontoon bridge - disruption of shipping, low carrying capacity and costly operation - {{led to the}} construction of the first fixed bridge at Maxau in the 1930s. The inauguration of the new bridge was celebrated on 17 January 1938 (road bridge) and on 3 April 1938 (rail bridge). The bridge had a central pillar, the structure was divided into two spans that were 175 m and 117 m long. It had two superstructures in steel truss construction: one superstructure, which accommodated the two-track railway line, and one superstructure for the road. The new Rhine bridge was damaged in 1945 {{at the end of the}} Second World War during an air raid. On 21 March 1945, an American artillery grenade hit a detonator and thereby triggered the demolition of the bridge prepared by German troops (see Operation Undertone).|$|R

50|$|Two {{trials in}} Northern Nigeria {{combined}} multiple rounds of MDA and insecticide spraying. The first trial, in Kankiya, included 11 rounds of MDA combined with 8 rounds of DDT indoor spraying. The study {{was based on}} computer-aided models that showed that MDA could eradicate malaria {{in the study area}} if combined with an appropriate ‘insecticide attack’. Following MDAs, parasite prevalence dropped from 19% to 1%. The investigators did not consider this a success because parasite prevalence increased again after the interventions were stopped. Entomological indices also showed only a temporary reduction in transmission, which was completely reversed after the control measures ceased. Because the investigators felt that the failure of the trial to interrupt transmission was due to <b>operational</b> <b>inadequacies,</b> they recommended a much larger and more sophisticated evaluation of insecticide spraying combined with MDA. This recommendation helped to launch the Garki project, also in Northern Nigeria, in 1969. In the Garki project, all 164 study villages in the catchment area were sprayed with propoxur, a residual insecticide. In addition, in 60 villages, MDA with sulfalene / pyrimethamine was given at 10-week intervals for two years. In two small village clusters, house spraying was supplemented with larvicide and MDA every two weeks. With biweekly MDA, parasite prevalence fell to 1% in the dry season and to 5% in the rainy season. MDA given every 10 weeks resulted in a parasite prevalence of 2% in the dry season and 28% in the rainy season. Transmission was not interrupted with either MDA regime. The authors concluded that spraying of residual insecticides and MDA did not result in a sustainable interruption of malaria transmission.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Political Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 The {{perpetual}} {{conflict in}} Darfur, Sudan, which started anew in 2003, had dire humanitarian consequences and threatened {{international peace and}} security. The UN Security Council, which has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, adopted Resolution 1769 on 31 July 2007 and authorised a 26 000 person-strong joint African Union/United Nations hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID) to take over from AMIS (the African Union peace operation in Darfur). UNAMID was established with dual command and control linked to both the African Union and the United Nations and both organisations would have an equal say in its mandate and operations. Given this unique and unprecedented arrangement between a regional organisation and the United Nations in terms of maintaining international peace and security, {{the aim of this}} research was to: • Understand and describe the political motivations/reasons why the United Nations formed a hybrid peace operation with the African Union; • Establish in which way the aforementioned impacted on future efforts of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security, especially on the African continent; and, based on this, • To determine whether or not hybrid operations were a viable alternative for the United Nations to maintain international peace and security. By means of a thorough analysis of the theoretical underpinnings of international peace and security, an assessment of the peace and security architecture of the United Nations and the African Union, an investigation into the origins of the Darfur conflict, an examination of the structure and mandate of UNAMID, and through an empirical investigation, a new theoretical proposition is provided in the conclusion of the thesis. It is concluded that the UNAMID model, in practical terms, is not an optimal mechanism for the United Nations to use to maintain international peace and security because it suffers from numerous internal political inequities and <b>operational</b> <b>inadequacies.</b> Doctora...|$|R
