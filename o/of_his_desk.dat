5|$|Sarah (Hana Hayes) is Joel's twelve-year-old daughter, whom he {{had when}} he was in his late teens, and the game's first playable character. The posters and photos on her wall suggest that she was a keen soccer player. At the start of the game, she gives her father a new watch for his birthday. In the early hours of the next day, she is awoken by a commotion and the sound of Tommy phoning Joel. Later, Joel bursts into his office, pulls a {{revolver}} out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> drawer and shoots their neighbor. Sarah leaves with Tommy and Joel, but her leg is hurt in a crash, forcing Joel to carry her. On the outskirts of their hometown, they come across a soldier, who follows his orders and shoots at them. Sarah is fatally wounded by bullets and dies in Joel's arms.|$|E
5|$|The man is now standing, {{his arms}} crossed, and watches with {{pleasure}} as Beyoncé continues the private dance. After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a stack of papers off <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently there all along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while their hair is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their hair back and forth. The video ends with a fade to black as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most other}} things in Wolfe's life, his beer {{drinking}} is bound by ritual. Seated at his desk, Wolfe presses the button twice to ring for beer, and Fritz delivers the bottles unopened; Wolfe uncaps the bottles himself, using an 18-carat gold bottle opener {{given to him by}} a satisfied client. He never drinks directly from the bottle, but instead pours the beer into a glass and lets the foam settle to an appropriate level before drinking. He keeps the gold opener in the center drawer <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> where he also keeps the bottlecaps as a means of tracking his daily/weekly consumption.|$|E
50|$|From {{that day}} Picquart's removal was decided. He was {{authorized}} {{for the sake}} of appearances to continue his investigations concerning Esterhazy, but he was forbidden to take any decisive steps or to have Esterhazy arrested. Picquart found that ordinary measures - secret searches in <b>his</b> rooms, opening <b>of</b> <b>his</b> correspondence, examination <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>desks</b> - were <b>of</b> no avail, because Esterhazy had been warned.|$|R

25|$|After {{his father}} {{received}} a rabbinic appointment, the Ansbacher {{family moved to}} Wiesbaden in 1925, where Joseph attended the Staatliche Gymnasium. When the Nazis took power in Germany in January 1933, {{he was one of}} only seven Jews in a student body of around 600, and the only Jew in his class. He endured three years of harassment including an antisemitic insult carved into the top <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> and other students singing popular songs calling for the murder of the Jews. In 1936, all Jewish students were expelled from the public schools, and his parents sent him to the Talmud Torah school in Hamburg, led by Rabbi Joseph Carlebach, where he graduated in spring, 1938. Among the frequent guest lecturers in his senior year was Martin Buber.|$|E
500|$|During {{his second}} year of {{teaching}} at Command and General Staff School, one of his students, Dwight D. Eisenhower, would come to his office, sit on the corner <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> and pump him for information, knowing that Middleton had commanded a regiment in combat in France. Eisenhower asked the most practical questions, and was unquestionably motivated—he finished first in his class. [...] Nearly every officer who commanded a division in Europe during World War II attended the Command and General Staff School during Middleton's tenure there from 1924 to 1928. There was also {{a point in time}} during World War II when every corps commander in Europe had been a student of Middleton's.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Zhuge Liang arrived, Cao Cao had already sent Sun Quan a letter boasting of {{commanding}} 800,000 men and hinting {{that he wanted}} Sun to surrender. The faction led by Sun Quan's Chief Clerk, Zhang Zhao, advocated surrender, citing Cao Cao's overwhelming numerical advantage. However, on separate occasions, Lu Su, Zhuge Liang, and Sun Quan's chief commander, Zhou Yu, all presented arguments to persuade Sun Quan {{to agree to the}} alliance against the northerners. Sun Quan finally decided upon war, chopping off a corner <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> during an assembly and stating: [...] "Anyone who still dares argue for surrender will be [...] the same as this desk." [...] He then assigned Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, and Lu Su with 30,000 men to aid Liu Bei against Cao Cao [...]|$|E
60|$|A {{cycle of}} time went by--an eternity, or else a few seconds. Sir Thomas Ryder {{pulled open the}} long drawer <b>of</b> <b>his</b> monumental <b>desk.</b>|$|R

50|$|Prez {{continues}} to have difficulty teaching his problem to his afternoon classes. Children who want to learn are distracted by others who continue to disrupt the class. As he tidies {{up at the end}} of the first day, he finds notes on his problem showing that at least one student was following it. This lifts his mood until he finds a profane graffito about himself on one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>desks.</b> The children refer to him as Prezbo because they cannot pronounce his name.|$|R
500|$|Themes of {{religious}} salvation and allusions to the Bible appear only briefly in Barton Fink, but their presence pervades the story. While Barton is experiencing his most desperate moment {{of confusion and}} despair, he opens the drawer <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> and finds a Gideon Bible. He opens it [...] "randomly" [...] to , and reads from it: [...] "And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill." [...] This passage reflects Barton's inability {{to make sense of}} his own experiences (wherein Audrey has been [...] "cut in pieces"), as well as the [...] "hopes and dreams" [...] of [...] "the common man". Nebuchadnezzar is also the title of a novel that Mayhew gives to Barton as a [...] "little entertainment" [...] to [...] "divert you in your sojourn among the Philistines".|$|E
500|$|Later, Ray Pearce eats at {{a halfway}} house as {{volunteer}} Larina Jackson bothers him. She tries {{to reach out to}} help him but he is completely uninterested in talking with her. Meanwhile, at the salvage yard, Odell is shredding documents when Ray appears. Harry feigns friendliness while he gets the shotgun out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> drawer. He blasts Ray through a sliding glass door. Ray’s detached arm begins to rebuild itself with metal. Harry is transfixed by this sight as Ray kills him. The next morning, Doggett checks out the new murder scene and finds an interesting shredded document. Doggett goes to Chamber Technologies and learns about [...] "smart metals"—metals that rebuild their original forms but are still a metallurgist’s pipe dream at the moment. On the phone, Doggett mentions the [...] "smart metals" [...] and Scully tells Doggett about how Ray Pearce’s medical records show his whole cellular structure was changing due to exposure to an unknown substance. Meanwhile, Larina sees Ray’s obituary in the paper and is watching the television news story about the murder at the salvage yard. She decides to call Ray’s widow.|$|E
2500|$|George Murphy {{was elected}} as the Senator from California in 1964, {{to take office}} the {{following}} year. Murphy, known as a song-and-dance man from musicals such as Broadway Melody of 1938, Broadway Melody of 1940 and For Me and My Gal, had a taste for sweets. A short time after joining the Senate, he started keeping candy in his desk; then, in 1968, he moved desks and {{ended up at the}} spot where the Candy Desk is now situated. Since more senators now passed his desk on a daily basis, he started offering the contents <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> to his colleagues. Senators who were invited to partake in the sweets started calling Murphy's desk the [...] "candy desk". Murphy was defeated in the 1970 Senate elections, but subsequent senators have carried on the tradition of supplying candy in their desk for the enjoyment of the Senate as a whole.|$|E

50|$|When General Potter spared Millford, he did {{not know}} that Manning had a copy of the Articles <b>of</b> Secession in <b>his</b> <b>desk.</b> The story <b>of</b> Millford's {{survival}} might have ended quite differently had he known.|$|R

60|$|He {{ran through}} his life {{insurance}} policies, verifying the permitted suicide clause in each one; signed the tray of letters that had waited his signature since the previous morning; and dictated a letter into the phonograph to the publisher <b>of</b> <b>his</b> books. <b>His</b> <b>desk</b> cleaned, he scrawled a quick summary {{of income and}} expense, with all earnings from the Harvest mines deducted. He transposed the summary into a second summary, increasing the expense margins, and cutting down the income items to an absurdest least possible. Still the result was satisfactory.|$|R
50|$|Jacques Nasser, then a Ford {{executive}} and eventually CEO, {{was very proud}} of the car, and kept a model <b>of</b> it on <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> as seen in a documentary on the U.K. television network Channel 4 on the Firestone tire incidents.|$|R
