He {{had joined the}} series during its second season, and had to quickly {{manufacture}} props while working under time and budget constraints. He explained, [...] " [...] first episode {{we had to make}} the shape-shifter device, the thing that you put into your mouth and it transforms one person into another person. I was brand new here and I wasn’t happy with the way that turned out, and it came back in about 5 or 6 episodes.

500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E
500|$|Root came {{to realise}} {{that while the}} novel's {{narrative}} style allowed Anne's thoughts to come through, the film adaptation offered comparatively little dialogue. As a result, she [...] "had to cover pages and pages of the story without uttering anything, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't even think about technique, I just had to keep looking at the [...] and then somehow radiate the feelings". Persuasion was shot in chronological order, which allowed Root to see [...] "what a difference [...] sense of unhappiness can create", as {{by the end of}} the film Anne is [...] "happier and looks better". Root considered the role to be much quieter than her experiences working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth. The Irish actor Ciarán Hinds, who depicted Frederick Wentworth, commented that Austen [...] "understands a man's heart and how delicate it can be sometimes". He also appreciated that, though Wentworth was a [...] "competent leader of men in his profession", he was [...] "socially inept" [...] in Anne's presence. Susan Fleetwood, the actress who played Lady Russell, had also worked with Michell on The Buddha of Suburbia. She died soon after filming; Persuasion was her last film role.|$|E

500|$|Di Grassi {{was handed}} a formal {{reprimand}} by the stewards over the pit stop release that caused Piquet to brake to avoid hitting {{him and was}} fined €1,500. Piquet felt it was not fair for different punishments to exist for the same penalty and was frustrated, complaining of inconsistency from the stewards. He warned drivers would become quickly disenchanted and believed stewards would not be taken seriously in future races. Piquet advocated for more people to observe the track, install more cameras and fit a GPS system in all cars. D'Ambrosio felt aggrieved over the battle between his teammate Duval in the race's closing period, saying the events were [...] "a {{little bit of a}} pity" [...] and was unsure whether it was a misunderstanding. Duval insisted the battle was firm but fair, saying he gave d'Ambrosio room but would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him: [...] "As you have seen in the past though we have had fights and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was really gentle, and this weekend I was in this position where I was competitive and I had less energy available so I fought." [...] Dragon's team principal Jay Penske revealed the drivers were allowed to battle each other cleanly but if one of them eliminated the other from contention, that driver would be required to miss the following race.|$|E
500|$|The {{visits to}} Europe continued. Farmer moved there in 1968 and {{ultimately}} settled in Vienna, where he performed with The Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band {{and joined the}} Austrian Radio Orchestra. The latter job initially required only ten days a month of his time, so {{he was able to}} play with other well-known expatriates such as Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, and Ben Webster. As the orchestra's music gradually changed in style from jazz to simpler forms and took up more of Farmer's time, he found that it was {{getting in the way of}} his musical ambitions, so he left after three or four years. Pursuing these ambitions meant that Farmer traveled extensively worldwide. He said in 1976 that [...] "I'm traveling 90 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> can live anywhere. It's just a matter of getting to the airport". A 1982 revival of the Jazztet, with Golson, led him to play more frequently in the United States than he had over the previous decade. In the 1980s Farmer also created a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan, that toured internationally. In the early 1980s, Farmer had also made some changes to his lifestyle. Interviewed for a 1985 article in The New Yorker, he reported losing 30 pounds in weight a couple of years earlier, and stopping smoking and drinking a couple of years before that; Farmer [...] "used to think he couldn't play without drinking; now he couldn't play and drink", was the interviewer's summary of Farmer's habits, which appear to have avoided the drug-related problems of many of his contemporaries.|$|E
500|$|... "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted similarities between [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] Beyoncé's previous singles including [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] {{and concluded that}} Beyoncé [...] "certainly knows how to dump a man in style". Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] could be [...] "Irreplaceable Part Two" [...] and noted that Beyoncé's vocal performance brings depth to the song. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point [...] "Irreplaceable", but [...] "nor is it as shady". He commended the optimism in the song's lyrics. Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyoncé's vocal performance [...] "as [...] wounded bird turned resilient lioness". Choosing [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] as the highlight of 4, Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as [...] "a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyoncé's ability to plow through it". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted the moderate chart performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)", and wrote: [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] finds Beyoncé mining {{the same kind of}} girl-power imagery as she did on 'Run the World (Girls)'. But there is something more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When I think <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you'). 'Best Thing I Never Had' feels like the kind of crossover hit that will help 4 join the rest of Beyoncé's discography in multiplatinum land.|$|E

2500|$|Gooch had {{a public}} falling-out with David Gower, the England batsman, {{particularly}} after Gower hired a vintage aircraft and 'buzzed' {{the ground where}} England was playing during the unsuccessful tour of Australia in 1990/91. [...] Gooch contributed to the decision to omit Gower from England's tour of India in 1993, which proved so controversial that an extraordinary vote of no confidence in the selectors was passed at the MCC. [...] Gower never played another Test, lending an ironic edge to Gooch's surpassing him as England's leading run scorer in the 1993 Ashes series. It is this {{relationship between the two}} men that perhaps highlights best the differences between their approaches to the game, as Gower himself identified in 1995 in an interview in The Independent [...] "I was never destined to be on the ball 100 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> don't have the same ability that Graham Gooch has, to produce something very close to his best every time he plays.' ...|$|E
