These were subsequently republished in Charles Gardner's 1935 West Australian Wild Flowers. One of the first published colour photographs of the species appeared in William Blackall's 1954 How to know Western Australian wildflowers, but this publication was restricted to plant identification. The species was discussed and illustrated in the 1959 Wildflowers <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> Australia, and in the 1973 Flowers and plants <b>of</b> <b>Western</b> Australia, but these books did not provide cultivation advice either.|$|E
