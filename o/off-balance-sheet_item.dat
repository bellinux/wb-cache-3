40|$|We present new stylized {{facts on}} bank and firm {{leverage}} {{during the period}} 2000 – 2009 using internationally comparable micro level data from many countries. We document the following patterns: a) {{there was an increase}} in leverage for investment banks prior to the sub-prime crisis; b) there was no visible increase in leverage for the typical commercial bank and non-financial firm; c) <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>items</b> constitute a big fraction of assets, especially for large commercial banks in the US, whereas investment banks do not report these items; d) the leverage ratio is procyclical for investment banks and for large commercial banks in the US; e) banks in emerging markets with tighter bank regulation and stronger investor protection experienced significantly less deleveraging during the crisis. The results suggest that excessive risk taking before the crisis was not easily detectable because the risk involved the quality rather than the quantity of assets...|$|R
40|$|Japanese {{banks are}} {{promising}} sources of capital {{for developing countries}} wishing to finance a balance of payments gap. This paper shows that Japanese banks are highly capitalized in terms of market value; much of their capital is"hidden capital,"the divergence between accounting and stock market estimates. The authors developed a method for testing hypotheses about two types of hidden capital: the misvaluation of on-balance-sheet items and intangible values that the General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAPP) currently designates to be unbookable <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>items.</b> They construct a model that explains changes in both types of capital functions of holding-period returns earned in Japan on stocks, bonds, yen, and real estate. They apply the model to annual data for 1975 - 89 and a four-class size/charter participation of the Japanese banking system. For each type of hidden capital and each class of bank, the model develops estimates of the stock market, interest rate, foreign exchange, and real estate sensitivities of returns to bank stockholders. Only the stock market sensitivities prove significant, at 5 percent. Time-series regressions show that the large Japanese banks have developed stock market betas over two and {{that the value of}} the bank's beta has come to increase with measures of its size and accounting leverage.

40|$|This paper {{measures}} and analyzes {{two types of}} hidden capital at Japanese banks: (1) the net undervaluation present in accounting measures of on-balance-sheet assets and liabilities and (2) the net economic value of <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>items.</b> A model is constructed that explains changes in both types of capital as functions of holding that explains changes in both types of capital as functions of holding-period returns earned in Japan on stocks, bonds, yen, and real estate. The model is applied to annual data covering 1975 - 1989 and a four-class size/charter partition of the Japanese banking system. For each type of hidden capital and each class of bank, the model develops estimates of the stock-market, interest-rate, foreign-exchange, and real estate sensitivities of returns to bank stockholders. Only the stock-market sensitivities prove significant at five percent. This finding leads us to investigate {{what happens when we}} analyze Japanese bank stock returns by means of stationary and split-sample market models. Timeseries regressions show that very large Japanese banks have developed stockmarket betas in excess of two and that the value of a bank's beta has come to increase with measures of its size and accounting leverage. Future research will investigate the sensibility of our results to different ways of pooling data from individual banks and to more-sophisticated methods for estimating various parameters. We also plan to extend the analysis by imbedding it in a model of how variations in bank-customer contracting arrangements in Japan affect the returns that can be earned by bank stockholders. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{capital markets}} become more {{integrated}} and globalized, standard setting in financial accounting faces multiple challenges. Financial accounting standards must adapt {{and change in}} ways that make them usable to firms in varying institutional and economic settings, and by extension, make the financial statements produced under those standards useful to capital market participants worldwide. A {{question that arises is}} how to ensure corporate transparency and faithfully represented financial reports, and whether principles-based – rather than rules-based – standards are superior in this context. Two areas of particular interest to standard setters are mandatory disclosures made within the scope of the standards, and judgments and estimates required by financial statement preparers when standards are predominantly principles-based. This thesis investigates quality implications of features pertaining to three different accounting standards: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The underlying aim is to draw conclusions about effects on accounting usefulness of the various accounting methods and disclosure and recognition rules prescribed by these standards. The rationale for this type of research can be derived from the IASB's own requirements that a post-implementation review (PIR) be executed whenever significant financial reporting changes are introduced by a new or revised standard. The studies carried out within the scope of this thesis show that in accounting for certain discretionary items related to employee benefits, there appears to be improvements in transparency as firms are required by the amended IAS 19 to move previously <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>items</b> onto the balance sheet, thus formally recognizing them rather than merely disclosing them in the supplementary notes. Further, evidence on disclosures made in accordance with IAS 1 points to comparability issues and to the disclosures being of varying quality, with accounting outcomes being contingent on the individual firm’s contextual factors. This indicates that the principles-based disclosure standards that are currently favored by standard setters do not work as well as expected. Meanwhile, as regards estimation of credit losses in banks, there is evidence to support the current move towards a more principles-based standard (IFRS 9), provided that there is enforcement of adequate quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} and to better inform industry practitioners to the most appropriate classification and regression techniques for modelling the three key credit risk components of the Basel II minimum capital requirement; probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD). The Basel II accord regulates risk and capital management requirements {{to ensure that a}} bank holds enough capital proportional to the exposed risk of its lending practices. Under the advanced internal ratings based (IRB) approach Basel II allows banks to develop their own empirical models based on historical data for each of PD, LGD and EAD. In this thesis, first the issue of imbalanced credit scoring data sets, a special case of PD modelling where the number of defaulting observations in a data set is much lower than the number of observations that do not default, is identified, and the suitability of various classification techniques are analysed and presented. As well as using traditional classification techniques this thesis also explores the suitability of gradient boosting, least square support vector machines and random forests as a form of classification. The second part of this thesis focuses on the prediction of LGD, which measures the economic loss, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} exposure, in case of default. In this thesis, various state-of-the-art regression techniques to model LGD are considered. In the final part of this thesis we investigate models for predicting the exposure at default (EAD). For <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>items</b> (for example credit cards) to calculate the EAD one requires the committed but unused loan amount times a credit conversion factor (CCF). Ordinary least squares (OLS), logistic and cumulative logistic regression models are analysed, as well as an OLS with Beta transformation model, with the main aim of finding the most robust and comprehensible model for the prediction of the CCF. Also a direct estimation of EAD, using an OLS model, will be analysed. All the models built and presented in this thesis have been applied to real-life data sets from major global banking institutions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} four empirical {{studies on the}} effects of bank behaviour on bank performance in European and North American countries up to the 2007 - 08 financial crisis. First, we investigate the effects of non-traditional bank activities, i. e., <b>off-balance-sheet</b> (OBS) <b>items</b> and traditional activities, i. e., loans, on bank performance, and then considering a risk-based capital requirement show an optimal bank portfolio. Second, we examine the impact of interbank lending on bank risk-taking, considering the consequence of “Too big to fail” (TBTF) and show differences in bank activities and risk-taking between large and small banks. We then study the effect of changes in bank behaviour on the determinants of interest margins. Finally, we identify the reasons of individual bank failure towards understanding the mechanism of the recent financial crisis. Our empirical findings provide following results. First, the negative effect of OBSs on bank performance is found and banks prefer moving away from OBSs, given the risk-based capital requirement. Second, interbank lending increases the large banks’ risk level under TBTF. Third, product diversification has a negative impact on interest margins. Finally, the housing price index has {{a significant impact on the}} probability of bank failure in the context of the recent financial crisis...|$|R
