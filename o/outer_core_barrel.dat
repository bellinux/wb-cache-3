40|$|Prior to the {{restructuring}} of the Prometheus Program, the NRPCT was tasked with delivering a nuclear space reactor. Potential NRPCT nuclear space reactor designs for the Prometheus Project required dissimilar materials to be in {{contact with each other}} while operating at extreme temperatures under irradiation. As a result of the high reactor core temperatures, refractory metals were the primary candidates for many of the reactor structural and cladding components. They included the tantalum-base alloys ASTAR- 811 C and Ta- 10 W, the niobium-base alloy FS- 85, and the molybdenum base alloys Moly 41 - 47. 5 Rhenium. The refractory metals were to be joined to candidate nickel base alloys such as Haynes 230, Alloy 617, or Nimonic PE 16 either within the core if the nickel-base alloys were ultimately selected to form the <b>outer</b> <b>core</b> <b>barrel,</b> or at a location exterior to the core if the nickel-base alloys were limited to components exterior to the core. To support the need for dissimilar metal joints in the Prometheus Project, a co-extrusion experiment was proposed. There are several potential methods for the formation of dissimilar metal joints, including explosive bonding, friction stir welding, plasma spray, inertia welding, HIP, and co-extrusion. Most of these joining methods are not viable options because they result in the immediate formation of brittle intermetallics. Upon cooling, intermetallics form in the weld fusion zone between the joined metals. Because brittle intermetallics do not form during the initial bonding process associated with HIP, co-extrusion, and explosive bonding, these three joining procedures are preferred for forming dissimilar metal joints. In reference to a Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory report done under a NASA sponsored program, joints that were fabricated between similar materials via explosive bonding had strengths that were directly affected by the width of the diffusion barrier. It was determined that the diffusion zone should not exceed a critical thickness (0. 0005 in.). A diffusion barrier that exceeded this thickness would likely fail. The joint fabrication method must therefore mechanically bond the two materials causing little or no interdiffusion upon formation. Co-extrusion fits this description since it forms a mechanical joint between two materials by using heat and pressure. The two materials to be extruded are first assembled and sealed within a co-extrusion billet which is subsequently heated and then extruded through a die. For a production application, once the joint is formed, it is dejacketed to remove the outer canister. The remaining piece consists of two materials bonded together with a thin diffusion barrier. Therefore, the long-term stability of the joint is determined primarily by the kinetics of interdiffusion reaction between the two materials. An experimental design for co-extrusion of refractory metals and nickel-based superalloys was developed to evaluate this joining process and determine the long-term stability of the joints...|$|E

40|$|The HDR {{experimental}} {{facility has}} been used for several blowdown experiments in order to study fluid-structure interactions and loadings on the pressure vessel internal structures of a pressurized water reactor. We have developed the code FLUX to analyse the motions in the initial blowdown period. This paper describes a new type of HDR experiments (V 34) and compares the experimental results with the FLUX-code results. As novel feature, the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> is not rigidly clamped to the vessel as in earlier experiments but supported with gaps such that the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> can move freely upwards for about 2 mm and horizontally for 0. 3 mm at the upper flange. At the lower core-barrel edge, snubbers restrict the horizontal motion to about + 1. 4 mm and − 2. 8 mm. The experimental results show that the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> is deflected sidewards until it hits the snubber at the lower edge and then swings back to hit the opposite snubber. By this some kinetic energy is lost due to plastic snubber deformations. At the same time, the measurements show that the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> lifts rather uniformly from its support upwards until it hits the upper constraint. Several bounces up and down are observed until the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> becomes fixed probably due to friction from the side. This situation has been pre- and post-computed with the new FLUX-version which contains a very effective algorithm to treat supports with gaps and resultant impacts. For treatment of plastic supports, a simple model is added. Pre-computations were not meaningful because of large deviations in the pre-estimated initials gaps. However the computed pressure-field is not influenced very much by these parameters and predicted very well. This was favoured by the isothermal fluid initial conditions. Post-computations show sufficient agreement with respect to computed <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> motion. The axial motion is described very well. Some problems remain which are due to the model for the upper flange support. Impacts do not results in greatly enlarged loadings, strains or accelerations for this situation...|$|R

By using this fitting procedure, two modes of vibration have been identified in the frequency range of the beam mode.

The lower supports have a maximum allowed gap between the clevis insert ant the lower radial support, this gap is known to be larger than intended but still below the upper allowed limit.

These pulsations show an almost linear relation between the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> displacement and peak to peak pressure amplitude. A more detailed model was used for the final simulation.

In this article, we report that the P. multocida type strains belonging to serovars 8 and 13 share the same LPS <b>outer</b> <b>core</b> biosynthesis locus and produce structurally related LPS molecules.
