40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design the 2016 {{combustion}} car drivetrain for Global Formula Racing (GFR). The goal of this project was to improve upon the 2015 drivetrain design by reducing complexity, weight, and maintenance time. To reduce complexity the spool was changed to a <b>one</b> <b>piece</b> <b>system</b> and the drivetrain inserts were changed to a simpler design. These changes were able to reduce weight and the complexity of machining by making the designs more simple. The drivetrain mounting system had its complexity reduced by moving to a eccentric chain tensioning design. This was chosen because it reduced the time to adjust the chain and reduced the overall part count of the system. The major issues that occurred during this project {{had to do with}} the manufacturing of the drivetrain mounts. Since there were issues finding sponsors to make the mounts they had to be made in house. This required learning edgecam and the cnc machining process to be able to manufacture them. The machining of the mounts took a tremendous amount of time and this made it difficult for their to be enough time during the manufacturing phase to make two complete sets. The result of this project is a finished and functioning drivetrain for the 2016 combustion car. The car has been through numerous test days and the drivetrain has worked exactly as expected. So far there have been no issues with the performance or maintenance of the system. Next year the designer of the drivetrain should focus on further improvement of the spool design and reducing the manufacturing time of the whole system. Furthermore, a heavy emphasis should be put on finding sponsors with large machining capabilities to help manufacture the drivetrain system...|$|E

All existing methods only provided the equation of motion in terms of some auxiliary variables (such as the Lagrange multiplier or other quasi variables [24 – 26]), {{in addition to the}} generalized coordinates. This had hindered certain fundamental explorations, such as stability, chaos, bifurcation, which are mostly performed based on the analytic expressions. Hence, the research of this ultimate analytical form of the equations of motion of constrained systems continued.|$|R

I argue that the development of these measures was a driven by geopolitical concerns and show how these vetting criteria favored the admission of hardline nationalists and anticommunists. The argument proceeds in two steps. First, I demonstrate that geopolitics influenced immigration policy, resulting in the admission of extremist individuals. Second, I document how geopolitical concerns and the openness of American institutions provided exiles with the opportunity to mobilize politically. While {{there is little evidence that}} the vetting system succeeded in preventing the entry of communist subversives into the US, it did help to create a highly mobilized anticommunist ethnic lobby that supported extremist policies vis-à-vis the Soviet Union during the early Cold War...|$|R

50|$|Older Weaver <b>systems</b> {{used two}} <b>pieces</b> mounted a {{distance}} apart {{from one another}} typically on the receiver of a rifle over the bolt opening where the cartridge would be inserted and/or ejected. However, alignment problems of the two <b>piece</b> <b>system</b> can put undue stress on a rifle scope and cause problems between the scope and rifle barrel parallels and bullet Point Of Impact (POI). Also the two <b>piece</b> <b>system</b> must be mounted to exacting tolerances to one another to ensure perfect alignment using a scope alignment device called Alignment Sleeves. The two piece type can also be problematic when some rifles will not allow for the two pieces to be mounted due to metal thickness of the receiver or other issues of receiver length that will not allow for proper distance to hold the scope.

40|$|The authors {{report on}} the design of a system which will enable real time {{measurements}} of (therapeutic) drug concentrations in the anterior chamber of the eye. Currently the concentration of therapeutic drugs in the anterior chamber is determined by analyzing samples which have been removed from the aqueous humor of laboratory animal eyes. This sampling via paracentesis can be painful and does not provide a continuous measurement. Our system will be far less invasive, removing the need for sampling via paracentesis, and also providing a continuous measurement, enabling a more complete understanding of the kinetics of ophthalmic drugs. A key component in our novel system is a specially constructed contact lens.
