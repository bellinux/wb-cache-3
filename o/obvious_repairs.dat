Origin: As appears in colophon with patronage statement on fol. 363 b (p. 724), copied for Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Ṣāliḥ al-ʻAnsī. Transcription finished ("wa-kāna al-farāgh min raqmih [...] . ") at midday on Thursday, 10 th of Jumādá I, 1070 [January 1660]. Place of transcription not specified though patron, content, hand, etc. suggest Yemen. Accompanying materials: a. Inventory cataloguing slip in hand of Winifred Smeaton Thomas. [...] b. Acquisitions slip from Yahuda. [...] c. letter on European paper with seal impression, difficult to read, inserted between fol. 143 - 144 (p. 284 - 285) [...] d. cache of exactly 60 slips in European paper (with watermarks: three crescents, coat of arms, horn in circle, bunch of grapes, etc.) of unusual shapes and sizes inserted between fol. 287 - 288 (p. 572 - 573), bearing traditions, glosses, legal problems, etc. [...] e. cache of 7 now detached leaves and slips in European paper (with three crescents watermark, hand and flower watermark) after the final quire, carrying glosses, excerpts, etc. Former shelfmark: From spine label, "IL 177 " (likely supplied by Yahuda, see acquisitions slip). Binding: Pasteboards covered in dark brown leather with repairs in black cloth; Type II (likely, i. e. once with flap, now lost); board linings in purple wove paper; upper and lower covers carry a large blind-stamped central mandorla with light brown leather onlays (filled with vegetal composition of asymmetrical design, incorporating chi clouds - compare Déroche class.

50|$|The {{designation}} of Haixiu 121 class series tug {{is unique in}} that it is different than the usual Chinese naming convention for ships in the military service. Ordinarily, auxiliary ships in PLAN service are designated by a combination of two Chinese characters followed by three-digit number. The first Chinese character denotes which fleet the ship is service with, with East (Dong, 东) for East Sea Fleet, North (Bei, 北) for North Sea Fleet, and South (Nan, 南) for South Sea Fleet. The second Chinese character is designated by the mission the ship performs, and it is usually Tuo (拖), meaning tug in Chinese, for ships that are classified as tugboats. Haixiu 121 is a tug, but instead, the first Chinese character is Hai (海), meaning ocean in Chinese, while the second character is Xiu (修), meaning repair, and such designation is for repair ships. However, this boat has not been observed being used as a repair ship, but instead, used as a tug. Furthermore, no <b>obvious</b> <b>repair</b> equipment can be observed on board the boat. The pennant numbers may have changed due to the change of Chinese naval ships naming convention.|$|R

However, now with digital technology driving Jacquard looms, they have become more readily available to individual artists. Digitally generated designs and digitally controlled looms have allowed for more complex designs to be created and woven. The large woven piece Dark D’Oyley, by Liz Williamson, responds {{to the practice of}} publicly displaying textiles that have been repaired yet fail to reference the actual process of repair. The work draws on a doyley displayed in a textile museum, which had a large and <b>obvious</b> <b>repair</b> in the middle, yet no wall text or archival reference to the repair. The utilitarian nature of this restoration work means it is often overlooked, a position that this research directly challenges through incorporating the damage into {{the construction of a new}} meta doyley. The significance of the Dark D’Oyley series is demonstrated by its inclusion in From Lausanne to Beijing: 2002 International Tapestry Art Biennale, Academy of Art and Design, Tsinghua University, China; A matter of time: 16 th Tamworth Fibre Textile Biennial, Tamworth Regional Gallery; World Eco-Fibre and Textile Art Exhibition, Galerie Petronas, Malaysia; and solo touring exhibition Liz Williamson: Living Treasures, Object, Sydney...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{double strand}} breaks are potent {{inducers}} of cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage response (DDR) signalling and repair pathways. Ionizing radiation (IR) efficiently induces DSBs. G 2 -M checkpoint activation delays/stops cell division to facilitate repair of these lethal lesions. According {{to the classical}} view proteins of PI 3 K kinase family ATM and ATR {{have been shown to}} be the key players in the activation of this checkpoint. In higher eukaryotes, two main repair pathways named NHEJ and HRR are responsible for the repair of DSBs. For many years, HRR has been considered to be a minor pathway of DSB repair in higher eukaryotes. This opinion is based on the fact that none of the cell lines deficient in important HRR genes displays <b>obvious</b> DSB <b>repair</b> defects although they are clearly radiosensitive to killing. It is therefore thought that in higher eukaryotes IR induced DSB repair is practically exclusively undertaken by the D-NHEJ pathway; on the other hand the role of HRR is only evident on the repair of I-SceI induced site directed DSBs in integrated genomic loci. Thus, how HRR contributes to the repair of IR induced DSBs remains unknown. In the work presented here, we study the repair of IR induced DSBs through their transformation into G 2 -chromosomal breaks. Our results show the direct involvement of HRR in the repair of a subset of IR induced DSBs which are associated with the formation of G 2 -chromosomal breaks. The D-NHEJ repair pathway does not seem to play a role in the repair of these breaks. Our results also demonstrate that HRR is a key player in the activation and maintenance of the G 2 -checkpoint. We employed flow cytometry based determination of mitotic index after exposure to 1 Gy X-rays using phosphorylated histone-H 3 as a marker. Chinese hamster cells deficient in RAD 51 paralogs RAD 51 B, RAD 51 C, RAD 51 D, XRCC 2 and XRCC 3 show a remarkable defect in G 2 -checkpoint activation, while cells deficient in NHEJ components KU 80, DNA-PKcs and XRCC 4 show strong G 2 - checkpoint activation when compared to the wild type cells. This is, to our knowledge, the first report implicating HRR in the repair of a subset of DSBs with the potential of forming chromosome breaks, as well as in the development and maintenance of DNA damage induced cell cycle checkpoints...|$|R
