40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{that the impact of}} an exogenous shock, such as the 1997 market reforms, <b>on</b> <b>quote</b> competition varies depending on what happens to the levels of preferenced trading. With the significant reduction in the level of preferenced trading, share volume sensitivity to quote competitiveness is expected to increase and the change in share volume is positively related to a market maker’s quote competitiveness. However, without a large decline in preferenced trading, the improved competition comes at a price: (i) reduced sensitivity between quote competitiveness and share volume; and (ii) a negative relation between quote competitiveness and the change in share volume. Empirical evidence from the pre- and post-reform periods supports this prediction and reconciles the seemingly conflicting findings of Barclay et al. (1999), Kandel and Marx (1999), and Weston (2000) and those of Chung et al. (2003). We also {{demonstrate that}} preferenced trading is responsible for the reduced sensitivity and the negative relation between quote competitiveness and share volume. Consistent with the ‘cream skimming ’ hypothesis, we find that market makers that are more dependent on preferenced trading tend to be associated with stocks characterized by a lower cost of information asymmetry. The pattern of market maker entries and exits is also dictated by the persistent level of preferencing. We observe a net entry of market makers who rely on preferenced trading and a net exit of market makers who rely <b>on</b> <b>quote</b> competition around the NASDAQ market reforms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{employs a}} "transaction" {{database}} to study whether observed quote revisions {{are consistent with}} those predicted by the adverse selection and inventory cost theories of the bid-ask spread. The authors find that actual quote revisions are consistent with the theoretical prediction in only 25 percent of the cases. Furthermore, quote-revision patterns are found to be strongly dependent on the level of the outstanding spread and, to a lesser extent, on the transaction size. These systematic patterns, unrelated to the inventory cost and adverse selection theories, are consistent with the effect <b>on</b> <b>quote</b> revisions of the limit order book and the minimum 1 / 8 price-change rule.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of price quote revisions on the London Stock Exchange for a sample of highly liquid stocks over a two-week settlement period in September 1990. In our theoretical model the level of optimal price quotes set by market makers are {{a function of the}} expected fundamental price, the expected number of liquidity trades and the lagged level of inventories. The model is used to test for the existence of adverse selection, inventory control and anticipated liquidity trade effects <b>on</b> <b>quote</b> revisions. Our findings are that while {{there seems to be some}} evidence of asymmetric information in our sample, market makers clearly take into account their inventory positions in the stocks in which they make a market, but there is little evidence that market makers exploit liquidity traders.

40|$|Abstract: We analyze price {{discovery}} in floor-based and electronic exchanges {{using data from}} the German stock market. We find that both markets contribute to {{price discovery}}. There is bidirectional Granger causality, and prices from both markets adjust to deviations from the long-run equilibrium. We use two different measures of the contributions to price discovery, the information share (Hasbrouck 1995) and the weights with which the series enter the common long memory component as defined by Gonzalo / Granger (1995). The contributions of the two trading systems to the process of price discovery are almost equal when transaction prices are used for the estimation. Models based <b>on</b> <b>quote</b> midpoints indicate that the electronic trading system has a larger share in the price discovery process. A cross-sectional analysis reveals that the contributions to price discovery are positively related to the market shares of the trading systems. JEL classification: G 1...|$|E
