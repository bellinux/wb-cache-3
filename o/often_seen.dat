5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, the kakapo was {{extinct in}} the North Island and its range and {{numbers in the}} South Island were declining. One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> or heard, and {{occasionally}} eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of kakapo were becoming scarce.|$|E
5|$|Children and infants may {{be unable}} to report being bitten, making it {{difficult}} to associate their symptoms with a spider bite. Symptoms seen in infants include inconsolable crying, refusing to feed and a general erythematous rash. Muscle aches and pains, and neck spasm are <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> in children over four years of age.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the turkey}} vulture, this vulture is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> {{standing}} in a spread-winged stance. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, Old World vultures, and storks.|$|E

5|$|A {{description}} of the species was published by Jacques Labillardière in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, accompanied by a figure drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Plée. Labillardière chose the specific name obovata, {{in reference to the}} leaves of his specimen, which were obovate (egg-shaped, with the narrow end at the base). This leaf shape is <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> in this species. The term obovata derives from the Latin ob- ("inverse") and ovum ("egg"), and has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus.|$|E

5|$|Akane {{was created}} to be a {{relatable}} character who would question the setting and answer the viewer's questions. Early in the show's development, the production staff planned the way Akane would mature throughout the story. Early critical reception to Akane has been mixed. Some critics saw her as typical new cop <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> in dramas; others criticized her as uninteresting. However, her growth in the story earned praise for becoming a highly appealing protagonist.|$|E
5|$|All {{his adult}} life, Pflueger {{maintained}} his residence at his childhood home on Guerrero Street. When entertaining downtown {{late into the}} evening, {{he was known to}} spend an occasional night at the Olympic Club. Pflueger drove a green Cadillac convertible and was <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> with his steady lady friend on his arm. Pflueger never married and left no children. His brother Milton, fifteen years younger, had been working with the firm since the 1930s and, at Tim's death, Milton reorganized and headed the company, doing business as Milton T. Pflueger, Architect.|$|E
5|$|At 6ft 4 in, 225lb (1.93m, 102kg), Ripken was a {{departure}} from the prototypical shortstop of the time—small, fleet-of-foot players who played a defensively difficult position but often did not post the home run and batting average totals that an outfielder might. Power hitting shortstops such as Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra and Miguel Tejada are <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> by fans to be part of Ripken's legacy.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{in the second half of}} the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
5|$|Designed with a V-shaped top in {{the form}} of an {{overturned}} chaika, the šajkača is narrow and typically black or grey in colour. It is usually made of soft, homemade cloth and is worn without any symbols during peacetime. During times of war, cockades featuring the Serbian double-headed eagle and the motto Only Unity Saves the Serbs are <b>often</b> <b>seen</b> on the cap. The šajkača worn by Serbian soldiers during World War I had a non-reflecting peak and was topped with a royal monogram.|$|E
