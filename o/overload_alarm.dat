50|$|The {{trip to the}} Moon {{took just}} over three days. After {{achieving}} orbit, Armstrong and Aldrin transferred into the Lunar Module, named Eagle, and after a landing gear inspection by Collins remaining in the Command/Service Module Columbia, began their descent. After overcoming several computer <b>overload</b> <b>alarms</b> caused by an antenna switch left in the wrong position, and a slight downrange error, Armstrong took over manual flight control at about 180 m, and guided the Lunar Module to a safe landing spot at 20:18:04 UTC, July 20, 1969 (3:17:04 pm CDT). The first humans on the Moon waited six hours before they left their craft. At 02:56 UTC, July 21 (9:56 pm CDT July 20), Armstrong became the first human to {{set foot on the}} Moon.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Overloads {{in coach}} buses creates more {{possibilities}} to cause serious traffic accidents and bring heavy loss and injuries {{to our country}} and people. This research bases on sensor control technology and SCM (Single Chip Micyoco) technology {{in order to prevent}} people from changing its overload control system. We aim at developing an overload safety monitoring and warning control system which can count the number of passengers, send out <b>overloading</b> <b>alarm</b> signals and control the work of the engine. This system has functions that can set up upper limit of the number of passengers and show the current number. When the bus is overloading, the system will send out audible and visual alarm signals and stop the engine from starting through the engine monitoring system. When the overload is relieved and up to the upper limit, the system will automatically clear the alarm and the engine will return to its normal operation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop techniques for safe, reliable monitoring of complex, dynamic systems where human resources for sensor interpretation are constrained. The challenge is to avoid information <b>overload</b> and <b>alarm</b> escalation. Our approach is twofold: the current emphasis is on defining context-sensitive sensor ordering criteria {{to be used as a}} basis for selecting a subset of the available sensor data for presentation during system operations. The future emphasis will be on developing design analysis tools for assessing and defining monitoring requirements during the design phase. Physical systems which are to be monitored may be partitioned into three classes according to a complexity criterion (see Figure 1) : Those of few sensor channels and low complexity which can be monitored safely and reliably using a comprehensive strategy (all sensor channels in-terpreted all of the time). Those of many sensor channels and high complexity which can be monitored safely and reliably using a selective strategy (some sensor channels inter...|$|R
40|$|Societys {{critical}} infrastructures {{are increasingly}} dependent on IP networks. Intrusion detection and tolerance within data networks is therefore imperative for dependability in other domains such as telecommunications or energy distribution. Todays data networks {{are protected by}} human operators that are exceedingly overwhelmed by the massive information <b>overload</b> through false <b>alarm</b> rates of the protection mechanisms. This paper studies the role of alarm reduction and correlation in supporting the security administrator in an enterprise network. We present an architecture that incorporates intrusion detection systems as sensors, and provides improved alarm data to the human operator or to automated actuators. Alarm reduction and correlation via static and adaptive filtering, normalisation, and aggregation is demonstrated on the output from three sensors (Snort, Samhain and Syslog) used in a telecom test network. 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Smart {{infusion}} pump technology (SIPT) {{was designed to}} enhance safety with intravenous medication administration, but has introduced new patient safety risks and harm when nurses initiate workarounds that bypass SIPT safety features. This study sought to develop a grounded theory explaining nurses 2 ̆ 7 experiences with SIPT, their perceptions of safety features, the rules and resources used in response to safety features, the actions taken in response to SIPT workflow blocks, and conditions contributing to nurse-initiated workarounds. Corbin and Strauss 2 ̆ 7 s (2008) grounded theory approach guided this study. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 28 nurses who used SIPT across 13 adult patient care areas in a single Midwest teaching hospital. The grounded theory Nurse-Technology Interplay was developed through constant comparison analysis of transcribed interview data. The four categories of interacting with SIPT, making meaning, taking action, and consequences, were linked through relational statements and theoretically integrated to develop the grounded theory. The grounded theory explicates the continual interplay that occurs as nurses interact with SIPT, and the cognitive and physical processes used to resolve workflow blocks in the context of care delivery. Interacting with SIPT reflected the learning curves faced by nurses, the context of patient-care unit characteristics, and encountered workflow blocks. Making meaning reflected the cognitive processes used by nurses as they encountered workflow blocks with SIPT, and was influenced by individual perspectives, as well as shared learning. Taking action often occurred simultaneously with making meaning, and represented processes of doing, such as rechecking programming activities, seeking assistance, or engaging in workarounds. Consequences of using SIPT included patient outcomes with medication administration and the impact on practice as nurses experienced disruptions in care delivery, dependency on SIPT, a loss of calculation skills, and <b>alarm</b> <b>overload.</b> The grounded theory of Nurse-Technology Interplay provides an understanding of how nurses make sense of, and respond to, workflow blocks with SIPT safety features. The study yielded valuable insights into the complexity of SIPT implementation and the challenges nurses face while providing safe, effective, patient-centered care in the midst of juggling competing priorities. The findings have implications for nursing practice and nurse leaders. Critical to moving forward is a more purposeful approach to SIPT education and training within a patient safety framework, a systematic evaluation of organizational processes that impact SIPT, optimization the SIPT drug library to facilitate nurses 2 ̆ 7 work, and promotion of a learning organization that capitalizes on the lessons that can be learned from workarounds...|$|R
