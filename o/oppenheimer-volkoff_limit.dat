40|$|We analyse a {{new class}} of static spherically {{symmetric}} solutions to Einstein's equations that intermediate between neutron stars and black holes. These solutions share the same equation of state with neutron stars, but they are characterized by a conical spacelike singularity at the center; hence the name `singularity stars'. Geodesics are extendible across the singularity, so the singularity does not lead to any pathological behavior. It is best described as an irreducible spacetime boundary. As such it must be assigned to an entropy, so that the total entropy is a sum of matter entropy and of singularity entropy. We evaluate the latter by using methods that have been developed for black hole thermodynamics, namely, Euclidean Quantum Gravity and Wald's Noether charge approach. Then we use the maximum-entropy principle, in order to show that singularity stars define a stable thermodynamic phase for stellar masses above the <b>Oppenheimer-Volkoff</b> <b>limit,</b> {{in exactly the same way}} that neutron stars define a stable thermodynamic phase for masses below the <b>Oppenheimer-Volkoff</b> <b>limit.</b> Comment: 29 pages, 13 figure...|$|E
40|$|A {{system of}} self-gravitating massive fermions is {{studied in the}} {{framework}} of the general-relativistic Thomas-Fermi model. We study the properties of the free energy functional and its relation to Einstein’s field equations. A self-gravitating fermion gas we then describe by a set of Thomas-Fermi type self-consistency equations. Thermodynamical properties of the self-gravitating fermion gas have been extensively studied {{in the framework of}} the Thomas-Fermi model [1 - 6]. The system was investigated in the nonrelativistic Newtonian limit. The canonical and grand-canonical ensembles for such a system have been shown to have a nontrivial thermodynamical limit [1, 2]. Under certain conditions this system will undergo a phase transition that is accompanied by a gravitational collapse [2, 5] which may have important astrophysical and cosmological implications [6, 7].

40|$|We {{explore a}} class of compact charged spheres made of a charged perfect fluid with a {{polytropic}} equation of state. The charge density is chosen to be proportional to the energy density. The study is performed by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation which describes the hydrostatic equilibrium. We show the dependence {{of the structure of}} the spheres for several characteristic values of the polytropic exponent and for different values of the charge densities. We also study other physical properties of the charged spheres, such as the total mass, total charge, radius and sound speed and their dependence on the polytropic exponent. We find that for the polytropic exponent γ= 4 / 3 the Chandrasekhar mass limit coincides with the Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass limit. We test the <b>Oppenheimer-Volkoff</b> <b>limit</b> for such compact objects. We also analyze the Buchdahl limit for these charged polytropic spheres, which happens in the limit of very high polytropic exponents, i. e., for a stiff equation of state. It is found that this limit is extremal and it is a quasiblack hole. Comment: 16 pages, 17 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. All {{presently}} known stellar-dynamical {{constraints on}} the size and mass of the supermassive compact dark object at the Galactic center are consistent with a ball of self-gravitating, nearly non-interacting, degenerate fermions with mass between 76 and 491 keV/c 2, for a degeneracy factor g = 2. Similar to the masses of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, which are separated by an <b>Oppenheimer-Volkoff</b> (OV) <b>limit</b> between 1. 4 to 3 M⊙, the masses of the supermassive fermion balls and black holes are separated by an OV limit of 1. 1 × 10 8 M⊙, for a fermion mass of 76 keV/c 2 and g = 2. Sterile neutrinos of 76 keV/c 2 mass, which are mixed {{with at least one}} of the active neutrinos with a mixing angle θ ∼ 10 − 7, are produced in about the right amount in the early Universe by incoherent resonant and non-resonant scattering of active neutrinos having an asymmetry of L ∼ 10 − 2. The former process yields sterile neutrinos with a quasi-degenerate spectrum while the latter leads to a thermal spectrum. The mixing necessarily implies the radiative decay of the sterile neutrino into an active neutrino in about 10 19 years which makes these particles observable. As the production mechanism of the sterile neutrino is consistent with the constraints from large scale structure formation, cosmic microwave background, big bang nucleosynthesis, core collapse supernovae, and diffuse X-ray background, it could be the dark matter particle of the Universe. At the same time, the quasi-degenerate components of this dark matter, may be responsible for the formation of the supermassive degenerate fermion balls and black holes at the galactic centers via gravitational cooling. ...|$|R
40|$|Essay {{selected}} for Honorable mention 2014 by the Gravity Research Foundation. We study an isothermal system of semi-degenerate self-gravitating fermions in General Relativity (GR). The most general solutions present mass density profiles {{with a central}} degenerate compact core governed by quantum statistics followed by an extended plateau, and ending in a power law behaviour r^- 2. By fixing the fermion mass m in the keV regime, the different solutions depending on the free parameters of the model: the degeneracy and temperature parameters at the center, are systematically constructed along the one-parameter sequences of equilibrium configurations up to the critical point, which {{is represented by the}} maximum in a central density (ρ_ 0) Vs. core mass (M_c) diagram. We show that for fully degenerate cores, the <b>Oppenheimer-Volkoff</b> (OV) mass <b>limit</b> M_c^cr∝ M_pl^ 3 /m^ 2 is obtained, while instead for low degenerate cores, the critical core mass increases showing the temperature effects in a non linear way. The main result of this work is that when applying this theory to model the distribution of dark matter in big elliptical galaxies from miliparsec distance-scales up to 10 ^ 2 Kpc, we do not find any critical core-halo configuration of self-gravitating fermions, able to explain both the most super-massive dark object at their center together with the DM halo simultaneously.

40|$|The density {{dependencies}} {{of various}} effective interaction strengths in the relativistic mean field are studied and carefully compared for nuclear matter and neutron stars. The influences of different density dependencies are presented and discussed on mean field potentials, saturation properties for nuclear matter, equations of state, maximum masses and corresponding radii for neutron stars. Though the interaction strengths and the potentials given by various interactions {{are quite different}} in nuclear matter, the differences of saturation properties are subtle, except for NL 2 and TM 2, which are mainly used for light nuclei, while the properties by various interactions for pure neutron matter are quite different. To get an equation of state for neutron matter without any ambiguity, {{it is necessary to}} constrain the effective interactions either by microscopic many-body calculations for the neutron matter data or the data of nuclei with extreme isospin. For neutron stars, the interaction with large interaction strengths give strong potentials and large <b>Oppenheimer-Volkoff</b> (OV) mass <b>limits.</b> The density-dependent interactions DD-ME 1 and TW- 99 favor a large neutron population due to their weak ρ-meson field at high densities. The OV mass limits calculated from different equations of state are 2. 02 ∼ 2. 81 M_, and the corresponding radii are 10. 78 ∼ 13. 27 km. After the inclusion of the hyperons, the corresponding values become 1. 52 ∼ 2. 06 M_ and 10. 24 ∼ 11. 38 km. Comment: 28 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Research {{by one of}} {{the authors}} {{suggested}} that the critical mass of constant-density neutron stars will be greater than eight solar masses when the majority of their neutrons group into bosons that form a Bose-Einstein condensate, provided the bosons interact with each other and have scattering lengths on the order of a picometer. That analysis was able to use Newtonian theory for the condensate with scattering lengths on this order, but general relativity provides a more fundamental analysis. In this paper, we determine the equilibrium states of a static, spherically-symmetric variable-density mixture of a degenerate gas of noninteracting neutrons and a Bose-Einstein condensate using general relativity. We use a Klein-Gordan Lagrangian density with a Gross-Pitaevskii term for the condensate and an effective field for the neutrons. We show that a new class of compact stars can exist with masses above the <b>Oppenheimer-Volkoff</b> <b>limit,</b> provided the scattering length of the bosons is large enough. These stars have no internal singularities, obey causality, and demonstrate a quantum mechanism consistent with general relativity that could prevent collapsed stars from becoming black holes...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} static stellar {{equilibrium}} configurations ofuncharged and charged spheres composed by a relativistic polytropic fluid, and compare {{with those of}} spheres composed by a non-relativistic polytropic fluid, the later case already being studied in a previous work [J. D. Arbañil, P. S. Lemos, V. T. Zanchin, Phys. Rev. D 88, 084023 (2013) ]. In the relativistic fluid case, a relativistic polytropic equation of state, p=ωδ^γ, is assumedd. Here, δ=ρ-p/(γ- 1), with δ and ρ being the rest mass density and the energy density, respectively, and ω and γ are respectively the polytropic constant and the polytropic exponent. We assume that the charge density ρ_e {{is proportional to the}} energy density ρ, ρ_e = α ρ, with α being a constant such that 0 ≤ |α|≤ 1. Some properties of the charged spheres such as mass, total electric charge, radius, redshift, and the speed of sound are analyzed. The dependence of such properties with the polytropic exponent is also investigated. In addition, some limits that arise in general relativity, such as the Chandrasekhar limit, the <b>Oppenheimer-Volkoff</b> <b>limit,</b> the Buchdahl bound and the Buchdahl-Andréasson bound, i. e., the Buchdahl bound for the electric case, are studied. As in a charged non-relativistic polytropic sphere, the charged relativistic polytropic sphere with γ→∞ and α→ 1 saturates the Buchdahl-Andréasson bound, thus indicating that it reaches the quasiblack hole configuration. We show by means of numerical analysis that, as expected, the major differences between the two cases appear in the high energy density region. Comment: 15 pages, 15 figure...|$|E
