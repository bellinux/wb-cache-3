Owing to similarities between the two works, Edwards suggests they are both copies of a lost original, perhaps completed by the same studio.

The Merchant’s House or Law’s Close at 339–343 High Street; <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> the Law family, {{is one of}} the best surviving examples of a sixteenth-century town house in Scotland. Sailors' Walk, at 443–449 High Street; consists of two seventeenth-century houses, resting on foundations dating back to around 1460. These two houses were once divided into four dwellings; three of which were owned by the Oliphant family and the fourth by James Ferguson of Raith.|$|E
5|$|There {{used to be}} {{a village}} of Delaware Indians at the mouth of Mahoning Creek. One of the first {{buildings}} in Danville, a gristmill built by George Montgomery's father, was built on Mahoning Creek. A tract of 180 acres in Danville, including an area along the creek, was <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> the Penn family. Phillip Maus was among the first settlers in Valley Township, Montour County, having settled there in 1769.

5|$|Before being {{acquired}} by the society, the Corstorphine hill site was a nursery, <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> Thomas Blaikie, who planted many of the great French parks such as ‘La Bagatelle’.

The south-facing aspect allows bananas to be grown outside. Increasingly, horticulture is seen as a discipline in its own right, with the focus on habitat creation within enclosures, food stuffs for the animals, and enrichment for both the animals and the visiting public.|$|E

5|$|By 1983, {{with his}} medical bills at £40,000 a year, Terry-Thomas's {{financial}} resources were dwindling. He {{and his wife}} sold their dream house and moved into the small cottage <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> his former wife Pat Patlanski, which she left to him in her will on her death in June that year. Shortly afterwards he worked with ghostwriter Terry Daum on an autobiography, Terry-Thomas Tells Tales. Although the first draft was completed by late summer 1984, Terry-Thomas refused to release the script and continued to make alterations, but never completed his copyediting: the book was finally published after his death.|$|E
5|$|Heliade Rădulescu {{was born}} in Târgovişte, the son of Ilie Rădulescu, a wealthy {{proprietor}} {{who served as the}} leader of a patrol unit during the 1810s, and Eufrosina Danielopol, who had been educated in Greek. Three of his siblings died of bubonic plague before 1829. Throughout his early youth, Ion was the focus of his parents' affectionate supervision: early on, Ilie Rădulescu purchased a house <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> the scholar Gheorghe Lazăr on the outskirts of Bucharest (near Obor), as a gift for his son. At the time, the Rădulescus were owners of a large garden in the Bucharest area, nearby Herăstrău, as well as of estates in the vicinity of Făgăraş and Gârbovi.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century a rising cost of {{consumable}} goods and a series of bad harvests brought about economic changes in Glamorgan. Those with enough wealth were able to seize on opportunities created by these unsettled conditions and set about enlarging and enclosing farm lands. The enclosure of freehold lands that began in the later Middle Ages now gained momentum and farms that were <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> individual farmers were now owned by small groups of wealthy landowners. By the 19th century most of the Rhondda farms and estates were owned by absentee landlords, such as the Marquis of Bute, Earl of Dunraven, Crawshay Bailey of Merthyr and the De Winton family of Brecon.|$|E

5|$|Pleydell {{was born}} by 1519. The sixth of nine children, {{he was the}} fourth son of wealthy tenant farmer William Pleydell of Coleshill, Berkshire—now Oxfordshire—and Agnes Reason (daughter of Robert Reason of Corfe Castle, Dorset). His younger brother was John Pleydell, Member for Cricklade in 1593. The Pleydell family were thought to descend from Thomas de Coleshill, a knight who was awarded lordship of the eponymous parish on 2 March 1275 by King Edward I. Gabriel came of age by 1540, holding land <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> Sir Anthony Hungerford at Eisey (near the parish of Cricklade).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} tunnel {{as built}} {{was designed by}} Sir Alexander Binnie and built by S. Pearson & Sons, between 1892 and 1897, for whom Ernest William Moir was the lead engineer. It was constructed using tunnelling shield and compressed air techniques and a Greathead shield (named after its inventor, James Henry Greathead). It was lit by three rows of incandescent street lights. To clear the site in Greenwich, more than 600 people had to be rehoused, and a house reputedly <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> Sir Walter Raleigh had to be demolished. The work force was largely drawn from immigrants; the tunnel lining was manufactured in Glasgow, while the manual labour came from provincial England, particularly Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, again head of Internal Affairs, Kogălniceanu began {{organizing}} {{the administration of}} Northern Dobruja, through decrees. He supported a distinct legal regime, as a transition from Ottoman administration, and a period of rebuilding—in effect, a colonial rule, aiming for the assimilation of locals into the Romanian mainstream, but respectful of Dobrujan Islam. Unlike other partisans of colonization (including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad), Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders. His intercession {{played a part in}} the ethnic policies: he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists (mocani) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Budjak homes, offering them the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land. This had become widely available after the partition of Ottoman estates, the nationalization of land <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> the Muhajir Balkan, and the appropriation of uncultivated plots (miriè). Kogălniceanu also advised the local administration to overrepresent existing Romanian communities in the decision-making process.|$|E

In January 2007, children from Overchurch Junior School in Upton, Wirral celebrated the life of Brassey. In April 2007 a plaque was placed on Brassey's first bridge at Saughall Massie. In the village of Bulkeley, near Malpas, Cheshire, is a tree called the 'Brassey Oak' on land <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> the Brassey family. This was planted to celebrate Thomas' 40th birthday in 1845.

They were recovered and in 2007 were replaced in a more accessible place with an information board.|$|E
5|$|Lookouts on Seahorse spotted Sensible at 16:00 on 26 June and Captain Edward Foote {{immediately}} gave chase, the French frigate fleeing southwards. For 12 {{hours the}} pursuit continued until Foote {{was able to}} catch and defeat his opponent, inflicting heavy casualties on the weaker and overladen French frigate. Among the prisoners captured was General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers who had been wounded in the storming of Malta, and among the treasure was an ornate seventeenth century cannon <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> Louis XIV. The captured Sensible was initially fitted out as an active warship, but on arrival in Britain in 1799 the ship was downgraded to a transport. The action provided the British with the first conclusive evidence of the French intention to invade Egypt, but despite an extensive search for Nelson's fleet Foote was unable to relay {{the location of the}} French to his admiral before the Battle of the Nile on 1 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{image of}} the dodo is of a very fat and clumsy bird, but this view may be exaggerated. The general opinion of scientists today is that many old European depictions were based on overfed captive birds or crudely stuffed specimens. It has also been suggested that the images might show dodos with puffed feathers, as part of display behaviour. The Dutch painter Roelant Savery was the most prolific and influential illustrator of the dodo, having made at least ten depictions, often showing it in the lower corners. A famous painting of his from 1626, now called Edwards's Dodo as it was <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> the ornithologist George Edwards, has since become the standard image of a dodo. It is housed in the Natural History Museum, London. The image shows a particularly fat bird and is the source for many other dodo illustrations.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} numismatists {{became aware of}} 1804 dollars, they have {{commanded}} high prices, both {{in relation to their}} face value and the numismatic value of other silver dollars. Some early examples were maintained in the Mint's coin cabinet for use in trades, and in 1859, dealers began offering Class II dollars priced at $75, while Theodore Eckfeldt reportedly offered a Philadelphia coin dealer three coins for $70 each. In 1883, a Class III dollar was reportedly purchased in Vienna for $740, and a Class I specimen was auctioned for $1,000 in 1885 by Henry and Samuel H. Chapman. In 1903, an example sold for $1,800, and the same coin reportedly sold for $4,250 in 1941. In 1960, a Class III dollar fetched $28,000 at an auction conducted by Stack's, a coin firm, and the same coin reached $36,000 at another Stack's sale in 1963. A Class I specimen brought $77,500 at a 1970 Stack's, and during a 1980 rise in coin prices, a Class III example sold for $400,000 by Bowers and Ruddy Galleries. A Class I example reached $990,000 at a Superior Galleries auction in 1990, and an example <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> coin collector Louis Eliasberg became the first 1804 dollar to surpass $1 million at auction, selling for $1,815,000 at a sale conducted by Bowers and Merena, Inc., in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{was caused}} by dissatisfaction {{of some of the}} {{soldiers}}, who had taken Vandal wives, with Solomon: the soldiers demanded the property <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> <b>by</b> their wives as their own, but Solomon refused, since this land had been confiscated by imperial decree. A first plot to assassinate Solomon in Easter failed and the conspirators fled into the countryside, but soon open rebellion broke out among the army in Carthage as well. The soldiers acclaimed one of Solomon's subalterns, Theodore, as its leader, and began looting the city. Solomon managed to find refuge in a church, and under the cover of night, with the aid of Theodore, he departed the city by boat for Missua, accompanied among others by the historian Procopius. From there, Solomon and Procopius sailed to Sicily, which had just been conquered by Belisarius, while Solomon's lieutenant Martin was dispatched to try and reach the troops at Numidia, and Theodore instructed to hold Carthage. Upon hearing about the mutiny, Belisarius, with Solomon and 100 picked men, set sail for Africa. Carthage was being besieged by 9,000 rebels, including many Vandals, under a certain Stotzas. Theodore was contemplating capitulation when Belisarius appeared. The news of the famous general's arrival were sufficient for the rebels to abandon the siege and withdraw westwards. Belisarius immediately gave pursuit and caught up and defeated the rebel forces at Membresa. The bulk of the rebels, however, was able to flee, and continued to march towards Numidia, where the local troops decided to join them. Belisarius himself was forced to return to Italy due to trouble there, and Emperor Justinian appointed his cousin Germanus as magister militum to deal with the crisis. Solomon returned to Constantinople.|$|E
