5|$|After a ten-yard gain by Richardson {{to start}} the quarter, Alabama lost a total of seven yards on {{consecutive}} plays and a McCarron incompletion on third down set up a third long field goal attempt. This time the 49-yard attempt from Jeremy Shelley was blocked by Bennie Logan and recovered by Eric Reid who returned it to the Alabama 48. On this LSU possession, Jordan Jefferson took <b>over</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Tigers' quarterback, and LSU gained a first down on a six-yard Michael Ford run {{and a pair of}} short runs by Ware. However, the drive stalled again and Wing was forced to punt for LSU.|$|E

5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken <b>over</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories. In the end it was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1810s and 1850s {{there were}} a series of changes in {{ownership}} and management. These coincided with a Puritan revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; reductions in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial crises and fell into a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when James Henry Chute, who was {{the manager of the}} Bath Assembly Rooms and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready, took <b>over</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise.|$|E

5|$|Brown entered Massillon Washington High School in 1922. Although {{he played}} {{football}} as a child, Brown was undersized {{for the game}} at less than 150 pounds and at first focused his athletic energies on the pole vault. Harry Stuhldreher, {{who went on to}} be one of Notre Dame's legendary Four Horsemen, was then the high school quarterback. But Massillon coach Dave Stewart saw Brown's determination to be a good vaulter despite his small size and brought him onto the football team; as a junior in 1924, he took <b>over</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> starting quarterback. Massillon posted a win-loss record of 15â€“3 in Brown's junior and senior years as the starter.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s {{at the height}} of the Cold War, the United States Army {{conducted}} a classified feasibility study that proposed the construction of a manned military outpost on the Moon called Project Horizon with the potential to conduct a wide range of missions from scientific research to nuclear Earth bombardment. The study included the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test. The Air Force, which at the time was in competition with the Army for a leading role in the space program, developed its own similar plan called Lunex. However, both these proposals were ultimately passed <b>over</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> space program was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency NASA.|$|E

In contrast to the 1990s, Garden City was unable to win a state championship throughout the 2000s, although the Buffaloes did produce three individual state titles and an All-American. Jason Nichols won individual state championships in 2000 and 2001 and sophomore Ryan Kromer won an individual state championship in 2002. In 2006, Beth Johnson was named a Second-Team All-American and in 2008, she was named as a First-Team All-American, the first girl {{to do so in}} school history. Also in 2008, Martin Segovia relinquished his role as head coach and former assistant Monte Moser took <b>over</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> new head coach. In 2010, the Buffaloes placed fourth in the state championship, while producing two individual state champions in Lane Greenlee and Joey Dozier. One year later, Anthony Calderon won an individual state championship. Following the 2012 season, Monte Moser retired and Carlos Prieto became the current head coach.

5|$|From the 1st century AD onwards, Cassel {{developed}} into a key urban centre for the whole region with an extensive road network converging on the hill.

Cassel was fortified with a circuit of walls at around this time but suffered its own decline, which was reflected in its loss of status as a regional capital; Tournai took <b>over</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> capital of the newly constituted Civitas Turnacensium.|$|E
