40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{characterized by}} progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons at the substantia nigra. Mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory responses {{are involved in the}} mechanism of cell damage in PD. 6 -Hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA), a dopamine analog, specifically damages dopaminergic neurons. Echinacoside (ECH) is a phenylethanoid glycoside isolated from the stems of Cistanche salsa, showing a variety of neuroprotective effects in previous studies. The present study was to investigate its effect against 6 -OHDA-induced neurotoxicity and possible mechanisms in PC 12 cells. The results showed that 6 -OHDA reduced cell viability, decreased <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>activity,</b> decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis compared with untreated PC 12 cells. However, echinacoside treatment significantly attenuated these changes induced by 6 -OHDA. In addition, echinacoside also could significantly alleviate the inflammatory responses induced by 6 -OHDA. Further research showed that echinacoside could reduce 6 -OHDA-induced ROS production in PC 12 cells. These results suggest that the underlying mechanism of echinacoside against 6 -OHDA-induced neurotoxicity may be involve in attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory responses by reducing ROS production...|$|E
3000|$|Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 {{is often}} used in an MFC. The {{processes}} of S. oneidensis MR- 1 to transfer electrons to the electrode can roughly be classified into three categories. One process is called indirect electron transport, which concerns the mediator. The mediator having <b>oxidation–reduction</b> <b>activity</b> receives an electron from the cells and shuttles the electron between the electron acceptor and the electrode. In the case of S. oneidensis MR- 1 secreting a derivative of quinone and flavin {{to the outside of}} the cells, it is possible to use these excretions as mediators [1, 2, 3, 4]. Another process is called direct electron transport. S. oneidensis MR- 1 is a metal-reducing and facultative anaerobic bacterium. This microorganism produces the outer membrane cytochromes called OmcA and MtrC at high density onto the cell surface via anaerobic cultivation. Unlike indirect electron transport involving mediator dispersion, an electron that is generated in the cell directly moves to the solid surface of the electrode through the outer membrane cytochromes [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. S. oneidensis MR- 1 produces electrically conductive pilus-like appendages [8] called bacterial nanowires [15] in direct response to the electron-acceptor limitation.|$|E
40|$|Protocatechuic {{aldehyde}} (PAL) {{has been}} reported to bind to DJ- 1, a key protein involved in Parkinson’s disease (PD), and exerts potential neuroprotective effects via DJ- 1 in SH-SY 5 Y cells. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective pharmacological effects of PAL against neurotoxin-induced cell and animal models of PD. In cellular models of PD, PAL markedly increased cell viability rates, mitochondrial <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>activity</b> and mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced intracellular ROS levels to prevent neurotoxicity in PC 12 cells. In animal models of PD, PAL reduced the apomorphine injection, caused turning in 6 -OHDA treated rats, and increased the motor coordination and stride decreases in MPTP treated mice. Meanwhile, in an MPTP mouse model, PAL prevented a decrease of the contents of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in the striatum and TH-positive dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra (SN). In addition, PAL increased the protein expression of DJ- 1 and reduced the level of α-synuclein in the SN of MPTP lesioned mice. PAL also increased the spine density in hippocampal CA 1 neurons. The current study demonstrates that PAL can efficiently protect dopaminergic neurons against neurotoxin injury in vitro and in vivo, and that the potential mechanisms may be related to its effects i...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of selected soil parameters on {{the mobility of}} heavy metals in soils The activity of zinc-lead industry has a very {{negative impact on the}} environment, mainly because of the accumulation of post-mining and metallurgical waste, which in the long term leads to an adverse transformation of natural environment due to migration of dust and metals to soils, surface waters and groundwater. Metals and their compounds present in the soil frac-tions vary in the degree of mobility. Their bioavailability is regulated by physical, chemical and biological processes and interactions between them. The method of binding heavy metals, and hence their bioavailability, depends on several soil properties, which include: granulomet-ric composition, organic matter content, occurrence and form of cations, pH value, sorption capacity, content of macro and micronutrients, <b>oxidation-reduction</b> potential, <b>activity</b> of mi-croorganisms, bioavailability for plants and animals, resistance of the soil. Mechanical compo-sition of soil is one of the important factors determining the extent of soil contamination with heavy metals and their content in plant tissues. Heavy soils, as compared to light soils, due to large amounts of suspended fraction, have a greater ability to retain metallic elements. On th...|$|R
40|$|A suspensionofchloroplasts, {{isolated}} from spinach cotyledons, {{was found to}} be an oscillatory system, i. e. a system in which one parameter (or more) varies over time in a fairly regular way. The oscillations, with a period of fifteen to twenty minutes,occured spontaneously in the light {{as well as in the}} dark and were self-sustained for several hours. Catalase activity was the parameter on which the oscillations in the chi oroplastic system were first observed and was also the parameter most intensely studied. Some other parameters investigated were the amount of glutathione, <b>oxidation-reduction</b> potential and <b>activities</b> of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and NADP- 1 inked malate dehydrogenase. Oscillations could be induced in previously non-oscillating systems (e. g. in dialysed chloroplast extracts) by addition of ascorbate and glutathione. A mechanism is suggested, built upon a respiratory chain in which the ascorbate and glutathione redox couples are involved and which is known to occur in young plants. The mechanism involves cyclic changes in the redox state of sulphur groups (-SH^^-SS- transitions) in some enzymes, causing changes in the activities of the enzyme. The proposed feed-back mechanism thus implies covalent modification of enzymes. The enzymes involved were found to be localized mainly in the stroma space of the chloroplast. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science Institute- Animal Science & IndustryAbbey L. NutschThis paper {{reviews the}} safe {{production}} of hard and semi-soft natural cheeses made from pasteurized milk, starter cultures, and enzymatic coagulation. Historically, raw milk {{has been a}} source of pathogenic bacteria; however, High Temperature Short Time (HTST) pasteurization has been proven to effectively control these pathogens. The US Public Health Service (USPHS) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) promulgate the legal operational parameters in the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to ensure milk is properly pasteurized and that dairy products are made in accordance with these regulatory standards. A combination of factors in the production of these natural cheeses further inhibits microorganisms. Intrinsic factors include pH, <b>oxidation-reduction</b> potential, water <b>activity,</b> nutrient content, natural inhibitors, and physical integrity. Extrinsic factors include temperature, relative humidity, gaseous environment, cumulative stress, and storage time. These factors contribute to a multiple hurdle effect that inhibits pathogens and spoilage organisms while also providing operational parameters to ensure flavor, texture, and other quality targets. Hard and semi-soft natural cheeses have been associated with few cases of food borne illness over the last few decades. Nevertheless, many operations in the dairy industry have voluntarily implemented food safety systems such as HACCP to ensure the continuous safe production of hard and semi-soft natural cheese...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of knowing the {{difference}} of ingredients of club-root gall caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae WORONIN and contiguous tissue of turnip, the microchemical and paper chromatographical analysis have been done. Cross sections of both tissues of young root of fresh material ware used in these tests. In the microchemical analysis, reactions for pH, inorganic substances (NH_ 4, PO_ 4, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu), organic compaunds (lignin, suberin, reducing sugars, dextrin, starch, protein, tannin, phenol and indol), enzymes (oxidase, psroxidase), and <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>activity</b> are respectively detected. Ferric compound is discovered more in diseased tissue than in contiguous tissue. The hydrogen-ion concentration of both tissues is approximately the same and is shown in pH 5. 3 - 6. 0. In general, there are almost no great differences between healthy tissue and the elemental tissues of gall. However, there are many infected cells which contain {{a large number of}} mature spores of the pathogen in the parenchyma tissue of gall. Two bases of phenol compound and indol substance are detected in the infected cells. And in these infected cells, protein reactions appear more abundantly than in the other portions. But alpha-amino acids (aspartic acid and glutamic acid) were found to be less in the gall than in the healthy tissue by the method of paper portion chromatography. This fact suggests the assumption that these free amino acids may be used for the assimilation of the pathogenic organism...|$|E
40|$|Background: Social insects exhibit {{striking}} {{phenotypic plasticity}} {{in the form}} of distinct reproductive (queen) and non-reproductive (worker) castes, which are typically driven by differences in the environment during early development. Nutritional environment and nourishment during development {{has been shown to be}} broadly associated with caste determination across social insect taxa such as bees, wasps, and termites. In primitively social insects such as Polistes paper wasps, caste remains flexible throughout adulthood, but there is evidence that nourishment inequalities can bias caste development with workers receiving limited nourishment compared to queens. Dominance and vibrational signaling are behaviors that have also been linked to caste differences in paper wasps, suggesting that a combination of nourishment and social factors may drive caste determination. To better understand the molecular basis of nutritional effects on caste determination, we used RNA-sequencing to investigate the gene expression changes in response to proteinaceous nourishment deprivation in Polistes metricus larvae. Results: We identified 285 nourishment-responsive transcripts, many of which are related to lipid metabolism and <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>activity.</b> Via comparisons to previously identified caste-related genes, we found that nourishment restriction only partially biased wasp gene expression patterns toward worker caste-like traits, which supports the notion that nourishment, in conjunction with social environment, is a determinant of developmental caste bias. In addition, we conducted cross-species comparisons of nourishment-responsive genes, and uncovered largely lineage-specific gene expression changes, suggesting few shared nourishment-responsive genes across taxa. Conclusion: Overall, the results from this study highlight the complex and multifactorial nature of environmental effects on the gene expression patterns underlying plastic phenotypes...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{activity}} in raw repurposed waters from {{oil and gas}} operations is known to cause enhanced corrosion in flow lines and downhole fouling in the reservoir if left un-treated. For this reason, shale operators prefer to use biocides or mobile treatment units to treat raw production waters. Unfortunately, field experience has shown that biocide treatments alone are ineffective and costly. In addition to these findings, produced water stability during storage is not yet well documented due to difficulty in obtaining timely and accurate microbial levels. Concluding an extensive literature review, industry inquiry, and referencing three levels of scale up testing (laboratory, pilot, and field scales), water treatment studies identified three low cost, real time analysis technologies. Using the identified technologies, membrane filtration was evaluated as a technique to reduce microbial activity and primary microbial metabolites in raw produced waters. Filtration treatment does efficiently reduce biomass levels in produced water. Using a two-stage filtration scheme with micro and nano filtration membranes, a significant reduction of divalent ion species and of biological activity is observed in permeate waters. Monovalent species were {{not found to be}} directly affected by filtration treatment. Metabolically active monovalent ions including: nitrate, ammonia, ammonium and nitrite were found to be reduced by microbial {{activity in}} permeate during temporary storage. Additional metabolically active ions including: soluble iron, sulfate, manganese, and dissolved organic carbon were found to be reduced by filtration treatment. Their divalent nature and organic compound molecular weight are thought to be the source. Concluding the study, it was found that treated produced water still exhibits an unstable, nutrient rich nature capable of supporting microbial growth and <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>activity</b> during storage. Therefore, without the addition of a biocide to establish a residual concentration, microbial biomass levels can be expected to regrow. Current publications available to industry members primarily focus on identifying corrosion and the specific bacteria responsible. Little information is published on methods of treatment and quality control. In addition few ?field ready? biological activity monitoring methods are available to the industry. Publishing this paper would provide information about testing technology and the specific metabolic species that must be monitored to ensure efficient microbial mitigation during treatment efforts...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to elucidate the genome-wide gene expression profile in streptozotocin induced diabetic rat liver tissues in response to resveratrol treatment and to establish differentially expressed transcription regulation networks with microarray technology. In addition to measure the expression levels of several antioxidant and detoxification genes, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was also used to verify the microarray results. Moreover, gene and protein expressions as well as enzymatic activities of main antioxidant enzymes; superoxide dismutase (SOD- 1 and SOD- 2) and glutathione S-transferase (GST-Mu) were analyzed. Diabetes altered 273 genes significantly and 90 of which were categorized functionally which suggested that genes in cellular catalytic <b>activities,</b> <b>oxidation-reduction</b> reactions, co-enzyme binding and terpenoid biosynthesis were dominated by up-regulated expression in diabetes. Whereas; genes responsible from cellular carbohydrate metabolism, regulation of transcription, cell signal transduction, calcium independent cell-to-cell adhesion and lipid catabolism were down-regulated. Resveratrol increased the expression of 186 and decreased the expression of 494 genes in control groups. While cellular and extracellular components, positive regulation of biological processes, biological response to stress and biotic stimulants, and immune response genes were up-regulated, genes responsible from proteins present in nucleus and nucleolus were mainly down-regulated. The enzyme assays showed a significant decrease in diabetic SOD- 1 and GST-Mu activities. The qRT-PCR and Western-blot results demonstrated that decrease in activity is regulated at gene expression level as both mRNA and protein expressions were also suppressed. Resveratrol treatment normalized the GST activities towards the control values reflecting a post-translational effect. As a conclusion, global gene expression in the liver tissues is affected by streptozotocin induced diabetes in several specific pathways. The present data suggest the presence of several processes which contribute and possibly interact to impair liver functions in type 1 diabetes, several of which are potentially amenable to therapeutic interventions with resveratrol...|$|R
