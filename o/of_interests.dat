5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was drawn}} to a {{diversity}} <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> throughout his life, from business to politics. After studying the law for three years, he wrote a number of potboiler novels under various pseudonyms.

5|$|A few British leaders, {{particularly}} Lord Mountbatten, {{the last}} British viceroy of India, were also uncomfortable with breaking links between independent India and the princely states. The development of trade, commerce and communications during the 19th and 20th centuries had bound the princely {{states to the}} British India through a complex network <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> Agreements relating to railways, customs, irrigation, use of ports, and other similar agreements would get terminated, posing {{a serious threat to}} the economic life of the subcontinent. Mountbatten was also persuaded by the argument of Indian officials such as V. P. Menon that the integration of the princely states into independent India would, to some extent, assuage the wounds of partition. The result was that Mountbatten personally favoured and worked towards the accession of princely states to India following the transfer of power, as proposed by the Congress.|$|E

5|$|Bute was {{determined}} to control the local government around Cardiff, considering it part of his rights and duties as a major landowner and aristocrat. On inheriting his estates, however, he found himself facing a difficult political situation. The Butes' grip on Glamorganshire had been weakened in the late 18th century, and the management of their political interests had been left {{for many years in}} the hands of John Wood, a local solicitor, whose family was embroiled in local politics, with their own set <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> Glamorgan was also politically split between factions in the west and the east of the county, with most of Bute's estates in the eastern half. Bute's residence in the area, Cardiff Castle, was understaffed and regarded as unsuitable as a residence; consequently, he lacked the easy local patronage that would have come with a major, properly functioning establishment.|$|E
5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel. According to Seth Killian, a former community manager for Capcom, Marvel presented {{a list of}} their own characters that {{they were interested in}} seeing in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities in order to reach a consensus. Each company also had their own set <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> and priorities. Marvel characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming products. On the other hand, Capcom sought to bring more diversity into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like character that could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of Firebrand.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E

5|$|In 1147 Manuel {{was faced}} with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had {{captured}} the Byzantine island of Corfu and plundered Thebes and Corinth.

In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs. Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily.

40|$|According to Wicksell's Classical Dichotomy {{the money}} rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{depends on the}} natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> but the latter {{does not depend on}} the former. If this Classical Dichotomy is false {{monetary}} policy may induce hysteresis because the natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> would depend upon the money rate <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> We use data for Israel to test Wicksell's Classical Dichotomy. We proxy the natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> by the forward yield to maturity on indexed-linked treasury bonds. If the null hypothesis is false it is difficult to suggest persuasive instruments that would identify the causal effect of the money rate on the natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Our identification strategy is therefore built around quasi-experimentation and event analysis. Large and seemingly orthogonal shocks to the natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> have no measurable effect on the natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> according to non-parametric and parametric tests.
