5|$|Wulfhere or Wulfar (died 675) was King of Mercia from 658 until 675 AD. He was {{the first}} Christian king of all of Mercia, {{though it is not}} known when <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{converted}} from Anglo-Saxon paganism. His accession marked the end of Oswiu of Northumbria's overlordship of southern England, and Wulfhere extended his influence over much of that region. His campaigns against the West Saxons led to Mercian control of much of the Thames valley. He conquered the Isle of Wight and the Meon valley and gave them to King Æthelwealh of the South Saxons. He also had influence in Surrey, Essex, and Kent. He married Eormenhild, the daughter of King Eorcenberht of Kent.|$|E
5|$|Much of Morgan's {{early life}} is unknown. He {{was born in}} south Wales, {{but it is not}} known how {{he made his way to}} the West Indies, <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> began his career as a privateer. He was {{probably}} a member of a group of raiders led by Sir Christopher Myngs in the early 1660s. Morgan became a close friend of Sir Thomas Modyford, the Governor of Jamaica. When diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of England and Spain worsened in 1667, Modyford gave Morgan a letter of marque, a licence to attack and seize Spanish vessels. Morgan subsequently conducted successful and highly lucrative raids on Puerto Principe (now Camagüey in modern Cuba) and Porto Bello (in modern Panama). In 1668 he sailed for Maracaibo and Gibraltar, both on Lake Maracaibo in modern-day Venezuela. He raided and plundered both cities before destroying a large Spanish squadron as he escaped.|$|E

5|$|The game's story follows Neku {{over the}} course of the three weeks that he plays the Game, paired with {{partners}} Shiki, Joshua, and Beat for each week, respectively. Neku is confused at first, lacking knowledge of how he died <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> arrived at the UG. As he develops friendships with his partners, he starts to understand the rules of the Game. After the first week, only Shiki is allowed to return to the living, and she promises to meet Neku at the statue of Hachiko. He also recovers his entry fee, which was his memories, except for the events leading up to his death. However, Shiki has become what Neku values most, and she is used as his new entry fee for the second week. During the second week he recalls small details of his death; eventually, he recognizes that he was shot at by Sho Minamimoto, one of the Reapers he faced during the Game. At the end of the second week, Joshua seemingly sacrifices himself to save Neku from an explosion created by Minamimoto.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} Prison Break—a man deliberately getting himself {{sent to prison}} {{in order to help}} someone escape—was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse, who wanted to produce an action-oriented series. Although Scheuring {{thought it was a good}} idea, he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> could develop it into a viable television show. He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother, and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long-term possibilities of such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series. Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries, which drew the interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds. Thus, the miniseries never materialized. Following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24, Fox decided to back the production in 2004. The pilot episode was filmed a year after Scheuring wrote the script.|$|E
25|$|Born in Calcutta in {{what was}} then the Bengal Presidency, Mustafa first {{appeared}} for the side in two matches played against the Pakistan national cricket team during the 1952–53 season. A right-handed batsman, his only match at first-class level came in January 1956, against a touring Marylebone Cricket Club side led by Donald Carr. In the match, played at Chittagong Stadium, Mustafa served as East Pakistan's captain, but was unsuccessful as a batsman, failing to reach double figures in either innings. The team as a whole was also unsuccessful, losing by an innings and 101 runs after having followed on. Mustafa did not play any further matches at first-class level, and died in Havana, Cuba, in July 1966, although it is unclear when <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had come to reside in Cuba.|$|E

25|$|Hinsley {{wrote that}} it was {{difficult}} to measure the influence of intelligence gained during the battle, because although Ultra revealed German situation reports, reinforcement details and unit identifications and that more intelligence was gleaned from prisoners and captured documents, it was not known how swiftly the information reached Freyberg <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> used it. The German parachute warfare manual had been captured in 1940 and after the war, Student said that he would have changed tactics, had he known. Field signals intelligence was obtained, including bombing instructions and information from the Fliegerkorps XI tactical code. Lack of air cover prevented much British air reconnaissance north of Crete but on 21 May, signals intelligence enabled an aircraft to spot a convoy. After midnight, twelve ships were sunk by the navy and the rest scattered, which led to a second invasion convoy being called back. The second convoy was intercepted during the morning of 22 May, despite the cost to the navy of a daylight operation and no more seaborne attempts were made.|$|E

VanDerWerff wrote that [...] "the show will just pick whichever characterization of Rory is most convenient for the episode in question", which made it [...] "hard to care all that much about <b>how</b> <b>he's</b> alone for Christmas <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>he's</b> building a friendship with Sam".|$|R

500|$|The police {{inspectors}} questioned Feletti, {{but each}} time they asked about {{anything to do with}} Mortara or his removal the monk said that a sacred oath precluded his discussing affairs of the Holy Office. When Curletti ordered him to hand over all files relating to the Mortara case, Feletti said that they had been burned—when asked when <b>or</b> <b>how,</b> <b>he</b> repeated that on Holy Office matters he could say nothing. Pressed further, Feletti said: [...] "As far as the activities that I carried out as Inquisitor of the Holy Office of Bologna, I am obliged to explain myself to one forum only, to the Supreme Sacred Congregation in Rome, whose Prefect is His Holiness Pope Pius IX, and to no-one else." [...] After the police searched the convent for documents relating to the Mortara case—they found nothing—the inquisitor was escorted to prison.

500|$|The episode also {{received}} some criticism. Dan Compora of Airlock Alpha {{said after a}} run of [...] "several strong" [...] episodes, Lost [...] "has slipped into mediocrity. While none of the recent episodes have been bad, they haven't been anything special. For a hundredth episode, average simply isn't good enough. While the shooting of Daniel at the end was stunning, I expected something much more {{from the rest of}} the episode than learning the identity of Daniel's parents." [...] A reviewer for TVoholic.com thought the episode was good, though not as good as [...] "The Constant", and he thought [...] "it came with lots of answers and references to past episodes from this season and the ones before it, making it all the more exciting." [...] The reviewer would, however, have [...] "loved any sort of explanation as to why [...] changed his mind about changing the past <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> thought this could work. There must have been something that made Daniel think this was possible, but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain." [...] Jon Lachonis of TVOvermind said that as an internal character piece, [...] "The Variable" [...] was not [...] "so much a great ending for Daniel. We brushed up against many key events and people – Theresa, Daniel’s ‘nurse’, and the Widmore and Eloise parental connection, etc. – but these forays into the geniuses’ past events were more to thread Daniel through the plot than to establish their connection to who Daniel truly was." ...|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that you want and I can give them to you and {{all you have to do}} is give me your soul".|$|E

500|$|Knox did not record when <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> was {{converted}} to the Protestant faith, {{but perhaps the}} key formative influences on Knox were Patrick Hamilton and George Wishart. Wishart was a reformer who had fled Scotland in 1538 to escape punishment for heresy. He first moved to England, where in Bristol he preached against the veneration of the Virgin Mary. He was forced to make a public recantation and was burned in effigy at the Church of St Nicholas {{as a sign of}} his abjuration. He then took refuge in Germany and Switzerland. While on the Continent, he translated the First Helvetic Confession into English. He returned to Scotland in 1544, but the timing of his return was unfortunate. In December 1543, James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault, the appointed regent for the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, had decided with the Queen Mother, Mary of Guise, and Cardinal David Beaton to persecute the Protestant sect that had taken root in Scotland. Wishart travelled throughout Scotland preaching in favour of the reformation and when he arrived in East Lothian, Knox became one of his closest associates. Knox acted as his bodyguard, bearing a two-handed sword in order to defend him. In December 1545, Wishart was seized on Beaton's orders by the Earl of Bothwell and taken to the Castle of St Andrews. Knox was present on the night of Wishart's arrest and was prepared to follow him into captivity, but Wishart persuaded him against this course saying, [...] "Nay, return to your bairns [...] and God bless you. One is sufficient for a sacrifice." [...] Wishart was subsequently prosecuted by Beaton's Public Accuser of Heretics, Archdeacon John Lauder. On 1 March 1546, he was burnt at the stake in the presence of Beaton.|$|E
500|$|Herbert [...] "Herb" [...] Powell (voiced by Danny DeVito), is Homer's {{paternal}} half-brother. He resembles Homer, {{though he}} is much thinner, boasts {{a full head of}} hair and is more astute. He first appeared in the season two episode [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] when Homer discovered he had a half-brother, the product of a short-lived affair between his father Abe and a carnival dunk-tank worker who was also a prostitute (identified in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album as [...] "Gaby"). [...] A year after putting the baby up for adoption, Abe married Mona, who insisted he promise never to tell Homer about Herb <b>or</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> was conceived. [...] Herb was raised by his adoptive parents Edward and [...] Mililani Powell (first names given in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album), put himself through college by working odd jobs, then founded Powell Motors, a car company based in Detroit. Herb is an exception to [...] "the Simpson Gene", which causes all male members of the Simpson family to gradually lose their intelligence as they mature, as Herb is intelligent, successful and an astute businessman, becoming extremely wealthy due to his car dealership. Overjoyed to learn that he had a blood family, Herb bonded with the children and hired Homer, as a representative of average Americans, to design a car. The car was a flop, bankrupting the company, and Herb angrily rejects Homer as a brother and became a street vagrant. The episode was written by Jeff Martin but the idea of having Herb voiced by Danny DeVito had been pitched by Sam Simon. Some were upset with the sad ending of the episode, and as a result the producers decided to make a sequel. Herb re-appeared the next season in [...] "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?". Now broke and homeless, he briefly settled in the Simpson household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb $2000, which Herb used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie. He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune. In gratitude, he bought gifts for each member of the family and paid Homer back with his forgiveness. Homer's [...] "seldom seen half-brother" [...] has had only one brief speaking part since this episode: DeVito reprised his role for the Season 24 episode [...] "The Changing of the Guardian", in which Powell's answering machine message, [...] "Hi, you've reached Herb Powell. I'm poor again.", is heard.|$|E
