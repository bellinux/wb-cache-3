Hospital 5 used to contain the midwifery department which closed in the 1980s and many older female patients admitted to the medical wards of Hospital 5 recounted how they had delivered their children in the same building many years previously. Other buildings such as hospital 1 changed function moving from providing inpatient care (hospital 1: oncology/cardiology/medical) to providing administration or day care services. Hospital 3 (a nice building which still had bullet holes in its walls from the Easter Rising) was sadly knocked down in the early 1990s (for parking). The school of nursing/Nurses Home building became administrations offices with the main teaching room becoming the Board Room. The current main hospital canteen was a former surgical ward.|$|E

Two hypotheses are tested: (i) Levels of income inequality decline during old age because public benefits are more equally distributed than work income; (ii) Because of the progressive nature of government benefits, countries with stronger public income security programs are better able to reduce income inequalities during old age. The analysis is performed by comparing age groups within seven OECD countries (Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) using Luxembourg Income Study data. Both hypotheses are supported. Several conclusions are drawn from the findings. retirement, income dynamics, comparative analysis, public pensions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA new Bayesian {{approach}} to multistage hypothesis testing is considered. Prior is derived using Jeffreys' criterion on likelihood {{associated with the}} design information. We show that the prior for sequential Bernoulli design asymptotically converges toward the Jeffreys prior in Pascal sampling model. A general rule is given for determining the design-corrected version of default priors when Jeffreys' criterion results in improper distribution. Based {{on the principle of}} design impartiality, the Bayes factor as posterior-based evidential measure can be generalized to multistage testing, so that the decision boundaries reflect equal evidence for hypotheses <b>over</b> <b>stages.</b> Effect of prior correction on design parameters and on Bayesian inference upon test termination is studied. The approach is applied to a three-stage binomial design. Last, the use of the prior as the default objective choice in multistage hypothesis testing is discussed...|$|E

Alkenone derived temperatures recorded a warming of 4. 5 degrees C during the last deglaciation. n-Alkanol Mass Accumulation Rates (MAR) fluctuated in parallel with Northeast Trade Winds (NETW) intensity. OC and sterol MAR both increased during glacial times indicating enhanced fertility of the ocean in response to intensified NETW. Alkenone/OC ratios were higher {{by a factor of}} two <b>over</b> <b>stages</b> 4 - 6 than stages 1 - 3 thus reflecting distinct coccolirhophorid inputs.

40|$|Abstract. Type-based {{termination}} is a semantically intuitive {{method that}} ensures termination of recursive definitions by tracking {{the size of}} datatype elements, and by checking that recursive calls operate on smaller arguments. However, many systems using type-based termina-tion rely on a semantical anomaly to guarantee strong normalization; namely, they impose that non-recursive elements of a datatype, e. g. the empty list, have size 1 instead of 0. This semantical anomaly also pre-vents functions such as quicksort {{to be given a}} precise typing. The main contribution of this paper is a type system that remedies this anomaly, and still ensures termination. In addition, our type system fea-tures prenex stage polymorphism, a weakening of existential quantifica-tion <b>over</b> <b>stages,</b> and is precise enough to type quicksort as a non-size increasing function. Moreover, our system accomodate stage addition with all positive inductive types. ...|$|E

40|$|Assume {{that players}} {{strictly}} rank {{each other as}} coalition partners. We propose a procedure whereby they “fall back” on their preferences, yielding internally compatible, or coherent, majority coalition(s), which we call fallback coalitions. If {{there is more than}} one fallback coalition, the players common to them, or kingmakers, determine which fallback coalition will form. The first player(s) acceptable to all other members of a fallback coalition are the leader(s) of that coalition. The effects of different preference assumption [...] particularly, different kinds of single-peakedness [...] and of player weights on the number of coherent coalitions, their connectedness, and which players become kingmakers and leaders are investigated. The fallback procedure may be used (i) empirically to identify kingmakers and leaders or (ii) normatively to select them. We illustrate and test the model by applying it to coalition formation on the U. S. Supreme Court, 2005 - 2009, which shows the build-up <b>over</b> <b>stages</b> of a conservative coalition that prevailed in nearly half of the 5 - 4 decisions. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{temporal}} interpretation of noun phrases. The leading questions throughout are the following: (1) Is the temporal {{interpretation of a}} noun phrase determined by the temporal interpretation {{of the rest of}} its clause? (2) " What kind of further interactions take place between the interpretation of noun phrases and the temporal interpretation of the main predicate of a clause? The framework in which these questions are answered exploits an ontology that assumes individuals, stages of individuals, and kinds as basic entities. Determiner-quantification is argued to be quantification <b>over</b> <b>stages</b> of individuals rather than individuals in their whole temporal extendedness. Chapter I provides a survey of the main topics of this thesis.
