5000|$|Schoolyear 2008-2009 {{featured}} a new Schoolhead - Sister Ma. Lina R. Despojo, OSA. The schoolyear was marked with several significant features and achievements. The school celebrated its Sixtieth (60th) Foundation Anniversary in January, 2009 via meaningful {{activities such as}} the Dawn Procession, a Grand Eucharistic Celebration, a Pictorial Exhibit of the school’s history; blessing of the grotto - Jardin de Maria; blessing of the Hotel and Restaurant Training Center, Hotel Consolatrix and Café Consuelo; Field Demonstrations of the Philippine Festivals and Dances; the Medical Mission; Alumni Tree-Planting Activity and the Parent-sponsored Family Day Celebration. The LCC Hymn was likewise launched and a Diamond Baby was declared. The ladderized course for a four-year Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management was likewise finally approved by the Commission on Higher Education. The Basic Education also became a recipient of the Educational Service Contracting (ESC) scheme and a new batch of the Free High School students (2008-2013) was accepted for the schoolyear.With Sister Ma. Lina R. Despojo, OSA as schoolhead, schoolyear 2009-2010 was marked with varied significant accomplishments. A speech laboratory was prepared and made fully functional for student-use. The stage at the quadrangle was renovated and provided with roof. Moreover, a satellite canteen has been provided at the fourth floor for more convenience of the school clientele. More significantly, the school in coordination with the Parish of St. Anthony of Padua - undertook a joint catechetical and feeding programs to the indigenous peoples of the Ilian settlement. The Basic Education Department (BED) revised their Students’s Handbook and the staff undertook varied preparations for the new BED curriculum - Understanding by Design (UBD). Having successfully passed the previous re- accreditations, PAASCU invited the High School Department to apply for Level III status. The BED students were likewise awarded at several competitions in mathematics sponsored by the Mathematics teachers Association of the Philippines (MTAP). The College department {{on the other hand}} had several accomplishments namely: The consistent one hundred percent passing mark of the examinees in the TESDA-administered National Competency II in Commercial Cooking, Housekeeping, Tour Guiding and Front office Management; the approved permit from CHED to operate the ladderized Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management and the completed self-survey report on Institutional Quality Assurance, Monitoring and Evaluation (IQUAME). Moreover, in response to the call for access and equity for tertiary education, the school offered the Mother Consuelo Financial Assistance program (MCFAP) to the college freshmen.For schoolyear 2010-2011 it had the following notable achievements: a concrete fence surrounding the school premises has been provided; a Student Activity Handbook for the BED was published; and re-ranking of the school staff was done. Moreover, the terminal courses were updated as required by TESDA and CHED finally granted Government Recognition for the full operation of a ladderized program for Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM).Schoolyear 2011-2012 with Sr. Ma. Lina R. Despojo, OSA as Schoolhead featured such notable accomplishments as: the preparation of the institution’s Five-Year Long-Range Development Program 2011-2016 and the conduct of the Fourth Re-Survey of the Basic Education Department by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) in January, 2012. Moreover, massive preparations, revisions and updating were made of the school’s Administrative Manual, Teacher’s Handbook, College Student’s Handbook and Office Guides. The schoolyear also featured relocations and improvement of facilities. A Dry laboratory was provided and installed with multi-media system. Air-conditioning units were likewise provided at the BED Library and CIMC and Faculty rooms were installed with intercom connections. The schoolyear also marked the start of the K to 12 Program of the Department of Education (Dep Ed) un the Kindergarten level. March, 2012 featured the first batch of graduates in the ladderized program for Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM).Having been granted a re-accreditation status by PAASCU, schoolyear 2012-2013 marked the start of the five-year (2012-2017) re-accredited status of its Basic Education department. The College Department also celebrated its twentieth (20th) Foundation Anniversary in September 4, 2012. The ongoing enhancement of school services featured the computerization of the operations of the Registrar’s Office as well as the Finance unit. A biometric device for attendance monitoring of the school staff was likewise installed, and the school’s website was re-activated. Moreover, the Faculty Research Journal was published. An Academic Team was created in the BED and the K to 12 Program progressed to cover Kindergarten, Grade I and Grade VII. This schoolyear also marked the graduation of the Free High School Batch 2008-2013.Schoolyear 2013-2014 marked the school’s Sixty-Fifth (65th) Foundation Anniversary. Celebrated in January, 2014, this jubilee featured simple yet meaningful activities starting with a Dawn Procession a Eucharistic Celebration, Outreach activities and finally a cultural show. Prior to this celebration, the whole school community headed by Sr. Ma. Lina R. Despojo, OSA, President, College Dean & BED Principal reviewed the school’s Foundations and came up on its sixty-fifth year with the new Vision and Mission of La Consolacion College- Iriga. The Vision states - “Community of Friends for God and others.” The Mission of the school is - “A holistic formation rooted in Gospel values through Augustinian Education.” Moreover, in preparation for the celebration there was a massive physical plant enhancement which included a renovation of the St. Augustine Auditorium now fully furnished with modern lighting and sounds, stage draperies and lockers. Re-painting of the school building and re-tiling of the corridors were likewise done. New seats were provided in the Grade School classrooms and in the libraries. Re-ranking of the personnel was done. This schoolyear, the Teacher-Education department produced among its graduates a National Placer (8th place) at the September,2013 Licensure Examination for Teachers.Schoolyear 2014-2015 marked the internationalization of student activities of the school. Eighteen students and two teachers participated in the Augustinian Youth Encounter held in Ketapang City, West Kalimantan, Indonesia last October 24-30, 2014. Furthermore, the BS Tourism Management department embarked on its first international tour to Hong Kong last February 27-31, 2015. The school paper of the high school department - the Consolinian received regional recognition such as Best in Editorial Page and Science and Technology Page and one high school student won 2nd place in Sports Writing Filipino. The College of Teacher Education also hosted the 2015 Regional CODTE Congress. Some notable improvements on the school facilities include: fully air-conditioned classrooms of the Basic Education Department and new chairs for the Grade School Department. Towards {{the end of the school}} year, the school was granted by Department of Education the permit to offer the Academic and Technical Vocational Tracks in Senior High School. For schoolyear 2015-2016, the school had its new set of administrators. Sr. Evangeline B. Algaba, OSA as the new President and College Dean while Sr. Ma. Sheila M. Carpentero as BED Principal. The new administration had likewise made significant improvement in the school’s physical plant facilities. New chairs were provided in the college department, 24 units of 50 inches LED Television in BED Classrooms, newly renovated Physics room equipped with state-of-the art facilities and among others. The school has likewise started the computerization of the grade posting in the College Department. Despite of the <b>over-all</b> <b>decrease</b> in enrolment, Grade 7 enrolment showed an increase of 5 students this school year. Despite the odds, La Consolacion College, Iriga City on its sixty-fifth (67th) year of existence continues to be enlivened by the Augustinian Spirit through the inspiration of Our Lady of Consolation and the blessings of the Lord Almighty.Let us all move onwards to continue and attain the Vision-Mission of LCC-I! ...|$|E

In envelopes, violaxanthin was also decreased and the relative decrease was similar to thylakoids, but zeaxanthin increase was small resulting in an <b>over-all</b> <b>decrease</b> {{of the amount of}} envelope carotenoids.

40|$|The {{vesicular}} stomatitis virus (VSV) nucleoprotein (N) associates tightly with the viral genomic RNA. This N-RNA complex con-stitutes the template for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L, which engages the nucleocapsid via its phosphoprotein cofactor P. While N and P proteins play {{important roles in}} regulating viral gene expression, the molecular basis of this regulation remains incompletely understood. Here we show that mutations in the extreme C terminus of N cause defects in viral gene expression. To determine the underlying cause of such defects, we {{examined the effects of}} the mutations separately on encapsidation and RNA synthesis. Expression of N together with P in Escherichia coli results predominantly in the formation of decameric N-RNA rings. In contrast, nucleocapsid complexes containing the substitution NY 415 A or NK 417 A were more loosely coiled, as revealed by elec-tronmicroscopy (EM). In addition, the NEF 419 / 420 AA mutant was unable to encapsidate RNA. To further characterize these mu-tants, we engineered an infectious cDNA clone of VSV and employed N-RNA templates from those viruses to reconstitute RNA synthesis in vitro. The transcription assays revealed specific defects in polymerase utilization of the template that result in <b>over-all</b> <b>decreased</b> RNA quantities, including reduced amounts of leader RNA. Passage of the recombinant viruses in cell culture led to the accumulation of compensatory second-site mutations in close proximity to the original mutations, underscoring the critical role of structural features within the C terminus in regulating N function. Nonsegmented negative-strand (NNS) RNA viruses are envel-oped pathogens, which tightly encapsidate their genomes with the nucleoprotein (N) during all stages of replication. N en...|$|R
40|$|Montane regions {{worldwide}} {{have experienced}} relatively low plant invasion rates, a trend attributed to increased cli-matic severity, {{low rates of}} disturbance, and reduced propagule pressure relative to lowlands. Manipulative experi-ments at elevations above the invasive range of non-native species can clarify the relative contributions of these mechanisms to montane invasion resistance, yet such experiments are rare. Furthermore, global climate change and land use changes are expected to cause decreases in snowpack and increases in disturbance by fire and forest thin-ning in montane forests. We examined {{the importance of these}} factors in limiting montane invasions using a field transplant experiment above the invasive range of two non-native lowland shrubs, Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and Spanish broom (Spartium junceum), in the rain–snow transition zone of the Sierra Nevada of California. We tested the effects of canopy closure, prescribed fire, and winter snow depth on demographic transitions of each species. Establishment of both species was most likely at intermediate levels of canopy disturbance, but at this intermediate canopy level, snow depth had negative effects on winter survival of seedlings. We used matrix population models to show that an 86 % reduction in winter snowfall would cause a 2. 8 -fold increase in population growth rates in Scotch broom and a 3. 5 -fold increase in Spanish broom. Fall prescribed fire increased germination rates, but <b>decreased</b> <b>over-all</b> population growth rates by reducing plant survival. However, at longer fire return intervals, population recover...|$|R

The present micropuncture experiments were carried out in order to study the possible role of altered peritubular physical forces (hydrostatic and colloid oncotic pressure) in mediating these two changes. Proximal tubular reabsorptive capacity, transit time, fractional reabsorption of sodium and water, πr 2 d/Vo, and intratubular hydrostatic pressure were measured in saline-loaded rats during acute changes in renal perfusion pressure induced by intermittent constriction of the abdominal aorta...|$|E
40|$|Total {{and free}} amino acid {{composition}} of germinating cotton seeds (Gossypium hirsutum L.) was determined.

This technique allowed changes in distribution with time of each amino acid to be followed in each tissue. Data for total content and amount in protein of each amino acid are presented. Asparagine increased in the whole seed, and most of this increase {{was found in the}} free pool of the developing axis. Other amino acids (e. g. arginine, glutamic acid) increased in the free pool but showed an <b>over-all</b> <b>decrease,</b> indicating that they were being metabolized.

40|$|Intermediate {{filaments}} {{are part}} of the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton; they provide cells with structure and have important roles in cell signalling. The IFs are a large protein family with more than 70 members; each tightly regulated and expressed in a cell type-specific manner. Although the IFs have been known and studied for decades, our knowledge about their specific functions is still limited, despite the fact that mutations in IF genes cause numerous severe human diseases. In this work, three IF proteins are examined more closely; the nuclear lamin A/C and the cytoplasmic nestin and vimentin. In particular the regulation of lamin A/C dynamics, the role of nestin in muscle and body homeostasis as well as the functions and evolutionary aspects of vimentin are investigated. Together this data highlights some less well understood functions of these IFs. We used mass-spectrometry to identify inter-phase specific phosphorylation sites on lamin A. With the use of genetically engineered lamin A protein in combination with high resolution microscopy and biochemical methods we discovered novel roles for this phosphorylation in regulation of lamin dynamics. More specifically, our data suggests that the phosphorylation of certain amino acids in lamin A determines the localization and dynamics of the protein. In addition, we present results demonstrating that lamin A regulates Cdk 5 -activity. In the second study we use mice lacking nestin to gain more knowledge of this seldom studied protein. Our results show that nestin is essential for muscle regeneration; mice lacking nestin recover more slowly from muscle injury and show signs of spontaneous muscle regeneration, indicating that their muscles are more sensitive to stresses and injury. The absence of nestin also leads to <b>decreased</b> <b>over-all</b> muscle mass and slower body growth. Furthermore, nestin has a role in controlling testicle homeostasis as nestin-/- male mice show a greater variation in testicle size. The common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster lacks cytoplasmic IFs as most insects do. By creating a fly that expresses human vimentin we establish a new research platform for vimentin studies, as well as provide a new tool for the studies of IF evolution...|$|R

In Klinefelter's syndrome, the arches of the thumbs and the ulnar loops of the index fingers were frequent, and the whorls of the index fingers were infrequent compared with the normal male and female controls with statistic significance. The loops and whorls seen in Klinefelter's syndrome showed ridge-counts less than the control subjects. The total finger ridge-counts were significantly less than those observed in the normal male and female subjects probably due to <b>over-all</b> <b>decrease</b> of the ridge-counts of the finger-prints rather than increase of the arches.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{associated}} the S 18 Y polymorphic variant of UCH-L 1 with protection from sporadic Parkinson’s Disease (PD). The mechanism involved in this protective function is unknown, but has generally been assumed to be linked to the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS). In the current study, we have inves-tigated the effects of overexpression of UCH-L 1 and its variants, including S 18 Y, in neuronal cells. We find that S 18 Y, but not WT, UCH-L 1 confers a specific antioxidant protective function when expressed at physio-logical levels in human neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons. In contrast, neither WT nor S 18 Y UCH-L 1 appear to directly impact the proteasome, although they both lead to stabilization of free ubiquitin. Lack of WT mouse UCH-L 1 in neurons derived from gad mice led to a decrease of free ubiquitin, but no <b>over-all</b> <b>decrease</b> in UPS function or enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress. We conclude that the S 18 Y variant of UCH-L 1 confers a novel antioxidant function that is not present in the WT form and that this function may underlie the protective effects of this variant in certain PD populations. Our results furthermore provide indir-ect evidence for the importance of oxidative stress as a pathogenetic factor in certain forms of sporadic PD...|$|E
40|$|Shifting the {{temperature}} of a yeast culture from 23 degrees to 36 degrees C results in a sudden and severe (greater than 85 %) decline in the cellular levels of ribosomal protein (rp-) mRNAs. Recovery during continued growth at 36 degrees C occurs within 1 h. The use of hybrid genes carrying different portions of the region upstream of the gene coding for ribosomal protein L 25 revealed that this characteristic, coordinate temperature shock phenomenon {{does not depend on}} the presence of specific upstream DNA sequences. Analysis of a heterologous gene carrying a synthetic UASrpg (upstream activation site of yeast ribosomal protein genes) provided conclusive evidence that the rp-characteristic, transient heat shock response is not mediated through the UASrpg elements. The addition of the transcription inhibitor 1, 10 -phenantroline prior to a 23 degrees to 36 degrees C heat shock inhibited the severe decline of the rp-mRNA levels. The latter observation indicates that transcription is required for the rp-gene- specific response to heat shock. A milder temperature shift, from 23 degrees to 30 degrees C, gave rise to a two-fold decrease in mRNA levels for all genes studied, both ribosomal and non-ribosomal. Together, these results indicate that a temperature shift causes a temporary general transcriptional arrest in yeast cells, resulting in an <b>over-all</b> <b>decrease</b> in mRNA levels. In addition, an enhanced nucleolytic break-down of pre-existing rp-mRNAs accounts for the dramatic drop in the steady state amounts of these mRNAs observed upon a 23 degrees [...] 36 degrees C shift. This enhanced breakdown is caused directly or indirectly by a factor whose synthesis is induced by the heat shock treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{years between}} the fall of Sebastopol and the {{outbreak}} of war in South Africa in 1899 witnessed considerable changes in British society and for the British army were years which heralded reforms in army organization, tactics and weaponry, and military thinking. There were important reforms which affected the terms and conditions of service and recruitment, {{and these are the}} concern of this thesis. The conditions of service are best divided into four main areas: army health; army education; discipline and crime; and pay, career prospects, and discharge. Each of these is singled out in a separate chapter and dealt with in turn. To set the scene, Chapter I describes the size of the Victorian army in this period, its constituent parts and its employment. It also outlines recent historical discussion of the army and points out how sketchy the treatment of the topics of this thesis has been partly because of source limitations. Discussion of the conditions of service begins in Chapter II with the health of the army. Improvement over the conditions of 1856 was more marked in this area than in any other. This was a result of better diet, clothing, physical training, and most important, a better environment and an improved medical care. Chapter III deals with the questions of education and literacy in the army and discusses, since the two were inseparably linked, the educational provisions made for the soldier and for his children. The army's response to the need for an educated soldiery was a comprehensive system of education for man and child which, by virtue of universality, cost, curriculum, and quality of instruction, far outweighed the provisions society made in general for the education of the working classes for most of this period. It is discipline above all else that ultimately distinguishes an army from any other group of men. This is the subject of Chapter IV: discipline, crime in the ranks, and its prevention. Wholesale reduction in the severity of punishment and the large scale provision of recreational facilities brought an <b>over-all</b> <b>decrease</b> in crime by 1900, but failure to ease the many restrictions of army life and to relax the bonds of discipline meant that minor disobedience, insubordination, and desertion would remain as prevalent as ever. Chapter V deals with pay, career prospects, and discharge from the Service, questions which were of the most importance to army recruits. In contrast to other areas in which considerable success was achieved in bettering many of the conditions of military service, there was a striking failure to increase substantially the army's attractions either by augmenting pay, improving career prospects, or by providing adequately for the discharge of men from the forces, The connections between the conditions of service and recruitment are particularly close in a voluntary-service army since alterations to one can easily bring about changes {{in the state of the}} other. The subjects of the following two chapters are the recruiting problem and patterns of recruitment. Throughout this time the army did not raise enough men to meet its requirements. Chapter VI considers and assesses the attempts to improve recruitment through altering the terms and conditions of service, and modifying the recruiting system. Chapter VII explains the nature of the very considerable changes in the patterns cf recruitment that took place between 1856 and 1899 without solving the basic shortage of men. The final chapter of this thesis concludes with an assessment of almost a half century of reform from 1556 to 1899. Conditions for the enlisted man and his family had improved markedly in many respects since the middle of the century, and in some ways too the image of the forces had changed. If it was not respectable to become a soldier, it was at least becoming respectable to be one. The disastrous opening of the war in South Africa forced a new period of discussion about the question of military reform at all levels...|$|E
