50|$|A <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> is {{a period}} of one year (or {{sometimes}} less), designated for reporting and (or) analysis of production, marketing and disposition of a commodity. (Disposition of an agricultural crop might include such uses as food, animal feed, industry, seed, and export, as well as changes in stocks.) Because of year-to-year fluctuations in production, much marketing and disposition of some commodities may reflect production that occurred during a previous calendar year. For this reason, analysis is often facilitated if the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> for a crop commences at about the time of harvest. However, world markets or other factors may also influence choice of beginning date for the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> for some commodities in some countries. Especially in the case of certain perishable fresh fruits and vegetables, the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> may be less than a full year in length, because economic activity of interest for reporting and analysis may be concluded within just a few months.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on a {{description}} of the winegrowing and wine-production in Australia, a country, which is becoming a more and more significant producer and exporter of wine in the world, and has become a part of competitive environment of the winegrowing and wine-production industry in the Czech Republic. Structural analysis of external environment is a part of strategic analysis of an industry, where one of the key parts is the analysis of competitive environment within an industry. Winegrowing areas of Australia are nowadays located mostly in the colder climatic zone of Australia. In the 70 -ies of the last century, there were planted new vineyards, in these areas, and the grapes from them have started to be used for production of quality-wine and the production of sweet wines and brandies have decreased. The most significant wine-production state has become the South Australia with the sound vineyards around the Murray River. The area of the productive vineyards has doubled, in the past seven years; most of the vineyards are under irrigation. The total grape production in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2001 – 2002 was 1   514   501  t, where 56 % were the blue grapes. In the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2001 – 2002, there was produced 1   220  mil. litres of wine and 416  mil. litres were exported., whereas in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2002 – 2003 the exports amounted for 508  mil. litres of wine. Most of the wine was exported to the Great Britain – in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2001 – 2002 it was 48 % of the total exports. In 2003 – 2004, were exported to the Czech Republic 466   914  litres of wine, which is an 850 % growth within the past four years. The average price of 1 litre of wine imported to the Czech Republic was 2. 16  €, in the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2002 – 2003, and have grown by 0. 28  € in the following year. Wine imports to Australia are decreasing from the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 1997 – 1998. In the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 2002 – 2003, the imports were 17  mil. litres of wine, for 81  mil €. Consumption of all alcoholic drinks recounted to the per capita and per year level is decreasing in Australia; from the <b>marketing</b> <b>year</b> 1977 – 1978 it have fallen by 26 % to the year 1999 – 2000, but the wine consumption have grown by 43. 6 % in the same period.

40|$|Corporate {{cash reserve}} has an adverse {{selection}} effect. Specifically, if investors know a {{company does not}} have to issue to invest, an attempt to do so sends a strong signal of overvaluation. This notion has not been explicitly studied in the extant empirical literature, despite its intuitiveness. Using a sample of acquisitions solely financed by stock to exclude the potential complications of free cash flow, I find that announcement returns are lower for a bidder with a higher excess cash reserve. This effect is stronger in hot equity <b>market</b> <b>years</b> or when a bidder's standalone value is more difficult to evaluate. I also find evidence supporting the idea that targets request cash payment to remove "lemon" bidders in normal (non-hot equity <b>market)</b> <b>years,</b> but accept too many stock offers in hot equity <b>market</b> <b>years.</b> After acquisitions, high-excess-cash-reserve bidders operationally outperform low-excess-cash-reserve bidders. Further, they spend more funds on reducing debt but not more on investments, compared with low-excess-cash-reserve bidders. Combined, these results show that cash reserve has information costs. Further, they highlight the importance of the two-sided information asymmetry framework of Rhodes-Kropf and Viswanathan (2004) in describing merger outcomes without resorting to behavioral or agency explanations.
