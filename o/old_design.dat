5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how the 1913 nickels {{came to be}} made. The Mint's records show no production of 1913 Liberty head nickels, and none were authorized to be made. Dies were prepared in advance and sent to California for a 1913-S Liberty Head nickel coinage, but upon orders from Mint Director Roberts in December 1912 to end the <b>old</b> <b>design,</b> they were returned to Philadelphia. They were received by December 23, and were almost certainly destroyed routinely by early January. Brown had been an employee at the Philadelphia Mint (although this was not known until 1963) and many theories focus suspicion on him.|$|E

50|$|In early 2005, {{another new}} Zoid line was launched, to tie into the Zoids: Genesis anime. The line {{consists}} of a mixture of <b>old</b> <b>designs,</b> new <b>designs</b> and <b>older</b> <b>designs</b> with new parts. The line is most notable for the much-anticipated reissues of Houndsoldier and Gilvader.|$|R

As of April 2017 the <b>old</b> <b>Design</b> Museum is largely empty and expected to be converted into luxury apartments.|$|E
25|$|All {{these changes}} (with the {{exception}} of the new top feed) were later applied to locomotives that had been built earlier. The new top feed became standard for new locomotives in 1944. Some older boilers and locomotives were later fitted with the new top feed, and some locomotives that were built with the new top feed were later changed back to the <b>old</b> <b>design</b> as boilers were swapped.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Virginia {{recalled}} its vanity {{plates with}} the Confederate flag emblem pictured within the logo of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. To holders of SCV plates, the state mailed replacements without the emblem. The <b>old</b> <b>design</b> with the emblem was invalidated and driving with such Virginia tags {{was made a}} misdemeanor similar to driving an unlicensed vehicle; though, in October 2015 a SCV legal team tried fighting the ban in court.|$|E

25|$|A {{player can}} have {{no more than six}} piece designs at any one time, so new designs can only be created by {{removing}} old designs. Only pieces that are in your current set of designs can be bought, so that it takes at least two turns to get any fairy chess piece on the board. Removing an <b>old</b> <b>design</b> does not affect pieces of that design already on the board or in the reserves of that design.|$|E
25|$|This {{is another}} <b>old</b> <b>design</b> making a {{comeback}} thanks to Lee Valley's Veritas Toolworks. The twin-screw vise was popular during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, particularly with chair makers. The updated Veritas design uses a chain to connect the two screws, keeping them slaved to each other. There is also a provision for decoupling the screws so that tapered work can be held. This design has many {{of the advantages of}} the classic shoulder vise and single screw face vise, with few of the disadvantages. It can also be used effectively as an end vise. The main drawbacks of the twin-screw vise are the expense and the relatively difficult installation.|$|E
25|$|There {{came to be}} {{problems}} with interpretation of the franchise terms for the City. By 1912, the city limits had extended significantly, with the annexation of communities to the north (1912: North Toronto) and the east (1908: Town of East Toronto) and the west (1909: the City of West Toronto—The Junction). After many attempts to force the TRC to serve these areas, the City created its own street railway operation, the Toronto Civic Railways to do so, and built several routes. Repeated court battles forced the TRC to build new cars, but they were of <b>old</b> <b>design.</b> When the TRC franchise ended in 1921, the Toronto Transportation Commission (TTC) was created, combining the city-operated Toronto Civic Railways lines into its new network.|$|E

25|$|These seals {{were used}} until 1873, when a European {{inspired}} {{coat of arms}} was designated by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) as the national emblem of Siam. However, {{the creation of the}} coat of arms did not entirely replace the old royal seals, for a law promulgated in 1890, stated that the Khrut Pha and the Airaphot seals would continue to be used. In 1893 the King changed his mind and decided that the heraldic arms was too foreign, and ordered his brother the Prince Narisara Nuvadtivongs to design a new seal featuring the Garuda. The Garuda as a symbol has been depicted in royal seals since the times of Ayutthaya. The Prince drew a new seal, which was based on the <b>old</b> <b>design,</b> featuring the god Narayana mounted on the Garuda's back. This version of the seal was used only briefly, as the King was not satisfied with this rendition. Soon after he asked the Prince to redesign the seal depicting the Garuda alone.|$|E
25|$|Rex Sorgatz, {{designer}} of Mediaite and CMO of Vyou, issued a {{bet that the}} redesigns would fail to bring in traffic, and Nick Denton took him up on it. The measure {{was the number of}} page views by October recorded on Quantcast. Page views after the redesign declined significantly—Gawker's sites had an 80% decrease in overall traffic immediately after the change and a 50% decrease over two weeks—with many users either leaving the site or viewing international versions of the site, which hadn't switched to the new layout. On 28 February 2011, faced with declining traffic, Gawker sites allowed for visitors to choose between the new design and the <b>old</b> <b>design</b> for viewing the sites. Sorgatz was eventually determined to be the winner of the bet, as at the end of September, 2011, Gawker had only 500 million monthly views, not the 510 million it had had prior to the redesign. However, on 5 October 2011, site traffic returned to its pre-redesign numbers, and as of February 2012, site traffic had increased by 10 million over the previous year, according to Quantcast. As of March 23, 2012, commenting on any Gawker site required signing in with a Twitter, Facebook, or Google account.|$|E
500|$|The {{shape of}} the Panthers logo was {{designed}} to mimic the outline of both North Carolina and South Carolina. The Panthers changed their logo and logotype in 2012, the first such change in team history. According to the team, the changes were designed to give their logo an [...] "aggressive, contemporary look" [...] as well {{to give it a}} more three-dimensional feel. The primary tweaks were made in the eye and mouth, where the features, particularly the muscular brow and fangs, are more pronounced, creating a more menacing look. The revised logo has a darker shade of blue over the black logo, compared to the <b>old</b> <b>design,</b> which had teal on top of black.|$|E
50|$|Between the {{outboard}} end of {{the arms}} is a knuckle. The knuckle contains a kingpin for horizontal radial movement in <b>older</b> <b>designs,</b> and rubber or trunion bushings for vertical hinged movement. In newer designs, a ball joint at each end allow for all movement. Attached to the knuckle at its center is a bearing hub, or in many <b>older</b> <b>designs,</b> a spindle to which the wheel bearings are mounted.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Type 07 uniform, {{especially}} that of the dress uniform, borrowed from <b>older</b> <b>designs.</b> The <b>older</b> <b>designs,</b> in turn, were influenced by those of the Soviet Union. However, the Type 07 design had striped cuff insignia which indicated years of service. The stripe cuff insignia were worn by all non commissioned officers except for the naval admirals and officers who used sleeve insignia in their dress blues.|$|R

500|$|In 1908, Selfe {{presented}} new proposals {{based upon}} the <b>old</b> <b>design</b> to the Royal Commission on Communication between Sydney and North Sydney. However, this time the commissioners preferred a tunnel scheme; again, no work proceeded. Agitation for a bridge was renewed {{with the election of}} a Labor government at the 1910 state election. But with Selfe's death in 1911, {{it was time for a}} new generation of bridge builders. In 1912 the government appointed J.J. Bradfield as [...] "engineer-in-chief of Sydney Harbour Bridge and City Transit"; the call for tenders for constructing the bridge was not made until a decade later. Over the following decades, versions of what Selfe had much earlier articulated for a city circle railway link and a bridge to the north shore were realised. Selfe's contribution received little public or formal recognition.|$|E
500|$|According to Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles, {{the treaty}} that ended World War I, the German Navy was {{permitted}} only six light cruisers. Article 190 limited new cruiser designs to [...] and prohibited new construction until the vessel {{to be replaced}} was at least twenty years <b>old.</b> <b>Design</b> work on the first new light cruiser, ordered as [...] "Ersatz [...] ", began in 1921. The ship was intended for long-range overseas service, so the designers placed emphasis on a large cruising radius and capacious crew accommodation spaces. The designers wanted to use a main battery of eight [...] guns in four dual mounts, but the Allied powers insisted on single gun turrets. This arrangement placed four guns amidships, which reduced the power of her broadside, as only six guns could fire on either side, as opposed to eight.|$|E
500|$|A {{new design}} for the website was {{launched}} on April 25, 2007, with the comment, [...] "Fark site redesign is now live. Hope nothing breaks, we're all out drinking." [...] The new design was initially received with some controversy by many users, mostly due to the change in layout and a seemingly indifferent attitude by site moderators to user impact or feedback. In response, Drew Curtis noted the following reasons for the redesign: [...] "Websites have to evolve over time. Otherwise {{you end up with}} a layout anachronism like the Drudge Report. The <b>old</b> <b>design</b> was put into place years ago, over time changes were nailed on to the design like loose shingles on a leaky roof. It was time to reformat and remove a bunch of the clutter while trying to keep the core design intact." [...] The site layout was refined over the next few weeks in accordance with many suggestions.|$|E

500|$|The new coins proved {{difficult}} to produce; {{due to the}} hardness of the planchet, the coins were not of high quality {{and the life of}} the striking dies was brief. The design of the coins was widely criticized, with Wharton describing the shield design as suggesting [...] "a tombstone surmounted by a cross and overhung by weeping willows." [...] The American Journal of Numismatics described it as [...] "the ugliest of all known coins". More seriously, the reverse design reminded many of the [...] "stars and bars" [...] motif of the defeated Confederate States. The rays were eliminated from the design in early 1867, in the hopes of eliminating some of the production problems. The transition to the new design was to occur on February 1, 1867, but it is likely the mint used up the remaining dies with the <b>old</b> <b>design</b> in the interest of economy. The design change created confusion among the population, with many people assuming one design or the other was a counterfeit, and the Mint considered abandoning the shield design entirely.|$|E
500|$|All {{circulating}} coins have {{a common}} side showing the denomination or value, and a map in the background. Due to the linguistic plurality in the [...] European Union, the Latin alphabet version of euro is used (as opposed to the less common Greek or Cyrillic) and Arabic numerals (other text is used on national sides in national languages, but other text on the common side is avoided). For the denominations except the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, the map only showed the 15 member states which were members when the euro was introduced. Beginning in 2007 or 2008 (depending on the country) the old map is being replaced by a map of Europe also showing countries outside the Union like Norway. The 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, however, keep their <b>old</b> <b>design,</b> showing a geographical map of Europe with the 15 member states of 2002 raised somewhat above {{the rest of the}} map. All common sides were designed by Luc Luycx. The coins also have a national side showing an image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin. Euro coins from any member state may be freely used in any nation that has adopted the euro.|$|E
500|$|Pennsylvania and Arizona {{were given}} {{extensive}} modernizations from 1929 through 1931; the expenditure {{came in the}} fiscal year 1930. As part of the rebuilding, Pennsylvania, which had been designed as a fleet flagship, had its conning tower expanded. Aside from that, Pennsylvania and Arizona received similar treatment: the elevation of the main batteries was increased to °, new fire control systems on tripod masts were added, the secondary armament and directors were replaced and overhauled, eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns (four per side) were mounted on the weather deck which was above the secondary anti-ship 5-inch gun battery, and their bridges were enlarged to hold elevated anti-aircraft directors. Armor additions were comparatively minimal beyond anti-torpedo bulges, which were standard additions on all major warships in this period: [...] of armor were added to the second armored deck, and a torpedo bulkhead was added to the engine room. The propulsion system of the two Pennsylvanias received perhaps the most attention. The boiler system was entirely replaced with six small-tube boilers and new turbines, the latter partially from the canceled [...] battleship [...] The new machinery allowed the ships to come close to their <b>old</b> <b>design</b> speed of , even with the added bulk of bulges: Pennsylvania made 20.89knots and Arizona 20.7knots on full-power trials.|$|E
