40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to collect data to model resident fish requirements for Lake Roosevelt {{as part of the}} Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Bureau of Reclamation (BoR), and U. S. Army Corps of Engineer`s (ACE) System <b>Operation</b> <b>Review.</b> The System <b>Operation</b> <b>Review</b> (SOR) is a tri-agency team functioning to review the use and partitioning of Columbia Basin waters. User groups of the Columbia have been defined as power, irrigation, flood control, anadromous fish, resident fish, wildlife, recreation, water quality, navigation, and cultural resources. Once completed the model will predict biological responses to different reservoir operation strategies. The model being developed for resident fish is based on Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks model for resident fish requirements within Hungry Horse and Libby Reservoirs. While the Montana model predicts fish growth based on the impacts of reservoir operation and flow conditions on primary and secondary production levels, the Lake Roosevelt model will also factor in the affects of water retention time on zooplankton production levels and fish entrainment. Major components of the Lake Roosevelt model include: (1) quantification of impacts to zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and fish caused by reservoir drawdowns and low water retention times; (2) quantification of number, distribution, and use of fish food organisms in the reservoir by season; (3) determination of seasonal growth of fish species as related to reservoir operations, prey abundance and utilization; and (4) quantification of entrainment levels of fish as related to reservoir operations and water retention times.

40|$|Micromachined {{gyroscopes}} {{are probably}} the most challenging type of transducers ever attempted to be designed in micro-world. A nail-size dynamic system integrated with control electronics on the same silicon chip (Fig. 1 (a)) is designed to be a very sensitive sensor which is potentially able to detect maneuvers and motions beyond human perception. Along with exciting opportunities which MEMS gyroscopes could bring to everyday life, the minia-turization introduces many new technical challenges. Multi-degree of freedom dynamics, sensitivity to fabrication imperfections, dynamic instability, limited control resources- all these raise a number of fundamentally challenging issues in the design, analysis, and control of micromachined gyroscopes. In this paper, we summarize principles of <b>operation,</b> <b>review</b> recent research and development eorts, and discuss potential applications and the future market of silicon based micromachined gyroscopes...|$|E

Location involved corporate governance section, <b>operation</b> <b>review</b> section, chairman’s report section and CSR section. Themes of disclosure were based on environment-related activities, employee-related activities, energy, product responsibility and community involvement. The form of the disclosures involved narrative, photographs and monetary data related {{to each of the}} themes. The CSR checklist was then developed and pre-tested to create an index of the dependent variable. The index was treated as a dichotomous variable, that is, if the company disclosed the specific CSR item it took the value ‘ 1 ’ if no disclosures, it took ‘ 0 ’. Items were included about each of the mentioned themes and scores were aggregated from these items related to CSR.|$|E

In addition smaller quantities of petroleum coke and a low value refinery stream were gasified. Phase II of the work to be done under this agreement, consists of gasification of the above-mentioned feeds at a gasifier pressure of approximately 3 bar.

40|$|A key {{challenge}} for the Malaysian after-school market-education sector organisations has been to communicate with parents to involve them beyond them being mere customers or bystanders in their children’s education. This dissertation is designed to move towards a new model for <b>operation.</b> <b>Review</b> of the literature led to the exploration of scenario stories {{as a tool for}} strategic conversation with parents to explore perception and guide choice in education. Scenario plots for the Malaysian education sector were written and used in a self-completion questionnaire survey. 61 individuals (parents, educators and other adults) participated and, from their responses, scenario end-states for the Malaysian national schools and the Malaysian after-school market-education sector were developed. The use of scenarios in this way was generally found to be helpful by the parents. Examining scenarios for both parent and organisation learning, a learning framework was devised with two levels of change: a shallow learning change to the behaviour, and a deeper learning change to the underlying values that drive the behaviour. Scenarios provide the perspective needed to determine the appropriate level of adaptation needed. I hope to utilise this framework with the stakeholders in my future work as I start my own private afterschool education organisation...|$|E

40|$|While {{environmental}} legislation in Australia regulates tourism development, {{it is less}} effective in operational areas because of the dependency of tourism on environmental resources that are not managed by operators, and the small but incremental nature of operational impacts. The absence of functional environmental standards for tourism means that little guidance exists: a problem compounded by variability in the diversity of operation types and receiving environments, {{as well as the}} accessibility of information by a non-technical audience. While legislation and economic considerations may provide impetus to adopt environmental practices, it is proposed that an environmental philosophy is necessary for tourism businesses to seek out and maintain alternative sustainable modes of <b>operation.</b> <b>Review</b> of the environmental audit process used by a Queensland resort suggests commitment to continual improvement in environmental performance is attributable to individual and corporate ethics. While the case is an ecotourism operation, the literature indicates that these factors have relevance to tourism generally. Although client satisfaction and return on investment objectives are constraints, environmental auditing can provide impetus for practical expression of environmental objectives. Facilitation of ethically-motivated voluntary action may be more effective in achieving tourism 2 ̆ 7 s environmental objectives than codifying standards in static legislation...|$|E
40|$|Amendment Request (LAR) 12 - 01 {{to revise}} the Seabrook Station Emergency Plan. The {{proposed}} changes {{are associated with the}} initiating conditions involving a loss of safety system annunciation or indication in the control room. The current classification scheme includes emergency action levels (EAL) that could place the plant in an emergency classification based solely on a loss of radiation monitoring indications. However, a loss of radiation monitoring indications by itself does not represent degradation in the level of plant safety. Therefore, the proposed changes revise the EALs to include radiation monitoring indications within the aggregate of safety system indications that are considered when evaluating a loss of safety system indications rather than separate EALs. The changes are consistent with NEI 99 - 01, "Methodology for Development of Emergency Actions Levels, " revision 5. As discussed in the evaluation, the proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 92, and there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the change. The Station <b>Operation</b> <b>Review</b> Committee has reviewed this LAR. NextEra has determined that with the proposed changes, the emergency plan will continue to meet the requirements in 10 CFR 50, Appendix E, and the planning standards of § 50. 47 (b).
