25|$|Poly{{ethylene}} consumes {{more than}} half of the world's ethylene supply. Polyethylene, also called polyethene, is the world's most widely used plastic. It is primarily used to make films in packaging, carrier bags and trash liners. Linear alpha-olefins, produced by <b>oligomerization</b> (formation of short polymers) are used as precursors, detergents, plasticisers, synthetic lubricants, additives, and also as co-monomers in the production of polyethylenes.|$|E
25|$|Both KCC2 isoforms {{can form}} homomultimers, or heteromultimers with other K-Cl symporters {{on the cell}} {{membrane}} to maintain chloride homeostasis in neurons. Dimers, trimers, and tetramers involving KCC2 {{have been identified in}} brainstem neurons. <b>Oligomerization</b> may {{play an important role in}} transporter function and activation, as it has been observed that the oligomer to monomer ratio increases in correlation to the development of the chloride ion gradient in neurons.|$|E
25|$|Some {{water-soluble}} {{proteins and}} peptides can also form transmembrane channels. They usually undergo <b>oligomerization,</b> significant conformational changes, and associate with membranes irreversibly. 3D structure {{of one such}} transmembrane channel, α-hemolysin, has been determined. In other cases, the experimental structure represents a water-soluble conformation that interacts with the lipid bilayer peripherally, {{although some of the}} channel-forming peptides are rather hydrophobic and therefore were studied by NMR spectroscopy in organic solvents or in the presence of micelles.|$|E
25|$|The {{signaling}} pathway responsible {{for carrying out}} necroptosis is generally understood. Production of TNFα during viral infection leads to stimulation of its receptor TNFR1. The TNFR-associated death protein TRADD signals to RIPK1 which recruits RIPK3 forming the necrosome. Phosphorylation of MLKL by the Ripoptosome drives <b>oligomerization</b> of MLKL, allowing MLKL to insert into and permeabilize plasma membranes and organelles. Integration of MLKL leads to the inflammatory phenotype and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which elicit immune responses.|$|E
25|$|Quaternary {{structure}} {{has not been}} broadly considered for MTs. Dimerization and <b>oligomerization</b> processes have been observed and attributed to several molecular mechanisms, including intermolecular disulfide formation, bridging through metals bound by either Cys or His residues on different MTs, or inorganic phosphate-mediated interactions. Dimeric and polymeric MTs {{have been shown to}} acquire novel properties upon metal detoxification, but the physiological significance of these processes has been demonstrated only in the case of prokaryotic Synechococcus SmtA. The MT dimer produced by this organism forms structures similar to zinc fingers and has Zn-regulatory activity.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol {{synthesis}} {{can also}} be turned off when cholesterol levels are high. HMG-CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's <b>oligomerization</b> state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the proteosome. This enzyme's activity {{can also be}} reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein kinase. Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low.|$|E
25|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multi-faceted, age-dependent, {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder, {{and is a}} {{major cause}} of dementia. According to the Amyloid hypothesis, the accumulation of extracellular amyloid betapeptides (Aβ) into plaques via <b>oligomerization</b> leads to hallmark symptomatic conditions of AD through synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Immunotherapy via exogenous monoclonal antibody (MAB) administration has been known to treat various central nervous disorders, such as AD, by inhibiting Aβ-oligomerization thereby preventing neurotoxicity. However, MABs are large for passive protein channels and are therefore inefficient due to the blood-brain barrier preventing MAB passage into the brain. However, the Peripheral Sink hypothesis proposes a mechanism where MABs may not need to cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, many research studies are being conducted from failed attempts to treat AD in the past.|$|E

2500|$|Major {{industrial}} {{reactions of}} ethylene include {{in order of}} scale: 1) polymerization, 2) oxidation, 3) halogenation and hydrohalogenation, 4) alkylation, 5) hydration, 6) <b>oligomerization,</b> and 7) hydroformylation. [...] In the United States and Europe, approximately 90% of ethylene is used to produce ethylene oxide, ethylene dichloride, ethylbenzene and polyethylene. Most of the reactions with ethylene are electrophilic addition.|$|E
2500|$|Nafion, as a superacid, has {{potential}} {{as a catalyst for}} organic synthesis. [...] Studies have demonstrated catalytic properties in alkylation, isomerization, <b>oligomerization,</b> acylation, ketalization, esterification, hydrolysis of sugars and ethers, and oxidation. [...] New applications are constantly being discovered. [...] These processes, however, have not yet found strong commercial use. [...] Several examples are shown below: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary or}} {{secondary}} alcohols obtained {{as described above}} may undergo conversion to drop-in biofuels, fuels which are compatible with current fossil fuel infrastructure such as biogasoline, green diesel and bio-jet fuel. [...] Such is done by subjecting the alcohols to dehydration followed by <b>oligomerization</b> using zeolite catalysts {{in a manner similar}} to the methanex process, which used to produce gasoline from methanol in New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|Apomorphine is {{reported}} to be an inhibitor of amyloid beta protein (Aβ) fiber formation and a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease (AD) under the amyloid hypothesis. [...] Apomorphine and its small molecule relatives are found to promote <b>oligomerization</b> of the Aβ40 group of molecules, but inhibit the more advanced fibril formation from occurring. [...] The mechanism of protection offered by the small molecules is thought to be due to the autoxidation that occurs at the hydroxyl groups. [...] Once this functional group was altered, the inhibitory effect could be seen to decrease, reducing either the indirect or direct interference of the fibril formation.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescence cross {{correlation}} spectroscopy overcomes the weak dependence of diffusion rate on molecular mass {{by looking at}} multicolor coincidence. [...] What about homo-interactions? [...] The solution lies in brightness analysis. [...] These methods use the heterogeneity in the intensity distribution of fluorescence to measure the molecular brightness of different species in a sample. [...] Since dimers will contain {{twice the number of}} fluorescent labels as monomers, their molecular brightness will be approximately double that of monomers. [...] As a result, the relative brightness is sensitive a measure of <b>oligomerization.</b> [...] The average molecular brightness (...) is related to the variance (...) and the average intensity (...) as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|During the <b>oligomerization</b> of PA63, {{molecules}} of EF and/or LF rapidly and simultaneously bind to the PA prechannel. This binding occurs because after removing the PA20 domain, a large hydrophobic surface is uncovered on domain 1 of PA63. Domain 1 provides a large surface that the {{interacts with the}} N-terminus of EF and LF, which is almost completely homologous for the first ~36 residues and similar in tertiary structure for the first ~250 residues. Studies on the binding region of LF and EF demonstrated that a large surface area contacts with domain 1 of two adjacent PA63 molecules when in the heptamer conformation. This large binding area explains why previous studies could only bind up to three molecules on a PA63 heptamer. The co-crystal structure of the PA octamer in complex with N-terminal LF revealed that the binding interaction is, in fact, two discontinuous sites. One site, termed the C-terminal subsite, resembles a classic [...] "hot-spot" [...] with predicted salt-bridges and electrostatic interactions. The other site, termed the alpha-clamp subsite, is a deep cleft that nonspecifically binds the N-terminal alpha helix and short beta strand of LF, guiding the N-terminus of the substrate towards the PA prechannel lumen. In this manner, the alpha clamp aids in protein translocation, nonspecifically binding and subsequently unfolding secondary structure as it unfurls from the substrate. The LF/EF binding site is now being utilized for delivery of therapeutics via fusion proteins.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{observed}} that the <b>oligomerization</b> of synthetic Aβ was completely inhibited by the competitive IDE substrate, insulin. These findings suggest that IDE activity is capable of joining of several Aβ fragments together. Qui et al. hypothesized that the Aβ fragments generated by IDE can either enhance <b>oligomerization</b> of the Aβ peptide or can oligomerize themselves. It is also entirely possible that IDE could mediate the degradation and <b>oligomerization</b> of Aβ by independent actions {{that have yet to}} be investigated.|$|E
