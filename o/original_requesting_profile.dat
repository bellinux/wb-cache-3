40|$|Replica {{placement}} (RP) intended at {{producing a}} set of duplicated data items across the nodes of a distributed system in order to optimize fault tolerance, availability, system performance load balancing. Typically, RP formulations employ dynamic methods to change the replica placement in the system potentially upon user <b>request</b> <b>profile.</b> Continuous Replica Placement Problem (CRPP) {{is an extension of}} replica placement problem that takes into consideration the current replication state of the distributed system along with user <b>request</b> <b>profile</b> to define a new replication scheme, subject to optimization criteria and constraints. This paper proposes an alternative technique, named Availability Aware Continuous Replica Placement Problem (AACRPP). AACRPP can be defined as: Given an already defined replica placement scheme, a user <b>request</b> <b>profile,</b> and a node failure profile define a new replication scheme, subject to optimization criteria and constraints. In this effort we use modified greedy heuristics from the CRPP and investigated the proposed mechanism using a trace driven java based simulation...|$|R

40|$|OWL-S Service Profile {{provides}} a way to describe services offered by providers and services needed by requesters. But some items in the Profile are not very suitable for describing a requester’s demands while some important information about the requester himself such as his identity which may play important role in precondition match are not considered in the Service Profile. In this paper we define an OWL compatible <b>Request</b> <b>Profile</b> ontology especially for service requesters to describe their special properties and their expectation about a service. ThHQD match algorithm is proposed to match service request described in <b>Request</b> <b>Profile</b> with service advertise described in Service Profile. The experiment {{results show that the}} match algorithm is efficient...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} sign this new message, {{typically}} the attacker {{would need to}} know the key the message was signed with, and generate a new signature by generating a new MAC. However, with a length extension attack, it is possible to feed the hash (the signature given above) into the state of the hashing function, and continue where the <b>original</b> <b>request</b> had left off, so long as you know the length of the <b>original</b> <b>request.</b> In this <b>request,</b> the <b>original</b> key's length was 14 bytes, which could be determined by trying forged requests with various assumed lengths, and checking which length results in a request that the server accepts as valid.|$|R

3000|$|... [...]. We discretize the {{continuous}} bandwidth and simplify the bandwidth state to a 0 – 1 model. One request that consumes more bandwidth than {{others can be}} considered as multiple simultaneous requests, which consumes less bandwidth. In addition, a network with more bandwidth can be made up of multiple 0 – 1 bandwidth networks. We replace the <b>original</b> <b>request</b> with multiple coupled requests without having to discuss the bandwidth separately.|$|R
50|$|CCBC users may poll the SDT API {{to request}} updates {{on the status}} of their cases.

30|$|Another {{focal point}} of the survey {{concerns}} the course of recruitment processes. Firms in the survey are asked to describe their last new hire in detail. From this, we do not only gather information on the recruitment (ways of search and search duration), but also details on the newly filled position (job profile and working conditions) and on the new employee (age, gender, employment status). Furthermore, we have the opportunity to compare the <b>requested</b> <b>profile</b> of the new employee with his or her real profile.|$|R

Mikhail Yangel was appointed head designer, but his job was complicated by multiple changes {{in the role of the}} aircraft from escort fighter to interceptor, dive bomber, and eventually reconnaissance.|$|R
