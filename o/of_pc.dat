40|$|Heavy metals {{activate}} the synthesis <b>of</b> phytochelatins (<b>PCs),</b> while the induced PCs might affect metal uptake via chelating intracellular free metals. However, the relationship <b>of</b> <b>PCs</b> to metal uptake is poorly understood. In this study, {{we examined the}} kinetics of cadmium (Cd) accumulation and the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>PCs</b> in a marine diatom, Thalassiosira weissflogii, under different irradiance levels. Irradiance alone could not change the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>PCs</b> in the Cd-free treatments, while higher irradiance accelerated the induction <b>of</b> intracellular <b>PCs</b> at the same [Cd 2 +] level. PC-SH (2 x PC 2 + 3 x PC 3 + 4 x PC 4) was bound with Cd at a stoichiometric ratio of 2 to 49 in our short-term uptake experiments, indicating that PC induction is sufficient {{to serve as the}} first line of defense against Cd stress. A positive linear correlation between the induction rate <b>of</b> <b>PCs</b> and the Cd uptake rate was observed, while the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>PC</b> content to intracellular Cd varied greatly when the irradiance was increased several fold. Because metal uptake has been successfully used in predicting acute metal toxicity, our findings are helpful for understanding the role <b>of</b> <b>PCs</b> in metal detoxification and developing PCs as biomarkers for metal sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|Phytochelatins (PCs) may {{function}} as a potential biomarker for metal toxicity. However, less {{attention has been paid}} to the effects of metal interactions on the production <b>of</b> <b>PCs</b> and glutathione (GSH), the most prominent cellular thiol. In the present study, the effects of interactions between cadmium (Cd) and plumbum (Pb) on the production <b>of</b> <b>PCs</b> and GSH were monitored over a period of 14 d in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) tissues. The results showed that combination of C-d and Pb led to synergistic growth inhibition in wheat. Exposure to Cd or Pb increased levels <b>of</b> <b>PCs</b> in a concentration-, tissue-, and time-dependent manner. Cadmium was more effective that Pb in increasing PCs production. Compared with the effects of Cd or Pb alone on the production <b>of</b> <b>PCs,</b> the combination <b>of</b> Cd and Pb acted synergistically, resulting in an enhanced production <b>of</b> <b>PCs.</b> Cadmium also stimulated GSH production in a concentration-, tissue-, and time-dependent manner.
