5|$|The show's storylines {{concern the}} {{domestic}} and professional lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> {{and work in}} Erinsborough, a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The series primarily centres on the residents of Ramsay Street, a short cul-de-sac, and its neighbouring area, the Lassiters complex, which includes a bar, hotel, cafe, police station, lawyers' office and park. Neighbours began with three families created by Watson – the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. Watson said {{that he wanted to}} show three families who are friends living in a small street. The Robinsons and the Ramsays had a long history and were involved in an ongoing rivalry. Pin Oak Court, in Vermont South, is the real cul-de-sac that has doubled for Ramsay Street since 1985. All of the houses featured are real and the residents allow the production to shoot external scenes in their yards. The interior scenes are filmed at the Global Television studios in Forest Hill.|$|E

Although it is possible to track migrations of people across Europe using founder analysis of DNA, most information on these movements comes from archaeology.|$|E

Only about 2,600 people live in the region, found primarily in the communities of Clyde River, Qikiqtarjuaq (formerly known as Broughton Island), and Pond Inlet. The communities are rather small, with the populations being 820, 473 and 1,315 respectively in 2006. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> in the region survive by hunting, fishing, and trapping.|$|E
25|$|The Australian {{soap opera}} Neighbours was first {{broadcast}} on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. The show's storylines concern the domestic and professional lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> {{and work in}} the fictional suburb of Erinsborough, Melbourne. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's other soap opera, Sons and Daughters. Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and it struggled for four months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network, Ten. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986. Neighbours has since become the longest running series in Australian television and attained great success in the United Kingdom and launched the careers of several international stars, including Kylie Minogue and Guy Pearce.|$|E

As a rule it helps to find a rapport with, and the appreciation of, the audience. And for us it is some kind of musical gift, to honour the host country and its people.

The Panel concluded that the World Bank's bias in favor of industrial logging impoverished local people, and that the Bank should rethink its approach to forest management and develop a policy based on true participation of forest-based peoples, with the aim of securing their traditional rights and promoting alternatives to industrial logging. The Inspection Panel's investigation of the allegedly unsustainable forest policies of the World Bank garnered significant international attention, with the Norwegian Agency for Development Coordination subsequently stating that [...] "it can [...] truly be said that RFN and its partners [...] turned around the entire forest and indigenous policies of this huge African country".|$|E

6000|$|He had no {{very clear}} idea of what sort of people he might come upon in this country. It was, he knew, America.

The mortality in South Africa and the Philippines fades away to insignificance. Here, in the heart of peace, is where the blood is being shed; and here not even the civilised rules of warfare obtain, for the women and children and babes in the arms are killed just as ferociously as the men are killed. War! In England, every year, 500,000 men, women, and children, engaged in the various industries, are killed and disabled, or are injured to disablement by disease.|$|E

"They are {{delightful}} reading," [...] observed Middleton, [...] "these old county-histories, {{with their}} great folio volumes and their minute {{account of the}} affairs of families and the genealogies, and descents of estates, bestowing as much blessed space on a few hundred acres as other historians give to a principality. I fear that in my own country we shall never have anything of this kind. Our space is so vast that we shall never come to know and love it, inch by inch, as the English antiquarians do the tracts of country with which they deal; and besides, our land is always likely to lack the interest that belongs to English estates; for where land changes its ownership every few years, it does not become imbued with the personalities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> on it. It is but so much grass; so much dirt, where a succession of people have dwelt too little to make it really their own.
