40|$|This paper {{defends the}} thesis that counterfactuals are strict conditionals. Its purpose {{is to show that}} there is a {{coherent}} view according to which counterfactuals are strict conditionals whose antecedent is stated elliptically. Section 1 introduces the view. Section 2 <b>outlines</b> a <b>reply</b> to the main argument against {{the thesis that}} counterfactuals are strict conditionals. Section 3 compares the view with a proposal due to Åqvist, which may be regarded as its direct predecessor. Section 4 explains how the view differs from contextualist strict conditional accounts of counterfactuals. Finally, section 5 addresses the thorny issue of disjunctive antecedents...|$|R
40|$|International audienceConflicting {{claims have}} been made about whether introspection can be {{reliable}} at all. Lots of objections have been formulated against it in classical and modern literature. We thus list these objections and <b>outline</b> some <b>replies,</b> in addition to some theoretical rebuttals based on contemporary philosophy of science. We further point out that these objections target an abstract image of introspection rather than introspection per se. Accordingly, we describe one of the currently available methods that we ourselves practice: the elicitation (or micro-phenomenological) interview method. Our aim is to show that, irrespective of its alleged theoretical ", introspection is made real by this kind of method which incorporates replies to most standard objections...|$|R
50|$|The {{monitor in}} a November 1, 2016 report {{questioned}} whether the police department had read his previous reports, and suggested a formal system to assess, react to and implement his findings. According to the police oversight board, citizens made 125 formal complaints {{in the first half}} of 2016. The board also said October 20 that the police chief is not following the procedure agreed to in the consent decree for responding to the board's recommendations on officer discipline in use of force incidents. The police chief was previously not required to respond to the recommendations, but since the settlement agreement the police chief is supposed to <b>reply</b> <b>outlining</b> his rationale when he disagrees with the board's recommendations.|$|R
40|$|This paper reconsiders the {{relationships}} between feminist perspectives and the figurational/process sociological perspective of Norbert Elias for understanding gender, sport and sport-related activities. The main aim of the article is to respond to Colwell’s (1999) claim that {{there are differences between}} feminist and figurational approaches to understanding and explaining gender that potentially negate the possibility of being a feminist and figurational sociologist at the same time. The paper makes a contribution to the wider discussions about the adequacy of Elias’s work in understanding gender and sport, and the potential of blending feminist and figurational perspectives on sport and gender. The essay introduces the principles underlying feminist and figurational approaches to sociology. The key features of the on-going debate about the differences between feminist and figurational approaches are briefly <b>outlined.</b> I <b>reply</b> to Colwell’s (1999) criticisms of my work and revisit issues surrounding the role of values and evaluation in sociology. Involved-detachment is introduced as a feminist interpretation of Elias’s theory of ever changing balances of involvement-detachment. The final part of the paper presents some reflections about working with involved-detachment in specific research on women’s involvement in sport-related fitness activities...|$|R

5000|$|Forward {{sensing control}} uses {{collision}} avoidance sensors to avoid collisions with other AGV in the area. These sensors include: sonic, which work like radar; optical, which uses an infrared sensor; and bumper, physical contact sensor. Most AGVs {{are equipped with}} a bumper sensor of some sort as a fail safe. Sonic sensors send a “chirp” or high frequency signal out and then wait for a <b>reply</b> from the <b>outline</b> of the <b>reply</b> the AGV can determine if an object is ahead of it and take the necessary actions to avoid collision. [...] The optical uses an infrared transmitter/receiver and sends an infrared signal which then gets reflected back; working on a similar concept as the sonic sensor. The problems with these are they can only protect the AGV from so many sides. They are relatively hard to install and work with as well.|$|R
5000|$|The Peaceful Assembly Act (PAA) replaces Section 27 of the Police Act, which {{required}} police permits for large gatherings. Under the new act, such permits are not necessary. Instead, organizers must give the police 10 days notice of any planned gathering, {{after which the}} police will <b>reply,</b> <b>outlining</b> any restrictions they wish to place on the gathering. The new act forbids street protest, prohibits persons under 15 from taking part in gatherings, prohibits persons under 21 from organising them, and bars them from taking place near schools, mosques, airports, railway stations, and other designated places. Though touted as a reform of Section 27 of the Police Act, the PAA has been severely criticised by the government opponents and by others as more restrictive than the legislation it replaced, with one opposition leader saying that the PAA gives “absolute powers to the police.” ...|$|R
5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a <b>reply</b> <b>outlining</b> the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|R
40|$|We {{reply to}} the Comment by T. Klein, P. Rodière and C. Marcenat (arXiv: 1205. 2566), on our paper, "Precision global {{measurements}} of London penetration depth in FeTe_ 0. 58 Se_ 0. 42 ", Phys. Rev. B 84, 174502 (2011). Our work was motivated by Klein et. al, "Thermodynamic phase diagram of Fe(Se_ 0. 5 Te_ 0. 5) single crystals in fields up to 28 Tesla", Phys. Rev. B 82, 184506 (2010). In their paper, Klein et al. have attributed a factor of five difference {{in the value of}} the London penetration depth obtained from their tunnel diode resonator (TDR) measurements and calculated from the "field of first penetration" to the surface roughness, although they have not verified it experimentally. In our paper, we have studied the effects of deliberately introduced surface roughness and found that its effects are minor and cannot be responsible for the difference of such magnitude. Instead, we suggest that the value of the "field of first penetration" measured with Hall - arrays cannot be used to extract a true lower critical field due to several reasons <b>outlined</b> in our <b>Reply.</b> We emphasize that the accuracy of the calibration procedure of the TDR technique has been carefully verified in several prior studies and our work on FeTe_ 0. 58 Se_ 0. 42 further confirms it. We show that in their Comment, Klein et. al use wrong arguments of the universal behavior of the superfluid density in the gapless limit, because it is inapplicable for the multi - band superconductors. We also discuss the applicability of the clean - limit γ- model and the influence of the disorder on the obtained results...|$|R
