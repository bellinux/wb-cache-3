40|$|PROBLEM: Conventional {{decoding}} techniques tend {{to operate}} {{exclusively in the}} space domain and often rely on code-specific “finder features,” ECC, high-resolution imaging, image resampling (a “lossy” process), encoded data “clues” and low code density relative to image resolution (see EASY examples below). This limits {{the amount of information}} that can be reliably encoded into a given area. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: Recover randomly-oriented 2 D bit fields without resampling, without reliance <b>on</b> <b>finder</b> features, and without dependency on encoding or data content. Decode at image densities that produce aliasing of primary grid frequencies – alias disambiguation (see HARD example below). Provide linear code density improvement of 1. 5 : 1 to 2 : 1 over conventional techniques, resulting in an increase in data density per unit area of 2. 25 : 1 to 4 : 1...|$|E
40|$|The 2 -D {{bar code}} {{possesses}} large capacity of data, strong ability for error correction, and high safety, which boosts the 2 -D bar code recognition technology being widely used and developed fast. This paper presents a novel algorithm for locating data matrix code based <b>on</b> <b>finder</b> pattern detection and bar code border fitting. The proposed method mainly involves three stages. It first extracts candidate regions that may contain a data matrix code by morphological processing and then locates the data matrix code roughly by detecting “L” finder pattern and the dashed border on the candidate regions. Finally, the lines fitted with the border points {{are used as}} the borders of data matrix code. A number of data matrix code images with complexity background are selected for evaluations. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm exhibits better performance under complex background and other undesirable conditions...|$|E
