25|$|The {{direct method}} {{operates}} {{on the idea}} that second language learning must be an imitation of first language learning, as this is the natural way humans learn any language: a child never relies on another language to learn its first language, and thus the mother tongue is not necessary to learn a foreign language. This method places great stress on correct pronunciation and the target language from outset. It advocates teaching of <b>oral</b> <b>skills</b> at the expense of every traditional aim of language teaching. Such methods rely on directly representing an experience into a linguistic construct rather than relying on abstractions like mimicry, translation and memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary.|$|E

A PhD in Biomedicine is however required for most higher research and teaching positions, which most colleges and universities offer. These graduate degree programs may include classroom and fieldwork, research at a laboratory, and a dissertation. Although a degree in a medicine or biology (biochemistry, microbiology, zoology, biophysics) is common, recent research projects also need graduates in statistics, bioinformatics, physics and chemistry. Abilities preferred for entry in this field include: technical, scientific, numerical, written, and <b>oral</b> <b>skills.</b>|$|E

In {{a majority of}} higher education curricula, courses are incorporated that centre on these particular skills. The present chapter starts with a conceptual discussion about <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skills,</b> and an in-depth discussion about the reliable assessment and evaluation of <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skills.</b> But how can we design and develop {{an effective way to}} develop these <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skills?</b> It is difficult to find an answer to this question, {{due to a lack of}} a clear theoretical framework to guide instructional interventions. We introduce such a theoretical framework to understand how <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skills</b> evolve and can be influenced from an instructional point of view. As much as possible, we build on the scarily available research results about the instruction of <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skills.</b> We adopt a social cognitive theoretical perspective towards self-regulated learning to develop a theoretical base for <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skills</b> instruction. In a systematic way, we link the theoretical base to the teaching and learning of <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skills.</b> Four sub-processes of the observational learning cycle, derived from the social cognitive view, are put forward.

Making use of focus group discussions and a structured oral interview with an American native speaker. Once the transcriptions of the interview were ready, the researcher forwarded it to three expert raters. Findings show {{that the level of}} communicative competence in <b>oral</b> and writing <b>skills</b> of the students is both acceptable; however, they differ in their numerical values. In terms of grammatical competence in <b>oral</b> <b>skill,</b> the average rate is 3. 10 while the respondents obtained an average rate of 2. 91 in their writing skill. In terms of discourse competence in <b>oral</b> <b>skill,</b> the average rate is 3. 10, while the respondents obtained an average rate of 2. 68 in their writing skill. In sociolinguistic competence in their <b>oral</b> <b>skill,</b> the respondents obtained an average rate of 3. 29 and 3. 01 in their speaking skill. For the strategic competence, the respondents got an average rate of 3. 12 in their <b>oral</b> <b>skill</b> and an average rate of 2. 73 in their writing skill. Based on the findings of the study, it can be disclosed that the communicative competence of the students both in speaking and writing skills is acceptable, having an average rate of 3. 15 and 2. 84 respectively. Their communicative and sociolinguistic competence could still be improved. Based on the foregoing conclusion, it is recommended that the module created by the researcher be used in their English classes since the topics included in the module were relevant to the actual findings.

Preparing HEI students with oral communication competency particularly <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skill</b> is crucial because research studies found that delivering oral presentations {{is one of the}} most frequent communicative events held at the workplace (DeKays, 2012; Yusof, 2012; Kassim and Ali, 2010). However, Kunioshi et. al (2014) argue that the teaching of <b>oral</b> communication <b>skills</b> are more complex and challenging. In such situation, language instructors would have employed various ways in teaching the skills to the students. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the language instructors' teaching emphasis and preferences in the teaching of <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skills</b> in classrooms. A quantitative research methodology will be applied in this study in which a set of questionnaire were distributed to 50 Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) English language instructors who are currently teaching English courses in UMP.

In this study, the video-based blogs were used repeatedly throughout the three stages of the video-based blog activities to produce an oral presentation of the same topic. The repetition is necessary in order to give ESL students ample oral practice for continuous improvement. With the repeated oral practice, students can improve their <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skills.</b> However, the use of video-based blogs should fulfil three criteria namely (a) proper planning and time management, (b) assessment of oral presentation has to be evaluated using a scoring rubric and (c) feedback has to be useful and timely. Nonetheless, challenges that compromise the effectiveness of video-based blogs such as access to the Internet connection, affective interferences, availability of recording venue, recording tools and computer software, students’ technical capability as well as weak link to real-time communication should be addressed by the language instructors before the execution of video-based blogs activities. The findings of the study also revealed that the students reacted positively to the use of video-based blogs in enhancing <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skills</b> and video-based blogs have positive influence on the students’ <b>oral</b> presentation <b>skills,</b> especially in the areas of verbal skills, non-verbal skills and content...|$|R
