OH and HO(x) (=OH + HO(2)) decay curves were recorded using laser-induced fluorescence after gas-expansion. The prompt HO(2) yields (HO(2) formed without preceding NO reactions) were determined by comparison to results obtained with CO as a reference compound. This approach was recently introduced and applied to the OH + benzene reaction and was extended here for a number of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The measured HO(2) formation yields are as follows: toluene, 0. 42 ± 0. 11; ethylbenzene, 0. 53 ± 0. 10; o-xylene, 0. 41 ± 0. 08; m-xylene, 0. 27 ± 0. 06; p-xylene, 0. 40 ± 0. 09; 1, 2, 3 -trimethylbenzene, 0. 31 ± 0. 06; 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene, 0. 37 ± 0. 09; 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene, 0. 29 ± 0. 08; hexamethylbenzene, 0. 32 ± 0. 08; phenol, 0. 89 ± 0. 29; o-cresol, 0. 87 ± 0. 29; 2, 5 -dimethylphenol, 0. 72 ± 0. 12; 2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenol, 0. 45 ± 0. 13. For the alkylbenzenes HO(2) is the proposed coproduct of phenols, epoxides, and possibly <b>oxepins</b> formed in secondary reactions with O(2). In most product studies the only quantified coproducts were phenols whereas only a few studies reported yields of epoxides. <b>Oxepins</b> have not been observed so far. Together with the yields of phenols from other studies, the HO(2) yields determined in this work set an upper limit to the combined yields of epoxides and <b>oxepins</b> that was found to be significant (≤ 0. 3) for all investigated alkylbenzenes except m-xylene. For the hydroxybenzenes the currently proposed HO(2) coproducts are dihydroxybenzenes. For phenol and o-cresol the determined HO(2) yields are matching the previously reported dihydroxybenzene yields, indicating that these are the only HO(2) forming reaction channels.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a formal method of species lumping {{that can be}} applied automatically to intermediate compounds within detailed and complex tropospheric chemical reaction schemes. The method is based on grouping species with reference to their chemical lifetimes and reactivity structures. A method for determining the forward and reverse transformations between individual and lumped compounds is developed. Preliminary application to the Leeds Master Chemical Mechanism (MCMv 2. 0) has led to the removal of 734 species and 1777 reactions from the scheme, with minimal degradation of accuracy across a wide range of test trajectories relevant to polluted tropospheric conditions. The lumped groups are seen to relate to groups of peroxy acyl nitrates, nitrates, carbonates, <b>oxepins,</b> substituted phenols, oxeacids and peracids with similar lifetimes and reaction rates with OH. In combination with other reduction techniques, such as sensitivity analysis and the application of the quasi-steady state approximation (QSSA), a reduced mechanism has been developed that contains 35 % of the number of species and 40 % of the number of reactions compared to the full mechanism. This has led to a speed up of a factor of 8 in terms of computer calculation time within box model simulations...|$|R

40|$|Aromatic {{compounds}} {{constitute the}} second most abundant class of organic substrates and environmental pollutants, {{a substantial part of}} which (e. g., phenylalanine or styrene) is metabolized by bacteria via phenylacetate. Surprisingly, the bacterial catabolism of phenylalanine and phenylacetate remained an unsolved problem. Although a phenylacetate metabolic gene cluster had been identified, the underlying biochemistry remained largely unknown. Here we elucidate the catabolic pathway functioning in 16 % of all bacteria whose genome has been sequenced, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. This strategy is exceptional in several aspects. Intermediates are processed as CoA thioesters, and the aromatic ring of phenylacetyl-CoA becomes activated to a ring 1, 2 -epoxide by a distinct multicomponent oxygenase. The reactive nonaromatic epoxide is isomerized to a seven-member O-heterocyclic enol ether, an <b>oxepin.</b> This isomerization is followed by hydrolytic ring cleavage and β-oxidation steps, leading to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA.

The collision-induced dissociation mass spectra of these compounds reveal product ions consistent with a major loss of carbon dioxide requiring unimolecular rearrangement of the perbenzoate anion prior to fragmentation. Isotopic labeling of the perbenzoate anion supports rearrangement via an initial nucleophilic aromatic substitution at the ortho carbon of the benzene ring, while data from substituted perbenzoates indicate that nucleophilic attack at the ipso carbon can be induced in the presence of electron-withdrawing moieties at the ortho and para positions. Electronic structure calculations carried out at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level of theory reveal two competing reaction pathways for decarboxylation of perbenzoate anions via initial nucleophilic substitution at the ortho and ipso positions, respectively.

40|$|In the aerobic {{metabolism}} of aromatic substrates, oxygenases use {{molecular oxygen}} to hydroxylate and finally cleave the aromatic ring. In {{the case of}} the common intermediate benzoate, the ring cleavage substrates are either catechol (in bacteria) or 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoate (protocatechuate, mainly in fungi). We have shown before that many bacteria, e. g. Azoarcus evansii, the organism studied here, use a completely different mechanism. This elaborate pathway requires formation of benzoyl-CoA, followed by an oxygenase reaction and a nonoxygenolytic ring cleavage. Benzoyl-CoA transformation is catalyzed by the iron-containing benzoyl-CoA oxygenase (BoxB) in conjunction with an FAD and iron-sulfur centers containing reductase (BoxA), which donates electrons from NADPH. Here we show that benzoyl-CoA oxygenase actually does not form the 2, 3 -dihydrodiol of benzoyl-CoA, as formerly postulated, but the 2, 3 -epoxide. An enoyl-CoA hydratase (BoxC) uses two molecules of water to first hydrolytically open the ring of 2, 3 -epoxybenzoyl-CoA, which may proceed via its tautomeric seven-membered <b>oxepin</b> ring form. Then ring C 2 is hydrolyzed off as formic acid, yielding 3, 4 -dehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde. The semialdehyde is oxidized by a NADP+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (BoxD) to 3, 4 -dehydroadipyl-CoA. Final products of the pathway are formic acid, acetyl-CoA, and succinyl-CoA. This overlooked pathway occurs in 4 – 5 % of all bacteria whose genomes have been sequenced and represents an elegant strategy to cope with the high resonance energy of aromatic substrates by forming a nonaromatic epoxide...|$|E

The ultra-violet absorption spectra of these compounds were studied in order to investigate the relation between conjugation and configuration in the diphenyls and the results lend further support to the conclusions drawn by other workers in this field.

Benzene is readily absorbed following inhalation (70 – 80 % in humans) or oral exposure (> 90 % in rabbits and rodents). Although benzene is readily absorbed through the skin, a significant amount of a dermal application evaporates from the skin when not occluded or immersed (absorbed dose ~ 0. 05 %). Absorbed benzene is rapidly distributed throughout the body and tends to accumulate in fatty tissues (ATSDR, 2007 a). The liver serves an important function in benzene metabolism, which results in the production of several reactive metabolites (ATSDR, 2007 a).

After the finding that our first highly potent active site-directed steroid sulphatase inhibitor, oestrone- 3 -O-sulphamate (EMATE), was highly oestrogenic, we proposed non-steroidal coumarin sulphamates such as 4 -methylcoumarin- 7 -O-sulphamate (COUMATE) as alternative non-steroidal steroid sulphatase inhibitors. In this work, we describe how tricyclic coumarin-based sulphamates have been developed which are even more potent than COUMATE, are non-oestrogenic and orally active. We also discuss potential mechanisms of action. Results: 4 -Ethyl- (4), 4 -(n-propyl) - (6), 3 -ethyl- 4 -methyl- (8), 4 -methyl- 3 -(n-propyl) coumarin- 7 -O-sulphamate (11); the tricyclic derivatives 665 COUMATE (13), 666 COUMATE (15), 667 COUMATE (17), 668 COUMATE (20) and the tricyclic <b>oxepin</b> sulphamate (22) were synthesised. In a placental microsome preparation, all of these analogues were found to be more active than COUMATE in the inhibition of oestrone sulphatase, with the most potent inhibitor being 667 COUMATE which has an IC 50 of 8 nM, some 3 -fold lower than that for EMATE (25 nM). In addition, 667 COUMATE was also found to inhibit DHEA-sulphatase some 25 -fold more potently than EMATE in a placental microsome preparation. Like EMATE, 667 COUMATE acts in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that it is an active site-directed inhibitor. However, in contrast to EMATE, 667 COUMATE has the important advantage of not being oestrogenic. In addition, we propose several diverse mechanisms of action for this active site-directed steroid sulphatase inhibitor in the light of recent publications on the crystal structures of human arylsulphatases A and B and the catalytic site topology for the hydrolysis of a sulphate ester. Conclusions: A highly potent non-steroidal, non-oestrogenic and irreversible steroid sulphatase inhibitor has been developed. Several mechanisms of action for an active site-directed steroid sulphatase inhibitor are proposed. With 667 COUMATE now in pre-clinical development for clinical trial, this should allow the biological and/or clinical significance of steroid sulphatase inhibitors in the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer and other therapeutic indications to be fully evaluated...|$|E
