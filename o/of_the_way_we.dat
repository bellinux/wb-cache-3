500|$|After {{the second}} series of Joking Apart had been transmitted, Ptaszynski revived Moffat's {{original}} idea about a sitcom {{set in a}} school. In an article for The Guardian newspaper, writer and comedian Richard Herring observed that Moffat has not used the show [...] "as a soapbox from which to satirise the government’s educational policy, preferring to concentrate on being funny ... yet beneath it all {{is a much more}} broadly satirical swipe at the implicit pointlessness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> are educated." [...] For this article, Moffat told Herring: ...|$|E
500|$|To {{revive the}} fervor of punk, which the band felt was being {{distorted}} by new wave, the Idles sought {{to look as}} intimidating as possible. They shaved their heads, grew mohawks and wore various punk accessories. Nelson and MacKaye even drove thumbtacks into the soles of their boots so they would make an [...] "ominous clacking" [...] sound when they walked. The band's visual presentation was at odds with their demeanor; according to MacKaye, [...] "In our shows and within our own community, we were totally goofy guys. We were painfully honest — we didn't shoplift, we didn't vandalize, we didn't spray-paint. [...] We don't do anything — everybody just hates us because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> look".|$|E

500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and figured it out on the date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds me <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about. They'd work it out right there in the room".|$|E

In particular, {{the lyrics}} detail the {{personal}} life of Katie Morosky, the character she portrays in the film. Specifically, her troubling relationship with Robert Redford's Hubbell Gardiner is explained, [...] "Memories light {{the corners of}} my mind / Misty watercolor memories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> were" [...] and [...] "Memories may be beautiful and yet". Streisand sings, [...] "What's too painful to remember / We quickly choose to forget", where she longs for nostalgia, which Rolling Stones Stephen Holden described as an implication that [...] "resonate in the current social malaise". In {{the beginning of what}} seems to be a bridge, she whispers, [...] "If we had the chance to do it all again / Tell me would we? Could we?".|$|E
500|$|A {{large portion}} of the episode was based on the ancient {{astronaut}} theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans. Frank Spotnitz later remarked that he was astounded at how little negative fan mail the show received, {{despite the fact that the}} [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"" [...] story arc heavily hinted that aliens were the originators of the notion of God and religion. He credited the manner in which the show handled this delicate subject, saying, [...] "Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure we would get angry letters. But we rarely do. And the reason is because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side with respect."

In addition to Disco Pigs, he starred in many other plays, including Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, Neil LaBute's The Shape of Things, and Chekhov's The Seagull; Murphy considers this stage work to have been his [...] "training ground". Murphy also reprised his Disco Pigs role for the 2001 indie film version by Kirsten Sheridan, {{in which he was}} able to showcase his singing. During this period, he moved from Cork, relocating first to Dublin for a few years, then to London in 2001. In 1999 he had a role as a soldier in William Boyd's The Trench, a film about a group of young British soldiers {{on the eve of the}} Battle of the Somme.|$|E

We had to dig in. This was a top team we were playing, but I felt {{we were going to}} win. Only a 35-yard Gerrard smasher was going to change that. The players have been magnificent – we are proud <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat hard to take as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it how I feel at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game. The players put in a fantastic effort, but it just wasn't to be for us. It was a marvellous FA Cup final and we gave all we could. I hope everyone was proud – it just wasn't our day." ...|$|E

Spotnitz was surprised that the show received few complaints, even though the [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"Amor Fati" [...] story arc heavily suggested that aliens developed the notions of God and religion.

And the reason is because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side [...] with respect." [...] Spotnitz later identified the combination of science and religion as [...] "a conjunction of science and mysticism, of aliens and religion, that we're starting to develop. It's deliberate on our part, to help bring all the mythologies together into one story line." [...] The ancient astronaut themes were revisited in two season nine episodes: [...] "Provenance" [...] and [...] "Providence".|$|E

2500|$|Milošević was {{uninterested in}} {{maintaining}} Slovenia within the Yugoslav federation, as Slovenia had very few Serbs living within it and Milošević suggested a political deal with Slovenian president Kučan, Serbia would recognize {{the right of}} the self-determination of the Slovene nation to independence if Slovenia in turn recognized the right of self-determination of the Serb nation to remain united with Serbia. Such a deal would have set a precedent for Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia to remain in one state with Serbia. Milošević's ally in the Yugoslav federal government, Borisav Jović stated [...] "I put it bluntly. We didn't want a war with Slovenia. Serbia had no territorial claims there. It was an ethnically-pure republic – no Serbs. We couldn't care less if they left Yugoslavia... We would have been overstretched.
