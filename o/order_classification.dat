40|$|Since the 19 th century, when {{books for}} {{instruction}} in science became available in significant numbers, {{their place in}} the science curriculum has been contentious. The defenders of textbooks have tended to point out their informative or instructional role, generally failing to respond to criticisms {{of the quality of the}} text as a prose work. Recent concern with readability, and the place of reading in the science curriculum, has made more urgent the analysis of the textbook and its place in science education. This thesis examines physical science textbooks for answers to questions dealing with the language of science textbooks as it relates to the history and purpose of science education. It is based on the premise that such language can be characterised not only by structural factors (such as sentence length and vocabulary) but also by what the language attempts to achieve. The latter is dependent on the purposes for which the text is written, and these are shaped by contemporary beliefs about the nature of science and science education, the particular science written about, and the intended readers of the book. Science textbooks emerge as prose works with a history that has shaped their characteristics. The thesis explores the history of physical science texts since 1800, and uses that history to develop both a classification system for textbooks, and a framework against which to view the changing purposes of science textbook authors. It is based on a large collection of such textbooks published in Great Britain, Australia, and the United States. Textbook characteristics are explored using three levels of analysis. Level 1 is historical, placing the texts in a context of contemporary opinion on the purposes of science and science education. It uses that context to develop a first <b>order</b> <b>classification</b> of textbook types. Level 2 uses techniques from literary criticism (notably genre-theory and stylistics) and rhetoric (the nature of argument and exposition) to match the first <b>order</b> <b>classification</b> in Level I to established theoretical results. This results in a second <b>order</b> <b>classification</b> of greater depth and power. Level 3 examines the textbooks for prose structures which are designed to meet the purposes of providing explanations for phenomena and instructing. These two purposes allow a third <b>order</b> <b>classification</b> to be developed, which can then be used to make judgements about the language of the text and its suitability for meeting the varied purposes of science education. Such an analysis provides information about the development of the modern science text, uses past and present texts as mirrors of the long-standing debate about the place of the textbook in science education, and provides the classification and characterisation of textbooks needed for any further rhetorical consideration of the textbook as prose...|$|E

40|$|At {{the core}} of {{understanding}} dynamical systems {{is the ability to}} maintain and control the systems behavior that includes notions of robustness, heterogeneity, and/or regime-shift detection.

This said, there exists very limited relevant statistical theory that is able cope with real-life data, i. e., how does perform simple analysis and/or statistics over a family of networks as opposed to a specific network or network-to-network variation. Here, we are interested in the analysis of network families whereby each network represents a point on an underlying statistical manifold.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose an {{extension}} of the naïve Bayes classification method to the multi-relational setting. In this setting, training data are stored in several tables related by foreign key constraints and each example is represented by a set of related tuples rather than a single row as in the classical data mining setting. This work is characterized by three aspects. First, an integrated approach in the computation of the posterior probabilities for each class that make use of first <b>order</b> <b>classification</b> rules. Second, the applicability to both discrete and continuous attributes by means a supervised discretization. Third, the consideration of knowledge on the data model embedded in the database schema during the generation of classification rules. The proposed method has been implemented in the new system Mr-SBC, which is tightly integrated with a relational DBMS. Testing has been performed on two datasets and four benchmark tasks. Results on predictive accuracy and efficiency are in favour of Mr-SBC for the most complex tasks. ...|$|E

From a normative point of view, transaction costs importance and information asymmetries are the major determinants of the efficiency of each type of rule. However, because of the Internet technological and geographical characteristics, implementation of these rules raise specific problems. As cyberspace does not know about legal borders, some obstacles exist to the (centralized) regulation by courts charged to apply legal rules.

Considerable structural difference was observed between grazed sites and sites where grazing has been suspendedor greatlyreduced for nearly two decades. In the ungrazed sites, structures that had been installed to improve fish habitat had apparently raised watertables and thus were associated with changesin riparian vegetation.

Certainriparian communitytypes (e. g., those characterized by Carex spp.) were able to maintain bank structure under grazing use, but others (e. g., those characterized by Poa pratensis) appeared to behighly unstable when grazed. Higher <b>order</b> <b>classification</b> revealed groups of streamsidecommunity types that, {{in the absence of}} grazing, could be expected to confer similar streambank characteristics. An apparently distinct, successional sequence from sandbar-dominated communities through Juncus balticusdominated communities to Poa pratensis-dominated communities or sedge-dominated communities was eVident.

Hack and Goodlett (1960) used a spatial subdivision of headwater systems into four topographic units: (1) hillslopes; (2) zero-order catchments; (3) ephemeral channels emerging from zero-order catchments; and (4) first- and second channels {{depending on the}} linkage between hillslopes and channels, and the stream <b>order</b> <b>classification.</b> This spatial subdivision has historically been applied to the scale of a drainage basin, but also to first-order catchments with an area < 1000  m 2 (Uchida et al., 2005). A zero-order catchment defines the minimum drainage area from which the generated runoff has sufficient force to initiate channel development (Schaefer et al., 1979). It has no permanently conducting channels by definition and extends from the water divide {{to the point where}} first-order streams begin. The location where the first-order channel begins (the channel head) is the zero-order outlet. The difference between hillslopes and zero-order catchments is their relative position with respect to the first-order channel: the zero-order catchment is connected only to the headward end of the first-order channel, whereas the hillslope is connected anywhere along a first- or higher-order channel. Fan and Bras (1998) proposed the term headwater for zero-order catchments that drain directly toward a channel head, and sideslope for hillslopes that drain toward a channel segment.|$|E

First, a review and critique of prior classification systems of runaways is provided. The inadequacies of the prior systems are reviewed. A descriptive taxonomy of runaway youth is then developed using cluster-analytic methods. The attribute space for this analysis is developed from an integration of strain and control theories and includes major social and psychological forces that impinge upon the youth. These forces relate {{to the strength of}} bonding, particularly within the family, peer, and school contexts. The empirical types which emerged from this analysis illustrate various patterns of weakness in the bonds between the runaway youths and their families, schools, or peer relationships. The article ends by explaining some relationships between the present findings and selected prior typological systems of runaway youth. The taxonomic tasks of accurate description and classification represent a critical phase in any developing scientific area. Descrip-tion and classification can, to an extent, precede the development of explanatory theory.
