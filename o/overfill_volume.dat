40|$|The use of {{injector}} loops {{made of the}} inert polymer PEEKTM was {{studied for}} the analysis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) using microbore LC with peak compression. Surprisingly {{it was found that the}} use of PEEK not only failed to prevent adsorption of analyte in the loop but, in this instance, actually exacerbated the problem. The effect of loop <b>overfill</b> <b>volume,</b> competing NSAID in the sample solution and percentage organic component in the mobile phase on this phenomenon was investigated. Comparison was also made between PEEKTM and other materials used for injector loops...|$|E
40|$|Background: Accurate {{measurement}} of ultrafiltration (UF) {{is important to}} improve the morbidity and mortality of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The introduction of “flush-before-fill ” PD systems has led to improved perito-nitis rates. Partly to compensate for dialysate lost during flush-before-fill, extra dialysate was added to each PD bag. A 2 -L PD bag now contains a mean volume of 2. 225 L. That <b>overfill</b> <b>volume</b> might be erroneously measured as UF. We previously studied how this confounding factor might be affecting the diagnosis of UF failure and found that almost all units were overestimating daily UF by 900 mL. We now repeat the study {{to determine if the}} accuracy of UF estima-tion has improved. ¤ Methods: We conducted a telephone survey of PD units in the UK to determine how drain bags are weighed and ho...|$|E
40|$|From direct N-body {{simulations}} we {{find that}} the dynamical evolution of star clusters is strongly influenced by the Roche volume filling factor. We present a parameter study of the dissolution of open star clusters with different Roche volume filling factors and different particle numbers. We study both Roche <b>volume</b> underfilling and <b>overfilling</b> models and compare with the Roche volume filling case. We find that in the Roche <b>volume</b> <b>overfilling</b> limit of our simulations two-body relaxation is no longer the dominant dissolution mechanism but the changing cluster potential. We call this mechnism "mass-loss driven dissolution" in contrast to "two-body relaxation driven dissolution" which occurs in the Roche volume underfilling regime. We have measured scaling exponents of the dissolution time with the two-body relaxation time. In this experimental study we find a decreasing scaling exponent with increasing Roche volume filling factor. The evolution of the escaper number in the Roche <b>volume</b> <b>overfilling</b> limit can be described by a log-logistic differential equation. We report the finding of a resonance condition which may play a role for the evolution of star clusters and may be calibrated by the main periodic orbit in the large island of retrograde quasiperiodic orbits in the Poincaré surfaces of section. We also report on the existence of a stability curve which may be of relevance with respect to the structure of star clusters.

30|$|Interestingly, if Φ MB {{was changed}} from 0.21 to 0.3, a huge {{difference}} in the measured heating curve was observed. As the amount of grinding stock was kept constant at Φ GS =  0.15, we calculated Φ GS, rel (Eq.  3) defined as the grinding stock filling degree with regard to the void volume in the milling ball packing. The complete void volume is filled with the grinding stock if Φ GS, rel =  1. Results show that the change in the heat up curve occurs if Φ GS, rel is approximately at this value. The milling beakers warm up significantly slower for Φ GS, rel > 1 (see Online resource 1). The grinding stock <b>overfills</b> the void <b>volume,</b> the velocity of the milling balls is reduced and thus less heat is generated.|$|R
40|$|An {{elevator}} is {{a conveyor}} device or transport equipment that moves people or goods between floors or levels or decks of a building, vessel, or other structures. It {{has become a}} {{part and parcel of}} modern life in developed countries. The number of floors in high buildings, skyscrapers, and towers generate the usage of elevators. If it is simply assumed that each floor has at least two elevators in a thirty-floor building, people call the elevators in each floor even they are already occupied in weight and/or volume. When it is end of the daily work, thousand of homebound people wait at each floor and call the elevator {{to get out of the}} building and go their home. However, even the elevator is occupied in weight and volume, elevator stops at each floor in case of calling by the people. This causes people in elevator stop at each floor even their elevator is over-filled by the people. This is known as an annoying problem for the people who use elevators in their daily life. The idea is to control the elevators according to their both weight and volume not to stop them if they are already over-filled in weight and volume. Weight sensors already exist in most of the elevators. But there is no utilization concept of volume sensors in the elevators. Kids wagon can take huge space even their weight is less than the limiting weight of an elevator. Except human being, sometimes some accessories or boxes can be carried by the elevators. If there is no space in the elevator, it should not stop to accept new passengers but it could give a signal to the passengers beforehand that it is unable to elevate new stuffs. Actually, the weight and volume information of elevators can be monitored for the waiting passengers and they can be guided before they call the elevator. Additionally, elevator can be analyzed with a video camera (e. g., Microsoft Kinect) mounted to the ceiling of elevator with a depth sensor next to it. By dint of video camera and depth sensor integration, we have developed a system that automatically monitors elevator and warns the new passengers about the current status of elevation. The important functionalities of our system include: (a) The threshold for volume constraint is to be parameterized by the system; (b) The system automatically estimates the necessary and sufficient parameters and then makes a decision either the elevator is <b>overfilled</b> in <b>volume</b> or not based on the estimated parameters along with wight; and (c) It warns the passengers if the elevator is <b>overfilled</b> in <b>volume.</b> To work reliably and efficiently, the system examines the following attributes rightfully: (i) Volumetric capacity of the elevator; (i) Amount of occupied volume in the elevator; (iii) Amount of empty volume in the elevator; (iv) Height of the longest object in the elevator; and (v) Height of the shortest object in the elevator. By installing two cameras opposite to each other, we can monitor the above attributes and estimate the necessary and sufficient parameters by using video information. Based on the predefined volume and weight thresholds of a specific elevator, if either volume or weight will exceed their given thresholds and if the elevator will be called, then the elevator will not stop and give signal that it is unable to elevate new passengers...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} ratios r_h/r_J of {{projected}} half-mass and Jacobi radius {{as well as}} r_t/r_J of tidal and Jacobi radius for open and globular clusters in the Milky Way using data of both observations and simulations. We applied an improved calculation of r_J for eccentric orbits of globular clusters. A sample of 236 open clusters of Piskunov et al. within the nearest kiloparsec around the Sun has been used. For the Milky Way globular clusters, data are taken from the Harris catalogue. We particularly use the subsample of 38 Milky Way globular clusters for which orbits have been integrated by Dinescu et al. We aim to quantify the differences between open and globular clusters and to understand, why they form two intrinsically distinct populations. We find under certain assumptions, or, in other words, in certain approximations, (i) that globular clusters are presently Roche volume underfilling and (ii) with at least 3 σ confidence that the ratio r_h/r_J of half-mass and Jacobi radius is 3 - 5 times larger at present for an average open cluster in our sample than for an average globular cluster in our sample and (iii) that a significant fraction of globular clusters may be Roche <b>volume</b> <b>overfilling</b> at pericentre with r_t > r_J. Another aim {{of this paper is}} to throw light on the underlying theoretical reason for the existence of the van den Bergh correlation between half-mass and galactocentric radius.
