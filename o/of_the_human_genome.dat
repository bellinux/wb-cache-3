5|$|In 1972, Walter Fiers and {{his team}} at the University of Ghent {{were the first to}} {{determine}} the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein. The subsequent development of chain-termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing {{and turned it into a}} routine laboratory tool. An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> Project.|$|E
5|$|Virtually all {{microbes}} {{can trigger}} an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication {{of many different}} types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens. It has been estimated that humans generate about 10billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen. Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of genes available to make these proteins is limited by the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome.</b> Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from {{a relatively small number of}} antibody genes.|$|E
50|$|The saguaro genome {{is around}} 1.5 billion base pairs long (about <b>the</b> half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome's</b> length).

25|$|Noncoding DNA {{is defined}} as all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DNA {{sequences}} within a genome that are not found within protein-coding exons, and so are never represented within the amino acid sequence of expressed proteins.

5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an {{editorial}} writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, particularly since the sequencing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> in 2003, as he started to realise {{how it could be}} related to the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics. Before the Dawn was published in hardcover in 2006, and then in an updated paperback in 2007, by the Penguin Group.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2003, Craig Venter, {{leader of}} the privately funded {{parallel}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> Project, has led the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these samples are sequenced using shotgun sequencing, in hopes that new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The pilot project, conducted in the Sargasso Sea, found DNA from nearly 2000 different species, including 148 types of bacteria never before seen. Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States, and completed a two-year expedition to explore the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of plankton.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a bizarre rock inscribed with Navajo writing found in Côte d'Ivoire, {{and the death of}} the African scientist involved. While its appearance in Washington begins to affect Mulder’s mental health, leading him to turn to Agent Fowley for help; a disturbed Scully—determined to disprove the theory that life on Earth began with aliens—heads to New Mexico and finds a dying Albert Hosteen—who has discovered that the rock includes passages from the Bible, and a map <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome.</b> While Mulder breaks down in a mental institution, Scully journeys unexpectedly to Africa.|$|E

5|$|When {{applied to}} human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of {{participants}} having varying phenotypes {{for a particular}} trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without (controls), {{or they may be}} people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said {{to be associated with the}} disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> that may influence the risk of disease.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E

5|$|DNA damage, due to {{environmental}} factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell, occurs {{at a rate}} of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome's</b> approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase <b>the</b> likelihood <b>of</b> tumor formation and contribute to tumour heterogeneity.|$|R
25|$|Comparative {{genomics}} {{studies of}} mammalian genomes suggest that approximately 5% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> has been conserved by evolution since the divergence of extant lineages approximately 200 million years ago, containing {{the vast majority}} of genes. The published chimpanzee genome differs from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> by 1.23% in direct sequence comparisons. Around 20% of this figure is accounted for by variation within each species, leaving only ~1.06% consistent sequence divergence between humans and chimps at shared genes. This nucleotide by nucleotide difference is dwarfed, however, by the portion of each genome that is not shared, including around 6% of functional genes that are unique to either humans or chimps.|$|E
25|$|BLAT (BLAST-like {{alignment}} tool) is a pairwise sequence alignment algorithm {{that was}} developed by Jim Kent at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) in the early 2000s {{to assist in the}} assembly and annotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome.</b> It was designed primarily to decrease the time needed to align millions of mouse genomic reads and expressed sequence tags against the human genome sequence. The alignment tools of the time were not capable of performing these operations in a manner that would allow a regular update <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> assembly. Compared to pre-existing tools, BLAT was ~500 times faster with performing mRNA/DNA alignments and ~50 times faster with protein/protein alignments.|$|E
