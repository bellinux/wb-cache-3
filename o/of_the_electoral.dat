5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced that, {{as a result of}} the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms if it were to have electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E

5|$|Disraeli's {{political}} views embraced certain Radical policies, particularly democratic reform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> system, {{and also some}} Tory ones, including protectionism.

In 1835 Disraeli stood for the last time as a Radical, unsuccessfully contesting High Wycombe once again.|$|E

Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts.
