500|$|For working her thirteenth studio album, Madonna enlisted a large team of songwriters and producers. In March 2014, she {{uploaded}} a {{photo on}} her Instagram {{account of a}} sunset, along with the words [...] "Rebel Heart" [...] and the caption [...] "Day turns into night. I wont give up the fight. Don't {{want to get to}} the end <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>days...</b> saying I Wasn't amazed! #revolutionoflove", which prompted speculation that she was preparing to release a new album or single. In mid 2014, she uploaded a picture that revealed her playing the guitar alongside Swedish electronic musician Avicii.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later, Madonna posted {{an image of}} a sunset with the words [...] "Rebel Heart" [...] on them, and a caption which the media {{interpreted}} as lyrics from a new song. The lines posted were: [...] "Day turns into night. I won't give up the fight. Don't {{want to get to the}} end <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>days...</b> saying I wasn't amazed". Additional images showed Madonna with singer Natalia Kills in front of a microphone, and with Martin Kierszenbaum, the founder and chairman of Cherrytree Records, and senior executive of A for Interscope Records, Madonna's label. By mid-April 2014, she had also revealed on Instagram the names of songwriters Toby Gad and Mozella and record producer Symbolyc One with images of the group working in studio. The list of personnel grew to include producer Ariel Rechtshaid and sound engineer Nick Rowe. In an interview with Sirius XM Radio, Kierszenbaum described the recording process: ...|$|E

500|$|Mars co-wrote [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of The Smeezingtons. The three co-produced {{the song}} with Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, and Emile Haynie. It {{was written in}} the key of D minor, with Mars's vocals range from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Levine {{aforementioned}} that some parts in the song are not instruments as Mars said they needed [...] "a dep-dep-dep-dep sound". Later, Levine told Mars to [...] "sing it into the microphone", where he chopped it up, and despite sounding like an instrument, the sounds are really Mars' voice. The song's composition relies mainly on a [...] "guitar-worthy groove guitar, a soaring sing-along chorus and sexual innuendo galore". It finds Mars singing a confession of a relationship that is so good that he repeats to his love [...] "Your sex takes me to paradise", a verse inspired by Halle Berry [...] "You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long/ Can I just stay here, spend the rest <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>days</b> here?" [...] he sings. During his Google Hangout {{on the day of the}} song's release, Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track. Mars picked the phrase [...] "But swimming in your water is something spiritual," [...] and said that the single's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the [...] "sensual, sensual and sensual" [...] theme of the album.|$|E

He tried returning a year later, but by 1863 had left {{for the duration of the}} war. While he was in exile he wrote, [...] "Not that I am guilty of any act against the government of the U.S., but I am considered to entertain opinions which are pronounced by some people as disloyal. For that reason I remain out of the country, hoping that the American people may some day return to their reason, [...] I may return in safety to spend the remainder <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>days</b> in a country ruined by the madness and fanaticism of its own people."
