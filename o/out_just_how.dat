5|$|At {{the age of}} 15 he was an {{offered a}} trial at Leeds United, where his uncle Jim was left back, but turned it down and instead joined his father in the mines. He worked in the mines {{for a short time}} but handed in his notice after finding <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> {{difficult}} and unpleasant it was to work deep underground. He applied to join the police and reconsidered the offer from Leeds United. His trial game for Leeds clashed with his police interview, and Charlton chose to play in the game; the trial was a success and he joined the ground staff at Elland Road.|$|E
500|$|In May 1977 Genesis {{released}} Spot the Pigeon, {{an extended}} play of three tracks left off Wind & Wuthering. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK singles chart. It {{was the final}} Genesis release before Hackett left the group. He had been writing more material {{on his own and}} found it increasingly difficult to contribute more of his ideas within a group context. He wished to embark on a solo career and [...] "take the risk in order to find <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> good I was on my own". News of Hackett's departure coincided with the band's double live album Seconds Out, recorded in Paris on the A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering tours and released in October 1977. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 47 in the US.|$|E
2500|$|Hilton Als' {{review in}} The New Yorker called Xanadu [...] "probably {{the most fun}} you’ll have on Broadway this season, one reason being that {{everything}} about it is so resolutely anti-Broadway. In its wildness and ecstasy, Xanadu is a welcome relief from the synthetic creations that some Broadway producers have been peddling for years. Here you can’t count the disco balls fast enough—not to mention the roller skates, the frosted-pink lips, and the glittering spandex that the director, Christopher Ashley, hurls at you like a PCP flashback. Xanadu is far sleazier and cheesier than conventional musical theatre, and it points <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> tame most other musicals are." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "This is an {{important}} book, breaking new ground in the sweep of its analysis, its analytical insights, and the policy implications it draws <b>out.</b> It shows <b>just</b> <b>how</b> often foreign and domestic intelligence gathering in the major democracies has been insensitive to public accountability, legality, and its consequences for individuals, {{to the detriment of}} both liberty and security--and how this can and must change. Simon Chesterman writes, as always, with compelling clarity and authority." ...|$|R
50|$|Following the AFL's {{rejection}} of the Sharks into the national league, the Sharks would set <b>out</b> to prove <b>just</b> <b>how</b> good they really were. The team would win three premierships {{in a row in}} 1997, 1998 and 1999 to finish off the millennium with success. In 1999 the Sharks were able to poach future St Kilda Saints star Nick Riewoldt from their cross town rivals Broadbeach Cats, although Riewoldt would not compete for the Sharks senior side until 2000.|$|R
2500|$|In his {{ironically}} entitled essay My Life as an [...] "Anti-Semite", from The Politics of Anti-Semitism (2007), Cockburn wrote, [...] "Over {{the past}} 20 years I've learned there's {{a quick way}} of figuring <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> badly Israel is behaving. You see a brisk uptick {{in the number of}} articles here accusing the left of anti-Semitism." [...] He went on to add: [...] "Back in the 1970s when muteness on the topic of how Israel was treating Palestinians was near-total in the United States, I'd get the anti-Semite slur hurled at me once in a while for writing about such no-no stuff as Begin's fascist roots in Betar, or the torture of Palestinians by Israel's security forces. I minded then, as I mind now, but overuse has drained the term of much clout." ...|$|E
2500|$|Patrick {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with Sam, and they get engaged. However, when Jason, Sam's husband, is revealed to be alive, Patrick realizes that he and Sam will not make it, and ends their engagement. Emma is devastated over Sam leaving, and asks for her mother. Patrick calls Robin, now being held hostage by Jerry Jacks after Helena's death. Robin desperately wants to see Emma after hearing her upset, but she's forced to end the call. Emma still demands to see Robin, and Patrick decides takes Emma to Paris to see Robin. However, when he gets there, Robin {{is nowhere to be}} found. He calls Robert and Anna for help, and the three make their way to Cassadine Island, where they're able to rescue Robin. The two come back to Port Charles with Emma, and start to heal their relationship after Patrick finds <b>out</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> far Robin went to keep her family safe. Eventually, the two of them get job offers in Berkeley, California, and decide to move there. Emma insists that her parents re-marry before moving, and they agree. Patrick and Robin re-marry with their family present, then leave with Emma to begin their new lives. Robin and Emma make periodic trips back to Port Charles, mostly for special occasions and holidays. During Robin's latest trip back to town, she reveals to her mother that she and Patrick are expecting their second child. In July 2017, Patrick and Robin welcomed a son, Noah Robert Scorpio-Drake, named after his grandfathers Noah Drake and Robert Scorpio.|$|E

500|$|McFarland praised Kaitlin Olson's {{portrayal}} of Brenda, however, stating [...] "Olson got some laughs <b>out</b> of <b>just</b> <b>how</b> deep Brenda’s denial went, finding every possible excuse to blame herself and exonerate Jeff. It made her endearing and easily likeable, every bit the opposite from Olson's {{place in the}} rogue’s gallery of misanthropy on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia." [...] He ended his review by comparing it to the fellow FOX animation series The Simpsons, noting, [...] "The Simpsons managed {{to find the right}} blend with Sideshow Bob episodes, or in the aching sadness of Homer and Marge's marriage, but as has been said ad infinitum, Family Guy hasn't mastered that combination {{in the same way as}} the original." [...] He graded the episode as C+.|$|R
6000|$|Thanks to the {{particular}} niche in society into which {{he happened to be}} born, Corliss drifted about easily from group to group, and was much envied therefore by Del Bishop, who sat stiffly in the first chair he had dropped into, and who was waiting patiently for the first person to take leave that he might know how to compass the manoeuvre. In his mind's eye he had figured most of it <b>out,</b> knew <b>just</b> <b>how</b> many steps required to carry him to the door, was certain he would have to say good-by to Frona, but did not know {{whether or not he was}} supposed to shake hands all around. He had just dropped in to see Frona and say [...] "Howdee," [...] as he expressed it, and had unwittingly found himself in company.|$|R
5000|$|Johnston is {{well known}} for writing, {{composing}} and producing all his compositions alone, in addition to playing all instruments. He will occasionally recruit outside vocalists or additional musicians to contribute when the piece requires, and often prefers to bring in unsigned bands and new artists to provide vocals. In 2008, Johnston publicly expressed his frustration to Billboard at the inability of WWE to secure better promotional deals with artists {{due to a lack of}} understanding of the WWE product. He said, [...] "One of my frustrations is getting the word <b>out</b> about <b>just</b> <b>how</b> much music is used in our product. The labels will stumble over themselves to get on MTV, but no one's watching MTV". Conversely, WWE and Johnston have been responsible for helping to fuel a surge in sales for associated acts such as Fuel, Shinedown and Motörhead through their use in WWE productions.|$|R

5000|$|This {{same year}} he began experimenting with the Rawlins oil process, a {{relatively}} new printing method that allowed extensive reworking of the image. This change allowed him to further blend the aesthetics of a painter with those of a photographer. In his many writings Demachy took great care to point <b>out</b> that <b>just</b> knowing <b>how</b> to use the technique of image manipulation {{was not enough to}} automatically make a photograph a work of art. A true artistic photographer, he said, must know [...] "where to put the accents, where to reduce detail and where to subdue or emphasize form, rather than how to do it." ...|$|R

His head was drawn back on his shoulders at the time, {{and he was so}} excited that he forgot to straighten it <b>out.</b> <b>Just</b> imagine <b>how</b> surprised he was, and how surprised Mr. Fox was, when he sailed away in beautiful flight, his long legs trailing behind him. With his neck carried that way, he could fly as well as any one. From that day on, no one laughed at Mr. Heron because of his long legs and long neck. Mr. Heron himself became proud of them. You see, he had learned how to use what he had been given. Also he had learned the value of patience. So he was happy and envied no one. But he still liked best to keep by himself and became known as the lone fisherman, just as Longlegs is to-day. Chug-a-rum! Isn't that Longlegs coming this way this very minute? This is no place for me!" ...|$|R
50|$|In September 2000, however, {{protests against}} fuel prices {{intensified}} {{across the country}} and the new Leader of the Conservative Party William Hague exploited the situation by pointing <b>out</b> to voters <b>just</b> <b>how</b> much fuel prices had risen under Labour. This sparked a brief Conservative lead in the opinion polls - the first time in eight years - but once the protests and consequent fuel shortages ended, Labour led the opinion polls once more. Blair was so confident of re-election that he called a general election for 3rd May, but this was postponed until 7th June due to the foot and mouth crisis. This led to a brief crisis in the agricultural and tourism industries, but did little to shake a still-strong economy and the electorate responded by re-electing Blair with an only slightly-reduced majority.|$|R

50|$|Dr. Denise Monack {{and others}} set <b>out</b> to {{discover}} <b>just</b> <b>how</b> the bacterium that causes typhoid fever can remain dormant in humans after infection. To do this, she developed a mouse model. Unfortunately, S. typhi can only infect humans, but S. typhimurium, a closely related strand, can infect both mice and humans. It was discovered the infection can {{last in the}} system of mice for almost their entire lifetimes. The bacterium takes refuge in macrophages, which are inflammatory attack cells that digest invading pathogens. However, by examining the gut lymph nodes of the mice, 42 days after infecting them, it was determined the S. typhimurium actually changes the inflammatory response of the macrophages. Instead of eliciting an inflammatory response from the attack cells, the bacterium switches them into an anti-inflammatory mode, allowing it to survive within the macrophage.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} pointed <b>out</b> that <b>just</b> like <b>how</b> the nation-creator god Sukuna-hikona {{appeared}} near water, {{the main character}} of the old tale [...] "Chiisa-ko" [...] (small child) is in some way related {{to the world of}} water and is related to the existence of a faith in a water god. For an old couple not to have any children is an abnormality within the community and for such abnormal persons give birth in an abnormal way such as by praying to a god and giving birth from the shin to a person {{in the form of a}} pond snail, as one would find in the tale Tanishi Chōja, is the normal course for tales about heroes and children of god.|$|R
5000|$|Joey Lawrence plays hit man, Lyle Wilkes, in {{this dark}} romantic comedy about Charlotte (Shirly Brener), {{a woman who}} has always had anger-management issues. When her {{childhood}} therapist suggests young Charlotte (Laura Wiggins), write a journal to keep her emotions in check, it's not long before her journal evolves into a list of people she wishes were dead: bad bosses, worse boyfriends, nasty neighbors and a couple of hostile strangers. After a bad breakup with her boyfriend Chad (Bryce Johnson, and despite strong objections from her mother (Andrea Evans), and father (John Savage), she ventures into online dating. Just as she reaches her limit of unsuccessful dates, Charlotte meets her soul mate Lyle. For {{the first time in her}} life, everything is perfect...until Lyle discovers Charlotte's journal. Unknown to her, Lyle is a hit man who sets <b>out</b> to prove <b>just</b> <b>how</b> deeply he loves her by killing everyone on her list.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the royal entry ceremonies celebrated in Barcelona between 1460 and 1473, {{in the light}} of their meaning and importance in relation to the unsettled period marked by the Catalan Civil War (1462 - 1472). Starting from the premise that these sort of events are likely to reflect the sociopolitical reality in which they occur, it sets <b>out</b> to determine <b>just</b> <b>how</b> far the receptions offered to the monarchy by the city during these years can contribute towards explaining the origin, development and conclusion of the warlike conflict which set the institutions of the Principate against John II.

Partiendo de la premisa de que este tipo de eventos son susceptibles de reflejar la realidad sociopolítica en la que tienen lugar, se intenta aquí determinar en qué medida las recepciones ofrecidas por la ciudad a la monarquía durante estos años pueden contribuir a explicar la génesis, desarrollo y conclusión del conflicto bélico que enfrentó a las instituciones del Principado con Juan II...|$|R

40|$|At {{the present}} time, {{performance}} optimisation of real-life Haskell programs {{is a bit}} of a “black art”. Programmers that can do so reliably are highly esteemed, doubly so if they manage to do it without sacrificing the character of the language by falling back to an “imperative style”. The reason is that while programming at a high-level does not need to result in slow performance, it must rely on a delicate mix of optimisations and transformations to work <b>out</b> <b>just</b> right. Predicting <b>how</b> all these cogs will turn is hard enough – but where something goes wrong, the various transformations will have mangled the program to the point where even finding the crucial locations in the code can become a game of cat-and-mouse. In this work we will lift the veil on the performance of heavily transformed Haskell programs: Using a formal causality analysis we will track source code links from square one, and maintain the connection all the way to the final costs generated by the program. This will allow us to implement a profiling solution that can measure performance at high accuracy while explaining in detail how we got to the point in question. Furthermore, we will directly support the performance analysis process by developing an interactive profiling user interface that allows rapid theory forming and evaluation, as well as deep analysis where required...|$|R
