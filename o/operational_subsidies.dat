One key element to this integration would be a single fare system, called Presto, to improve the convenience of transfers between different transit agencies. On March 23, 2006, the Government of Ontario announced funding for the extension northward of the TTC's Spadina Subway Line to the York University campus and beyond into the proposed Vaughan Metropolitan Centre (formerly known as Vaughan Corporate Centre) at Highway 7 and Jane Street in neighbouring Vaughan, York Region. When completed, it will be the first extension of the TTC subway system beyond the current post-1998 municipal border of Toronto. However, Toronto's existing transportation network, particularly public transit, has not kept up with the growth of the city. In the past decade, issues concerning transit funding and expansion have become political football. For example, in 2007, Metrolinx is provided $8.4 billion of funding to construct four light rail lines throughout the City, including light rail lines along Eglinton Avenue, Finch Avenue West, and Sheppard Avenue East, as well as a line replacing the Scarborough RT, all of which are expected to be completed and in operation by 2020. However, by 2017, political interference and delays meant that only two of the lines, Eglinton and Finch West, are projected to be complete by late 2021. Of the two aforementioned lines only one is currently under construction, as of 2017. Funding for the daily operations of the TTC have become chronically low with the removal of provincial funding by the premier Mike Harris in the late 90s, leaving the City of Toronto as the sole source of <b>operational</b> <b>subsidies.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we aim to}} {{estimate}} the effect of contract renewal as well as competitive tendering on public transport costs, subsidies, and ridership. More specifically, we examine to what extent (multiple) contract renewals and introduction of competitive tendering for long-term public transport contracts affect ridership, <b>operational</b> costs and <b>subsidies</b> in concession areas governed by public transportation authorities from 2001 until 2013 in the Netherlands. Our identification strategy improves on the literature as {{we are able to}} control for all time-invariant unobserved factors, such as network and area characteristics by using panel data. We show that when renewing long-term contracts, operational costs are reduced by at least 10 %, whereas subsidies fall even stronger. For contracts that are renewed at least twice, the reduction in costs is even more substantial and in the order of 16 %. We find that the effect of competitive tendering is completely absent, suggesting that the threat of competitive tendering is sufficient in a market where the majority of concessions is competitive tendered. Contract renewal not only reduces costs and subsidies, but simultaneously increases public transport ridership by 7. 7 %. Furthermore the vehicle-hours elasticity of operational costs is 0. 40, pointing to strong economies of density. The geographical scale elasticity of operational costs is around one, which indicates constant returns to scale with respect to the geographical size of the concession area. This suggest that the current size of the Dutch concession area is optimal with respect to costs...|$|R

40|$|In 2001, 58 % of the {{motorised}} {{trips on}} a typical day were made by using public transport in Santiago, the capital of Chile. Comparing this with its proportion in 1991 (71 %) and 1977 (83 %) a clear decline in public transport use can be seen. The improvement of the public transport system is crucial to stop its decline in the modal split, and to accomplish a more sustainable urban transport system (together with complementary policies: for instance car parking restrictions, bicycle facilities). Based on positive experiences provided by three selected European metropolitan areas (Greater London, Berlin and Madrid) and taking into account theoretic and empirical evidence investigated by the author in previous studies and field trips, {{the aim of this}} research is to identify and analyse aspects in which the public transport system of Santiago de Chile can be improved. An important part of this research is the comparison and analysis of the socio-economic and transport data of the four metropolitan areas. During this analysis, two topics were identified and selected for further research: the institutional organisation of public transport (transport authority) and the fare structure of public transport. In the case of the transport authority, the proposed solution for Santiago is the creation of a regional transport authority, responsible for the planning and implementation of both public and private transport policies, strategic plans and projects. It should also be responsible for the non-motorised modes and for urban planning and land-use definitions at the regional level. Responsibilities from other areas different to the transportation could also be transferred to the regional authority, {{as long as they have}} a regional scope. The regional government should change its appointment system, in the direction of directly elected head and representatives. Travelcards allowing unlimited public transport use in a certain period (e. g. a month) may have a positive impact on public transport demand. Their implementation is recommended for Santiago. No technical problems for its introduction are detected, being the main difficulty an eventual unwillingness at the decision-making level. The relation between the fare and the trip-length is discussed. A mostly flat fare is recommended for Santiago. The differentiation of fares in peak and off-peak periods is also analysed. As shown in a numerical simulation, it is possible to increase both patronage and revenue through this measure. The average fare in Santiago is marginally lower than in Berlin and Madrid. Comparing it with the disposable income of the population, the public transport in Santiago is more expensive than in London, Madrid and Berlin. Unlike the European case study areas, the public transport system in Santiago does not receive <b>operational</b> <b>subsidies.</b> These kind of subsides are fully justified by the economic theory in the case of urban public transport, and also represent a clear policy decision in the direction of giving incentives to the use of public transport. A subsidy in Santiago would be more likely, if it were not financed by fiscal expenditure but other sources (e. g. congestion charging). A regressive cross-subsidy from full-fare payers to the students should be eliminated, providing a compensation for the reduced students’ fare. During the time of this research the public transport system of Santiago was undergoing a major change under the name “Transantiago”. All the analyses are made assuming that Transantiago is already implemented, i. e. the recommendations are centred in future improvement for the new system...|$|E
40|$|There’s {{not much}} for {{children}} in this budget, according to the Australian Council for Educational Research’s Alison Elliott THIS week’s federal budget offers little {{in response to the}} growing educational, ethical and economic imperatives to provide high-quality early childhood programs. There is no mention of lifting child care quality, nothing about universal preschool education, no additional places to train early childhood teachers, no increase in Child Care Benefit payments, no mention of tax deductions for employer provided child care places, and no meaningful early childhood payment scheme to let parents remain at home while children are young or seek early childhood care and education. Nor does the budget include <b>operational</b> <b>subsidies</b> for community-based child care, any substantial increase to the Family Tax Benefit threshold, or an indication that carers in family day care could claim the Child Care Benefit when they cared for their own children alongside those from other families. The budget’s major childcare decision - to uncap subsidised places in family day care and out of school hours care - is unlikely to have any impact on the dire shortfall in early childhood care and education places and growing concerns about child care quality. A ‘subsidised’ place really means a place eligible for a Child Care Benefit payment. But the payment in itself is already capped by means tested family eligibility. The maximum rate of $ 144 for one child starts to reduce as families earn over about $ 34, 000. Until now, centre-based child care places have been uncapped, but family day care and out of school places have been set by the budget. Uncapping the number of places tied to the child care benefit doesn’t solve the shortage of places or improve the quality of early childhood programs. It’s especially difficult to imagine how the new 25, 000 family day care and out of school places by 2009 are going to be operationalised without substantial resourcing and careful planning. In fact, there are currently an estimated 30, 000 unfilled child care places and about unused 65, 000 out of school hours places. The number of centre-based child care places is governed by the number of licensed and accredited centres and theoretically these can be unlimited. Each centre is licensed for a certain number of ‘places’. These places can be tied to a set number of subsidised hours in care per day and up to 50 hours per week and may be occupied by more than one child. So a ‘ 60 place centre’ for example, has facilities and staff to safely care for up to 60 children at anyone time, but might have an enrolment of three times that number. The key issue in child care is not so much lack of places but where they are located. Out of school care must be located at or close to children’s schools rather than parents’ workplaces. Child care places must be in areas of high need, that is in communities with high parental employment and at or near workplaces. Centres are expensive to establish and run and qualified staff difficult to find. The greatest capital expenses are in cities with high land and building costs. Suburban centres in areas of full employment and high housing costs also have difficulty attracting staff, especially lower paid carers. Low paid child care workers are less likely to live in more affluent areas and travel, shift work and related work-family balance issues makes employment problematic. For them, nannying might well be a more realistic and profitable option. Family day care is based in normal family homes and is typically operated by a mother who cares for four or so young children. In areas of high employment, where the demand for care is highest, there are few stay-at-home mothers willing to care for other people’s children. Further, the requirements for playspaces, and other safety issues render many homes unsuitable for family day care, especially in built up or even rural areas and in rental properties. And, unless carers have a car that can carry three or more children they become prisoners in their homes. Using public transport with several young children in tow is clearly not an option. An increase of 10, 000 family day care places, assuming about 4 children per carer, would require 2, 500 new carers and homes. Often carers have only one or two children in care, and/or work part-time, meaning more carers are needed to create these extra places. Home based carers operate within schemes typically run by local government or community based organisations. Recruiting carers, training them and supporting them with playgroups, resources and child development advice are major undertakings. Establishing new family day care schemes requires premises and day to day operational costs to support carers; existing quality assurance processes are already stretching organisational resources. It {{will be interesting to see}} the extent to which private providers seek to enter the family day care and out of school care market. Unlimited increases in family day care places assume there will be thousands of women just waiting at home to set up small businesses caring for other people’s children for poor financial returns. There are not. Increasing places in out of school care also requires a host of new and, it’s to be hoped, trained staff, together with more resources, including buildings. An increase of, say, 15, 000 places, at 20 places per staff member, would require about 750 new staff. Staff are often young, energetic tertiary students who fit early morning or afternoon shifts around their study. They too can be hard to attract to child care, especially in some communities. Already, many family day care and out of school places are going begging because they are located in areas of low need. Careful planning is required to ensure that new and existing child care places end up where there are shortages. Strategic thinking in conjunction with local government is needed to target areas of high and likely demand. Vacant centre based child care, family day care or out of school places in Western Sydney are not much use to a family in Sydney’s inner west or in Melbourne or Brisbane. The announcement of a national hotline designed to direct parents to child-care vacancies in their area is certainly welcome and will help parents find services. Again, though, it doesn’t address the mismatch between vacancies and need. Given the structure of family day care, regulatory requirements and the characteristics of carers, the likelihood of it coming to the gardenless apartments and terraces of inner suburbia any time soon are remote. Family day care can be a very successful alternative to formal child-care centres, providing an intimate home and family environment for babies and toddlers. But although they are wonderfully warm and nurturing, carers tend not to have formal early childhood qualifications and many parents wonder about their ability to provide stimulating learning environments. Older children, especially in the year or two before school, require rich early childhood programs provided by qualified early childhood educators. Recent national recruitment drives to boost the number of people running family day care in their homes are likely to be unsuccessful - at least in the areas where care is most needed - because potential carers are not available, remuneration is poor and home-based physical conditions can be hard to meet. For all the recent rhetoric about universal preschool for all four year olds there was nothing in the budget hinting at developments in this area. And payments from the controversial 30 per cent child care tax rebate will still be made eighteen months in arrears. All children need access to developmentally and educationally significant early childhood programs and a seamless transition from child care to preschool and kindergarten and to school. Anything less ignores the strong evidence base on the positive impact of quality early childhood experiences on longer term educational outcomes - not to mention piece of mind for working parents. It also ignores many families’ desperate search for quality, affordable care and early education for their children. The goodwill surrounding care and early education has never been stronger. There is no better time to set ideologies, market forces, turf wars, and partisan party politics aside for children’s and families’ futures. But action must be swift and decisive or the already complicated, unwieldy and inefficient early childhood sector will become more and more difficult to navigate and to fix. • Alison Elliott is the Research Director, Early Childhood Education, at the the Australian Council for Educational Research Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|E
