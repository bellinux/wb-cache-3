5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the <b>oviduct</b> and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the <b>oviduct.</b> In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the <b>oviduct.</b> Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the <b>oviduct.</b> Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the <b>oviduct</b> at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the <b>oviduct.</b> This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the <b>oviduct</b> wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths {{as long as their}} mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|In caecilians, {{fertilisation}} is internal, {{the male}} extruding an intromittent organ, the phallodeum, and inserting {{it into the}} female cloaca. The paired Müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm. Fertilisation probably {{takes place in the}} <b>oviduct.</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary. On the 1 st {{day after}} mating, the <b>oviducts</b> {{of the mouse}} are {{infected}} with bacteria. Infection is eliminated within 24 to 36 hr, presumably by the leucocytes appearing {{at this time in}} the genital tract. Two groups of strains, one producing a greenish discolouration of the blood and the other =bhaemolytic,were isolated from the <b>oviducts</b> and were identified as being most probably varieties of enterococci.

40|$|Summary. The <b>oviducts</b> of 24 mares were {{examined}} {{to determine the}} site of retention of unfertilized eggs. The ampullary=n- regions of 42 of the 48 <b>oviducts</b> were serially sectioned and examined histologically. The remaining parts of the ovi-ducts were flushed and the flushings searched microscopically. Of 45 eggs located, 40 were in the sectioned segments of 25 <b>oviducts</b> and only 5 were in the flushings. All {{but one of the}} sectioned segments contained prominent masses of material obstructing the lumen, but these were apparently not the direct cause of egg retention since eggs were found on both sides of them...|$|R

5|$|In most species, {{the sexes}} are {{separate}} {{and there is}} little sexual dimorphism, but a few species are hermaphroditic and some parasitic forms show large differences between the sexes. Some Cymothoidans are protandrous hermaphrodites, starting life as males and later changing sex, and some Anthuroideans are the reverse, being protogynous hermaphrodites that are born female. Some Gnathiidans males are sessile and live with a group of females. Males have a pair of penises, which may be fused in some species. The sperm is transferred to the female by the modified second pleopod which receives it from the penis and which is then inserted into a female gonopore. The sperm is stored in a special receptacle, a swelling on the <b>oviduct</b> close to the gonopore. Fertilisation only takes place when the eggs are shed soon after a moult, at which time a connection is established between the semen receptacle and the <b>oviduct.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are what}} Thompson calls simple solids of revolution, varying from the nearly spherical eggs of owls through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens, to the {{markedly}} pointed eggs of cliff-nesting birds like the guillemot. He {{shows that the}} shape of the egg favours its movement along the <b>oviduct,</b> a gentle pressure on the trailing end sufficing to push it forwards. Similarly, sea urchin shells have teardrop shapes, such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid.|$|E
5|$|The Ichneumonidae are {{specialized}} parasitoids, {{often of}} Lepidoptera larvae deeply buried in plant tissues, {{which may be}} woody. For this purpose, they have exceptionally long ovipositors; they detect their hosts by smell and vibration. Some of the largest species, including Rhyssa persuasoria and Megarhyssa macrurus, parasitise horntails, large sawflies whose adult females also have impressively long ovipositors. Some parasitic species have a mutualistic relationship with a polydnavirus that weakens the host's immune system and replicates in the <b>oviduct</b> of the female wasp.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Parous ewes {{were treated}} orally or intravaginally with {{synthetic}} progestagen, or subcutaneously with progesterone. Treatment was begun on Day 8 or 10 of an oestrous cycle and continued for 13 to 17 days. At the oestrus following progestagen withdrawal, the uterus was exposed and uterine contractions observed. Each treatment {{reduced the number}} of uterine contractions moving towards the <b>oviducts</b> and increased the number moving towards the cervix. The altered motility pattern probably helps to account for decreased sperm transport to the <b>oviducts</b> at the progestagen-regulated oestrus. Controlling oestrus in ewes by intravaginal or oral administration of synthetic progestagen results in the inhibition of sperm transport to the <b>oviducts</b> at th...|$|R

5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's <b>oviduct</b> over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the <b>oviduct</b> to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E
5|$|In fertilised queens, {{the ovaries}} only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the <b>oviduct</b> to the vagina {{where there is}} a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating is stored. Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the {{development}} of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|E

50|$|Lim-1 is also {{essential}} {{for the development of}} the female reproductive tract as it causes the persistence of the mullerian ducts that will eventually develop into the <b>oviducts,</b> uterus, cervix, and vagina. Without the expression of Lim-1, formation of the epithelial and mesenchymal cells of the reproductive tract will not occur. While the ovaries will develop, female mice will develop without a uterus and <b>oviducts.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Tibetan {{antelope}} is {{endemic to}} the Tibetan Plateau, China, {{and is now}} considered an endangered species. As a possible rescue strategy, the development of embryos constructed by interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) was examined. Tibetan antelope fibroblast cells were transferred into enucleated bovine, ovine and caprine oocytes. These cloned embryos were then cultured in vitro or in the <b>oviducts</b> of intermediate animals. Less than 0. 5 % of the reconstructed antelope-bovine embryos cultured in vitro developed to the blastocyst stage. However, when the cloned antelope-bovine embryos were transferred to caprine <b>oviducts,</b> about 1. 6 % of the embryos developed to the blastocyst stage. In contrast, only 0. 7 % of the antelope-ovine embryos developed to the morula stage and none developed to blastocysts in ovine <b>oviducts.</b> The treatment of donor cells and bovine oocytes with trichostatin A did not improve the embryo development even when cultured in the <b>oviducts</b> of ovine and caprine. When the antelope-bovine embryos, constructed from oocytes treated with roscovitine or trichostatin A, were cultured in rabbit <b>oviducts</b> 2. 3 % and 14. 3 % developed to blastocysts, respectively. It is concluded that although some success was achieved with the protocols used, interspecies cloning of Tibetan antelope presents difficulties still to be overcome. The mechanisms resulting in the low embryo development need investigation and progress might require {{a deeper understanding of}} cellular reprogramming...|$|R
5|$|Mating {{has rarely}} been {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim {{parallel to each other}} while the male inserts a clasper into the female's <b>oviduct.</b> Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E
5|$|Ovulation is {{the second}} phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the <b>oviduct.</b> During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|All dinosaurs lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Eggs are usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some species of modern bird have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional <b>oviduct</b> and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as Troodon, exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid.|$|E

5|$|The {{reproduction}} of octopuses {{has been studied}} {{in only a few}} species. One such species is the giant Pacific octopus, in which courtship is accompanied, especially in the male, by changes in skin texture and colour. The male may cling to the top or side of the female or position himself beside her. There is some speculation that he may first use his hectocotylus to remove any spermatophore or sperm already present in the female. He picks up a spermatophore from his spermatophoric sac with the hectocotylus, inserts it into the female's mantle cavity, and deposits it in the correct location for the species, which in the giant Pacific octopus is the opening of the <b>oviduct.</b> Two spermatophores are transferred in this way; these are about one metre (yard) long, and the empty ends may protrude from the female's mantle. A complex hydraulic mechanism releases the sperm from the spermatophore, and it is stored internally by the female.|$|E
5|$|Females usually {{engage with}} several males over a {{breeding}} season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the <b>oviduct.</b> The female deposits them individually on leaves of aquatic plants, {{such as water}} cress or floating sweetgrass, usually close to the surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even plastic bags. In the northern crested newt, a female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. Crested newt females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) can lay up to 400. Triturus embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2mm in diameter with a 6mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested {{when they do not}} possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are homozygous for that chromosome).|$|E
5|$|The eggs of {{amphibians}} {{are typically}} laid {{in water and}} hatch into free-living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults. In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults. Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies. Some caecilians, the alpine salamander (Salamandra atra) {{and some of the}} African live-bearing toads (Nectophrynoides spp.) are viviparous. Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female's <b>oviduct,</b> often for long periods. Other amphibians, but not caecilians, are ovoviviparous. The eggs are retained in or on the parent's body, but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult. The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth, either before or after metamorphosis, according to their species. The toad genus Nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.|$|E

5|$|The identification, in 2000, of a {{probable}} Deinonychus egg associated {{with one of}} the original specimens allowed comparison with other theropod dinosaurs in terms of egg structure, nesting, and reproduction. In their 2006 examination of the specimen, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky examined the possibility that the dromaeosaurid had been feeding on the egg, or that the egg fragments had been associated with the Deinonychus skeleton by coincidence. They dismissed the idea that the egg had been a meal for the theropod, noting that the fragments were sandwiched between the belly ribs and forelimb bones, making it impossible that they represented contents of the animal's stomach. In addition, {{the manner in which the}} egg had been crushed and fragmented indicated that it had been intact at the time of burial, and was broken by the fossilization process. The idea that the egg was randomly associated with the dinosaur was also found to be unlikely; the bones surrounding the egg had not been scattered or disarticulated, but remained fairly intact relative to their positions in life, indicating that the area around and including the egg was not disturbed during preservation. The fact that these bones were belly ribs (gastralia), which are very rarely found articulated, supported this interpretation. All the evidence, according to Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky, indicates that the egg was intact beneath the body of the Deinonychus when it was buried. It is possible that this represents brooding or nesting behavior in Deinonychus similar to that seen in the related troodontids and oviraptorids, or that the egg was in fact inside the <b>oviduct</b> when the animal died.|$|E
