Here, an <b>ordinary</b> <b>ticket</b> from Tokyo to Takamatsu is coupled with a Shinkansen surcharge ticket from Tokyo to Okayama, allowing use of the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Okayama and use of local lines from Okayama to Takamatsu. For trips exclusively on one Shinkansen, the ordinary fare and Shinkansen surcharge may be combined on one ticket.|$|E
5000|$|Herman Hollerith's first {{device for}} {{punching}} cards from the 1890s was ...any <b>ordinary</b> <b>ticket</b> punch, cutting a round hole 3/16 {{of an inch}} in diameter. Use of such a punch was facilitated by placing the holes to be used near {{the edges of the}} card. Hollerith soon developed a more accurate and simpler to use Keyboard Punch, using a pantograph to link a punch mechanism to a guide pointer that an operator would place over the appropriate mark in a 12 by 20 matrix to line up a manual punch over the correct hole in one of 20 columns. [...] In 1901 Hollerith patented a mechanism where an operator pressed one of 12 keys to punch a hole, with the card automatically advancing to the next column. This first-generation Type 001 keypunch used 45 columns and round holes. In 1923 The Tabulating Machine Company introduced the first electric keypunch, the Type 011 Electric Keypunch, a similar looking device where each key closed an electrical contact that activated a solenoid which punched the hole. The 80 column punched card format was introduced in 1928; existing keypunches and other products could be modified for this new format while keeping the same model numbers. [...] Later Hollerith keypunches included the Type 016 Motor-Driven Electric Duplicating Keypunch (1929), the Type 31 Alphabetical Duplicating Punch (1933), and the Type 32 Alphabetical Printing Punch (1933).|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} to modelling in Sri Lanka {{is based on}} zoning of the area concerned, and {{the identification of the}} travel network within the area, connecting the different zones. The resulting travel patterns of bus and rail are understood as an inter-zonal travel made between the different zones. The set of models used for transportation planning in the Colombo Metropolitan Region has inconsistent structural forms with the formulation of different types of variables. Most of these variables are not common to each other. As a consequence the model estimation requires a large data base. Pertaining to this, a set of bus and rail passenger demand model forms is calibrated to a common modelling format, on a scientific basis. These models attempt to explain (a) bus travel demand, (b) rail travel demand using season tickets,(c) rail travel demand using <b>ordinary</b> <b>tickets</b> and (d) total bus and rail travel demand. In these models, the impedance to travel is expressed in a generalized form, which includes travel fare, waiting time, transfer time and travel time. The product of employee population and the housing density between zones are the best fitted variables which explain the travel characteristics of the region. The Mode choice modelling {{is one of the most}} crucial parts of travel demand modelling. With regards to this, the sound theoretical approach to the modelling facilitates the better understanding of traveller behaviour in the mode choice process. The theoretical framework of the bus and rail choice model has been formulated using logit theory, energy theory and economic theory. The variables fitted in this model are expressed by time variables such as, the utility difference between passengers (a) walking time to the mode, (b) in-vehicle travel times of bus and rail and (c) the loss of traveller comfort due to the loading levels and waiting time of the modes. The inclusion of bus and rail loading factors in the model, is important and has a great ability to represent the traveller characteristics of the inter-zonal travel. Therefore, the model can be applied for transportation planning studies not only to the study area but also to any Metropolitan region in the developing countries, which is of a similar nature in the travel characteristics. The statistical tests reveal that the set of demand models for bus, rail and total public transportation has been successfully calibrated. It indicates the variation of the coefficient of correlation is between 70 % and 80 %. In fact, the choice model indicates this value is 85 %, and 0. 289 of the log likelihood index, which makes one conclude that the theoretical choice model has an acceptable fit, of the variables and the data.
