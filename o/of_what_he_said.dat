He still thinks that governments should discourage people from having more than two children, suggesting, for example a greater tax rate for larger families.|$|E

25|$|Under President Carter, the CIA was {{conducting}} covertly funded pro-American opposition against the Sandinista. In March 1981, Reagan told Congress that the CIA would protect El Salvador by preventing the shipment of Nicaraguan arms {{into the country}} to arm Communist rebels. This was a ruse. The CIA was actually arming and training Nicaraguans Contras in Honduras in hopes that they could depose the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Through William J. Casey's tenure as DCI little <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> in the National Security Planning Group, or to President Reagan {{was supported by the}} intelligence branch of the CIA, so Casey formed the Central American Task Force, staffed with yes men from Covert Action. On December 21, 1982, Congress passed a law restricting the CIA to its stated mission, restricting the flow of arms from Nicaragua to El Salvador, prohibiting the use of funds to oust the Sandinistas. Reagan testified before Congress, assuring them that the CIA was not trying to topple the Nicaraguan government.|$|E

We're quite happy to have our beliefs questioned, ethically debated, and points of religion looked at. That's not a problem. We don't mind being criticised. We don't even mind being despised because of it.

500|$|Crowds of {{citizens}} had gathered outside {{the steps and}} gates of ʻIolani Palace expecting the announcement of a new constitution. Among them were White and members of Hui Kālaiʻāina who had presented a sealed package containing the constitution.

Representative White also gave a speech to this crowd on the palace steps although the exact nature <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> is disputed. Opponents of the monarchy, especially the conservatives in the Reform Party, later claimed he gave an inflammatory and violent speech inciting the crowd to storm the palace and [...] "go in and kill and bury" [...] either the queen or her cabinet ministers.

500|$|Cartman dresses like Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler, and {{occasionally}} says [...] "Sieg Heil", a common phrase previously used in Nazi Germany. Comedy Central had {{reservations about the}} idea and sought ideas for other possible costumes, but Parker and Stone insisted {{it had to be}} the Hitler costume. Once the episode aired, however, the two received very few letters from upset viewers over the costume; Parker attributed this to the fact that people were becoming more familiar with the Cartman character, and thus recognized that most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> and did was usually wrong. More than Hitler, however, Comedy Central executives were worried about the use of Chewbacca costumes throughout the episode because of George Lucas' well-known tendency to file lawsuits against unauthorized Star Wars references or parodies. The channel contacted his production company, Lucasfilm, about the episode and was asked to send a copy of the episode to them for review. The voice used by the supposedly actual Adolf Hitler in the educational video shown to Cartman is based on Monty Python alum John Cleese's Hitler impression, which both Parker and Stone particularly praised.|$|E

500|$|Behind the Exclusive Brethren: Politics Persuasion and Persecution is a non-fiction book by {{journalist}} and author Michael Bachelard about the group Exclusive Brethren, focusing on the sect in Australia. It was published in 2008 by Scribe Publications Pty Ltd. Bachelard first {{became interested in the}} organisation while a journalist for The Age, after finding out that prior to the 2007 Australian federal election the Exclusive Brethren organisation in Australia had close access to John Howard. He spent two years researching the group, focusing on its history, influence in Australia, and ties to the Liberal Party of Australia and to Howard. The book gives a historical background of the group's origins 200 years ago in Ireland under John Nelson Darby. Since 2002, Bruce Hales served as the international leader and [...] "Elect Vessel" [...] of the organisation, which has 15,000 members in Australia and 43,000 total globally. The author describes the beliefs and practices and doctrine of the organisation, including some of its more controversial methodology including excommunication of former members from their family still within the group. Daniel Hales, brother of the organisation's worldwide leader Bruce Hales, described the book as part of a trend <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> were lies told about his group by critics and disaffected former members.|$|E
500|$|In the All Music Guide to Jazz (2002), Lindsay Planer {{wrote that}} Monk's quartet [...] "continually reinvented" [...] their strong, {{cohesive}} sound with [...] "overwhelming and instinctual capacities" [...] throughout Misterioso. He especially praised Griffin, saying he [...] "consistently liberated the performances". Monk biographer Robin Kelley felt {{because he had}} mastered Monk's songs at that point, his solos on Misterioso and Thelonious in Action were excursive and spirited. Jazz critic Scott Yanow found Misterioso to be the superior record because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was Griffin's unforgettable solo on a passionate rendition of [...] "In Walked Bud", while music historian Ted Gioia listed Monk and Griffin's [...] "freewheeling" [...] performance on the title track {{as one of his}} recommended recordings of the composition. According to Robert Christgau, both this record and Brilliant Corners (1957) represented Monk's artistic peak. He cited Misterioso as his favorite album and, in a 2009 article for The Barnes & Noble Review, wrote that Griffin's tenor solo during [...] "In Walked Bud" [...] remained his [...] "favorite five minutes of recorded music". Liam McManus from PopMatters was less enthusiastic about Griffin's playing, which he believed was occasionally heavy-handed and detracted from the music, but still recommended Misterioso as an exceptional Monk record featuring him in a casual performance with his quartet.|$|E
2500|$|Much of Barnes's journalism was {{subjective}} and experiential. Writing about {{a conversation with}} James Joyce, she admitted to missing part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> because her attention had wandered, though she revered Joyce's writing. Interviewing the successful playwright Donald Ogden Stewart, she shouted at him for [...] "roll over and find yourself famous" [...] while other writers continued to struggle, then said she wouldn't mind dying; as her biographer Phillip Herring points out, this is [...] "a depressing and perhaps unprecedented note on which to end an interview." ...|$|E

He could describe a key as a key no matter what its size or color, and could determine how the key was different from others. Looking at a mirror, he said [...] "what color", and learned [...] "grey" [...] after being told [...] "grey" [...] six times. This made him {{the first and only}} non-human animal to have ever asked a question (apes who have been trained to use sign-language have so far failed to ever ask a single question).

2500|$|The tenth {{match was}} between The Total Package and Sting (accompanied by Elizabeth). Prior to the match, Sting was shown handing Elizabeth a can <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was spray, {{and told her}} to use it if she had to. [...] The Total Package {{attacked}} Sting as he entered the ring, and continued to have the advantage. Elizabeth climbed onto the apron, and this allowed Sting to fight back. After they knocked down each other with a clothesline, Elizabeth came into the ring, and revealed her alliance with The Total Package by attempting to use the spray on Sting. [...] Unfortunately for her, it was actually a can of silly string, revealing that Sting anticipated being betrayed by his confidante (a common occurrence in Sting's career). Sting performed a Stinger splash to The Total Package, and attempted to apply the Scorpion Deathlock. Elizabeth hit Sting with a baseball bat, and Sting won the match by disqualification. After the match, The Total Package attacked Sting's right arm with a steel chair and the bat.|$|E

2500|$|The authorship of the Old English Orosius is unknown. In the 12th century William of Malmesbury {{believed}} that it was the work of King Alfred himself, but scholarly scrutiny of the text since the mid-20th century, including by the historians Dorothy Whitelock and Janet Bately, has led to this view being refuted on lexical and syntactic grounds. Janet Bately believes that the Old English version of Orosius was created between 889 and 899, probably in the early 890s, but {{there is no way of}} knowing whether Ohthere's account was previously in existence and incorporated from the outset, or if it was written down later and incorporated into a subsequent copy.
