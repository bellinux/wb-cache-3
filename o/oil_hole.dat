In order to verify the cooling effect of MQL, the tool temperature at the flank face is measured using a newly assembled fiber-coupled two-color pyrometer.

The thermal radiation accepted by a sensing fiber is noncontactly transmitted to the other fixed fiber {{and led to the}} two-color detectors. As for cutting force in turning of SCM 440 H, MQL is more effective in low cutting speed below 100 m/min. The tool temperature in MQL turning is approximately 100 °C lower than that in dry turning over the wide range of 30 ∼ 300 m/min.

Design for internal combustion engine is mainly to calculate the crankshaft strength [1]. The failure points generally exist at transition fillet on main journal and crank arm, <b>oil</b> <b>hole</b> and internal defects. And most of the existing researches are to find the maximum stress point, using different analytical methods to achieve the purposes of crank design and optimization [2 - 5]. For the structure parameters (main journal diameter and length, crank pin diameter and length, etc.), there is less work done {{on the strength of}} the crankshaft.

40|$|The Squeeze film damper {{has proved}} a useful means of {{eliminating}} instabilities and reducing vibration in rotor-bearing systems. Analyses for this problem generally assume parallel land dampers. In this thesis, the pressure distribution, the fluid film forces, and the stiffness and damping coefficients of variable land geometry narrow, circular orbit type squeeze film dampers are obtained theoretically, assuming end feed and the Short Bearing Approximation. The coefficients for 7 r film are obtained for quartic, exponential, cosine and step wise axial profile variation and {{compared to those}} for parallel axial land geometry. It is shown that variable land geometry dampers can reduce the variation of stiffness and damping coefficients, thereby reducing the degree of damper force non-linearity, and presumally reducing the likelihood of undesirable bistable operation. Alternatively, variable axial land geometry dampers can significantly alter the unbalance response, and in particular, the likelihood of undesirable jump of circular orbit type squeeze film dampers. This thesis investigates the effect of variable land geometry profiles mentioned above on the jump up propensity of such dampers. Theoretical investigation is restricted to n film vertical rigid rotors with end feed {{and the application of}} Short Bearing Approximation. It is found that regardless of unbalance and regardless of the depth, width or shape of the profile, parallel land dampers are least likely to experience jump up to undesirable operation modes. These conflicting conclusions might be accounted for by the reduction in damping, and in fact, the reduction in the pressure. Moroever, the damper model with end feed assumed in this thesis could alter pressure distributions and forces. Thus, these conclusions will need to be qualified for practical dampers with <b>oil</b> <b>hole</b> feed. Finally, the limitation of Short Bearing Approximation for large e region could alter actual unbalance response data...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary design {{solutions}} {{in the engine}} engineering are aimed at raising a great many technical and economic performances, and enhancing manufacturability. When producing the V-shaped six-cylinder engines, the camber angle is often taken to be equal to 90 °, which is technologically advantageous {{in the production of}} V 8 engines. However, this solution leads to the engine instability and deteriorates mass-dimension and vibration performances of the engine. A crankshaft with the offset connecting rod journals is the solution to which Western and Russian power plant developers have increasingly taken recourse. However, introducing such a shaft entails a number of difficulties, and what is the most important requires special methods of calculation. There are no direct analytical methods to calculate this type of crankshafts. The article describes a technique to estimate endurance using a software complex "KVAL", developed at the BMSTU Department "Piston engines". This software disables direct examination of the crankshaft of this type, however, in conjunction with other calculations enables estimating endurance. The main point of the technique is a two-staged calculation. The original crankshaft is represented at first as a crankshaft with the connecting rods, sitting side-by-side. The article studies its endurance in the fillets of the rod bearing journal transition to the cheek and also at the outlets of two oil-feed holes. The second stage presumes that the shaft has an articulated rod and using the same type of calculations studies the fillet transition of the rod bearing journals to the intermediate cheek by its representation as an <b>oil</b> <b>hole.</b> Each of the stages refines theoretical coefficients of stress concentration through numerical simulation in the software package "ANSYS", thereby making calculation more stringent. The results obtained are very evident and representative, but also allow us to suggest a number of hypotheses for further research. The proposed technique enables us to study endurance of the crankshafts with offset connecting rod journals, as well as the Napoleone crankshafts of opposed reciprocating engines. </p...|$|E
