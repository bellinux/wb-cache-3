5|$|In 1945, much of {{the area}} that forms today's Cleland Conservation Park was {{purchased}} by the State Government, {{in large part because}} of the lobbying efforts of Professor Sir John Cleland. Most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>land,</b> including the Waterfall Gully area, was later combined in 1963 to create the park that extends eastwards up into the hills to the summit of Mount Lofty and northwards to Greenhill Road. During 1943, the Municipality of Burnside was proclaimed the City of Burnside.|$|E

5000|$|The known {{history of}} the {{aboriginal}} occupants <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>lands</b> begins with the conquest of the Incas, who never definitively conquered this people. The northermost outpost of the Inca Empire, according to Spanish chroniclers, was the Rumichaca Bridge, 7 km from Tulcan on the present-day border with Colombia.|$|R
5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} {{formed by}} traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. Because the ecological impact <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>land</b> management strategy {{is similar to}} the impact of such natural disturbances as a wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion of biodiversity. This strategy is declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.|$|E
5|$|Boone {{served as}} syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri {{became part of}} the United States {{following}} the Louisiana Purchase. Because Boone's land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on verbal agreements, he once again lost his land claims. In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>land</b> to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone was much too old for militia duty.|$|E
5|$|The Cavendish family {{sold the}} abbey in 1733, at which point, with Cavendish House in ruins, the precinct {{was being used}} as {{agricultural}} land. By the 19th century the abbey {{had come into the}} possession of the Earls of Dysart. Lionel Tollemache, 8th Earl of Dysart, sold the land east of the River Soar (known as Abbey Meadows) in 1876; this was to allow Leicester Town Council to undertake flood prevention work. The part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>land</b> between the river and the Grand Union Canal was developed by the Town Council into a public space known as Abbey Park, which was opened by King Edward VII (then Prince of Wales) in 1882.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} settlers of Hillsborough (other than Lenape) was a man named John Royce. It is documented that during the late 17th century he owned a large piece <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> <b>This</b> <b>land</b> is pretty much {{what is now the}} entire town of Manville.|$|R
5|$|The site {{chosen for}} the dock to be built on was an area of land bordered by Salthouse Dock to the east, the {{entrance}} channel to Canning Dock {{to the north and}} by Duke's Dock to the south. The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a pub, several houses and the Dock Trustee's Dockyard. Upon the clearance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>land</b> both the Salthouse and Canning dock's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed, whilst hundreds of 'Navvies' were employed to dig out the dock basin and construct the new river wall. The dock basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to 'lay-up'.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{references}} in the Domesday Book to Honecote, Hunnecota or Hunecota in the hundred of Carhampton. One records land held by one William of the tenant-in-chief, Roger de Corcelle; {{prior to the}} Norman Conquest, this land belonged to two theigns called Aluric and Bristeuin. Odo, son of Gamelin, held a detached portion <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>land.</b> The second record shows two nuns holding two and half virgates. The local historian and lawyer Charles Chadwyck-Healey identifies these manors with modern Holnicote, the National Archives agrees with him in their catalogue, and the Open Domesday project lists them under Holnicote, but {{the editors of the}} Victoria County History series only identify the land held by the nuns with Holnicote and state that de Corcelle's manor was actually Huntscott in Wootton Courtney.|$|E

5|$|A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was {{formerly}} Acacia koa – Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-ōhia) forest. Its destruction {{was driven by}} an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and {{those parts of the}} forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui. With the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1990s, much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>land</b> lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.|$|E
5|$|The {{land that}} would become part of Sully was likely {{controlled}} by several groups before the Doeg claimed the area. English settlers encountered Algonquian language speaking members of the Doeg tribe in modern-day Northern Virginia. The Doeg are most well known for their raid in July 1675 that {{became a part of}} Bacon's Rebellion. English colonists settling in modern Northern Virginia came into conflict with the Doeg from 1661 to 1664. When diplomatic attempts failed, the governor sent the Rappahannock County militia in June 1666. The specifics of that military action are unclear, but later land grants to English settlers are not disputed, suggesting the English gained control of the area. The English presumptively took control after a violent conflict with the Doeg in 1666. Little is recorded about the disposition <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>land</b> from the time when the English gained control of it until the land is patented by the Lee family of Virginia.|$|E
