It joins a list of over twenty-five countries who already have 2 ̆ 7 opt out 2 ̆ 7 laws—that means that once a person dies, it 2 ̆ 7 s presumed that they consent to donate their organs unless they 2 ̆ 7 ve specifically signed up to an <b>opt-out</b> <b>register.</b> In Australia, we have to opt in to donate organs and tissue. If you haven 2 ̆ 7 t expressed a preference either way, doctors ask family members to make a decision. In about one-third of cases they refuse. Could an opt-out system work in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Unsolicited {{commercial}} emails, {{also referred}} to as junk-mail or spam, is considered a rude and irritating form of marketing. The sending of unsolicited commercial emails has appeared on the European political agenda more then once. The discussion on this issue evolves around the question whether an ‘opt-in’ or an ‘opt-out’ approach should be installed. Opt-in means that no commercial messages may be sent without the prior consent of the receivers. Opt-out means that individuals can register in so called <b>opt-out</b> <b>registers,</b> or indicate to companies which have sent them emails that they no longer wish to receive such messages. There are several legislative acts in Europe that affect the sending of unsolicited emails. At present, two future directives are being prepared affecting the subject. This has led to a reopening of the discussion in the European Parliament. This article contains an overview of the current legal rules, as well as a discussion of the proposed legislative acts...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015, the Oregon {{legislature}} {{passed a}} bill to adopt an automatic voter registration procedure using information from the State DMV. The state has roughly 2.2 million registered voters out of an estimated 3 million eligible voters [...] and the bill will potentially register half of the 800,000 unregistered, eligible voters. Eligible individuals found through the system will have 21 days to <b>opt-out</b> or <b>register</b> with a political party; otherwise they will be automatically registered to vote as [...] "Non-affiliated" [...] with any party.|$|R
50|$|On April 20, 2006, Wikitravel {{announced}} that it and World66—another open-content wiki travel guide founded in 1999—had been acquired by Internet Brands, a publicly traded corporation. The new owner hired Prodromou and Jenkins to continue managing Wikitravel as a consensus-based project. They explained that Internet Brands' long-term plan was for Wikitravel to {{continue to focus on}} collaborative, objective guides, while World66 would focus more on personal experiences and reviews. In response, many authors of the German language community chose to fork the German Wikitravel, which was released on December 10, 2006, as Wikivoyage. The German language Wikitravel remains active. On April 1, 2008, Internet Brands added Google advertising to Wikitravel, with an <b>opt-out</b> procedure for <b>registered</b> users.|$|R
40|$|Over 85 % of Ontarians {{would like}} their organs to be donated after they die. 1 Yet strangely, less than 25 % of Ontarians are {{registered}} organ donors and Ontario law assumes {{that unless the}} deceased registered to be an organ donor prior to their death {{they did not want}} their organs to be donated after their death. 2 As a result, every year, hundreds of Ontarians die awaiting an organ transplant while thousands of healthy organs from individuals who are in favour of organ donation, but failed to register as organ donors, are disposed of instead of transplanted. 3 This situation is tragic, preventable and continues to worsen as the demand for organs increases and the supply flatlines. 4 In this essay I am going to draw on libertarian paternalism to argue that the Ontario government ought to amend the law to presume that Ontarians want to be registered organ donors unless they choose to <b>opt-out</b> of being <b>registered</b> organ donors. To defend my thesis I am first going to explain the state of organ transplantation in Ontario (section one) and then outline possible improvements to the system (section two). Afterwards, I will argue that presumed consent ought to be implemented because it is politically feasible and the most libertarian paternalistic option (section three) and respond to objections against presumed consent (section 4). Section five will conclude...|$|R
40|$|The organ {{shortage}} {{is commonly}} presented {{as having a}} clear solution, {{increase the number of}} organs donated and the problem will be solved. In the light of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s consultation on moving to an <b>opt-out</b> organ donor <b>register</b> this article focusses on the social factors and complexities which impact strongly on both the supply of, and demand for, transplantable organs. Judging by the experience of other countries presumed consent systems may or may not increase donations but have not met demand. Donation rates have risen considerably {{in all parts of the}} UK recently but there is also an increasing demand for organs. Looking at international donation rates and attitudes, future demand for organs and education on donation, the question is whether the organ shortage could ever be met. The increase in longevity, in rates of diabetes and obesity and in alcohol related liver disease all contribute both to increased demand for transplants, and re-transplants, and a reduction in the number of usable organs. It is unlikely that demand could ever be met, since, if supply was unlimited, the focus would move to financial resources and competing demands on the health care budget in a publicly funded health system. These factors point to the need to focus on ways of reducing, or at least stabilizing, demand where lifestyle factors contribute to the underlying disease...|$|R
