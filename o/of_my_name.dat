500|$|Jabbari Weekes of Exclaim! said, [...] "A {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> Is My Names {{sounds are}} wrapped in minimalistic saran wrap that allows Pusha T's cold delivery to flourish, with more abstract drug references than a paranoid dealer over a tapped phone line." [...] Reed Jackson, writing for XXL, stated, [...] "Certain songs, like the trap house anthem [...] "No Regrets" [...] or the early-2000s-sounding [...] "Let Me Love You," [...] are entertaining, but don’t have the inventiveness or {{excitement of the}} album’s other tracks. With MNIMN standing at a lean 12 songs, these missteps are hard to gloss over. Regardless, Pusha T accomplishes a lot here, crafting a record that is big in concept but is still rooted in the longstanding hip-hop tradition that lyricism is king." [...] Brandon Soderberg of Spin said, [...] "Don't tell King Push, but My Name Is My Name bears a weird resemblance to Drake's Nothing Was the Same: Here is another deeply considered collection of top-shelf beats and uncompromising-though-still-pop-enough raps that justifies the fairly awful personalities driving it, which, depending on your tolerance for wounded narcissism and a complete lack of insight, is either fascinating or frustrating." ...|$|E

500|$|In Olajuwon's {{college career}} and {{early years in}} the NBA, he was often undisciplined, talking back to officials, getting in minor fights with other players and {{amassing}} technical fouls. Later, Olajuwon took an active interest in spirituality, becoming a more devout Muslim. On March 9, 1991, he altered his name from Akeem to the more conventional spelling of Hakeem, saying, [...] "I'm not changing the spelling <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>name,</b> I'm correcting it". He later recalled, [...] "I studied the Qur'an every day. At home, at the mosque...I would read it in airplanes, before games and after them. I was soaking up the faith and learning new meanings each time I turned a page. I didn't dabble in the faith, I gave myself over to it." [...] "His religion dominates his life", Drexler said in 1995. Olajuwon was still {{recognized as one of}} the league's elite centers despite his strict observance of Ramadan (i.e., abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours for about a month), which occurred during the playing season throughout his career. Olajuwon was noted as sometimes playing better during the month, and in 1995 he was named NBA Player of the Month in February, even though Ramadan began on February 1 of that year.|$|E
