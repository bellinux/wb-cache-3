40|$|Normally, mice {{have two}} populations of lymphocytes; one is {{long-lived}} thymus dependent, recirculates, occupies the paracortical region of lymph nodes, bears 0 -antigen, and participates in cell-mediated immunity; {{the other is}} short-lived, tends to be sessile, occupies the primary follicles of lymph nodes, and can be induced to secrete humoral antibody (1). Both cell types arise from hematopoietic precursors: fetal liver or bone marrow (1, 2). In {{the absence of a}} thymus, the normal, rapid differentiation of the long-lived recirculating lymphocyte fails to take place (3). Presumably the thymic epithelial cells induce this normal differentiation (4). Whether this induction requires cell-to-cell contact or whether some other mechanism is involved is still debatable. Mice homozygous for the mutation nude (5) lack thymocytes (6) and thymus-derived cells (7 - 9) and thus may have a defect of either the hematopoietic precursors of thymocytes or of thymic epithelium.

5000|$|The {{later date}} would place Obadiah as a {{contemporary}} {{of the prophet}} Jeremiah, {{both of whom were}} prophets in the respective time periods. A sixth-century date for Obadiah is a [...] "near consensus" [...] position among scholars. Obadiah 1-9 contains parallels to Jeremiah 49:7-22. The passage in Jeremiah dates from the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (604 BC), and therefore Obadiah 11-14 seems to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadrezzar II (586 BC). It is more likely that Obadiah and Jeremiah together were drawing on a common source presently unknown to us than Jeremiah drawing on previous writings of Obadiah as his source. There is also much material found in Obadiah 10-21 which Jeremiah does not quote, and which, had he had it laid out before him, would have suited his purpose admirably. Despite everything, however, there are some who support both dates and even some who support dates other than the <b>two</b> <b>major</b> <b>possibilities</b> presented. Any date for the composition of Obadiah must be held tentatively.|$|R

40|$|The {{class of}} {{mammalian}} lymphocytes {{equivalent to the}} bursa-derived (B) 1 lymphocytes of birds may be identified {{by the presence of}} large amounts of immunoglobulin (Ig) on the surface of most of these cells (1, 2). In addition, many of these B lymphocytes, but not thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes, bear a surface receptor for an activated component of C 3 allowing them to bind antigen-antibody-complement complexes (3). These cells are referred to as complement receptor lymphocytes (CRL). Although no functional role for the C receptor of B lymphocytes has yet been established, at least <b>two</b> <b>major</b> <b>possibilities</b> have been suggested. Firstly, the C receptor by binding antigen-antibody-complement complexes may serve as an antigen concentrating mechanism and thus increase the likelihood that antigens would interact with with specific receptors on the surface of immunocompetent B lymphocytes and then activate these cells (4). Alternatively, it has been proposed that B-lymphocyte activation requires the interaction of that cell both with specific antigen and with another ligand leading to the generation of two signals within the cell.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>two</b> <b>major</b> <b>possibilities</b> for {{the striking}} loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength {{that occurs in}} very old animals and humans. It is concluded that muscle regeneration is not significantly impaired with age. Instead, it seems that individual myofibres undergo atrophy, with selective death of the fast type 2 B myofibres, due to the combined effects of many age-related changes the main causes being: nutrition (under-nutrition and lack of vitamin D), decreased hormone levels (e. g growth hormone, testosterone), reduced physical activity, {{and a loss of}} nerves that innervate the muscles. The discussion focusses on the central role of a local muscle form of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in muscle hypertrophy, atrophy and motorneurone loss. Reduced IGF-I signalling is involved in muscle atrophy and results from decreased muscle exercise, reduced growth hormone and insulin levels, reduced vitamin D, and treatment with drugs like corticosteroids, dexamethasone, and cyclosporin. In addition, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL- 6 can cause muscle wasting (cachexia) although this is usually associated with disease, and TNF-α may also act (at least in part) by inhibiting IGF-I signalling. The possible clinical prevention of age-related muscle wasting (and associated motorneurone loss) by the locally acting muscle isoform of IGF-I is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{extent of}} the {{expressed}} T helper cell repertoire {{is a result of}} many factors, including the quality of the initial gene pool of variable gene segments that comprise the receptor, the nature of the Ia molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), ~ and regulatory influences that either expand or delete its potential members. For T cell responses directed towards protein antigens, two extreme modes of response may be envisaged, one in which single T cell clones react at many sites along the molecule, the second in which very few sites of reactivity exist. Analysis of the specificity of the responses induced to several defined protein antigens (1), including those distantly related to self, has suggested that severe limitations exist in the choice of antigenic determinants. For example, T cells specific for the C-terminal peptide (amino acid residues 106 - 129) of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) have not been observed in H- 2 b mice (2, 3). Since H- 2 congenic mice strains (B 10. A and B 10. D 2) do respond to this region, the choice of reactivity is clearly dependent upon the MHC (4, 5). It has been difficult to choose between the <b>two</b> <b>major</b> <b>possibilities</b> that may account for this limitation. Strong arguments (6) have been advanced in favor of MHC-determined gaps in the available peripheral repertoire, as well as for determinant selection mechanisms of antigen presentation necessary for T cell activation. It is possible that a specific interaction is necessary between a site(s) on the Ia molecule and another discrete, haplotype-specific site of perhaps three or four amino acids on the nominal antigen (7, 8). When regions on an antigen are encountered that seem unable to induce T cells in a particular MH...|$|R
40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is {{the gateway to}} the secretory pathway in all eukaryotic cells. Its products subsequently pass through the Golgi apparatus {{on the way to}} the cell surface (true secretion) or to the lytic compartment of the cell (vacuolar protein transport). In animal cells, the Golgi apparatus is present as a stationary larger order complex near the nucleus, and transport between the cortical ER and the Golgi complex occurs via an intermediate compartment which is transported on microtubules. By contrast, higher plant cells have discrete mobile Golgi stacks that move along the cortical ER, and the intermediate compartment is absent. Although many of the major molecular players involved in ER-Golgi trafficking in mammalian and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells have homologs in higher plants, the narrow interface (less than 500 nm) between the Golgi and the ER, together with the motility factor, makes the identification of the transport vectors responsible for bidirectional traffic between these two organelles much more difficult. Over the years, a controversy has arisen over the <b>two</b> <b>major</b> <b>possibilities</b> by which transfer can occur: through vesicles or direct tubular connections. In this article, four leading plant cell biologists attempted to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, their opinions are so divergent and often opposing that it was not possible to reach a consensus. Thus, we decided to let each tell his or her version individually. The review begins with an article by Federica Brandizzi that provides the necessary molecular background on coat protein complexes in relation to the so-called secretory units model for ER-Golgi transport in highly vacuolated plant cells. The second article, written by Chris Hawes, presents the evidence in favor of tubules. It is followed by an article from David Robinson defending the classical notion that transport occurs via vesicles. The last article, by Akihiko Nakano, introduces the reader to possible alternatives to vesicles or tubules, which are now emerging as a result of exciting new developments in high-resolution light microscopy in yeast...|$|R

40|$|The {{orientation}} of the principal stress axes within deformation zones between two mobile plates is modeled here analytically, using a thin-plate theory. The simple analytical approach helps to explain why plates cease to move after collision. Orogenic periods last only several tens of million years because the stress associated with a particular constant driving force (causing a constant strain rate) is {{no longer able to}} maintain a significant horizontal displacement. In contrast, the uplift rate increases rapidly as the horizontal velocity decreases, and this may explain why the termination of orogenic epochs are usually heralded by the rapid deposition of thick sequences of immature sedimentary rocks or flysch. The analytical model also elaborates the relationship between homogeneous bulk deformations driven by a constant stress orientation and those due to a fixed displacement direction of physical boundaries of the deformation zone. <b>Two</b> <b>major</b> kinematic <b>possibilities</b> are considered: (1) plates converging either orthogonally or obliquely, making the deformation zone an analogue for orogenic collision; and (2) plates diverging either orthogonally or obliquely, so that the deformation zone is dynamically similar to initiating rift basins. The theoretical investigation led to the formulation of the following rules. Deformation zones between converging plates have the major axis of bulk deviatoric stress coinciding with the bisector of the acute angle between the relative plate velocity vector and the normal to the deformation-zone boundary. In case of extension within a deformation or rift zone separating diverging plates, th...|$|R

40|$|The Batain coast area {{in eastern}} Oman is {{dominated}} by allochthonous Permian to Late Maastrichtian sedimentary and volcanic rocks (Batain Group), unconformably overlain by neoautochthonous Tertiary sediments. The allochthonous rocks of the Batain coast were previously attributed to the Hawasina complex, the Permian to Coniacian/Santonian sedimentary infill of the neo-Tethyan Hawasina basin off northern Oman. Previous structural interpretations suggested that the Batain Group, along with the Hawasina complex and the Semail ophiolite, was obducted in the Coniacian to Campanian from NE to SW onto the northern Oman continental margin. Results of our work in the Batain area differ from previous interpretations, with most significant differences concerning timing and direction of obduction. Our results show that WNW directed tectonic movements formed a fold-and-thrust belt {{and led to the}} obduction of allochthonous rocks onto the east Oman continental margin during latest Maastrichtian/earliest Paleocene times. This is coeval with emplacement of ophiolitic fragments along the eastern coast of Oman (eastern ophiolite belt) but is about 15 - 20 Myr later than emplacement of Hawasina complex and Semail ophiolite in northern Oman. Postemplacement structural evolution during the Tertiary involved intraplate extension, possibly reflecting the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden opening, and late Tertiary shortening related to convergence between Arabia and Eurasia. Late Tertiary contractional deformation resulted in refolding of the Batain nappes and in folding of the overlying Tertiary sediments. A palinspastic reconstruction of the Batain area indicates that the Permian to Upper Cretaceous sediments were formerly deposited in the Batain basin, a part of the proto-Indian Ocean, along the present-day eastern Oman margin. This leads us to propose that Permian breakup of Gondwanaland created both continental margins of Oman and led to the <b>opening</b> of <b>two</b> <b>major</b> basins: the neo-Tethyan Hawasina basin in the north and the proto-Indian Ocean Batain basin in the east, the latter separating Arabia from greater India...|$|R
