5|$|From the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Log</b> Revolution {{and the end}} of April 1991, nearly 200 incidents involving the use of explosive devices and 89 attacks on the Croatian police were recorded. The Croatian Ministry of the Interior started arming an increasing number of special police forces, and this led to the building of a real army. On 9 April 1991, Croatian President Tuđman ordered the special police forces to be renamed Zbor Narodne Garde ("National Guard"); this marks the creation of a separate military of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|German {{scholar and}} folklorist Wilhelm Mannhardt {{holds that the}} log {{represented}} an incarnation {{of the spirit of}} vegetation. The sacrifices offered to the badnjak were meant to guarantee the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. Its burning symbolized sunshine, and was intended to secure the vitalizing power of the sun in the ensuing year. The lighting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>log</b> could be regarded as a fusion of tree worship and fire worship, attested in Slavic customs; e.g., Istrians fed the logs lighted on St. John's Day by sprinkling wheat upon them. Čajkanović characterizes the pre-Christian badnjak as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, comparing it in this respect with Attis, Osiris, Adonis, and Sandan. He also proposes that the crosses made from the thicker end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>log</b> may have originated from idols representing deities comparable with the Roman Lares, the cruciform having developed from an anthropomorphic shape of the idols. The badnjak is preferably cut from an oak, which was the most respected tree in the old Slavic religion, associated with the supreme god Perun.|$|E
5|$|The badnjak {{should not}} be jumped over or trodden upon, and blowing on its fire is avoided. It {{should not be}} moved when about to burn through, lest the log break at the place most {{consumed}} by the fire, which is usually strongest {{at the center of}} the fireplace; the separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>log</b> should be a result of the fire only. None of the family members should fall asleep before the log splits, otherwise some of them may die in the coming year, without warning.|$|E
50|$|Log jams were {{recorded}} near the bridge {{that connects the}} island to the mainland in 2010 and again in 2013. These caused trouble for local boaters whose docking space was diminished by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>logs.</b> <b>The</b> City <b>of</b> Saint Paul funded removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> in both instances.|$|R

50|$|The furnace used {{a forced}} and {{induced draft fan}} to draw {{combustion}} air and exhaust gases through the combustion chamber at 1/3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> sound (100 m/s+). The wood was loaded into a vertical tube which passed through the water jacket into a refractory lined combustion chamber. In this chamber the burning took place and was limited to <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>logs.</b> <b>The</b> water jacket prevented <b>the</b> upper parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> from burning so they would gravity feed as <b>the</b> <b>log</b> was consumed.|$|R
5|$|The dugouts {{were created}} by Algonquian peoples who were {{seasonal}} visitors to the area. They built them from the logs of cypress by slowing burning out the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>log</b> and scraping the burnt wood out, leaving only the outer shell. Historians believe that the Algonquian would sink their canoes {{to the bottom of}} the lake for safekeeping until they would return the following fishing and hunting season. Thirty of these ancient canoes have been found in Lake Phelps, with perhaps more yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans was a {{guest in}} a Serbian highlander family {{in the region of}} Krivošije, Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he {{concluded}} that the badnjak customs were connected with ancestor worship. The lighting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>log</b> on the ognjište could be seen as a solemn annual rekindling of the sacred hearth fire, regarded as the center of the family life and the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic hearth was attested among Slavic and other peoples. Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. A trace of sacrifice to the fire is the coin thrown into it by the polaznik after the ritual of making sparks fly from the badnjak.|$|E
5|$|The thicker end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>log,</b> the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{affinity}} of an antagonist for its {{binding site}} (Ki), i.e. {{its ability to}} bind to a receptor, will determine the duration of inhibition of agonist activity. The affinity of an antagonist can be determined experimentally using Schild regression or for competitive antagonists in radioligand binding studies using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Schild regression {{can be used to}} determine the nature of antagonism as beginning either competitive or non-competitive and Ki determination is independent of the affinity, efficacy or concentration of the agonist used. However, it is important that equilibrium has been reached. The effects of receptor desensitization on reaching equilibrium must also be taken into account. The affinity constant of antagonists exhibiting two or more effects, such as in competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents that also block ion channels as well as antagonising agonist binding, cannot be analyzed using Schild regression. Schild regression involves comparing the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 {{in the presence of a}} competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve. Altering the amount of antagonist used in the assay can alter the dose ratio. In Schild regression, a plot is made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>log</b> (dose ratio-1) versus the log concentration of antagonist for a range of antagonist concentrations. The affinity or Ki is where the line cuts the x-axis on the regression plot. Whereas, with Schild regression, antagonist concentration is varied in experiments used to derive Ki values from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, agonist concentrations are varied. Affinity for competitive agonists and antagonists is related by the Cheng-Prusoff factor used to calculate the Ki (affinity constant for an antagonist) from the shift in IC50 that occurs during competitive inhibition. The Cheng-Prusoff factor takes into account the effect of altering agonist concentration and agonist affinity for the receptor on inhibition produced by competitive antagonists.|$|E

25|$|The Tennessee Supreme Court {{observed}} it {{is essential}} in cases of trover, that the property must be found; it must {{at the time when}} the finder came upon it, to have been in such a situation as to clearly indicate that it was lost. It cannot have been placed there by the original owner who lost it by carelessness or forgetfulness, where it was later found by someone else. In such cases, the owner of the premises where the property is found is treated as a quasi-bailee (i.e. he holds the property for the original owner), and he may maintain trover against the finder. Since the log was not intentionally laid by the (unknown) owner on the land of the plaintiff (Deaderick), and hence he was not a quasi-bailee for the owner, he cannot hold against the superior right of the defendant (Oulds) arising out of his prior possession and earlier finding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>log.</b> Judgment for ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>log</b> was to the defendant Oulds.|$|E

25|$|In a 1982 {{series of}} {{articles}} for New Scientist, Maurice Burton proposed that sightings of Nessie and similar creatures may be fermenting Scots pine logs rising {{to the surface of}} the loch. A decomposing log could not initially release gases caused by decay because of its high resin level. Gas pressure would eventually rupture a resin seal at one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>log,</b> propelling it through the water (sometimes to the surface). According to Burton, the shape of tree logs (with their branch stumps) closely resembles descriptions of the monster.|$|E

The tinder is lit, and the kindling is allowed to catch fire. When it is burning briskly, it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder, and the larger kindling is placed over <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>logs.</b> When that is burning well, it is also pushed down. Eventually, a pile of kindling burns between two pieces of fuel wood, and soon <b>the</b> <b>logs</b> catch fire from it.|$|R

25|$|Among the Tanala it is {{traditional}} {{to keep the}} body of a deceased individual for a month or more; the dead are then buried in the forest in coffins carved from large logs, with sacrifices to mark the cutting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>log</b> and indications carved into a tree to indicate the location of the burial. In certain Tanala communities, bodies are buried in a tomb, while among others, they are placed inside huts in a designated part of the forest, which is thereafter considered sacred and forbidden to visit.|$|E
