Methods. A total of 240 women participated in this cross-sectional study. Of these, 125 had fibromyalgia. Several variables were assessed: age, fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> from 0 to 100, number <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> body composition, balance performance, lower limb strength, health-related quality of life, and impact of fibromyalgia. Results. Women with fibromyalgia reported more falls and more fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was associated with number <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in the last year, stiffness, perceived balance problems, impact of FM, and HRQoL whereas the number <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> was related to fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> balance performance with eyes closed, pain, tenderness to touch level, anxiety, self-reported balance problems, impact of FM, and HRQoL.

Design: The study used a qualitative design to describe the lived experiences of community-dwelling older adults with the fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted individually with six participants who reported the fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Results: Five main areas emerged from data analysis: development of the fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> feared consequences <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> activities curtailment, fall prevention behavior and meaning of social support in daily life. The fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was described as a negative experience, directly linked to fall consequences such as physical injury, incapacitation, loss of autonomy, fear of dependence and experience of humiliating conditions. To maintain a certain level of independence in daily life, the participants chose to avoid falls by activity curtailment, organizing their lives more carefully and getting support from others.

40|$|Although fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> is {{a common}} and serious problem among elderly people, {{little is known about}} the risk factors {{associated}} with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> among frail elderly persons in Japan. To assess the fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and investigate related factors, we conducted a study among 167 Japanese women aged 59 or older, who were receiving visiting nursing services. Fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was measured by asking subjects about being afraid <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> (yes/no) and completing the Japanese version <b>of</b> <b>Falls</b> Efficacy Scale (FES). Fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> (being afraid <b>of</b> <b>falling)</b> was reported by 135 (80. 8 %) of the subjects. The overall FES score was significantly (p< 0. 01) lower in subjects who reported fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> (mean± standard deviation= 19. 8 ± 5. 5) than in those who did not (26. 1 ± 7. 2).

5|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} these theories (excepting that of Preston) {{is given in}} Jurens's 1987 article.

In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating Hoods deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> of Bismarcks 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14°, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of Hood show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated, if Hood had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.|$|E

Aliterature search of medical databases was conducted to identify articles that address the fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and multifactorial programs as either a primary or secondary component of their findings. Multifactorialinterventions were assessed {{in terms of their}} program content, design, demographics, implementationtechniques, and cost-effectiveness. Falls are a common, but preventable, cause of morbidity and injury inolder adults 65 and over. In addition to physiological variables, fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and self-efficacy arepsychosocial factors that impact the incidence <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in this population. Addressing fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> inaddition to physiological parameters may influence the success <b>of</b> multifactorial <b>falls</b> prevention programsfor adults 65 and over...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis pursues {{the problematic}} <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> among seniors and possibilities <b>of</b> influencing the <b>falls</b> by affecting the seniors' stability and balance. It present basic information about causes and consequence <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> among seniors and discusses possibilities <b>of</b> prevention <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> through a physiotherapy and movement. Further, it shows summary and any results {{of studies that}} aimed to influence the stability and prevention <b>of</b> the <b>falls</b> among seniors through various forms of physiotherapy. Most of these studies present the significance of balance and coordination exercises combined with resistance and endurance lokomotor training. The most frequent results of physiotherapy containing these elements are {{the improvement of the}} balance functions, the increase of muscle strength, the reduction <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and the decrease <b>of</b> anxiety <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> This bachelor thesis also includes a practical part containing casuistics of two patients at the risk <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> After eight-week therapy of balance and fitness character, there was an improvement of several parameters of functional balance tests in both cases. There was also a questionnaire inquiry focused on the frequency <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> among seniors. There is a positive effect on the reduction <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> among seniors figuring from the results...|$|R
40|$|Fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> foot pain, {{impairment}} and disability are commonly reported in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, {{the relationship between}} fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and foot pain, {{impairment and}} disability has not been investigated in established RA. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the relationship between fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and foot pain, walking velocity and foot impairment and disability in women with established RA. A secondary aim was to evaluate differences between fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> foot pain, walking velocity and foot impairment and disability in women with established RA and age- and sex-matched control participants. Twenty-one women with established RA and twenty-one age- and sex-matched controls were assessed for fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> foot pain, foot impairment and disability and walking velocity. Pearson’s r-correlations were used to examine relationships between fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and the foot measures. Independent samples t tests evaluated the differences in fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and foot measures between the two groups. In people with RA, significant correlations were found between fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and foot impairment (r[*]=[*] 0. 53, p[*]=[*] 0. 015), foot disability (r[*]=[*] 0. 77, p < 0. 001) and walking velocity (r[*]=[*] 0. 56, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). No correlation was found between fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and foot pain (r[*]=[*] 0. 36; p[*]=[*] 0. 11). Significant differences between cases and control participants were found between fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 001), foot impairment (p[*]=[*] 0. 004) and foot disability (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Foot impairment and disability relates to fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> in women with established RA. A better understanding <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> in people with established RA may contribute to more efficient falls assessments in order to identify at risk individuals...|$|R
