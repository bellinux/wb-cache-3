40|$|International audienceThe {{magnetic}} {{properties of the}} layered Banþ 1 ConO 3 n- 1 Br (n= 5 and 6) <b>oxybromides</b> have been determined by means of magnetization measurements and neutron diffraction under variable magnetic field. For n= 6, the magnetic phase diagram has been built {{on the basis of}} several features, including the notions of short-range ordering, spin reorientation, and spin-flop transitions. In those compounds, the competition between magnetic exchanges arise from the existence of [Ba 2 O 2 Br]- double-layers that separate perovskite 2 D-blocks. The latter are dominated by ferromagnetic (FM) intraexchanges while the interblock exchanges are antiferromagnetic (AFM). Interestingly, a perturbation created by an external magnetic field could be on the same order of magnitude than the interblock exchange leading to a complex set of spin reorientations versus H and T. From {{the point of view of}} magneto-crystalline anisotropy, theAFMsystem with moments parallel to the c-axis turns into a FM system with moments aligned in the perpendicular (a,b) planes.

Co-pyrolysis of BFRs with hematite (Fe 2 O 3) represents a viable option for the thermal recycling of BFRs. Consensus of experimental findings confirms the superior bromine fixation ability of Fe 2 O 3 and the subsequent formation of iron bromides. This contribution provides a comprehensive mechanistic account of the primary reactions between a cluster model of Fe 2 O 3 and major bromine-bearing products from the decomposition of TBBA, the most commonly deployed BFR. We estimate the thermo-kinetic parameters for interactions of Fe 2 O 3 with HBr, brominated alkanes and alkenes, bromobenzene and bromophenol. Dissociative addition of HBr at a Fe-O bond proceeds through a trivial barrier of 8. 2 kcal/mol with a fitted Arrhenius parameters of k(T) = 7. 96 × 1011 exp(- 6 400 /RT) s- 1. The facile and irreversible nature for HBr addition to Fe 2 O 3 accords with the experimentally-reported 90 % reduction in HBr emission when Fe 2 O 3 interacts with TBBA pyrolysates. A detailed kinetic analysis indicates that, transformation of Fe 2 O 3 into iron bromides and <b>oxybromides</b> occurs via successive addition of HBr to Fe(Br) -O(H) entities. Elimination of a water molecule proceeds through an intramolecular H transfer. A direct elimination one-step mechanism operates in the dehydrohalogentation of bromoethane into ethene over Fe 2 O 3. Dissociative decomposition and direct elimination channels assume comparable reaction rates in formation of acetylene from vinyl bromide.

5000|$|A Coronial inquest {{into the}} deaths of the {{accident}} victims and adequacy of the ATSB investigation began in July 2002. South Australian Coroner Wayne Chivell delivered his findings on 24 July 2003, exonerating the pilot overturning the ATSB's conclusions. The conduct of the ATSB during the inquiry was described by the court as [...] "uncooperative and defensive" [...] after reviewing scientific evidence which contradicted the report, indicating that the initial failure occurred in one of the cylinders in the right engine as a result of overheating that may have been exacerbated by the presence of lead <b>oxybromide</b> deposits. The engine however would have continued operating at a reduced power, affecting the pilot's decision to continue to Whyalla. The Coroner found the failure of the left engine was caused by a metallurgic defect, present in the broken crankshaft since its manufacture, hence the failures were independent of each other. The inquest was critical that the ATSB had not taken into account as many as 15 similar engine failures leading to Textron Lycoming's recall, including two that occurred in Australia after the accident. Just days before the report was released in December 2001, the Bureau was notified of an incident involving a Sharp Airlines Piper Chieftain which suffered a broken crankshaft in one of its engines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{findings}} of the report were disputed {{by many in the}} aviation industry, in particular the emphasis on lead <b>oxybromide</b> deposits formed {{as a result of the}} engines running at high temperatures due to the company's fuel saving policies. The report attributed these deposits as the cause of detonation within the cylinder head which blew a hole in the right engine, although the validity of this finding was disputed outside of the Bureau. Commentators in the United States where the aircraft was manufactured weighed in to the controversy. John Deakin, a highly experienced pilot and writer for US aviation news website AVweb raised further questions. Deakin pointed out that one month after the report was published, engine manufacturer Textron Lycoming notified operators of the same model fitted to flight 904 of a recall to address defective crankshafts, and provided a number of plausible scenarios leading to engine failures which were overlooked by the investigation. With a lack of corroborating evidence other than the ATSB's own research, Deakin labeled the findings as [...] "junk science".

Here, a facile chemical precipitation process was used to synthesize tetragonal BiOBr with a predominance of either { 001 } or { 010 } exposed crystal facets. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that BiOBr particles dominated by the { 010 } facet possessed a large plate-like morphology while the { 001 }-dominated BiOBr comprised smaller, more irregular particles. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra and Mott-Schottky analysis highlighted a difference in electronic band structure of the two materials; BiOBr- 010 possessed a valence band potential and a band-gap of 2. 71 and 2. 95 eV versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively, while BOBr- 001 exhibited values of 2. 63 and 3. 15 eV versus NHE, respectively. BiOBr- 010 displayed a better photo-oxidative capability than BOBr- 001 for both water oxidation and formic acid degradation (aqueous phase).

The new Ag 3 PO 4 /BiOBr heterojunctions exhibited wide absorption in the visible-light region and compared to pure BiOBr and Ag 3 PO 4 samples displayed exceptionally high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of typical organic pollutants such as Rhodamine B (RhB) and phenol. The optimal Ag/Bi weight ratio in Ag 3 PO 4 /BiOBr microsphere (AB 7) {{was found to be}} 0. 7. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was related to the efficient separation of electron-hole pairs derived from matching band potentials between BiOBr and Ag 3 PO 4 which results into the generation of natural energy bias at heterojunction and subsequent transfer of photoinduced charge carriers. Moreover, the synthesized samples exhibited almost no loss of activity even after 6 recycling runs indicating their high photocatalytic stability.

Short-lived isotopes of Zr, Hf, Rf, Nb, Ta, Ha, W, and Bi were produced via compound nucleus reactions at the 88 -Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and transported to the experimental apparatus using a He gas transport system. The isotopes were halogenated, separated from the other reaction products, and their volatilities determined by isothermal gas phase chromatography. Adsorption Enthalpy ({Delta}H{sub a}) values for these compounds were calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation program modeling the gas phase chromatography column. All bromides showed lower volatility than molecules of similar molecular structures formed as chlorides, but followed similar trends by central element. Tantalum was observed to form the <b>oxybromide,</b> analogous to the formation of the oxychloride under the same conditions.

A synthetic route to the pentacyclic structure (VII}) is proposed. The tetracyclic precursor (VI) of this this to be obtained by alkylation of 10 -carbethoxy- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ 1 (9) -octalin- 2 -one (V) with the methylene bromide (IV, R=H or OH). A possible route for {{the preparation of this}} bromide is outlined (I-IV); this involves the degradation of the aromatic ring of the tricyclic ketone (II) to give the keto-acid (III). As the first stage of this synthesis, the tricyclic unsaturated ketone (I) has been prepared. Attempts to prepare 2, 6 -dihydroxynaphthalene as a possible source of 6 -methoxy- 1 -methyl- 2 -tetralone, by fusing sodium 2 -hydroxynaphthalene- 6 -sulphonate with alkali, failed. Reduction of 6 -methoxynaphthalene using Raney nickel in acidic solution gave, among other products, 6 -methoxytetralin which was oxidised to 6 -methoxy- 1 -tetralone. The latter reacted with methyl magnesium iodide to give a tertiary alcohol which, in the presence of acids, gave the expected 6 -methoxy- 1 -methyl- 3, 4 -dihydronaphthalene, together with 6 -methoxy- 1 -methylnaphthalene and 6 -methoxy- 1 -methyl-tetralin, the products of its own dismutation, as reported by Jacques and Kagan. A possible mechanism for this disputation is proposed, and the effects of the conditions of dehydration on this reaction are studied. The dihydronaphthalene, when treated with lead tetra-acetate, gave a diacetate which rearranged in low yield under strongly acid conditions to 6 -methoxy- 1 -methyl- 2 -tetralone. Ring extension of this tetralone gave the tricyclic ketone (I). Alternative methods for the preparation of 6 -methoxy- 1 -methyl- 2 -teralone were investigated. Reaction of 6 -methoxy- 1 -methyl- 3, 4 -dihydronaphthalene with perbenzoic acid gave, not the epoxide, but a hydroxy-benzoate which was also rearranged to the required tetralone, although the yield obtained by Howell and Taylor could not be repeated. The crystalline material isolated in low yield from the product of the peracid treatment was formulated as 1 -benzoyloxy- 2 -hydroxy- 6 -methoxy- 1 -methyltetralin; reasons for this formulation are discussed. Treatment of the dihydronaphthalene with formic acid gave an &alpha-ketol from which 6 -methoxy- 1 -methyl- 2 -teralone could not be obtained. Attempts to prepare this tetralone from 2 -benzal- 6 -methoxy- 2 -teralone were unsuccessful because 1, 4 -addition products appeared to be formed in the Grignard reaction. Anti-Markownikoff hydration of 6 -methoxy- 1 -methyl- 3, 4 -dihydronaphthalene under the Brown conditions gave a product which the results of subsequent oxidation suggested to be a mixture of 6 -methoxy- 1 -methyl- 2 - and 4 -tetralols. The publication of a synthetic route very similar to that adopted in the present work resulted in the work being suspended. 5 -(2 ′-Bromoethyl) - 6 -methylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl- trans -decalin was prepared by a route developed by Rushton. Oxidation of of sclareol with potassium permanganate gave the enol ether (VIII) which, after ozonolysis and reduction with lithium aluminium hydride, afforded the glycol (IX). The required bromide was obtained by treating the last with phosphorus <b>oxybromide.</b> 10 -Carbethoxy- 7, 7,-dimethyl-Δ 1 (9) -octalin- 2 -one, containing the potential D and E rings of the pentacyclic ststem, was synthesised from dimedone. The enol chloride derived from dimedone was reduced with lithium in liquid ammonia (30 % yield) and by catalytic hydrogenation (50 - 70 %) to 3, 3 -dimethylcyclohexanone, which was carbethoxylated to 2 -carbethoxy- 5, 5 -dimethylcyclohexanone. The required octalone was produced in nearly quantitative yield from this compound by ring extension. The products of catalytic and lithium-ammonia reduction of the octalone were compared. Resolutoon of the octalone was not possible when its menthhydrazone was used, but was at least partly achieved by the use of the (-) brucine salt of the p -carboxyphenyl-hydrazone, although the yield was poor and the method laborious. Conditions for alkylating the octalone without decomposition were defined in model experiments using n-propyl iodide. To obtain even small quantities of tetracyclic material under suoh conditions it was necessary to employ the iodo-derivative (IV, R=H, X=I), which is more reactive than the corresponding bromo-compound. The latter reacted if diglyme was used as the solvent, as suggested by Zook. In this reaction both the iodo- and the bromo-compounds gave two tetracyclic products; the possibility that they are the two enantiomorphs of the ketone (VI) is discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{various groups}} {{into which the}} triterpenes are divided are defined and {{emphasis}} is placed on the structural relationships which exist between these groups. A brief description is given of the methods used in the determination of the structure of triterpenes with particular reference to β-asyrin (I), a member of the oleanane (II) group. Recent progressin the problems of biogenesis and the total synthesis of triterpenes is reviewed. All approaches, so far investigated, to the synthesis of pentacyclic triterpenes involve the fusion of two bicyclic moities representing rings A and B and rings D and E of the proposed structure. This thesis describes attempts to synthesise pentacyclic triterpenes of the oleanane (II) group, via the tetracyclic-cis-ketone (IIIa), the tetracyclic-trans-ketone (IIIc) or the tetracyclic-αβ-unsaturated-ketone (IVa). The important bicylic intermediates in these syntheses are 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans-decaline(Va), 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-cis-decal- 2 -one (VI) and 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII); the preparation of the last two compounds has been reported previously by Halsall and Thomas. It was proposed originally to obtain the racemic modification of 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -tri- methyl-trans-decalin from Δ-podocarpen- 7 -one (VIII), the synthesis of which requires large amounts of 2, 2, 6 -trimethyl- cyclohexanone. A rapid technique was developed for the preparation of this compound in high yield from 2 -methylcyclo- hexanone. The availability of sclareol (IX), which is a suitable relay in the synthesis of (+) - 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 - exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans-decalin (Va) led to the abandonment of the route via Δ-podocarpen- 7 -one. Oxidation of sclareol with potassium permaganate gave the enol-ether (X). Ozonolysis of the enol-ether (X), followed by decomposition of the Oozonide (XI) with Raney nickel and reduction of the product with lithium aluminium hydride gave a mixture of 5 -(2 '-hydroxyethyl) - 6 -hydroxy- 1, 1, 6, 10 - tetramethyl-trans-decalin (XII) and 5 -(2 '-hydroxyethyl) - 6 - exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans-decalin (Vb). Treatment of either of these compounds with phosphorus <b>oxybromide</b> in pyridine gave (+) - 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans- decalin (Va), from which ambreinolide (XXIII) was prepared. The crude product, obtained after decomposing the ozonide (XI) with Raney nickel, was reduced with sodium borohydride but only small yields of compounds, which could be characterised were obtained. These were 5 -(2 '-hydroxyethyl- 6 -acetoxy- 1, 1, 6, 10 -tetramethyl-trans-decalin, 5 -carboxymethyl- 6 -acetoxy- 1 - 1 - 6 - 10 -tetramethyl-trans-decalin and the lactone derived from 5 -carboxymethyl- 6 -hydroxy- 1, 1, 6,, 10 -tetramethyl- trans-decaline. The first two of these compounds were obtained also by catalytic hydrogenation of the ozonide (XI); the lactone was the only compound isolated from the product obtained by oxidising the enol-ether (X) with sodium metaperiodate/ osmium tetroxide. It has been predicted on theoretical grounds that that 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-cis-decal- 2 -one (VI) should enolise towards C - 3. Alkylation of this compound with ethyl iodide gave 3 -ethyl- 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-cis-decal- 2 -one, from which a mixture of 3 -ethyl- 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-cis-octal- 2 -one and 3 -ethyl- 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one was obtained by brominating and dehydrobrominating. 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl— cis-decal- 2 -one (VI) was brominated in several ways and the crude product was dehydrobrominated to give, in all cases, a mixture of 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-cis-octal- 2 -one and 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one. The implications from the results of the alkylation and bromination/dehydrobromination experiments are discussed. Alkynation of (±) - 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII) with (+) - 5 -(2 -bromoethyl) — 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl- trans-decalin (Va) gave a mixture of the tetracyclic-αβ-unsaurated ketones (IVa and b). A second product was obtained from this alkylaqtion and may be a mixture of the isomeric tetracyclic-βδ-unsaturated- ketones (XIIIa and b). The tetracyclic-αβ-unstaurated- ketones (IVa and b) were reduced with lithium in liquid ammonia to give the tetracyclic-trans-ketones (IIIc and d) this mixture was resolved. The C, 30 -alcohols (XIVa and/or b) were prepared from the tetracylic-trans-ketones (IIIc and/or d) and lithium methyl, and they were treated with boron trifluoride etherate. A hydrocarbon (or mixture of hydrocarbons } was obtained and was stable to further treatment with acid. Possible products of this series of reactions are oleon- 18 -ene (IV) and 18 βH-olean- 12 —one (XVI); neither of these compounds was isolated. The tetracyclic-hydrocarbons (XVIIa and b) were obtained by treating the tetracyclic-αβ-unsaturated-ketones (IVa and b) with methyl magnesium iodide. Spectroscopic analysis of the product obtained by treating the tetracyclic- hydrocarbons (XVIIa and b) with boron trifluoride etherate, fluoroboric acid or aluminium trichloride in nitromethane indicated that the yields of olean- 11 (12), 13 (18) -diene (XVIII) (one of the expected products of this series of reactions) was greater than that obtained from the tetracyclic-allylic-alcohols (XIXa and b) by Corey and co-workers, who used acetic acid saturated with hydrogen chloride as the cyclising agent. An investigation was made into the stability of the conjugated diene system in 3 β-bezoyl-olean- 11 (12 }, 13 (18) -diene to treatment with acid. An attempt was made to prepare (+) - 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one (XX) for use in the alkynation with (+) - 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl- 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans- decalin (Va). Only partial resolution of (±) - 7, 7, 10 -tri- methyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII) was achieved using standard procedures. 10 -Carbethoxy- 7, 7,dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (XXIa) has been resolved and in the present work the racemic modification of this compound. was converted into 7, 7, 10 -tri- methyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one by two routes. It is possible therefore, to obtoin the optical isomers of 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII) by an indirect method. The carbonyl group was protected by preparing the dioxolane-derivative (XXIIa), which was reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to give 10 -hydroxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIb). In naming dioxolane derivatives in this abstract it is assumed that the double bond is in the Δ position; no evidence was obtained to confirm this. 10 -Methanesulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 - dioxolane (XXIIc) was prepared by treating 10 -hydroxymethyl- 7, 7,-dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIb) with methane sulphonyl chloride. the two routets to 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ- octal- 2 -one diverge at this stage. In the first method 10 -methanesulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 - dioxolane (XXIIc) was converted to the dioxolane-methanethiol (XXIId), which without purification, was desulphurised with hydrazine. The dioxolane protecting group was removed from the product and 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one was obtained. In the second method 10 -methanesulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIc) was converted to 10 -iodomethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIe), which was reduced with lithium aluminium hydride. The product was hydrolysed and 7, 7, 10 -trimethly-Δ-octal- 2 -one was obtained. 10 -(+) -Camphor- 10 -sulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7,-dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 - one- 2 -dioxolene (XXIIf) was prepared by treating 10 -hydroxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIb) with (+) -camphor- 10 -sulphonyl chloride; the cli? ^tei^eoiaoi for;. ^ of tlie ? f / 4 *dinltro_ ^•^. hydrfu. orue ve,-e resolved by euaiia' tion.
