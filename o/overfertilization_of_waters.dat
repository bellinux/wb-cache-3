40|$|Abstract. Most {{forests in}} North America remain {{nitrogen}} limited, although {{recent studies have}} identified forested areas that exhibit symptoms of N excess, analogous to <b>overfertilization</b> <b>of</b> arable land. Nitrogen excess in watersheds is detr imental because of disruptions in plant /soi l nutr ient relat ions, increased soil acidification and aluminum mobility, increased emissions of nitrogenous greenhouse gases from soil, reduced methane consumption in soil, decreased water quality, toxic effects on fresh-water biota, and eutrophication <b>of</b> coastal marine <b>waters.</b> Elevated nitrate (NOT) loss to groundwater or surface waters is the primary symptom of N excess. Additional symptoms include increasing N concentrations and higher N:nutrient ratios in foliage (i. e., N:Mg, N:P), foliar accumulation of amino acids or NO. :, and low soil C:N ratios. Recent nitrogen-fertilization studies in New England and Europe provide preliminary evidence that some forests receiving chronic N inputs may decline in productivit...|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, {{there was}} a {{widespread}} concern {{about the consequences of}} eutrophication but {{there was a}} lack of solid scientific evidence. Dr. W. E. Johnson of the Freshwater Institute of Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) convinced the Canadian government that unimpeachable evidence could be obtained by experimental pollution of pristine lakes through controlled <b>overfertilization</b> <b>of</b> specified elements. The Experimental Lakes Area was established in 1968 by the Fisheries Research Board of Canada. Dr. John Reubec Vallentyne and Dr. W. E. Johnson of the Freshwater Institute created the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA). While Vallentyne was Scientific Leader of the Eutrophication Section from 1966 to 1972, he attracted a stellar staff of scientists from around the world in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He recruited a junior scientist, David W. Schindler. Schindler, who would become one of the world's leading limnologists, would direct ELA projects from 1968 to 1989.|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} planning of Magnesia Prefecture is studied in this work, aiming at {{the assessment of}} the environmental quality and the determination of the most appropriate objectives and priorities, for the achievement of the highest environmental protection level in the target area. Examination of air pollution sources showed that atmospheric pollution is mainly attributed to point sources, while the contribution of diffusion sources is negligible. In Pagasitikos Gulf, seawater pollution is increased, especially in the bay of Volos, in places where treated domestic and industrial wastewaters are discharged, and intense marine activities are developed (harbor of Volos). Moreover, significant pollution results from human activities such as drainage from rural areas, discharge of raw industrial wastewaters from olive processing units, and wastes from ships navigating in the area. Other important pollution problems include fresh water salination in coastal areas, and high concentration of nitrates, related to the <b>overfertilization</b> <b>of</b> farming lands. Sources of soil pollution include domestic and stockbreeding waste landfills, and uncontrolled landfills in Pelion area and in streams of Almyros. From the current study it is evident that significant environmental problems are detected in the Prefecture, and an integrated {{environmental planning}} program has to be developed, that will promote the preservation of the biodiversity and protect the natural resources, according to the principles of sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{and iron}} (Fe) are {{essential}} nutrients for plants. Iron availability {{is low in}} calcareous soils of Iran due to the excessive amounts of CaCO 3 and high pH. <b>Overfertilization</b> <b>of</b> P fertilizers may also decrease Fe availability. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of P and Fe on the growth and chemical composition of corn (Zea mays L.) under greenhouse conditions. Treatments consisted of a factorial arrangement of P rates (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 mg kg- 1 as KH 2 PO 4) and Fe rates (0, 2. 5, 5 and 10 mg kg- 1 as Fe EDDHA) in a completely randomized design with four replications. Plants were grown for 8 weeks in a loamy soil, calssified as Chitgar series (fine-loamy, carbonatic, thermic, Typic Calcixerepts). Results showd that P application up to 80 mg kg- 1 increased corn top dry matter. Corn P concentration and total uptake increased by P application but decreased by Fe application. Application of Fe up to 5 mg kg- 1 increased dry matter but decreased it at higher rates. Concentration and total uptake of Fe increased by Fe application but decreased by P application. Zinc and copper concentrations decresed significantly when P was added. Manganese concentration increased at 40 mg P kg- 1 but decreased at higher rates. Iron application decreased zinc and manganese concentrations but had no effect on copper...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{present the}} view that in the Sudeten for fourty years paralelly {{eutrophication}} and acidification processes are taking place, {{as a result of}} industrial emissions. This view is based on results of bioindication studies on pollution and accumulation of sulphur, nitrogen and heavy metals. At the same time, after 30 years, vegetation and floristic changes were investigated on permanent plots on the Śnieżnik and in the Karkonosze Mts. In most habitats a decrease of pH over 1. 0 has been recorded, even in areas with calcium bedrock. Acid rains containing a lot of nitrates contribute to the fertilization of most of the ecosystems. The yearly fall of total nitrogen in the Sudeten ranges from 38 kg in the Karkonosze, to 59 kg/ha on the Śnieżnik, of nitrates - from 380 to 900 ppm/year, and sulphur, on the average, 1300 ppm/year in the whole Sudeten. The acidification of soil causes the inaccessibility of alcaline elements (magnesium, calcium) and mobilization of harmful for plants aluminium. <b>Overfertilization</b> <b>of</b> habitats, the lack of calcium and magnesium and the excess of aluminium cause unfavourable alterations in all phytocenoses in the Sudeten. The high mountain forests are particularly suffering, but also the high mountain vegetation and above all the subalpine swards exposed to acid rains. Examples of plant species which adapt themselves to the new ecological conditions, and mountain plants which reduce their range are given. In general, the typical mountain flora and vegetation of the Sudeten is endangered in the existing ecological conditions...|$|R
