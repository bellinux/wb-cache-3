25|$|On February 27, 1988 David Hartlaub {{was murdered}} in his van at a bank parking lot near the Musicland record store that he managed, as he was {{dropping}} off the nightly deposit. The deposit bag contained about $4000 in cash and was not taken. Three members of Hells Angels motorcycle gang; Steven Wayne Yee, Mark Verdi, and John Ray Bonds were carrying out a hit. Cleveland Hells Angels were planning to retaliate against a Sandusky Outlaw gang member for the Joliet, IL. shooting of an Hells Angels member the previous year, at which Bonds had been present. The Outlaw member drove a van almost identical to Hartlaub's. The trio mistook Hartalub's van for their enemies and shot and killed him by mistake. Both the gun and the van's carpet were spattered with blood, allowing police to use DNA evidence, and discovered that John Ray Bonds was the shooter who had hid inside Hartlaub's van and was waiting to kill him. He shot him with a MAC-11 9-mm semi-automatic pistol fitted with a homemade silencer. Bond's DNA profile analyzed by the FBI matched the bloodstains found in Yee's car and based on this {{they were able to}} use it as key evidence. This {{was one of the first}} cases of DNA being used for criminal conviction. The trial and legal wrangling lasted nearly two years and ended in long prison terms for all three Hells Angels members, who may remain in prison <b>on</b> <b>sentences</b> up to life.|$|E

His research design is based on the classification of two different levels of intonation (horizontal level and vertical level). The first experiment (at the horizontal level) is conducted to investigate three utterance types: declarative, imperative, and interrogative. In his second experiment, the investigation of sentences is conducted to view intonation but in vertical sense. 'Vertical' here means a comparative analysis of intonations of the three types of sentences by keeping the nuclear intonation constant.|$|E
25|$|Many style guides do {{not provide}} {{guidance}} <b>on</b> <b>sentence</b> spacing. In some cases, the spacing of the volume or work itself provides an indication on the recommendation for usage of sentence spacing. A lack of guidance <b>on</b> <b>sentence</b> spacing is also notable for style guides in languages which did not adopt double sentence spacing to accommodate the mechanical limitations of the typewriter, and which conform to the current convention for published work, single sentence spacing. Most language guides for languages with prescriptive guidance provided by an academy also {{do not provide}} advice <b>on</b> <b>sentence</b> spacing.|$|R
40|$|The United States v. Booker (2005) {{decision}} rendered Federal Sentencing Guidelines advisory {{rather than}} mandatory. In {{the context of}} this decision, this study examines both the direct influence of aggregate-level political, community and administrative variables <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> outcomes, and the way that such characteristics might contextualize individual-level predictors. Using multi-level regression techniques, this study examines the role of aggregate level variables <b>on</b> <b>sentence</b> length decisions across four distinct time periods. Moreover, this article also examines whether aggregate-level variables condition the effects of race/ethnicity <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> outcomes. While the direct effects of aggregate-level variables <b>on</b> <b>sentencing</b> outcomes are generally limited to political climate effects, there is evidence that political climate and other aggregate-level measures contextualize individual-level race/ethnicity effects. Future research should seek to better understand the specific mechanisms behind these relationships...|$|R

By 1973 she began to use the possessive pronoun my, making my and the possessive pronoun her the only possessive pronouns she learned. Curtiss wrote that this comprehension was not total, and was at least partially predicated on the method of testing. On another test from this time on reflexive pronouns, such as [...] "The boy is feeding himself", she got more wrong than right but did somewhat better <b>on</b> <b>sentences</b> using object pronouns, such as [...] "He is feeding him". Curtiss also recorded Genie using the word it twice, but only in sentences that were, for all practical purposes, imitative utterances.|$|E
