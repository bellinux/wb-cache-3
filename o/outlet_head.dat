40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase flow systems such as high head gated conduit flow systems and two phase pipe flow systems using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high <b>head</b> <b>outlet</b> conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, air suction occurs at air vents. In two phase flow systems, air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the air suction downstream of high head gated conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase flow systems also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase flow systems have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water. It was observed from the results that two phase flow systems were more efficient in deep ponds than in shallow ponds...|$|R

At present, controversy {{exists on the}} optimal location of the monitoring sensor. Therefore, we conducted an in vitro study to estimate the pressure gradients between the ventricle, the 'gold standard' site, and the rinsing inlet and <b>outlet.</b> Methods. A <b>head</b> model and a standard endoscope were used. Rinsing was enforced by using a pressurized infusion bag. Using clinically relevant flow rates, pressure was measured at the rinsing inlet and outlet, in the ventricle, and at the distal end of the rinsing channel using a tip sensor or a capillary tube. Results. At a flow of 61 ml min(- 1), the steady-state pressures measured at the rinsing inlet, in the ventricle, and at the rinsing outlet were 38, 26, and 12 mm Hg, respectively. At 135 ml min(- 1), these increased to 136, 89, and 42 mm Hg. Transendoscopic pressure measurements were always within 1 mm Hg of the ventricular pressure. Conclusions. During endoscopy, measurements at the rinsing inlet overestimated the ventricular pressure by similar to 50 mm Hg during heavy rinsing, whereas measurements at the rinsing outlet underestimated the pressure by similar to 50 mm Hg. An electronic tip sensor or a pressure capillary tube placed at the distal end of the lumen of the rinsing channel of the endoscope did not interfere with rinsing flow and produced measurements that were equal to ventricular pressures...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The {{hypothesis}} {{of this research}} is {{that it is possible to}} increase the drip irrigation lateral line length by using a larger spacing between emitters at the beginning of the lateral line and a smaller one after a certain distance, which would allow for a higher pressure variation along the lateral line under an acceptable value of distribution uniformity. Study Design: Non-pressure compensating drip hose is widely utilized for vegetables and orchards irrigation. Though there is a limitation, which is the lateral line length must be short to maintain uniformity due to head loss and slope, any procedure to increase the length is appropriate because it represents low initial cost of the irrigation system. Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted at the College of Agricultural Sciences of Sao Paulo State University in Botucatu, SP, during the year 2011. Methodology: To evaluate this hypothesis, a nonlinear programming model (NLP) was developed. The input data were: diameter, roughness coefficient, pressure variation, emitter operational pressure, relationship between emitter discharge and pressure. The output data were: line length, discharge and length of the each section with different spacing between drippers, total discharge in the lateral line, multiple <b>outlet</b> adjustment coefficient, <b>head</b> losses, localized head loss, pressure variation, number of emitters, spacing between emitters, discharge in each emitter, and discharge per linear meter. Results: The mathematical model developed was compared with the lateral line length obtained with the algebraic solution generated by the Darcy-Weisbach equation. The NLP model showed the best results since it generated a greater gain in the lateral line length, maintaining the uniformity and the flow variation under acceptable standards. It also had lower flow variation. Conclusion: NLP model showed the best results when compared with the conventional procedure, generating gain in the lateral line length, keeping the uniformity and flow variation under acceptable standards...|$|R

In the laboratory, each monolith was equipped with different measuring devices to monitor soil water content, bulk soil electrical conductivity (ECa), soil temperature, pressure <b>head,</b> <b>outlet</b> flux, and pH. Four unsaturated steady state experiments were carried out on each monolith using two different imposed fluxes (referred to as low and high). First a chloride breakthrough experiment was performed to identify the basic transport processes followed by sulphate breakthrough experiment for {{the identification of the}} important sulphate transport processes. Water and solute (chloride and sulphate) mass balances were made to evaluate effective sulphate transformations at the scale of the monolith. The relative water mass balance errors ranged between - 4. 0 % and 5. 0 %. The chloride mass balances were almost as good as those obtained for water, whereas the sulphate mass balance revealed that sulphate was subjected to adsorption and immobilization during the transport. The high flux sulphate experiments resulted in relatively large mass balance discrepancies compared to the low flux sulphate experiments. The sulphate breakthrough curves (BTCs) were somewhat retarded in the loamy monoliths whereas both chloride and sulphate BTCs were significantly affected by preferential flow in the sandy loam monoliths. Standard batch experiments showed that the adsorption isotherm was linear and immobilization occurred in both soils studied whereas net mineralization was essentially low. The effect of flow rate on the BTCs and influence of water content on immobilization process was not apparent. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

As economy expands and self-service chains / supermarkets business develops rapidly, Supply Chain Management (SCM) {{has become one of}} the key determinants of success against increasing competition. Effective SCM develops value-added processes that deliver innovative, high quality, low cost products on time with greater responsiveness than ever before to meet the exceptional value demanded by customers. The challenge is to implement a supply chain solution that brings maximum return on investment and efficiencies to the business. This research focused on identifying current SCM practices in Sri Lankan supermarkets, benchmarking them with global SCM best practices and recommending improvements based on demographics and business characteristics. The qualitative and quantitative benchmarking' research methodologies were adopted for the study. The convenient sample of four supermarket chains in Colombo and suburban areas were selected. In-depth interviews were conducted with various supply chain and operation management professionals in supermarket Retail <b>Outlets</b> (RO), <b>Head</b> Offices (HO) and Distribution Centers (DC) / Central Purchasing Unit (CPU). The collected data was analyzed and benchmarked against the global supermarket SCM best practices. The Supply Chain Operations Reference-model (SCOR 2) developed by Supply Chain Council was also used as the guideline for the study. It was identified that supermarkets in Sri Lanka use SCM best practices to a certain extent, however they need further improvements for, more efficient operations. Suitable best practices and strategies are recommended to the four supermarket chains covered in this study. 1 1 "Quantitative benchmarking" which has exactly measurable indicators and aims at effective measurements of the process in different implementation environments. "Qualitative benchmarking" which examines the way in which work is performed. Some trend indicators and other measures are also used but the focus is on "method" and an examination of the alternatives. In this case the input of an expert group is vital. In order to set qualitative benchmarks, it is necessary to 'know what good looks like' and set a profile of best practice with which to compare against. (DigiCult, 2006) 2 SCOR is a process reference model that has been developed and endorsed by the Supply-Chain Council as the cross-industry standard diagnostic tool for supply-chain management. It isolates key supply-chain management processes and matches their process elements against industry-specific best practices, benchmarking performance data, and appropriate software applications, providing users with a framework for understanding where they need to make improvements.

40|$|Summary The {{fission product}} Cs- 137 {{is present in}} all parts of the Norwegian environment, brought here atmospherically or by ocean currents. The most {{important}} sources are fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, discharges from nuclear fuel repossessing plants and fallout from the Chernobyl accident which have caused the presence of this radionuclide in the marine environment. The environmental presence of this radionuclide is thoroughly monitored, and the content in the Norwegian marine environment is relatively low. Earlier investigations have, however, shown elevated contents of Cs- 137 in surface sediments from a few Norwegian fjords compared to the content in surface sediments from open marine areas. The fjords with elevated contents of Cs- 137 are all connected to land areas which received relatively high amounts of fallout from the Chernobyl accident in 1986. In this work the Cs- 137 activity concentrations in 14 sediment cores from the <b>outlet</b> and the <b>head</b> of the Laksefjord and the Sognefjord, have been investigated. Using the lead- 210 dating method with correction of supported lead- 210, each one-centimeter-layer in 11 of the cores has been dated. The Cs- 137 activity concentrations in the upper sediment-layer from all 14 cores show Cs- 137 content of three different levels. In the outlet of the Sognefjord the Cs- 137 level (approximately 33 Bq/kg (d. w.)) is about 6 times above the level (approximately 5. 8 Bq/kg (d. w.)) in the Laksefjord. In the head of the Sognefjord the Cs- 137 level (approximately 293 Bq/kg (d. w.)) is about 10 times above the level in the outlet of the Sognefjord. In all cores analyzed, the Cs- 137 activity concentrations in the upper layers are highest. This indicates a continuous supply of Cs- 137 in the ocean currents or of Cs- 137 in run-off from land. There are no specific signals in the dated sediment layers indicating which of the main sources is the dominating. It is likely to believe that the Sognefjord which is much deeper than the areas outside the fjord can accumulate Cs- 137 from ocean currents and run-off. Chernobyl fallout on the land area surrounding the head of the Sognefjord is most likely the source to the elevated contents of Cs- 137 there. The Cs- 137 can be focused in the head of fjords due to the ratio between the drain-off area and the area receiving the drain-off. There are also elevated contents of Cs- 137 in some other Norwegian fjords. These fjords are also located in areas which received a large amount of Chernobyl fallout. Fjords located in areas which received a relatively moderate amount of Chernobyl fallout does not show these elevated levels...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Researchers {{frequently}} include multiple cultivars {{and fertility}} levels in field experiments. Therefore, the experiments sowing operation must represent a considerable saving {{in time and}} labor, compared to hand sowing. Greater flexibility in experimental design and setup could be achieved by equipment that enables quick changes in the cultivar and fertilizer rates from one plot to the next. A satisfactory seed drill must distribute a given quantity of seed evenly over a predetermined length of coulter row, the coulters must be spaced at exact intervals and depth of sowing must be uniform. In a self-propelled type of plot seeder, no coulter should run in a wheel track as the compaction of the soil can cause observable differences in vigor between plants in such a row and those in un-compacted rows. The machine should sow in succession from a try in which a series of seed pocket separated clearly and must be put into distributer funnel by an assistant operator. The length of gap being varied according to the nature and purpose of the plot. The objectives of this experiment were 1 - to design and construct a local self-propelled plot seeder and 2 - To compare it with the imported (Wintersteiger) plot seeder in cereal breeding programs. Materials and Methods A small-plot seeder was designed and constructed to meet this objective. The unit consists of the following basic components: a toolbar for pulling a set of six blade coulter, an air compressor for lifting and putting down the openers and metering transmission drive wheel, an operators chair and work rack, one belt seed distribution. A cone-celled and rotor seed distributor is used for seed distribution to the openers. The cone system {{is connected to the}} gearbox and allows for great flexibility in changing cultivars, crop species, and plot length. This is driven by the separate drive wheel. The cone-celled distributor sows all the seed of the sample in making one complete turn. The spinner can be equipped with a 4 or 6 <b>outlet</b> delivery <b>head,</b> depending on row spacing. The planter is fitted with hoe openers. Alternatively, spear-point openers have sometimes been used under conventional tillage systems. Seeding depth control was achieved by an adjustment screw handle. The plot seeder is being moved by a 9. 6 kW engine, and has been successfully used in applications. Field experiment established by using 4 plot length (2, 3, 4 and 6) with 4 replication by the constructed plot seeder and imported plot seeder. Crop measurements were planted height, spike m- 2, seeds/spike, Thousand kernel weight, Biological and grain yield, harvest index and drill measurements were seeding depth, uniformity of row spacing in action, seed counter performance, power requirement, slippage evenly of rows after planting. Results and Discussion Results showed that there were significant differences between the plant emergences. The emergencies were higher in plots, which planted by the new plot seeder. The differences between seed distribution of openers were insignificant, but the variances of new plot seeder and imported plot seeder were 0. 267 and 1. 05 respectively. Mean planting depth of plots planted by the Wintersteiger plot seeder was 0. 8 cm shallower than the adjusted planting depth while mean planting depth in plots planted by constructing machine had only 0. 01 cm variation. Results of variance analysis revealed that effect of treatments on wheat grain yield and yield components was significant. So that, highest grain yield (4216 kgha- 1), biological yield (8704 kgha- 1), number of spikes per square meter (649 spike), obtained from a plot which planted by constructed plot seeder. Increasing yield of treatments which planted by constructed plot seeder might be because of increasing the number of spikes per square meter in those treatments. The mean of spike per square meter in plots of new planter was 691 spikes which were 116 spike more than plots planted by imported plot seeder. Conclusions The constructed plot seeder had up to 18500 cost reduction. The seeder was able to distribute the different type of seed to the seed tubes uniformly in laboratory tests, nevertheless it is necessary to test the constructed plot seeder in field condition by using different seed type and conducting new research project. Advantages of this planter include less variation of seed fall down in different coulters, perfect planting depth control, separate wheel for adjusting planting length, minimize the slippage of planter driven wheel and proper utility in different field condition. According to effects on crop parameters the constructed plot seeder had relative priority to imported one. In addition easily accessories supply and cheaper prime cost are profit of the designed and constructed plot seeder...|$|R
