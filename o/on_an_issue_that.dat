500|$|Sporting Life {{reported}} that Hogan began the 1911 season with relatively modest expectations. [...] The paper stated, [...] "Hogan is not promising a pennant-winning team...but he does promise {{a good team}} and means to fight hard for the pennant again". [...] The team's challenges included salary limits that sharply limited its capacity to attract more experienced players. [...] Earlier that year, the Tri-State League's imposition of $1,900 limits for individual salaries had created a stir throughout Lancaster, where fans resented the fact that outgoing clubs had been permitted to vote <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> would not affect them. [...] Club president John H. Myers' efforts to persuade the league to [...] "advance the individual salary limit" [...] proved unsuccessful, and Hogan [...] "was directed to secure the best team that can be secured" [...] under the circumstances. [...] In January 1911, Hogan had announced he would [...] "cut out exhibition games and devote the entire preparatory season to hard practice". [...] Hogan added that [...] "the exhibitions do not pay the club, and do harm to the unseasoned players". [...] Ultimately, the 1911 league championship went to a franchise from Reading, Pennsylvania, which [...] "took the lead {{at the beginning of}} the season and never was headed until the finish", closing with a record of 7435.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, President George W.

Their actions have created confusion <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> requires clarity." [...] In January 2005, however, he said he would not lobby on its behalf, since too many U.S. senators thought DOMA would survive a constitutional challenge.|$|E
2500|$|In a May 2017 letter, Sessions {{personally}} asked {{congressional leaders}} {{to repeal the}} Rohrabacher–Farr amendment so that the Justice Department can prosecute providers of medical marijuana. The Rohrabacher–Farr amendment is a 2014 measure that bars the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent states [...] "from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical marijuana." [...] Sessions wrote in the letter that [...] "I believe it would be unwise for Congress to restrict {{the discretion of the}} Department to fund particular prosecutions, particularly {{in the midst of an}} historic drug epidemic and potentially long-term uptick in violent crime." [...] John Hudak of the Brookings Institution criticized the letter, stating that it was a [...] "scare tactic" [...] that [...] "should make everyone openly question whether candidate Trump's rhetoric and the White House's words on his support for medical marijuana was actually a lie to the American public <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> garners broad, bipartisan support." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 10 September 1996, Hanson {{gave her}} maiden {{speech to the}} House of Representatives, which was widely {{reported}} in the media. In her opening lines, Hanson said that [...] "I won the seat of Oxley largely <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> has resulted in me being called a racist. That issue related to my comment that Aboriginals received more benefits than non-Aboriginals". Hanson then asserted that Australia {{was in danger of}} being [...] "swamped by Asians", and that these immigrants [...] "have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate". Hanson argued that [...] "mainstream Australians" [...] were instead subject to [...] "a type of reverse racism ... by those who promote political correctness and those who control the various taxpayer funded 'industries' that flourish in our society servicing Aboriginals, multiculturalists {{and a host of other}} minority groups". This theme continued with the assertion that [...] "present governments are encouraging separatism in Australia by providing opportunities, land, moneys and facilities available only to Aboriginals". Among a series of criticisms of Aboriginal land rights, access to welfare and reconciliation, Hanson criticised the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), saying [...] "Anyone with a criminal record can, and does, hold a position with ATSIC". There then followed a short series of statements on family breakdown, youth unemployment, international debt, the Family Law Act, child support, and the privatisation of Qantas and other national enterprises. The speech also included an attack on immigration and multiculturalism, a call for the return of high-tariff protectionism, and criticism of economic rationalism. Her speech was delivered uninterrupted by her fellow parliamentarians as it was the courtesy given to MPs delivering their maiden speeches.|$|E

50|$|Conservation {{first became}} <b>a</b> {{national}} <b>issue</b> during the progressive era's conservation movement (1890s - 1920s). The early national conservation movement shifted emphasis to scientific management which favored larger enterprises and control began {{to shift from}} local governments {{to the states and}} the federal government.(Judd) Some writers credit sportsmen, hunters and fishermen with the increasing influence of the conservation movement. In the 1870s sportsman magazines such as American Sportsmen, Forest and Stream, and Field and Stream are seen as leading to the growth of the conservation movement.(Reiger) This conservation movement also urged the establishment of state and national parks and forests, wildlife refuges, and national monuments intended to preserve noteworthy natural features.Conservation groups focus primarily <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that's</b> origins are routed in general expansion. As Industrialization became more prominent as well as the increasing trend towards Urbanization the conservative environmental movement began. Contrary to popular belief conservation groups are not against expansion in general, instead they are concerned with efficiency with resources and land development.|$|R

50|$|Joining with Bernhard Förster, the {{brother-in-law}} of Friedrich Nietzsche, {{he set up}} the Deutscher Volksverein (German People's League) in 1881 {{to support}} the anti-Semitic agenda.
