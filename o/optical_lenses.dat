25|$|Antonie van Leeuwenhoek {{made more}} than 500 <b>optical</b> <b>lenses.</b> He also created at least 25 single-lens microscopes, of differing types, of which only nine have survived. These microscopes were made of silver or copper frames, holding hand-made lenses. Those that have survived are capable of {{magnification}} up to 275 times. It is suspected that van Leeuwenhoek possessed some microscopes that could magnify up to 500 times. Although he has been widely regarded as a dilettante or amateur, his scientific research was of remarkably high quality.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of the steady illumination of the Argand lamp, the application of <b>optical</b> <b>lenses</b> to increase and focus the light intensity became a practical possibility. William Hutchinson developed the first practical optical system in 1763, known as a catoptric system. This rudimentary system effectively collimated the emitted light into a concentrated beam, thereby greatly increasing the light's visibility. The ability to focus the light led to the first revolving lighthouse beams, where the light would appear to the mariners as a series of intermittent flashes. It also became possible to transmit complex signals using the light flashes.|$|E
40|$|The current {{approach}} to <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> design still relies {{very much on}} the lens designers: experience and knowledge. In the initial lens design, it is normally performed by lens designers and then is optimised by using some optimisation techniques. This research aims to design and develop a computer-aided <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> design system for automating the entire design process. In this paper, various approaches to <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> design are briefly reviewed first. It is then followed by the descriptions of a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approach, based on the case based reasoning and genetic algorithm, to <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> design. A prototype <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> design system based on the hybrid approach was proposed and developed.

It is recorded by the interference of a plane wave and a spherical wave in a Fe-doped LiNbO 3. The flat <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> can laterally transfer and focus the plane wave which perpendicularly incidents on the planar crystal surface.

The flat <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> with different recording and reconstructing wavelength has also been discussed. The flat <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> has the advantages of light weight, laterally transferring and focusing, small duty ratio, and easy for the microstructure integration.

25|$|Many {{applications}} of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency, {{giving rise to}} their primary use as window panes. Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make <b>optical</b> <b>lenses,</b> prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities {{have led to the}} extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses.|$|E

500|$|... and taxonomic works became ambitious {{enough to}} replace the ancient texts. This is {{sometimes}} credited {{to the development of}} sophisticated <b>optical</b> <b>lenses,</b> which allowed the morphology of organisms to be studied in much greater detail. One of the earliest authors {{to take advantage of this}} leap in technology was the Italian physician Andrea Cesalpino (1519–1603), who has been called [...] "the first taxonomist". His magnum opus De Plantis came out in 1583, and described more than 1500 plant species. Two large plant families that he first recognized are still in use today: the Asteraceae and Brassicaceae. Then in the 17th century John Ray (England, 1627–1705) wrote many important taxonomic works. Arguably his greatest accomplishment was Methodus Plantarum Nova (1682), in which he published details of over 18,000 plant species. At the time, his classifications were perhaps the most complex yet produced by any taxonomist, as he based his taxa on many combined characters. The next major taxonomic works were produced by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (France, 1656–1708). His work from 1700, Institutiones Rei Herbariae, included more than 9000 species in 698 genera, which directly influenced Linnaeus, as it was the text he used as a young student.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For higher {{geometrical}} accuracy {{requirement of}} <b>optical</b> <b>lens,</b> much {{research has been}} conducted either by changing the injection process parameters or changing the material of the mold or the mold manufacturing process. Although some degree of improvements was achieved, those were occasional but not-repeatable. One conventional procedure has been: the injection mold core must be polished several times to obtain qualified lens product in preproduction trial, very uneconomical and inefficient. In this paper, modern engineering tools were applied to simplify the correction process in <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> fabrication. Combining virtual manufacturing with reverse engineering technology, the method was demonstrated very powerful. For the <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> of 70 x 29. 1 mm in this research, the maximum deviation from the flatness after regular plastic injection molding was 0. 208 mm. While with combined technology of VM and RE the error was reduced to 0. 008 mm only by once iteration with an improvement of 96. 15 %. Not only the technology could be extended to larger or more challenging lens fabrication, it could also be applied to curved surfaces. This is really great tool to achieve higher quality <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> production with much lower expending in labor and funding. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDue {{to these}} advantages, small size, low heat radiation, long life time, and high {{luminous}} efficiency, the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{have been used}} widely to the varied lighting in recent years.

In this study, the LED illumination module with/without secondary <b>optical</b> <b>lens,</b> total internal reflected (TIR) lens or reflection mirror cup, can be simulated by the Apilux(R) optical software.
