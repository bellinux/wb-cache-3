5|$|Piquet, on a {{one-stop}} strategy {{after his}} poor qualifying performance, had fortuitously pitted {{immediately prior to}} the safety car's deployment and was also fuelled {{to the end of}} the race. Promoted to third place from 14th beforehand following the pit stops, he was set to take the lead once Hamilton and Heidfeld (who also had not pitted under the safety car conditions) pitted for their final stops. Further back, Vettel squeezed past Alonso at the pit exit, pushing him <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> line separating the pit lane exit from the track. Alonso complained over his radio but no action was taken against either driver. Meanwhile, Räikkönen dropped several places to 11th, having had to queue behind Massa at the second pit stops.|$|E
5|$|Stars such as James Cagney redefined their images. Cagney {{played a}} series of patriots, and his gangster in Angels with Dirty Faces (1937) purposefully acts like a coward when he is {{executed}} so children who had looked up to him would cease any such admiration. Breen in essence neutered Groucho Marx, removing most of his jokes which directly referenced sex, although some sexual references slipped through unnoticed in the Marx Brothers post-Code pictures. In the political realm, films such Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) in which James Stewart tries to change the American system from within while reaffirming its core values, stand {{in stark contrast to}} Gabriel <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House where a dictator is needed to cure America's woes.|$|E
5|$|The Rock Springs massacre, {{also known}} as the Rock Springs Riot, {{occurred}} on September 2, 1885, in the present-day United States city of Rock Springs in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The riot, between Chinese immigrant miners and white immigrant miners, was the result of racial tensions and an ongoing labor dispute over the Union Pacific Coal Department's policy of paying Chinese miners lower wages than white miners. This policy caused the Chinese to be hired <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> miners, which further angered the white miners and contributed to the riot. When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes resulting in approximately US$150,000 in property damage ($ in present-day terms).|$|E

5|$|The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company was a British {{shipping}} company founded in London in 1839 by James MacQueen. It became the largest shipping {{group in the}} world when it took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Star Line in 1927. Lord Kylsant had been chairman of the company since 1902. He had expanded the company rapidly: aside from the White Star Line, he bought the Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1910 for £1.5million, the Union-Castle Line in 1912, and assumed control of the Harland and Wolff shipyards in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} strong leaders {{who could take}} charge and steer America out of its crisis is seen in Gabriel <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House (1933), about a benevolent {{dictator}} who takes control of the United States. Walter Huston stars as a weak-willed, ineffectual president (likely modeled after Hoover) who is inhabited by the archangel Gabriel upon being knocked unconscious. The spirit's behavior {{is similar to that}} of Abraham Lincoln. The president solves the nation's unemployment crisis and executes an Al Capone-type criminal who has continually flouted the law.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the election, Downey {{announced}} that he was resigning for health reasons. Warren appointed Nixon to the short remainder of Downey's term; under the Senate rules at the time, this gave Nixon seniority over the senators sworn in during January. Nixon took office on December 4, 1950. He used little of his seniority, since in November 1952 he was elected vice president as Dwight Eisenhower's running mate, the next step on a path that would lead him to the presidency in 1969. Downey, who as a former senator retained floor privileges, was hired as a lobbyist by oil interests. In 1952, as Republicans took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House and control of both houses of Congress, he was fired. An aide stated that the big corporations did not need Downey anymore. Boddy, dispirited by his election defeat and feeling let down by the average citizens for whom he had sought to advocate, lapsed into semi-retirement after his primary defeat. In 1952, he sold his interest in the Daily News, which went into bankruptcy in December 1954.|$|E

5|$|Christopher {{began the}} 1944 Philadelphia Athletics {{season as a}} member of the {{starting}} rotation along with Don Black, Lum Harris and Bobo Newsom. However, he did split time in the first half of the year between the starting rotation and the bullpen. Among those appearances was a 16-inning match against the Chicago White Sox; Christopher pitched the final four innings, losing 4–2 after Hal Trosky stole home plate. On July 14, he pitched a 4–3 victory against the Senators, helping his team defeat Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn for the first time in three years. After starting the season with a 4–10 record, on July 22 Christopher went on a seven-game winning streak that culminated with a 5–1 complete game victory <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox. He finished the season with a 14–14 record, 84 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.97. After the season ended, Christopher and others went on a barnstorming tour throughout the United States, ending in Wenatchee, Washington.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lieber was the Cubs' Opening Day starter. From June 28 to August 14, he won {{a career-high}} six {{consecutive}} decisions. On July 3, he threw a shutout, allowing two hits in a 30 victory over the Pirates. In his next start, on July 8, he had 12 strikeouts and threw a complete game in a 92 win <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox. Lieber was 127 with a 4.12 ERA through his first 29 starts; however, he went 04 in September with a 5.88 ERA. In 35 starts (tied for the NL lead with Randy Johnson, Kevin Millwood, Tom Glavine, and Greg Maddux), Lieber had a 1211 record, a 4.41 ERA, and 54 walks. He tied Darryl Kile for ninth in the league with 192 strikeouts, he led the league with 251 innings pitched, he ranked third in the league with 248 hits allowed (behind Liván Hernández's 254 and José Lima's 251), and he tied Maddux for third with six complete games (behind Johnson's and Curt Schilling's eight).|$|E

It intersects CRD 332 after crossing over the ditch, {{and it turns}} west at the western and southern termini of Route DD and CRD 337, respectively. Route 75 then enters the city of Anniston, crossing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Pond inside the city limits. At Kaycee Lane (CRD 341), the road turns north towards {{the center of the}} city, where it intersects CRD 328 and other streets. Route 75 turns west at B Street (CRD 339), leaving the city limits.

5|$|Seething {{beneath the}} surface of American life in the Depression was the fear of the angry mob, portrayed in panicked {{hysteria}} in films such as Gabriel <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House (1933), The Mayor of Hell (1933), and American Madness (1932). Massive wide shots of angry hordes, comprising sometimes hundreds of men, rush into action in terrifyingly efficient uniformity. Groups of agitated men either standing in breadlines, loitering in hobo camps, or marching the streets in protest became a prevalent sight during the Great Depression. The Bonus Army protests of World War I veterans on the capital in Washington, D.C., on which Hoover unleashed a brutal crackdown, prompted many of the Hollywood depictions. Although social issues were examined more directly in the pre-Code era, Hollywood still largely ignored the Great Depression, as many films sought to ameliorate patrons' anxieties rather than incite them.|$|E
5|$|The White Sox led {{for most}} of the season {{starting}} with a tie for first on May 17, held at least a share of the lead for 154 days, and never dropped more than a game behind the leader. The Twins spent much of the season in second place behind the White Sox, along with 54 days in the lead. Despite going 11–15 in September, the Twins took a half-game lead with an extra innings win <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox on September 25 that capped a three-game sweep of Chicago. The Twins maintained that lead through their final game, forcing Chicago to play a make-up on September 29 against the Tigers which had been rained out earlier that month. The White Sox won, 8–2, leaving the Sox and Twins tied atop the AL Central with 88–74 records, forcing a tie-breaker to decide the division. Tickets for the tie-breaker sold out within an hour {{of the end of the}} September 29 game.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees again {{reached the}} World Series in their 1963 campaign, but were swept {{in four games}} by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Houk left the manager's {{position}} to become the team's general manager and the newly retired Berra was named manager. After dealing with player injuries and internal dissension, the Yankees rallied from third place late in the 1964 season and won the AL pennant by one game <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox. It was their fifth straight World Series appearance and fourteenth in the past sixteen years. The team faced the St. Louis Cardinals in a series that included a walk-off home run by Mantle to end the third game. Despite Mantle's game-winning hit, the Yankees were defeated by the Cardinals in seven games, and Berra was fired.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton made a {{pit stop}} on lap 35, coming out behind his teammate, driving <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> pit exit {{line in the}} process. This handed him a five-second time penalty {{to be added to}} his {{finishing}} time. Sebastian Vettel came in two laps later, being stationary for more than 13 seconds due to a problem with the wheelnut of his rear right tyre and came out behind Felipe Massa in fourth place. Meanwhile, Romain Grosjean retired with gearbox issues. Vettel closed the gap to Massa in the last podium position, but was eventually unable to pass the Brazilian, handing Massa his first podium finish of 2015. Toward the end of the race, Pastor Maldonado was racing Max Verstappen for seventh place. Going past the start/finish straight, Maldonado almost lost the rear of his car coming out of the Toro Rosso's slipstream, while Verstappen locked up going into turn one, handing the position to the Lotus driver. Rosberg, who complained about vibrations in his front tyres during the last laps, crossed the finish line three seconds ahead of teammate Hamilton, taking his third victory of the season and the second consecutive one at Spielberg, reducing his championship gap to ten points.|$|E
5|$|Taaramäe took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> jersey {{for best}} young rider from Rigoberto Urán on stage 18. Urán {{finished}} a distant 27th on the day, seven minutes off {{the pace of}} stage winner Andy Schleck. Taaramäe's eighth place, three minutes back of Schleck but four minutes the better of Urán, moved him into 11th place overall and into the best young rider's position, by 33 seconds over Pierre Rolland. Rolland won the stage at Alpe d'Huez the next day, with Taaramäe finishing 14th two minutes back. This gave Rolland an advantage of a minute and 33 seconds going into the stage 20 individual time trial, where Taaramäe's skills are superior. Taaramäe indeed finished better than Rolland in the time trial, tenth to Rolland's 21st, but gained only 48 seconds. This was insufficient to win back the white jersey before the final, largely ceremonial stage into Paris on the Tour's final day. Taaramäe finished the Tour in 12th place overall, at a deficit of eleven {{and a half minutes}} to Tour champion Cadel Evans. Moncoutié was not a major factor in any classification, finishing 41st overall and 25th in the mountains classification. Given his result at just 24 years of age, and that he retains eligibility for the white jersey in the 2012 Tour de France, Boyer expressed that he was quite pleased with Taaramäe's performance, and that he expected the Estonian to be a contender for the overall podium at the Tour within two or three years.|$|E
