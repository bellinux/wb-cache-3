50|$|Consider an RPD cake-baking {{example from}} Montgomery (2005), where an {{experimenter}} wants {{to improve the}} quality of cake. While the cake manufacturer can control the amount of flour, amount of sugar, amount of baking powder, and coloring content of the cake, other factors are uncontrollable, such as <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> and bake time. The manufacturer can print instructions for a bake time of 20 minutes but in the real world has no control over consumer baking habits. Variations in the quality of the cake can arise from baking at 325° instead of 350° or from leaving the cake in the oven for a slightly too short or too long period of time. Robust parameter designs seek to minimize the effects of noise factors on quality. For this example, the manufacturer hopes to minimize the effects in fluctuation of bake time on cake quality, and in doing this the optimal settings for the control factors are required.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} {{a system that}} links a thermal desorption oven for aerosol filter samples to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) via a combustion interface. Organic compounds are desorbed from the filter sample in He at 7 temperature steps between 100 and 400 °C and subsequently oxidized to CO 2, which is analyzed for δ 13 C. We tested the system for isotopic fractionation, reproducibility and linearity using organic test compounds and aerosol filter samples. An oxalic acid standard with known δ 13 C value shows no isotopic fractionation when it is desorbed at temperatures well above its melting point. When organic acids are heated at a temperature close to their melting point {{only a fraction of}} the compound (10 – 80 %) evaporates which shows depleted δ 13 C values at this temperature step. At the next higher temperature step, when the rest of the compound is desorbed, δ 13 C values are enriched. This effect is stronger for compounds with a lower molecular weight than for compounds with a higher molecular weight. In ambient samples this should only have a moderate effect on the overall δ 13 C value, since hundreds of different compounds are desorbed at each temperature step. Choosing different values for temperature steps does not strongly change the δ 13 C values for ambient aerosol filter samples. For typical ambient samples the reproducibility lies below ± 0. 3 ‰ for <b>oven</b> <b>temperatures</b> below 200 °C and below ± 0. 5 ‰ for <b>oven</b> <b>temperatures</b> above 200 °C.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Crystallized {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (CPET) is nearly transparent to microwave energy and can sustain 200 &deg;C convection <b>oven</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{for more than}} 60 min. without embrittling. As a result, it is a leading candidate for thermo-formed freezer-to-oven portion servings. The rate of crystallization is controlled by adding small amounts of organic and/or inorganic nucleants. Nearly amorphous sheet of thickness of 60 mil or less can be extruded by casting onto chill rolls. This sheet is then rapidly heated to forming temperature with radiant and/or convection energy sources. The rapidly crystallizing sheet is finally formed against a heated mold. This paper proposes a way of understanding the time-dependent nature of CPET crystal-linity during the typical thermoforming process. The results are compared with the patent literature...|$|R
