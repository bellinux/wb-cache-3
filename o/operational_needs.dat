5|$|The 6th Division's {{structure}} changed considerably during World War II, with units being detached or {{attached to}} meet <b>operational</b> <b>needs.</b> This was particularly so during early 1942 and late 1943. Below is a divisional {{order of battle}} that is indicative of its generic make up. In addition to those listed, during 1942–1943, the 14th, 21st, 25th and 30th Brigades were also attached, albeit temporarily for varying periods.|$|E
5|$|This river {{valve system}} {{was one of}} the first parts of the dam to be built when the dam project started in 1961, because its initial purpose was to divert the river while the dam was under construction. After that, it served various purposes, {{including}} as a possible emergency release valve. Since the accident, DWR had implemented a standing order that prohibited the operation of the river outlet system and significantly limited access to the river valve chamber. Following the accident, DWR entered into a 2012 Agreement with CalOSHA to hire a third party expert to improve the safety of the River Valve Outlet System (RVOS) and make it operational again. In 2014, DWR embarked on an accelerated refurbishment program to respond to concerns about <b>operational</b> <b>needs</b> during the ongoing drought. The system was mostly refurbished and was used during 2014 and 2015 to meet Endangered Species Act temperature requirements for the Feather River. Some additional refurbishments were being made to portions of the RVOS and were expected to conclude in early 2017.|$|E

25|$|As {{with all}} mass transit in the United States the TA {{requires}} assistance for its capital costs and to cover <b>operational</b> <b>needs,</b> however, {{the very high}} ridership of New York City's subway system has enabled it to pay 67% of its operating costs from fares and advertising. Historically, the TA's capital requirements were met by the city and state jointly, but this support was withdrawn, primarily by Governor Rockefeller, in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|UC San Diego Health shares {{doctors and}} care {{providers}} {{with several other}} hospital systems in the region. In 2015, UCSD entered a long-term management agreement with El Centro Regional Medical Center in El Centro, the county seat of Imperial Valley. Under the terms of this agreement, ECRMC patients have access to specialized facilities operated by UCSD in the city. Doctors also have access to training and continuing medical education through the UCSD School of Medicine, and UC administrators will continually monitor the <b>operational</b> <b>needs</b> of the remote medical center.|$|E

25|$|The Fairchild 82 was a {{ruggedly}} performing {{aircraft and}} it found a niche as a freighter especially in northern Canada, although export versions had {{a variety of}} roles assigned to it. It was operated by several Canadian firms including Canadian Pacific Air Lines. While its main competitor, the Noorduyn Norseman was also finding success, the Fairchild company decided to abandon the bush plane market and ceased production of the Model 82 in favour of converting its production lines to the Bristol Bolingbroke version of the bomber that was being produced for Royal Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force <b>operational</b> <b>needs</b> {{in the years immediately}} prior to the Second World War.|$|E
500|$|In {{planning}} the island's development, the Navy considered its <b>operational</b> <b>needs</b> and the island's historic value. However, the National Trust for Historic Preservation considered the Navy's communication style more directive rather than collaborative, restricting the NTHP's ability {{to share their}} concerns, and in 2001 designated Ford Island one of its 11 most-endangered sites. Although the Navy's plans included preserving important hangars, the control tower and seaplane ramps, they failed to protect the existing runway and 1920s housing and did not address preserving bullet holes on the seaplane ramps. [...] As hoped by the Trust, after the designation the Navy agreed to delay development {{of some of these}} items until an agreement could be reached.|$|E

2500|$|As {{fighting}} intensified {{throughout the}} region in early 1948, however, the SA's sole squadron in Tel Aviv could not meet all <b>operational</b> <b>needs.</b> Soon new detachments were deployed to the Negev and the Galilee, where several aircraft begun operating from the former RAF landing ground at Mahanayim {{in support of the}} newly formed Golani Brigade. When the brigade moved its headquarters to Yavne'el, three SA aircraft deployed to an airstrip constructed there. On 4 April 1948, two Auster Autocrats, three pilots and two mechanics, were formed into the SA's Galilee section, headed by Pesach Tolchinky. On 25 April, the unit was officially designated the SA's 3rd Squadron and given the callsign [...] "Lavi" [...] (Lion).|$|E
2500|$|Between 10 October and 27 November, the {{squadron}} moved more aircraft to Tan Son Nhut from Phan Rang and [...] Phù Cát due to <b>operational</b> <b>needs</b> in Cambodia. On 7 December, the 17 SOS {{was ordered to}} fly night support missions for Laotian forces on the Bolaven Plateau after several Lima Sites were surrounded by enemy forces. Three gunships and four crews were relocated from Phan Rang to Phù Cát, and air support enabled the Lima Sites to reset defenses in around five days. Between 12 and 15 December, 32 squadron missions expended 555,800 7.62mm rounds and 128 flares {{in support of the}} Cambodian Army defense of Prey Totung. On 29 December, A Flight was inactivated at Phù Cát, and its personnel and equipment transferred to B Flight at Phan Rang.

According to one Battalion commander it was a poor location for a firebase from a defensive standpoint. [...] " [...] in a saddle with hills around it on three sides." [...] It was also at the very edge of helicopter range from Americal headquarters at Chu Lai. Any other location in the region would have put the FSB outside the range of the Division's heavy artillery batteries and prevented artillery at Mary Ann from shelling key locations in the region. From an offensive standpoint the FSB was in a good location since it straddled the Dak Rose Trail network.|$|E
