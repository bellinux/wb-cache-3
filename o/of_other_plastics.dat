Specifically, this research utilizes indigenous natural zeolite as catalyst, while the primary raw material is Polyethylene. Variations in the raw materials are conducted by adding smaller quantity <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>plastic</b> materials.

50|$|The Zara Spook {{was first}} {{developed}} by the Heddon company as a wooden lure named the Zaragossa 6500 series lures. In 1939 The plastic version was introduced and following the naming <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>plastic</b> lures Heddon added spook to the name to classify it as a plastic lure. The Zara Spook 9260 Series lures contained different types of hardware throughout their production. Heddon two piece hardware were the first hardware on the 1939 catalogued Zara Spook. Later lures through the 1940s and 1950s had surface hardware. Later models contained bell hardware and moulded hangers through the 1970s. In the mid-1990s, a 4-inch long model with three hooks was introduced, and a smaller 2-inch model has also been developed for light tackle fishing. The Zara spook and spin off models are {{one of a few}} lures still marketed under the Heddon brand name by EBSCO.|$|R
40|$|The Scattered Nucleon Detection Assembly (SCANDAL) setup at The Svedberg Laboratory {{has been}} used to produce neutron elastic {{scattering}} cross section data at 175 MeV for bismuth and iron. This work presents MCNPX simulations of the experimental setup and aims to describe processes and data important for the upcoming off-line data analysis. In the experiment, neutrons scattered off the target are converted to protons, which are stopped in scintillator crystals. The results include a description of the proton spectra dependence on the neutron-to-proton conversion angle, suggesting a cut at a conversion angle of 15. 2 °. Calculation of the hit position gates indicates high proton leakage from the crystals. A study of the converter describes the role of its chemical composition and also the role <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>plastic</b> scintillators on the proton spectra.

50|$|Plastics were {{introduced}} to the rotational molding process in the early 1950s. One of the first applications was to manufacture doll heads. The machinery was made of an E Blue box-oven machine, inspired by a General Motors rear axle, powered by an external electric motor and heated by floor-mounted gas burners. The mold was made out of electroformed nickel-copper, and the plastic was a liquid PVC plastisol. The cooling method consisted of placing the mold into cold water. This process of rotational molding led to the creation <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>plastic</b> toys. As demand for and popularity of this process increased, it was used to create other products such as road cones, marine buoys, and car armrests. This popularity {{led to the development of}} larger machinery. A new system of heating was also created, going from the original direct gas jets to the current indirect high velocity air system. In Europe during the 1960s the Engel process was developed. This allowed large hollow containers to be manufactured in low-density polyethylene. The cooling method consisted of turning off the burners and allowing the plastic to harden while still rocking in the mold.|$|R

No <b>other</b> <b>plastic</b> at the time could compete on price, and with ivory, horn and bone products becoming far more expensive, it found a natural home in the fashion industry.|$|R

30|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> sources <b>of</b> {{microplastics}} in {{the environment}} have been identified. Abrasion from car tyres has been considered as very relevant [46, 57]. In addition, many ship paints and other protective paints contain synthetic polymers, e.g. alkyds, poly(acrylate/styrene), PU and epoxy resins. Microplastics may be released by spills during application of the paint, by abrasion during use of the painted product and during paint removal [21, 57].

40|$|Understanding the ion {{transport}} behavior of organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) {{is crucial for}} their potential application as solid electrolytes in various electrochemical devices such as lithium batteries. In the present work, the {{ion transport}} mechanism is elucidated by analyzing experimental data (single-crystal XRD, multinuclear solid-state NMR, DSC, ionic conductivity, and SEM) {{as well as the}} theoretical simulations (second moment-based solid static NMR line width simulations) for the OIPC diethyl(methyl) (isobutyl) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate ([P 1, 2, 2, 4][PF 6]). This material displays rich phase behavior and advantageous ionic conductivities, with three solid–solid phase transitions and a highly “plastic” and conductive final solid phase in which the conductivity reaches 10 – 3 S cm– 1. The crystal structure shows unique channel-like packing of the cations, which may allow the anions to diffuse more easily than the cations at lower temperatures. The strongly phase-dependent static NMR line widths of the 1 H, 19 F, and 31 P nuclei in this material have been well simulated by different levels of molecular motions in different phases. Thus, drawing together of the analytical and computational techniques has allowed the construction of a transport mechanism for [P 1, 2, 2, 4][PF 6]. It is also anticipated that utilization of these techniques will allow a more detailed understanding of the transport mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>plastic</b> crystal electrolyte materials...|$|R

40|$|On ocean beds {{around the}} world sinking {{particles}} of residual biomass from animals and vegetation have, over time, accumulated into thick layers of sediment. For researchers these layers of sediment contain valuable information about the earth’s past climate, {{information that can be}} used to predict future climate change and to estimate natural vs. human causes of today’s global warming. The Institute of Geosciences at Stockholm University studies sediment cores that have been acquired with an apparatus called piston corer. For future coring expeditions additional piston corers are needed. However, the dimensions of the current piston corer only allow use of specially ordered polycarbonate pipes which are used as liners. This pipe is relatively expensive compared to pipes <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>plastic</b> materials and <b>of</b> standard dimensions. In order to lower the cost of upcoming coring expeditions a new piston corer design, that allows use of standard dimension plastic pipes as liners, is required. The process of redesigning the piston corer offers an opportunity to identify structural disadvantages and generate ideas on improvements that can be accomplished in a new construction. It also offers an opportunity to satisfy a need to increase the dimensions of the liners in order to acquire a larger volume of sediment, thereby increasing the reliability of the information gathered when examining the sediment. This thesis paper presents the process of redesigning and improving the piston corer currently used by Stockholm University. The resulting design allows use of standard dimension PVC pipes as liners. It has also been improved regarding the process of extruding liners after recovering sediment cores as well as performance and handling...|$|R

40|$|Brillouin {{scattering}} {{experiments were}} carried out on single crystals of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) in the plastic phase, near the triple point, and adiabatic elastic constants were evaluated. Four single crystals were grown in a quartz cell. The crystals were rotated and their orientations {{with respect to the}} laboratory frame of reference were determined using X-ray Laue transmission methods. Light (514. 5 nm wavelength) from an Ar-ion laser was incident along the vertical axis of the cylindrical cell, and scattering at an angle of 90 ° was analyzed and recorded by photon counting techniques using a piezoelectrically scanned Fabry-Perot interferometer, photomultiplier tube and a data acquisition and stabilization system. [...] The spectra usually showed a quasilongitudinal component and a single, very much weaker, quasitransverse component; only three spectra showed both transverse components. By least-squares fitting 59 different frequency shift measurements, the adiabatic elastic constants were determined to be: at 279. 2 ± 0. 2 K (in units of 10 ⁹ N m⁻²), [...] C₁₁ = 2. 8 (57), C₁₂ = 2. 4 (72), C₄₄ = 0. 35 (8) [...] with an estimated absolute uncertainty of 2 %. This resulted in an adiabatic bulk modulus Bs = 2. 60 x 10 ⁹ N m⁻², and an elastic anisotropy factor A = 1. 86.
