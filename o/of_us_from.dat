500|$|His channel appeals {{strongly}} to younger viewers, a group Google {{refers to as}} Generation C for their habits of [...] "creation, curation, connection and community". According to a 2014 survey commissioned by Variety, PewDiePie {{along with a few}} other YouTube personalities have been reported to be more influential and popular than mainstream celebrities, such as Jennifer Lawrence, among US teenagers aged 13 through 18. His rise to fame has been used as [...] "a great example of how the emerging society gives extensive opportunities to individuals with great ideas, courage, and, of course, a significant portion of luck as opposed to the old society." [...] Studies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of gamers engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to be an important reason for PewDiePie's popularity. In 2015, PewDiePie was included on Time's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, cementing his influence as an internet personality. Later in 2015, PewDiePie was featured on the cover of Varietys [...] "Famechangers" [...] issue, with the magazine ranking him as the [...] "#1 Famechanger", or [...] "those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest". The following year, Time included him on their Time 100 list, with South Park co-creator Trey Parker writing in his entry, [...] "I know it might seem weird, especially to those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> an older generation, that people would spend so much time watching someone else play video games [...] But I choose to see it as the birth of a new art form. And I don't think anyone should underestimate its most powerful artist." [...] In June 2017, Forbes released a quarterly [...] "Top Influencers" [...] list, ranking PewDiePie at #2 in the Gaming gategory behind Markiplier. Forbes cited their reasoning for the ranking, writing, [...] " [...] overall brand suffered earlier this year when he included anti-Semitic content in nine of his videos." ...|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the close}} of the first day's journey ... we had a splendid view of the country we were to travel, which lay {{stretched}} out beneath our feet to an immense distance, as we descended into the little town of Pozzo Borgo. Deep valleys sloped on each side <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>from</b> which the smoke of cottages occasionally curled: the branches of an overhanging birch-tree or a neighbouring ruin gave relief to the grey, misty landscape, which was streaked by dark pine-forests, and speckled by the passing clouds; and in the extreme distance rose a range of hills glittering in the evening sun, and scarcely distinguishable from the ridge of clouds that hovered near them.|$|E
2500|$|If {{voluntary}} {{provision of}} public goods will not work, then the obvious solution is making their provision involuntary. This saves each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> our own {{tendency to be}} a free rider, while also assuring us {{that no one else}} will be allowed to free ride. [...] One frequently proposed solution to the problem is for governments or states to impose taxation to fund the production of public goods. This does not actually solve the theoretical problem because good government is itself a public good. [...] Thus it is difficult to ensure the government has an incentive to provide the optimum amount even if it were possible for the government to determine precisely what amount would be optimum. [...] These issues are studied by public choice theory and public finance.|$|E
2500|$|The song had {{its origins}} during the {{recording}} of 1993's Siamese Dream. According to frontman Billy Corgan, [...] "somewhere, I have a tape <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> 1993 endlessly playing the 'world is a vampire' part over and over". It was not until 1995 that Corgan finished the song with the noted chorus [...] "rat in a cage", on an acoustic guitar during the same session that [...] "Landslide" [...] was recorded. The lyrics [...] "Can you fake it, for just one more show?" [...] may refer to the band's experience headlining the 1994 Lollapalooza festival, with Corgan calling it the [...] "old job". Along with {{other parts of the}} album, Corgan appears to compare himself to Jesus Christ, with the line [...] "Jesus was an only son / Tell me I'm the chosen one".|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the Mau Mau Uprising, {{the records}} {{included}} confirmation of [...] "the {{extent of the}} violence inflicted on suspected Mau Mau rebels" [...] in British detention camps documented in Caroline Elkins' study. Numerous allegations of murder and rape by British military personnel are recorded in the files, including an incident where an African baby was [...] "burnt to death", the [...] "defilement of a young girl", and a soldier in Royal Irish Fusiliers who killed [...] "in cold blood two {{people who had been}} his captives for over 12 hours". Baring himself was aware of the [...] "extreme brutality" [...] of the sometimes-lethal torture meted out—which included [...] "most drastic" [...] beatings, solitary confinement, starvation, castration, whipping, burning, rape, sodomy, and forceful insertion of objects into orifices—but took no action. Baring's inaction was despite the urging of people like Arthur Young, Commissioner of Police for Kenya for less than eight months of 1954 before he resigned in protest, that [...] "the horror of some of the [...] should be investigated without delay". In February 1956, a provincial commissioner in Kenya, [...] "Monkey" [...] Johnson, wrote to Attorney General Reginald Manningham-Buller urging him to block any enquiry into the methods used against Mau Mau: [...] "It would now appear that each and every one <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>from</b> the Governor downwards, may be in danger of removal from public service by a commission of enquiry as a result of enquiries made by the CID." [...] The April 2012 release also included detailed accounts of the policy of seizing livestock from Kenyans suspected of supporting Mau Mau rebels.|$|E
