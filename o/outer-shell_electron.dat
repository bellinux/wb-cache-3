At best, {{it can make}} {{predictions}} about the K-alpha and some L-alpha X-ray emission spectra for larger atoms, if two additional ad hoc assumptions are made (see Moseley's law above). Emission spectra for atoms with a single <b>outer-shell</b> <b>electron</b> (atoms in the lithium group) can also be approximately predicted. Also, if the empiric electron–nuclear screening factors for many atoms are known, many other spectral lines can be deduced from the information, in similar atoms of differing elements, via the Ritz–Rydberg combination principles (see Rydberg formula). All these techniques essentially make use of Bohr's Newtonian energy-potential picture of the atom.|$|E

For the simplest case of coherent two-level optical pumping of an atomic species containing a single <b>outer-shell</b> <b>electron,</b> this means that the electron is coherently pumped to a single hyperfine sublevel (labeled [...] ), which is defined by the polarization of the pump laser along with the quantum selection rules.

50|$|As one {{progresses}} down a {{group on}} the periodic table, the ionization energy will likely decrease since the valence electrons are {{farther away from the}} nucleus and experience a weaker attraction to the nucleus's positive charge. There will be an increase of ionization energy from left to right of a given period and a decrease from top to bottom. As a rule, it requires far less energy to remove an <b>outer-shell</b> <b>electron</b> than an inner-shell electron. As a result, the ionization energies for a given element will increase steadily within a given shell, and when starting on the next shell down will show a drastic jump in ionization energy. Simply put, the lower the principal quantum number, the higher the ionization energy for the electrons within that shell. The exceptions are the elements in the boron and oxygen family, which require slightly less energy than the general trend.|$|E

50|$|Characteristic X-rays are {{produced}} when an element is bombarded with high-energy particles, {{which can be}} photons, electrons or ions (such as protons). When the incident particle strikes a bound electron (the target electron) in an atom, the target electron is ejected from the inner shell of the atom. After the electron has been ejected, the atom is left with a vacant energy level, {{also known as a}} core hole. <b>Outer-shell</b> <b>electrons</b> then fall into the inner shell, emitting quantized photons with an energy level equivalent to the energy difference between the higher and lower states. Each element has a unique set of energy levels, and thus the transition from higher to lower energy levels produces X-rays with frequencies that are characteristic to each element. When an electron falls from the L shell to the K shell, the X-ray emitted is called a K-alpha X-ray. Similarly, when an electron falls from the M shell to the K shell, the X-ray emitted is called a K-beta X-ray. Sometimes, however, instead of releasing the energy {{in the form of an}} X-ray, the energy can be transferred to another electron, which is then ejected from the atom.

Such studies have been conducted for most elements 1 and theoretical modelling can be performed to high precision 2, 3, taking into account relativistic effects that scale approximately as the square of the atomic number. However, for the transfermium elements (those with atomic numbers greater than 100), the atomic structure is experimentally unknown. These radioactive elements are produced in nuclear fusion reactions at rates of only a few atoms per second at most and must be studied immediately following their production 4, which has so far precluded their optical spectroscopy.

40|$|Photoionisation of an atom by X-rays usually removes an inner-shell {{electron}} from the atom, {{leaving behind a}} perturbed "hollow ion" whose relaxation may take different routes. In light elements, emission of an Auger electron is common. However, the energy and {{the total number of}} electrons released from the atom may be modulated by shake-up and shake-off effects. When the inner-shell <b>electron</b> leaves, the <b>outer-shell</b> <b>electrons</b> may find themselves in a state that is not an eigen-state of the atom in its surroundings. The resulting collective excitation is called shake-up. If this process also involves the release of low energy electrons from the outer shell, then the process is called shake-off. It is not clear how significant shake-up and shake-off contributions are to the overall ionisation of biological materials like proteins. In particular, the interaction between the out-going electron and the remaining system depends on the chemical environment of the atom, which can be studied by quantum chemical methods. Here we present calculations on model compounds to represent the most common chemical environments in proteins. The results show that the shake-up and shake-off processes affect about 20 % of all emissions from nitrogen, 30 % from carbon, 40 % from oxygen, and 23 % from sulphur.

40|$|Ionization of K-shell or, more generally, of deep inner-shell {{electrons}} in atoms and molecules {{is accompanied by}} a considerable rearrangement of the valence (<b>outer-shell)</b> <b>electrons</b> in response to the reduced shielding of the nuclear attraction. (1) This adjustment of the valence electrons, referred to as electronic relaxation, leads to a significant energy lowering of the final ionic state relative to a state where the valence electron distribution of the initial state is maintained (“frozen”). The magnitude of this relaxation energy scales with the number of valence electrons. In the case of the K-shell ionization of second-row atoms (Z = 3 − 10), for example, the relaxation energies (in eV) are approximately given by Ε ^R(Z) = 3. 1 (Z − 2. 2). In a molecular environment the corresponding relaxation energies are typically 2 − 3 eV larger than the values for the free atom. Relaxation not only plays a role in the ionic core but also affects the motion of the outgoing photoelectron. The relaxation of the valence electrons, being essentially a contraction of the valence charge distribution, quite effectively screens the inner-shell hole potential experienced by the photoelectron. This means that the potential of the relaxed ionic core is less attractive than its unrelaxed (frozen) counterpart. As a consequence, resonances in the photoionization cross section will appear at higher energy for a relaxed core than for an unrelaxed (frozen) core. Concomitantly with the shift to higher energy, the resonance peaks will be lowered and broadened as a result of relaxation...|$|R

The spectroscopic investigation concentrates upon transition-metal oxides (for example, the rutile series MO 2 various sesquioxides M 2 O 3, and ternary systems such as ilmenites (MTiO 3). Such materials are of considerable general interest by virtue of their diverse electronic properties, and their technological importance. Photoelectron spectra were measured from polycrystalline samples, using both UV (He I and He II) and X-ray (Mg Kα) excitation. The sequential measurement of UV- and X-ray photoelectron spectra is an important element of this work. From the technical point of view another important feature of the experimental work is the attention given to preparation of clean sample surfaces. The theoretical work concerns the 'fine structure' of photoelectron signals due to (1) electrostatic coupling effects and (2) electronic relaxation in the final state. The ionic approximation is invoked, all electronic structure calculations being performed on atomic species.

40|$|Methods of {{controlling}} molecular rotations using linearly polarized femtosecond and picosecond pulses are considered and analyzed theoretically. These laser pulses, typically in the infrared, are highly non-resonant {{with respect to}} the electronic degrees of freedom of the molecules and have intensities of ∼ 10 ^ 13 to 10 ^ 14 W/cm&sup 2;. It is shown how these laser pulses can force small linear molecules to align with the direction of the electric field vector of the laser both {{in the presence of the}} laser field as well as after the application of a short laser pulse. Recent experiments on laser-induced molecular alignment are modeled and excellent agreement between experiment and theory is found. Additional methods {{of controlling}} molecular rotational dynamics are outlined. The first method considers the forced rotational acceleration of diatomic molecules, called the optical centrifuge. Here, the direction of polarization of a linearly polarized laser field is made to smoothly rotate faster and faster. The molecules, which tend to align with the polarization vector of the laser field, follow the rotation of the laser polarization and are accelerated to high angular momentum. The second method considers the control of field-free rotational dynamics by applying phase shifts to the molecular wave function at select times called fractional revivals. At these select moments, an initially localized wave function splits into several copies of the initial state. Adding phase shifts to the copies then induces interference effects which can be used to control the subsequent evolution of the rotational wave function. This same control scheme has a close link to quantum information and this connection is outlined. Finally, a recently proposed method of controlling the quantum dynamics of the classically chaotic kicked rotor system [J. Gong and P. Brumer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 1741 (2001) ] is analyzed from a phase space perspective. It is shown that the proposed quantum control can be linked to small islands of stability in the classical phase space. An experimentally feasible variant of this control scenario using wave packets of molecular alignment is proposed. Two applications of molecular alignment are discussed. The first application uses field-free aligned molecules as a non-linear medium for compression of a laser pulse to the 1 fs regime at optical wavelengths. At such durations, these laser pulses contain nearly a single oscillation of the electric field and represent the shortest laser pulses physically achievable for such frequencies. The second application uses molecular alignment to create a sort of gas phase "molecular crystal" which forms a basis for laser-induced electron diffraction and imaging of the aligned molecules. Here, a first laser pulse aligns the molecules in space.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{ordering}} of electronic degrees of freedom: charge, orbital and magnetic order, {{is important for}} the understanding of many of the often spectacular properties of transition-metal oxides (TMO), including high-temperature superconductivity and metal-to-insulator transitions. While magnetic structure of a bulk systems can be investigated directly using neutron diffraction, an appropriate technique for the study of orbital and charge order was lacking for a long time. Neutrons are not sensitive to charge and therefore cannot detect charge or orbital order directly; they can only pick-up lattice distortions that such an order might induce on the crystal lattice. The suitable technique has to be directly charge sensitive, but beyond this in particular sensitive to the <b>outer-shell</b> <b>electrons,</b> since exactly these determine the electronic properties of a solid. The conventional x-ray diffraction technique rules therefore out, since the main intensity in the detected signal comes here from the inner-shell electrons. Resonant soft x-ray diffraction is the appropriate technique to investigate electronic order in transition metal oxides [1]. Since soft x-rays have energies in the range 200 - 2000 ~eV, the photon energy can be tuned such, that the diffraction process will involve one of the following virtual excitations: oxygen 1 s -> 2 p (K-edge), transition metal 2 p -> 3 d (L 2, 3 -edge) and lanthanide 3 d -> 4 p (M 4, 5 -edge). It is known from x-ray absorption (XAS) data that variation of the photon scattering cross section across the TM L 2, 3 - edge is extremely sensitive to the electronic state of TMO [2]. Whereas XAS delivers only average information about the electronic state of the system, resonant soft x-ray diffraction is structure-selective, so that only the coherent signal belonging to a long-range order with a certain periodicity is detected. This allows for spectroscopically-resolved structure study or, using an appropriate microscopic model, for structurally-resolved spectroscopy study. Resonant soft x-ray diffraction has therefore a high potential for investigation of mixed-valent transition-metal oxide systems, where an electronic phase-separation is expected. In the last years the electronic order of a few TMO-systems has been investigated applying the resonant soft x-ray diffraction technique [3 - 16]. Nevertheless, a full spectral analysis of the data in terms of a realistic microscopic theory - as it is state of the art in the closely related x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) - is very rare, showing that the technique is still in its infant state. Up to now most of the studies use a qualitative analysis of the spectral shape for the interpretation of their data. The aim of this PhD work was the application of resonant soft x-ray diffraction technique for the investigation of electronic order in transition metal oxides at the TM L 2, 3 -edge, trying to obtain a quantitative understanding of the data. The method was first systematically explored through application to a model system in order to test the feasibility of the technique and to understand of how x-ray optical effects have to be taken into account. Two more complex systems were investigated; stripe order in La 1. 8 Sr 0. 2 NiO 4 and charge and orbital order in Fe 3 O 4. The main focus of the work was on the spectroscopic potential of the technique, trying to obtain a level of quantitative description of the data. For x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) from transition metal oxides, cluster configuration interaction calculation provides a powerful and realistic microscopic theory. In the frame work of this thesis cluster theory, considering explicit hybridization effects between the TM-ion and the surrounding oxygen ligands, has been applied {{for the first time to}} describe resonant diffraction data; previous publications confined themselves to a pure ionic picture [1, 5, 6].
