5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded <b>on</b> <b>video.</b> The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded <b>on</b> <b>video</b> in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E

5|$|Prior to release, {{the film}} was {{involved}} in a controversy over plans by Universal Pictures to release it for home viewing <b>on</b> <b>video</b> on demand to 500,000 Comcast customers, only three weeks after its theatrical debut. Concern over the implementation's harming ticket sales and inspiring further films to follow suit resulted in several theater chains' refusal to show the film at all if the plan went ahead, forcing Universal to abandon the idea.|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of national television networks {{during this period}} further fueled the growth of independent Somali productions, most shot <b>on</b> <b>video.</b> Having now obtained greater penetration of the domestic market, the focus then shifted from traditional film premieres in movie theaters to private projections.
