25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> self. It encompasses {{the emotional and}} intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is {{to decide how to}} choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E
500|$|During 1968, Biden clerked for {{six months}} at a Wilmington law firm headed by {{prominent}} local Republican William Prickett and, as he later said, [...] "thought <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Republican". He disliked the conservative racial politics of incumbent Democratic Governor of Delaware Charles L. Terry and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968. The local Republicans tried to recruit him, but he resisted due to his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon, and registered as an Independent instead.|$|E
500|$|Wintour herself, {{when asked}} about it, dismisses the notion that she has all the power {{attributed}} to her. [...] "I don't think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> powerful person," [...] she told Forbes in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world's hundred most powerful women. [...] "You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or whatever it may be. But {{it is a wonderful}} opportunity {{to be able to help}} others, and for that I'm extremely grateful." ...|$|E

500|$|McEwan {{has been}} open about the autobiographical {{elements}} in the book, and has called it [...] "a muted and distorted autobiography" [...] and [...] "a muted, or transmuted, memoir <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young writer." [...] There are, however, significant differences between author and character. Haley is both an academic and a writer of fiction, while McEwan has been a professional author for his entire career. The intelligence agency plot is also completely fictional; {{there was never a}} scheme such as the one described in the book run by MI5. As McEwan says himself, [...] "unfortunately a beautiful woman never came into my room and offered me a stipend." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conception}} of the album, Aguilera told MTV News that [...] "it is a new beginning, a re-introduction <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new artist in a way, because {{for the first time}} people are really seeing and getting to know who I really am". She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and get it away from me. And that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart". [...] "Walk Away" [...] was written by Aguilera, Scott Storch and Matt Morris, with production handled by Storch.|$|E
500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling. Because {{at the end of the}} day I do think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> story teller. But it's rough as f---, [...] so bear with me and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know if you like it raw.|$|E

2500|$|Richards has {{frequently}} {{stated that he}} feels less like a creator than a conduit when writing songs: [...] "I don't have that god aspect about it. I prefer to think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> antenna. There's only one song, and Adam and Eve wrote it; the rest is a variation on a theme." ...|$|R

5000|$|Nye {{decided to}} go to New York City, where he worked in radio, playing various roles on soap operas. He recalled, [...] "I still think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> actor.

40|$|The work I {{have created}} during my time <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{graduate}} student {{is a reflection}} of the dialogues I have engaged in with other artists and acquaintances both in and outside of the academic arena. Stylistically this work is derivative of my involvement with graffiti, Tattooing, and underground comics. I have developed the icon of the rider to represent the agency and responsibility <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist in reflecting these various contexts...|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the impact}} of rape, battery and robbery in this jail I came to abandon my Quaker belief in pacifism; my {{depression}} gradually changed to anger at the jail and the government in general. This {{was a turning point}} in my consciousness; I came to think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> outlaw and began to adopt jailhouse attitudes. Eventually I accepted my identity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> punk and decided {{to make the best of}} it.|$|R
2500|$|Cartwright said, [...] "When I was younger, I {{saw myself}} as a batting all-rounder, and then I started taking a few wickets and people started saying, ‘’Oh you’re a bowling all-rounder’’ because I was out of form with my batting. So it was quite hard {{to try to keep}} the idea <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> batting all-rounder in my own mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Berengarten's {{perspectives}} {{as a poet}} combine British, French, Mediterranean, Jewish, Slavic, American and Oriental influences. On his {{own work}} Berengarten says: [...] "I would rather think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> European poet who writes in English than as an 'English' poet."There is no civilisation without poetry. A poet’s responsibilities are social as well as subjective, communal as well as individual. Poetry, {{if it is not}} to caricature or betray itself, needs to involve critical commitment to both the past and future history of ‘all humanity’, and all nature. Berengarten is a popular reader of his own poetry, and a dynamic teacher.|$|E
2500|$|According to Greenwood, {{he began}} playing bass out of necessity, {{teaching}} himself by playing along to New Order, Joy Division and Otis Redding. He said: [...] "We {{were people who}} picked up their respective instruments {{because we wanted to}} play music together, rather than just because we wanted to play that particular instrument. So {{it was more of a}} collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool. I don’t think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bass player anyway. I’m just in a band with other people." [...] Among his musical influences are Booker T and the MGs, Bill Withers and Curtis Mayfield.|$|E
5000|$|Radwan {{worked at}} the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the last {{position}} he held there was that of adviser to the director general on development policies and counsellor on Arab countries. This served the dual purpose of earning him an international professional standing while keeping him, through one project after another, in more or less direct contact with Egypt: [...] "I never really thought <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> expatriate." [...] He also served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> board member of Egypt’s General Authority for Investment.|$|R
2500|$|Harris {{has been}} {{referred}} to, along with Dan Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens, {{as one of}} the [...] "new atheists", but he considers the term [...] "atheist" [...] to be problematic. He said, [...] "while I am now one of the public voices of atheism, I never thought <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> atheist before being inducted to speak as one [...] I think that 'atheist' is a term that we do not need, {{in the same way that}} we don't need a word for someone who rejects astrology." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album is}} a {{reflection}} of Reyli's love for experimentation. The 11-track album showcases ballads and songs of rock music and ranchera influence. He admitted that the album [...] "sounds harder and more-street." [...] In it, [...] "I show a little bit more <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> composer. It is a more direct disc, a mouthful of truths, a special expression of life's contrasts, with songs very rough, but also songs [...] "full of honey, of purity, like Ando por las nubes (I walk through clouds), Alma gemela (Soulmate), Cásate conmigo (Marry me); there is everything on the CD." ...|$|R
2500|$|Davis {{wrote her}} {{consumer}} books over a 40-year career, revising {{some in the}} 1970s. She saw herself as an [...] "interpreter," [...] not merely a researcher. [...] "I think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> newspaper reporter, who goes out to libraries and gathers information from hundreds of journals, which most people can't understand, and I write it {{so that people can}} understand." [...] She reviews scientific literature in the biochemical libraries at U.C.L.A., for instance. Her references for Let's Get Well totaled almost 2,500, many from cases during her nutrition practice, and she was upset when the publisher of Let's Have Healthy Children eliminated the 2,000 references from the 1972 revision, says author Daniel Yergin.|$|E
2500|$|Lynch {{has said}} that he is [...] "not a {{political}} person". However, he has expressed admiration for former US President Ronald Reagan. Describing his political philosophy, he stated, [...] "at that time, I thought <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> libertarian. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations." [...] Lynch continued to state that [...] "I don't know if there even is a Libertarian party. They wouldn't have a prayer of getting anywhere. So I'm a Democrat now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I {{think a lot of the}} Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the public}} controversy, on October 18, 2007, the Board of Trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory {{suspended}} Watson's administrative responsibilities. On October 19, Watson issued an apology; on October 25, he resigned from his position as chancellor. In 2008, Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL. As of 2009, he continues to advise and guide project work at the laboratory. In a 2008 BBC documentary, Watson said: [...] "I have never thought <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> racist. I don't {{see myself as a}} racist. I am mortified by it. It was the worst thing in my life." [...] An editorial in Nature at the time acknowledged that his remarks were [...] "beyond the pale," [...] but wished that the tour had not been cancelled so that Watson would be forced to face his critics in person, encouraging scientific discussion on the matter.|$|E
2500|$|In a press release, Fiona {{explained}} the album's title, [...] "the ‘MF’ in the album title represents my initials, {{but it also}} gets at the many facets <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist and a young woman. It {{can be viewed as}} the ‘Mighty Fine Life’ in times of triumph and success, but also the ‘Mother-F-ing Life’ when I’m dealing with frustration or misfortune. I celebrate both. I feel it would be dishonest if everything was all about glitz and glamour. It’s about the balance of life, the yin and the yang, the good and the bad, all of that." ...|$|R
40|$|In this essay, I inquire phenomenologically into {{a gesture}} that I {{performed}} and documented through photography. This gesture is significant because it has led me to consider the resistant edge <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist, researcher, and educator. It is from this resistant edge that I find myself crossing a metaphorical waterline. Waterlines mark the liminal threshold between water and air, i. e., the point of conscious awareness—of breath—below which lay the unknown. This metaphor has helped me become aware <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> artist, writer, learner, and teacher. In this art essay of my living inquiry into a performed gesture within an art installation, I discovered the waterline of a self-censored voice...|$|R

2500|$|Despite {{his having}} {{personally}} described {{his work as}} [...] "Gonzo", it fell to later observers to articulate what the term actually meant. While Thompson's approach clearly involved injecting himself as {{a participant in the}} events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. Thompson, in a 1974 interview in Playboy addressed the issue himself, saying [...] "Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then, I don't think <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reporter." [...] Tom Wolfe would later describe Thompson's style as [...] "...part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric." [...] Or as one description of the differences between Thompson and Wolfe's styles would elaborate, [...] "While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a fly in the ointment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes {{embarked}} upon a quest {{in which}} he called all his previous beliefs into doubt, {{in order to find}} out of what he could be certain. In so doing, he discovered that he could doubt whether he had a body (it could be that he was dreaming of it or that it was an illusion created by an evil demon), but he could not doubt whether he had a mind. This gave Descartes his first inkling that the mind and body were different things. The mind, according to Descartes, was a [...] "thinking thing" [...] (...) , and an immaterial substance. This [...] "thing" [...] was the essence of himself, that which doubts, believes, hopes, and thinks. The body, [...] "the thing that exists" [...] (...) , regulates normal bodily functions (such as heart and liver). According to Descartes, animals only had a body and not a soul (which distinguishes humans from animals). The distinction between mind and body is argued in Meditation VI as follows: I have a clear and distinct idea <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> thinking, non-extended thing, and a clear and distinct idea of body as an extended and non-thinking thing. Whatever I can conceive clearly and distinctly, God can so create.|$|E
2500|$|Zorn {{was quoted}} in 1998 as saying [...] "Sometimes I {{get the feeling that}} people just don't see me as a {{composer}}, but it's what I've always been since I was eight years old... I've always thought <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> composer, but the world has had a hard time looking at me as a composer because a lot of what I compose is controversial." [...] The establishment of Tzadik allowed him to release many compositions which he had been written over the previous two decades for classical ensembles. Zorn's earliest released [...] "classical" [...] composition (for five flutes), [...] "Christabel" [...] (1972) first appeared on Angelus Novus in 1998. Zorn credits the composition of his 1988 piece for string quartet [...] "Cat O' Nine Tails", commissioned and originally released by the Kronos Quartet (Short Stories), to awakening him to the possibilities of writing for classical musicians. This composition was featured on The String Quartets (1999) and Cartoon S/M (2000) along with variations on [...] "Kol Nidre", inspired by the Jewish prayer of atonement which was written {{at the same time as}} (but not part of) the first Masada Book. [...] (1998) was Zorn's first full-scale orchestral release featuring pianist Stephen Drury, the Hungarian Radio Children's Choir and the American Composers Orchestra conducted by Dennis Russell Davies.|$|E
40|$|I {{have been}} on a journey to shed old, narrow habits and find broader {{approaches}} to my artistic processes, leading to <b>a</b> complete redefinition <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist and collaborator. In the past, I spent much time setting myself firm rules for designs, which proved constricting. At UCSD I tried to shake off these patterns, discovering avenues for intuitive exploration. Found-object sculpture and puppet-creation became important to me as new arts in which to approach design. I took first steps in digital media design as well, discovering ways of working in collaboration beyond costume [...] reaching out to the environment of performance <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. Just <b>as</b> <b>a</b> puppet reaches out from its puppeteer, so too I believe projections have the ability to expand a show. "The Fantasy Project" gave me the opportunity to explore this, developing a language in which the ephemera of projection worked seamlessly within the tactility of dance. I have found ways to apply my discoveries to costume: seeking a "softer process" approach; allowing language to develop organically and the design to follow. Through conversation, new research, and allowing intuition to have a voice in my decisions, I found the designs for "Titus Andronicus" emerging naturally and powerfully. My practices in different design areas interact with each other, borderless. Just as I have learned to approach design with a more fluid and intuitively available awareness, so too has this fluidity permeated my conception <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> art-maker. I will continue from this grounding in expansion...|$|R

Life demands examination from me at inconvenient times, but {{with the intention of}} growing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person I proceed willingly, and <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist, equipped with a paintbrush. My search has led me to discover new materials and techniques and my structured self-reflection has uncovered a new source of inspiration. I now combine the physical layering of art materials with layers of personal meaning as well. My work has an autobiographical theme which I have interpreted through the filter of my sense of humor.
