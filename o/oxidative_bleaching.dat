[...] However, most photocatalyst commercial products use only a thin layer of titania (e.g. ca. 15 nm thick in self-cleaning glass) and ambient UV levels are often low (e.g. for a sunny day in the UK the UVA irradiance is only ca. 4 mW/cm2). As a consequence, the photocatalytic <b>oxidative</b> <b>bleaching</b> of methylene blue is usually very slow, taking many hours, and so inappropriate for marketing at least.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} the synthesis of sulfonamides through the combination of an organometallic reagent, a sulfur dioxide equivalent, and an aqueous solution of an amine under <b>oxidative</b> conditions (<b>bleach).</b> This simple reaction protocol avoids the need to employ sulfonyl chloride substrates, thus removing the limitation imposed by the commercial availability of these reagents.

40|$|A new technique, termed {{spatially}} resolved combing analysis, {{was employed}} to study the conditioning prop-erties of a cationic polymer on various types of hair. In this method, special frames are employed that allow {{the application of a}} treatment to selected areas of the fibers, while shielding the remaining portions as internal reference sections. The combing traces of hair treated in such a way, obtained by using a Diastron tensile tester, show positive or negative peaks depending on whether the treatment results in an increase or a decrease of friction against the hair surface. The method has higher sensitivity than previously employed procedures that involved the measurements of hair before and after conditioning of the whole tress. The conditioning of polyquaternium- 11 was evaluated on untreated, Caucasian brown hair as well as on fibers damaged by <b>oxidative</b> dyeing, <b>bleaching,</b> bleaching/dyeing, and perming. It has been shown that the conditioning effect depends on the type of hair modification. The effect of the polymer on untreated hair is relatively small and becomes apparent only after multiple shampooing, which roughens the untreated sections of hair. For dyed hair, which exhibits three to four times higher combing forces than the reference virgin hair, the adsorbed polyquaternium- 11 reduces the combing forces to the level of untreated hair. The conditioning layer of the polymer can be removed from dyed hair by one to two shampooings. The polymer showed higher substantivity for bleached and perreed hair, with the conditioning effect persisting after multiple shampooings...|$|R

Loss of chlorophyll can be initiated by several reactions, including <b>oxidative</b> <b>bleaching,</b> chlorophyllase activity, and Mg-dechelatase activity. Extracts from the Russian wheat aphid [Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) ], the bird cherry-oat aphid [Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) ], and aphid-infested and uninfested wheat plants were assayed in vitro for activities involved in chlorophyll degradation. Although the initial infestation was the same (10 apterous adults) for both aphid species, D. noxia weight {{was significantly higher than}} R. padi after feeding for 12 days. Consequently, D. noxia feeding caused greater fresh leaf weight reduction than R. padi feeding. Chlorophyll degradation assays showed no activity from either D. noxia or R. padi extracts. Plant extract assays showed a significant difference in Mg-dechelatase activity, while no difference was detected in either the chlorophyllase or <b>oxidative</b> <b>bleaching</b> pathways among the aphid-infested or uninfested plant extracts. Diuraphis noxia-infested leaf extracts showed a greater increase of Mg-dechelatase activity than either R. padi-infested or the uninfested plants.

40|$|The chlorine-Hercosett {{process has}} been {{dominant}} in the wool shrink-proofing industry for more than 30 years. Hypochlorite breaks the hydrophobic nature of wool surface; Hercosett (cationic polyamide epichlorhydrin resin) covers wool and prevents wool from shrinking. From today's modem point of view, however, the chlorineHercosett process shows a number of drawbacks which make the search for an ecologically clean alternative worthwhile: poor handle, yellowing of wool, difficulties in dyeing and most importantly today, environmental impact (rdlease of absorbable organic halogens- AOX to the effluents). As a result, many researches {{have been carried out}} for Non-AOX rapid oxidation of wool. Potassium peroxomonosulphate (PMS), hydrogen peroxide and some per acids have been concerned as possible alternatives, but only little commercial successes. It was well known that Hercosett will not deposit on the PMS or hydrogen peroxide treated wool. The key difference. in terms of polymer compatibility between chlorinated and PMS, hydrogen peroxide treated wool is the surface energy (wettability). Surface energy has influence on the spreading properties of Hercosett and wool/polymer interfacial adhesion. Resent researches have shown that this difference is associated with the removal of a fatty acid (lipid), namely IS-methyleicosanoic acid (IS-MEA), which is thought to be chemically bound to the surface of wool fibre by a thio-ester linkage. In common words, chlorination can remove this fatty acid but PMS and hydrogen peroxide treatments can not. The wool shrink-proofing research in this thesis is f<?cused on wool delipidisation. Total delipidisation (97 % of the IS-MEA was removed) is achieved by a cationic surfactant/nucleophile process. During the treatement, hydrophobic complexes between the cationic surfactant and nucleophile are formed which can diffuse into the wool lipid shell. The nucleophile will attack the eletrophilic thio-ester linkage of the wool lipid and liberate the free lipid as its carboxylate salt into water. The wool top after delipidisation, oxidative sulphitolysis and Hercosett 125 treatment shows some significant shrink resist properties when compared to the untreated wool fibre. The same wool top was spun, knitted and wash tested using the standard TM 31 wash test procedure. Such wool fabric has passed 3 x 5 A wash cycles. It was also worth mentioning that the same wool fabric has soft handle and bright shade when compared to the chlorine-Hercosett treated wool. Wool bleaching and photo-yellowing are also important subjects in wool research. The proportion of wool which is bleached is approximately IO% of the total world production. The photo-yellowing effect of ~unlighton bleached wool is greater than on untreated wool. The relationship ofwool bleaching and wool photo-yellowing is studied. FTIR studies shows that there are more wool disulphide bonds cleaved during the reduction bleaching than the oxidation bleaching. The photo-yellowing effect of sunlight on the reductive bleached wool is greater than on the <b>oxidative</b> <b>bleached</b> wool. The reduction in wool cystine residue content is a key effect in preventing photo-yellowing in bleached wool. The decomposition reaction of urea to isocyanic acid and the subsequent reaction of isocyanic acid with nucleophiles such as the hydroxyl groups in cotton cellulose are studied. The properties of the modified. carbamoylated cellulose have been investigated including the ease of bleaching it when tea stained and its dyeing properties with reactive dyes. The reaction of wool nucleophiles with isocyanic acid derived from sodium cyanate was studied. The properties of the modified wool were investigated.

40|$|From this, a {{specific}} minimum demand for energy of 0. 82 kWh/kg is calculated, {{leading to a}} maximum theoretical ozone yield of 1, 220 g/kWh. Commercially used ozone plants, however, under most favorable conditions achieve only an energy recovery of 14 % compared to the theoreti-cally possible ozone yield. The ozone generators applied so far primarily aimed at the utilization of the ozone, although it was known that ozone is highly toxic and has a half-life of more than 5 hours. Many applications utilize its toxic phase (for the killing of germs and viruses, etc.), other applications the <b>oxidative</b> phase (<b>bleaching</b> processes, industrial oxidation, etc.). Thus, tech-nical improvements mainly aimed at increasing the ozone yield. The underlying {{problem is that the}} amount of energy needed is relatively high {{due to the fact that}} the major por-tion of the energy fed into discharge is lost for the ozone synthesis, and finally is converted to heat.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} process for the {{industrial}} scale bleaching of possum fur. Research was undertaken into the bleaching of possum with regard to whiteness of final fur, damage occurring to fur and prevention of matting to fur. A process was supplied consisting of kill, mordant, oxidative bleach, strip and reductive bleach steps. This process produced fur with a loss of around 9. 5 % and alkali solubility of around 70 %. Improvements made to this process gave a loss of around 5 % and alkali solubility of around 50 %. The main alterations made to the process were (i) Changing the reducing agent and pH of the mordant and lengthening this stage. (ii) Altering the temperature, time and pH of the oxidative bleach. (iii) Shortening the strip stage (iv) Altering the reagent system of the reductive bleach The displacement bleaching system used was found to be successful in preventing matting of the fibre provided care is taken in transferring the wet fur for drying. The main difficulty encountered in scaling up the laboratory process was a compression of the fur during <b>oxidative</b> <b>bleaching</b> resulting in a build up of pressure and flow problems through the fur. This {{is due in part to}} the hollow nature of possum fibre which gives it a large degree of buoyancy and the swelling of the fibres during <b>oxidative</b> <b>bleaching.</b> Changes in the surface chemistry of the fibres occurring during <b>oxidative</b> <b>bleaching</b> are also thought to play some part since these problems are not encountered with fibre which has undergone a successful oxidative bleach. These problems were countered by using a shallower bed of fur for bleaching, reducing the flowrate through the fur and reducing the temperature of the oxidative bleach to give a more gradual bleach. These modifications allowed the successful bleaching of a 3. 5 kg batch of fur. A larger scale pilot plant for the bleaching of 15 kg batches was constructed. An attempted run on this plant using the conditions developed in the smaller plant was unsuccessful. It was specified that the lid on the top of the plant be clamped in place however this was not undertaken as a cost and time saving measure. This then came unstuck during bleaching leading to the overflow of the vessel. Further work is required to optimise the lower temperature oxidative bleach. With this undertaken it is recommended that the lid be clamped into place on the larger plant and the design parameters determined on the smaller plant verified before further scale-up is attempted.

Russian wheat aphid [Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) ] feeding caused significant losses of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids in the damaged regions. However, bird cherry-oat aphid [Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) ] feeding did not, except a significantly lower level of carotenoids was observed in the damaged regions from the short-infestation (6 -day) samples. Interestingly, the non-damaged regions of D. noxia-infested leaves on both sampling dates had a significant increase of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoid concentrations {{when compared with the}} uninfested leaves. Although D. noxia feeding did not cause any changes in either chlorophyll a/b or chlorophyll (a + b) /carotenoid ratio between the damaged and non-damaged leaf regions on short-infestation (6 -day) samples, a significantly lower chlorophyll a/b ratio was detected in long-infestation (12 -day) samples. The assays of chlorophyllase and <b>oxidative</b> <b>bleaching</b> activities showed {{no significant differences between the}} damaged and non-damaged regions of the infested leaves on either sampling date. Mgdechelatase activity, however, was significantly higher in D. noxia-damaged than non-damaged leaf regions from the short-infestation samples, while no differences were detected from the long-infestation samples. Furthermore, the long-infestation samples showed that Mg-dechelatase activity from both D. noxia-damaged and non-damaged regions increased significantly in comparison with the respective regions of either uninfested or R. padi-infested leaves. We infer that non-damaged regions of D. noxia-infested leaves compensate for the pigment losses in the damaged regions, and that Mg-dechelatase activity changed dynamically from a localized response to a systemic response as infestation duration extends. The findings from this study on cereal aphid-elicited chlorosis (or desistance) would help us to elucidate plant resistance mechanisms, in particular plant tolerance to non-defoliating herbivory...|$|E
40|$|The {{final stage}} of edible soybean oil {{manufacture}} is refining, the most delicate phase of which is bleaching. At this step, undesirable substances are removed, such as pigments, traces of metals, phospholipids and certain degradation products. However, certain valua-ble compounds such as tocopherols and sterols may also be removed, significant loss of oxidative stability can occur, and fatty acid content may increase. To avoid these negative oil changes, bleaching parameters such as the concentration of bleaching clay, temperature and duration should be optimized. Since bleaching conditions depend on {{the properties of the}} bleaching clay {{as well as on the}} type of crude oil, bleaching parameters should be opti-mized with different types of clay for each vegetable oil.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{are thought to}} play a major role in cell death {{pathways}} and bleaching in scleractinian corals. Direct measurements of ROS in corals are conspicuously in short supply, partly due to inherent problems with ROS quantification in cellular systems. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we characterized the dynamics of the reactive oxygen species superoxide anion radical (O(2) (-)) in the external milieu of the coral Stylophora pistillata. Using a sensitive, rapid and selective chemiluminescence-based technique, we measured extracellular superoxide production and detoxification activity of symbiont (non-bleached) and aposymbiont (bleached) corals, and of cultured Symbiodinium (from clades A and C). Bleached and non-bleached Stylophora fragments were found to produce superoxide at comparable rates of 10 (- 11) - 10 (- 9) mol O(2) (-) mg protein(- 1) min(- 1) in the dark. In the light, a two-fold enhancement in O(2) (-) production rates was observed in non-bleached corals, but not in bleached corals. Cultured Symbiodinium produced superoxide in the dark at a rate of. Light was found to markedly enhance O(2) (-) production. The NADPH Oxidase inhibitor Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) strongly inhibited O(2) (-) production by corals (and more moderately by algae), possibly suggesting an involvement of NADPH Oxidase in the process. An extracellular O(2) (-) detoxifying activity was found for bleached and non-bleached Stylophora but not for Symbiodinium. The O(2) (-) detoxifying activity was partially characterized and found to resemble that of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of substantial extracellular O(2) (-) production as well as extracellular O(2) (-) detoxifying activity may shed light on the chemical interactions between the symbiont and its host and between the coral and its environment. Superoxide production by Symbiodinium possibly implies that algal bearing corals are more susceptible to an internal build-up of O(2) (-), which may in turn be linked to <b>oxidative</b> stress mediated <b>bleaching...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of paper {{can be improved}} greatly by incorporating clay fillers into the paper sheet or applying a clay coating on the paper surface. Filled paper has considerable advantages over unfilled paper including better optical and printing properties. Fundamental studies on aqueous systems containing fibres, fillers and retention aids {{have been carried out}} in order to develop {{a better understanding of the}} way in which clay fillers are incorporated into the paper sheet. This study has concentrated on the binding of clay to high yield pulp fibres produced from Eucalyptus species and Pinus radiata using cationic retention aids. Scanning electron microscopy shows that the kaolin particles tend to coat the pulp fibres rather than forming aggregates. The surface coverage of kaolin on the fibres can be correlated with the pH of the pulp suspension and is also dependant on ionic strength. Differences in surface area of pulps caused by fibrillation also affect the binding of clay fillers to high yield pulps. FTIR microscopy and FTIR-ATR spectroscopy have been used to look at different fibre types and their admixtures with kaolin. The FTIR studies have shown the presence of kaolin in filled paper from its characteristic peaks. The binding of the retention aid on model surfaces for high yield pulps has also been studied by in situ FUR- ATR spectroscopy. The surface charge of the pulps is important in determining the conditions when deposition of filler particles on the pulp fibres occurs. The surface charge as a function of pH and ionic strength of both bleached and unbleached mechanical and chemical pulps produced from Eucalyptus species and P. radiata have been determined using potentiometric titration. The effects of the retention of lignin and hetnicellulose during high yield pulping were evaluated by comparison of the surface {{properties of}} the high yield pulps with those of bleached and unbleached eucalypt and P. radiata lcraft pulps. High yield pulps are commonly <b>bleached</b> by <b>oxidative</b> lignin-retaining <b>bleaching</b> methods. The effect of these bleaching procedures on the surface chemistry of these pulps was studied by surface titration, determination of total acid group content and ultraviolet-visible and FTIR spectroscopy. The high yield eucalypt pulps have higher surface charges and acid group contents than the high yield P. radiata pulps. The surface charge and acid group contents of both high yield pulp types increase on peroxide bleaching. The unbleached eucalypt and P. radiata high yield pulps have considerably higher surface charges and higher acid group contents than the corresponding 'craft pulps. The surface charges of the high yield pulps increase on peroxide bleaching while the surface charges of the kraft pulps decrease on chlorine/chlorine dioxide bleaching. The differences in behaviour between the different pulp types can be explained by the different lignin and hemicellulose contents and differences in the structure of the lignin and hemicellulose components. Oxidative reactions on peroxide bleaching lead to the increased acid group content and increased surface charge. The adsorption of cationic retention aids on the pulps can be correlated with their surface charge...|$|R

40|$|The acid {{hydrogen}} peroxide system {{has the potential}} to significantly reduce the specific energy consumption in the production of softwood thermomechanical pulps (TMPs). A drawback of the chemical system is discoloration of the pulp during refining. The work presented in this study evaluates the possibility to regain the lost brightness by washing, chelating and sodium dithionite or {{hydrogen peroxide}} bleaching of the treated pulps. A washing or chelating procedure can reduce the metal ion content of the chemically treated TMPs considerably, though brightness can be increased by a maximum of two ISO units. The amount of iron can be further reduced to a level similar to that of untreated pulps by performing a reducing agent-assisted chelating stage (Q(Y)) with dithionite. The discoloration cannot,, however, be completely eliminated. The brightness decrease-of the treated pulps is thus not only caused by higher iron content in the pulp, but is also dependent on the type of iron compound and/or other coloured compounds connected with the acid hydrogen peroxide treatment. <b>Oxidative</b> <b>bleaching</b> with hydrogen peroxide (P) is more effective than reductive bleaching with sodium dithionite in regaining the brightness lost during the energy reductive treatment.

30|$|Denim as a fabric, has {{received}} the widest acceptance among all textile products. It has had an incredible influence on consumers both socially and culturally (Paul 2015). This twill cotton fabric usually has warp threads indigo dyed while weft remains plain white. The warp faced fabric therefore looks blue {{on one side and}} white on reverse. The warp being ring dyed, creates denim‚Äôs fading characteristics, which is unique compared to every other textile material. With changing times, many new variants of denim came into existence. Denim washing {{is one of the key}} areas in getting the faded look. Earlier stone washing used to be done to achieve soft feel and the desired appearance. During washing, the pumice stone, scraps off the dye particles from the yarn surface in the denim fabric. Due to the ring dyeing of denim fabric and heavy abrasion during stone washing process, the faded effect is achieved. <b>Oxidative</b> <b>bleaching</b> agent with or without the addition of stones have also been used to get fading effect. Difficulty in removing residual pumice from fabric, damage to equipment and clogging of machine drainage passage due to particulate material proved to be major drawbacks with the technique (Heikinheimo et al. 2000). Later on use of enzymes became a sustainable option to get the worn out look in denim. The enzymes used are cellulase enzymes, specifically acting on the cellulose part, mainly on the surface of the fabric. This gives the desired look and at the same time, removes hairiness from surface thus giving a smooth and soft feel. Enzymes are substrate specific in their action, unaffecting the others. They are primarily used in textiles to promote hydrolysis of the required substrate (Patra 2003).|$|E
40|$|Carried {{out under}} the European Project SusFoFlex, this study aimed the {{investigation}} and selection of different agro-food by-products for the recovery of antioxidants and cellulose to be further exploited for application {{in the development of}} innovative and sustainable food packaging materials. Based on literature data and partners' countries availability, four by-products were considered: brewers' spent grains, wheat straw, hazelnut shells and orange peels. A common process for the production of antioxidant extracts (a two-step hydro alcoholic solvent extraction) and another for the fractionation of cellulose (an acid hydrolysis step followed by an alkali hydrolysis and, then, an <b>oxidative</b> <b>bleaching</b> step) was applied to all the materials with the objective of selecting ideally a unique by-product for the production of both antioxidants and cellulose. The extracts were characterised in terms of total phenols content (based on Folin assay and expressed as gallic acid equivalents) and antioxidant activity (evaluated with both the radical ABTS test and the Ferric Reducing/Antioxidant Power assay). The highest total phenols recovery was obtained for orange peels (9. 50 ¬± 0. 66 mg per g of dried by-product), while the yields for the other byproducts were not statistically different and ‚â§ 2 mg/g. Regarding the antioxidant activity, all the extracts showed very similar results with the ABTS assay, whereas orange peels extract exhibited the highest level of FRAP activity. The obtained cellulose residues were analysed for the total cellulose content and the level of lignin and hemicellulose impurities. In this case, the best by-product resulted wheat straw, with the recovery of 45 % of the original cellulose, a cellulose content (purity) of 84 % and residual impurities of hemicelluloses and lignin of 2 % and 12 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Rose apple or jambu (Syzygium jambos L.), Surinam cherry (Eugenia uniflora L.) are {{tropical}} fruits from Madeira Island. Rose apple is reddish and rose-scented while Surinam cherry {{is a small}} eight-ribbed fruit, {{of about}} 2 - 3 cm and ranges from orange to red colour. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate their antioxidant activity using two methods, Œ≤-carotene bleaching assay and 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH‚Ä¢) scavenging assay. The extract concentration providing 50 % inhibition of DPPH radical (EC 50) was calculated from the graph of scavenging effect percentage against extract concentration in the solution. The Œ≤-carotene bleaching assay studied the ability of the extracts to avoid the <b>oxidative</b> <b>bleaching</b> of Œ≤-carotene in a Œ≤-carotene/linoleic acid emulsion. DPPH‚Ä¢ reduction assay showed higher antioxidant activity of Surinam cherry (EC 50 = 3. 74 ¬± 0. 09 mg/mL) than Rose apple (EC 50 = 10. 0 ¬± 0. 21 mg/mL). Œ≤-carotene bleaching assay showed an antioxidant activity capacity (AAC) also higher for Surinam cherry (AAC= 831. 5) than for Rose apple (AAC= 582. 5). Surinam cherry showed better antioxidant capacity in both trials. Madeira Island has many tropical fruits with antioxidant activity, which could improve health status, by preventing diseases caused by oxidative stress, since these bioactive compounds can help to counteract the oxidizing agents. The results of this study indicate that both Rose apple and Surinam cherry have potential as antioxidants sources. In the future more research is needed in order to identify the compounds responsible for the antioxidant properties.

Background: Current techniques for intra-coronal bleaching of stained root-filled teeth employ <b>oxidative</b> <b>bleaching</b> with hydrogen peroxide. However, concern over the potential for invasive cervical resorption following the use of hydrogen peroxide has been expressed by many researchers, and recommendations {{have been made to}} limit the use of this agent. A reductive-oxidative bleaching process using a thiourea and hydrogen peroxide regimen is proposed as an effective and safer bleaching combination. The efficacy of this novel bleaching regimen is evaluated in this study. Methods: The study involved a quantitative and qualitative spectrophotometric assessment of the ability of two amine (bleaching) agents, aqueous thiourea and acidified thiourea, to alter the absorption spectra of haemoglobin and methaemoglobin compared to hydrogen peroxide. In addition, extracted premolar teeth discoloured by blood were subjected to different bleaching regimens using amine reducing agents and hydrogen peroxide. The change in the colour of the bloodstained dentine samples was measured at each stage of the bleaching process with a Photometer and Reflectance Densitometer. Comparisons of different treatments were made using a method of least significant difference and/or analysis of variance. Results: Spectrophotometric studies showed that acidified thiourea solution greatly reduced the colour of the haemoglobin and methaemoglobin in the visible range (330 ‚Äì 760 nm). Aqueous thiourea had no effect on the presence of haemoglobin and methaemoglobin. Reflection Densitometer and Photometer scores indicate that the greatest bleaching effect was achieved by the combined acidified thiourea and hydrogen peroxide regimen. Conclusion: The recognition that bleaching discoloured teeth is a chemical process, which can be achieved by both reducing and oxidizing agents, offers the possibility of developing new and safer clinical bleaching protocols. It is concluded that the bleaching regimen which employs the sequential use of 0. 1 M acidified thiourea and 30 % w/v hydrogen peroxide is as effective at bleaching bloodstained dentine as 30 % w/v hydrogen peroxide alone. However, the addition of thiourea to the bleaching regimen has the potential benefit of reducing the level of damaging hydroxyl radicals and achieving a safer bleaching process. K.

40|$|The {{potential}} of using acid hydrogen peroxide under Fenton conditions {{to lower the}} electrical energy consumed during the production of Black spruce (Picea mariana) thermomechanical pulp (TMP) was investigated. The chemical system, which consisted of ferrous sulphate, hydrogen peroxide and optionally an enhancer (3, 4 -dimethoxybenzyl alcohol, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or oxalic acid/sodium oxalate), was evaluated as an inter-stage treatment where the primary refiner {{was used as a}} mixer. The produced TMPs were thoroughly characterised in order to explain the effect of the chemical system on fibre development {{and to be able to}} propose a mechanism for the impact on refining energy reduction. The possibility to improve the optical properties by washing, chelating and sodium dithionite or hydrogen peroxide bleaching the treated pulps was evaluated. ¬† The results obtained in a pilot plant trial show that it is possible to significantly reduce the comparative specific energy consumption by approximately 20 % and 35 % at a freeness value of 100 ml CSF or a tensile index of 45 Nm/g by using 1 % and 2 % hydrogen peroxide respectively. The energy reduction is obtained without any substantial change in the fractional composition of the pulp, though tear strength is slightly reduced, as are brightness and pulp yield. No major differences between the reference pulp and the chemically treated pulps were found with respect to fibre length, width or cross-sectional dimensions. However, the acid hydrogen peroxide-treated pulps tend to have more collapsed fibres, higher flexibility, a larger specific surface area and a lower coarseness value. The yield loss accompanying the treatment is mainly a consequence of degraded hemicelluloses. It was also found that the total charge of the chemically treated pulps is higher compared to the reference pulps, something that may have influenced the softening behaviour of the fibre wall. ¬† A washing or chelating procedure can reduce the metal ion content of the chemically treated TMPs considerably. The amount of iron can be further reduced to a level similar to that of untreated pulps by performing a reducing agent-assisted chelating stage (QY) with dithionite.

The system of lignocellulosicmaterial, a Norway spruce (Picea abies) TMP, and Fenton chemistry was alsoevaluated in a model study to understand more about how conditions such as e. g. initial pH, dissolved organic material and reaction time affect the reactions. Ferrous and ferric ions (free and chelated) and different anions were evaluated. Moreover, it was examined whether hydroxyl radicals could be detected andmonitored. The results obtained in pilot scale showed that it is possible to significantly reducethe specific energy consumption by approximately 20 % and 35 % at a freenessvalue of 100 ml CSF or a tensile index of 45 Nm/g by using 1 % and 2 % hydrogenperoxide respectively.

From the model study and by using a chemiluminescence method, it could beconcluded that hydroxyl radicals were present in the system of Fenton chemicalsand lignocellulosic material (TMP). Initial pH, retention time, pulp consistency,type of catalyst (free or chelated) and dissolved organic material had an impact onthe reactions between TMP and acid hydrogen peroxide. Different anions(sulphate, nitrate and chloride) of ferric ion salt gave a similar catalytic effect. There appeared to be more reactions with the TMP when there was less dissolvedorganic material in the liquid phase from the start. A catalyst of ferrous sulphatehad a greater impact on the pulp (increased total fibre charge and carbonyl groups,more dissolved organic material in filtrate) than ferric ions chelated withethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at an initial pH of about 3 - 7. If using ferric-EDG(ethanol diglycinic acid) as catalyst, the measured effect on the pulp was similar orless compared to using ferrous sulphate. Ferric-EDG, however, gave higherhydrogen peroxide consumption and more detectable hydroxyl radicals than usingferrous sulphate (initial pH 5 - 8). It is likely that the iron catalyst must bind to theTMP, or be in close proximity to it, for the hydroxyl radicals to be able to react withthe material. A mechanism was proposed: the hydroxyl radicals generated in the Fentonreaction will probably attack and oxidise the available outer fibre surfaces,weakening these layers, and simultaneously dissolve some of the organic material. This can facilitate fibre development, give a better bonding pulp and reduce theelectrical energy required during refining...|$|E
