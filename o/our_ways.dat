The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued {{to his or her}} credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> later, rather than immediately, here and now).|$|E

2500|$|Politically, Seger has {{characterized}} {{himself as a}} centrist: [...] " [...] right down the middle", he remarked. He supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. He tackled antiestablishment themes in early songs such as [...] "2+2=?" [...] (1968) and [...] "U.M.C. (Upper Middle Class)" [...] (1974), according to Brian McCollum of the Detroit Free Press. On his 2014 album Ride Out, he addressed topics such as gun violence, and wrote [...] "It's Your World" [...] about climate change. On the subject, he said, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} culprits in climate change, and everybody's responsible, myself included. Nobody gets a free pass on this one.

2500|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} people should not {{entertain}} the foolish thesis {{that at the time}} of their creation, God decrees whether they will be righteous or wicked (what some call [...] "predestination"). Rather, each person is fit to be righteous or wicked. Jeremiah implied this in [...] "From the mouth of the Most High, neither evil nor good come forth." [...] Accordingly, sinners, themselves, cause their own loss. It is thus proper for people to mourn for their sins and for the evil consequences that they have brought upon their own souls. Jeremiah continues that since free choice is in our hands and our own decision prompts us to commit wrongs, it is proper for us to repent and abandon our wickedness, for the choice is in our hands. This is implied by [...] "Let us search and examine <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> and return [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Jesus was {{instrumental}} [...] {{in changing the}} Torah and causing the world to err and serve another beside God. But it is beyond the human mind to fathom the designs of our Creator, for <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> are not God's ways, neither are our thoughts His. All these matters relating to Jesus of Nazareth, and the Ishmaelite [...] who came after him, only served {{to clear the way}} for the Jewish Messiah to prepare the whole world to worship God with one accord, as it is written 'For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they all call upon the name of the Lord to serve Him with one consent.' (...) [...] Thus the Jewish hope, and the Torah, and the commandments have become familiar topics of conversation among those even on far isles, and among many people, uncircumcised of flesh and heart. (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, XI.4.) ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{decades after}} his death the {{attitude}} of critics toward Leskov and his legacy varied. Despite {{the fact that some}} of his sharpest satires could be published only after the 1917 Revolution, Soviet literary propaganda found little of use in Leskov's legacy, often labeling the author a [...] "reactionary" [...] who had [...] "denied the possibility of social revolution," [...] placing too much attention on saintly religious types. For highlighting the author's 'progressive' inclinations [...] "Leftie" [...] (a [...] "glorification of Russian inventiveness and talent") and [...] "The Toupee Artist" [...] (a [...] "denunciation of the repressive nature of Tsarist Russia") were invariably chosen. [...] "He is a brilliant author, an insightful scholar of <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> of life, and still he's not being given enough credit", Maxim Gorky wrote in 1928, deploring the fact that after the 1917 Revolution Leskov was still failing to gain ground in his homeland as a major classic.|$|E
