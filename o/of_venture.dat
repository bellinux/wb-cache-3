5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack <b>of</b> <b>venture</b> capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E

The role of corporate entrepreneurs in cognitively constructing and configuring specific elements that remain as fundamental features of these units is proposed. The instrumental cases of the foundation <b>of</b> two <b>venturing</b> units by their parent corporations are employed to illustrate how founding elements constructed as an outcome of the corporate entrepreneurs’ sensemaking and sensegiving process imprint the postfounding behavior <b>of</b> the <b>venturing</b> units...|$|R
40|$|The central {{interest}} of this thesis is the emergence <b>of</b> social  <b>ventures.</b> In this regard, it investigates {{two types of}} questions: what regional factors influence the emergence <b>of</b> social  <b>ventures?</b> and what  types of interaction may emerge between the emergence <b>of</b> social  <b>ventures</b> and the demography (entry,  exit  and migration) <b>of</b> commercial <b>ventures</b> in a region? The thesis also aims to adopt a macro-oriented approach to studying the research questions. To  answer  those  questions, this  thesis  applies  both  theoretical  and empirical  analysis.   For the theoretical analysis, instead of a single theory it applies three middle-range theories: theory of organisational ecology, market failure theory, and the demand and supply theory of  entrepreneurship. The empirical analysis is based on two large-scale databases from  Sweden  and  the U. S. The Swedish database includes nonprofit social ventures and commercial ventures for the 1990 - 2014 period {{from all of the}} 290 municipalities across Sweden, while the database from U. S. includes 88 counties in the State of Ohio between 2003 - 2007. The answers to the research questions are presented in the form of six papers. Paper 1 provides an overall picture of the different possible functions <b>of</b> social <b>ventures</b> within communities and  their contributions to regional development. With this overall view, Papers 2 and 3 answer the  first  research question, that is the factors influencing the emergence <b>of</b> social <b>ventures.</b> Thus, while  Paper 2 provides a review of previous research, Paper 3 empirically examines some of  the  regional factors that may influence the emergence <b>of</b> social <b>ventures</b> in a region. The  results of Paper 3 revealed that factors such as gender, education, entrepreneurial role models, wealth, unemployment rate, age, and urbanisation positively influence the emergence rate of the <b>of</b> social <b>venture</b> in a region. Papers 4, 5 and 6 are dedicated to answering the second type of research question, in other  words the interaction between the emergence of  social ventures and the demography (entry, exit and migration) <b>of</b> commercial <b>ventures.</b> As such, Paper 4 studies how the emergence <b>of</b> social <b>ventures</b> is influenced by the entry and exit <b>of</b> commercial <b>ventures,</b> Paper 5 investigates how the emergence <b>of</b> social <b>ventures</b> influences the entry of commercial ixventures, and Paper 6 examines how the emergence <b>of</b> social <b>ventures</b> influences the migration <b>of</b> commercial  <b>ventures.</b> In summary, the results of these three papers reveal that while the emergence <b>of</b> social <b>ventures</b> negatively influences the commercial ventures inside a region, it has a positive  influence on the commercial ventures outside the region. Paper 6 further investigates the influence of the emergence <b>of</b> commercial <b>ventures</b> on the migration <b>of</b> commercial <b>ventures.</b>   The results show that while the emergence <b>of</b> social <b>ventures</b> attracts commercial ventures from outside into a region, the emergence <b>of</b> commercial <b>ventures</b> repels them from moving into the region.
