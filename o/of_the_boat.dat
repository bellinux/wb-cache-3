5|$|Rowing at Georgetown has a {{distinguished}} history {{dating back to}} the founding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boat</b> Club in 1876. The team was however suspended from 1909 to 1920 due to lack of interest, and involvement in World War I. Georgetown added a men's lightweight team in 1963, a women's team in 1975, and a women's lightweight team in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately, Hoagie {{escapes from}} the shark. Jake and Mike hastily put {{together}} an explosive powered by electrical impulses. They begin blasting the shark with the impulses, which begin to drive it mad; it repeatedly {{jumps out of the}} water, roaring in pain. As Jake moves to the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> the shark lunges, giving it the chance to pull Jake under and maul him. He manages to get the explosive into the shark's mouth before he is taken underwater.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the next}} three weeks, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> lost contact with each other, and {{numerous}} occupants died. Rogerson had hoped to prevent <b>the</b> dispersal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> {{for as long as}} possible, but as the situation worsened, he was compelled to allow one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faster <b>boats,</b> which was short of supplies and taking on water, to press on ahead. <b>The</b> <b>boats</b> also suffered damage, with rudders or masts being broken, causing some to lag behind. Eventually, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> had lost sight of each other and proceeding alone.|$|R
50|$|While a {{lifeboat}} drill {{had been}} {{conducted by the}} crew {{a week before the}} fateful voyage, only five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> had been lowered in <b>the</b> drill. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> should have been tested, the board argued.|$|R
5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, the hull <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> could be worn as a cloak, the oar {{used as a}} walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This {{was followed by a}} two-man craft that was small enough to fit into a knapsack, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, Karanj {{was badly}} damaged after a {{collision}} with the destroyer Ranjit when she surfaced directly below the ship. As no drawings of the damaged portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> were available with the Bombay Dockyard or the Indian Navy, {{it was decided to}} use Kursura, which was already docked at Bombay, as the design template for the metal work, and Karanj was repaired within months, in time to join the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.|$|E
5|$|In mid 1962, {{the wreck}} of U-20 was {{discovered}} in the northern Adriatic. Italian salvage crews raised the boat's rear portion on 22 July and her front section on 21 November. The conning tower and a small midships section of U-20 were donated to the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum in Vienna, where they are on display, while the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was scrapped.

40|$|Behavioral {{responses}} by Sotalia guianensis dolphins in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> touristic sea traffic in <b>the</b> bay <b>of</b> Curral, Pipa-RN, Brazil, were measured. The dolphins changed their behavior when boats were closer than 100 meters. The main behavioral alterations {{were that the}} dolphins remained submerged for longer and that they formed a more cohesive group as <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> came closer. Although we concluded that <b>the</b> approach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> changed <b>the</b> dolphins’ behavioral pattern, {{we do not know}} what aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> caused <b>the</b> avoidance. We believe that <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> is probably responsible for repelling the animals...|$|R

5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the shortcomings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to. King solved this problem with a steel wire that stretched from bow to stern, to which he clipped a harness. His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Puerto Escondido, they {{continued}} {{up the coast}} to Loreto, where they restocked their supplies. They then visited the Coronado Islands, Concepcíon Bay and San Lucas Cove, collecting specimens at each stop. The work was exhausting; Steinbeck wrote in his letters that he had little time for sleep because the collecting and preparation took so long. In the cramped quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> all the equipment had {{to be set up}} and stowed each time the boat moved to a new anchorage, which made the work of cataloguing and processing the specimens doubly arduous.|$|E
5|$|Still {{relatively}} inexperienced, Low ordered {{too many}} {{men to the}} outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> {{to work on the}} buildup, and the Rose Pink tipped over too far. The portholes had been left open, and the vessel took on water and sank, with the death of two men. The Rose Pink had been carrying most of the provisions, and Low—by now captaining a captured schooner, the Squirrel—and his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water to half a pint (around 275ml) per man, per day.|$|E

5|$|The first {{club was}} founded as Naples Foot-Ball & Cricket Club in 1904 by English sailor William Poths and his {{associate}} Hector M. Bayon. Neapolitans such as Conforti, Catterina and Amedeo Salsi were also involved, {{the latter of}} whom was the club's first president. The original kit of the club was a sky blue and navy blue striped shirt, with black shorts. Naples' first match was a 3–2 win against the English crew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> Arabik with goals from MacPherson, Scafoglio and Chaudoir. The name of the club was shortened to Naples Foot-Ball Club in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks of}} pursuit from 25 May until 17 June placed an {{enormous}} strain on U-853s crew.

50|$|At first, it was {{suggested}} that a mechanical failure in at least one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> led them to the Iranian waters, then it was verified that both boats returned to base under their own power.

5|$|At 07:15 UTC on 14 November 1963, {{the cook}} of Ísleifur II, a trawler sailing these same waters spotted a rising column of dark smoke {{southwest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> The captain {{thought it might}} have been a boat on fire, and ordered the vessel to investigate. Instead, they encountered explosive eruptions giving off black columns of ash, indicating that a volcanic eruption had begun to penetrate the surface of the sea. By 11:00 the same day, the eruption column had reached several kilometres in height. At first the eruptions took place at three separate vents along a northeast by southwest trending fissure, but by the afternoon the separate eruption columns had merged into one along the erupting fissure. Over the next week, explosions were continuous, and after just a few days the new island, formed mainly of scoria, measured over 500metres (1640ft) in length and had reached a height of 45metres (147ft).|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, sailors on the USS America (CV-66) {{spent about}} 1,700hours to assist Guantánamo Bay in recovery. The sole {{survivor}} of the sinking boat carrying Cuban exiles was tried in a military tribunal. The man was {{held responsible for the}} 44boat deaths and was quickly executed. The United States Coast Guard deployed boats, helicopters, and airplanes to find victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> capsized in the Straits of Florida. In the United States, the price for lettuce and tomatoes rose due to Inez's crop damage in Florida and reduced crop output in California. The country's military sent helicopters and planes to join the Mexican Air Force, as well as trucks by land, to deliver tons of supplies, including food, clothing, and medicine to flood-affected areas in Tamaulipas. In the weeks after the storm, many residents had minimal food access, and some areas remained flooded. Conditions in Tampico, located near where the storm moved ashore, gradually returned to normal. Heavy rainfall in Mexico restored reservoirs, which assisted future crop growing.|$|E
5|$|Old Members of {{the college}} who rowed when they were {{students}} can join the Cadwallader Club. The club, which was revitalised in 1974 and organises an annual dinner for members, also receives contributions for the Cadwallader Trust; {{this has been a}} registered charity since December 1982 and supports rowing at the college both with capital expenditure and training costs. In the year ending 5 April 2008, the trust's expenditure was £19,001. Members of the Cadwallader Club have helped to provide new boats and blades for the men's and the women's 1st VIIIs, and on the Saturday of Eights Week 2008, the trust presented the boat club with a new coxed four, named Cadwallader. Cadwallader Club members are also non-voting members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> club.|$|E

5|$|On {{behalf of}} Stern, in January 1973 Heidemann photographed the Carin II, a yacht that {{formerly}} belonged to Göring. The boat {{was in a}} poor state of repair and expensive to maintain, but Heidemann took a mortgage on his Hamburg flat and purchased it. While researching {{the history of the}} yacht, Heidemann interviewed Göring's daughter, Edda, after which the couple began an affair. Through this relationship and his ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> he was introduced to a circle of former Nazis. He began to hold parties on the Carin II, with the former SS generals Karl Wolff and Wilhelm Mohnke as the guests of honour. Wolff and Mohnke were witnesses at Heidemann's wedding to his third wife in 1979; the couple went on honeymoon to South America accompanied by Wolff, where they met more ex-Nazis, including Walter Rauff and Klaus Barbie, who were both wanted in the West for war crimes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 12 May, U-6 headed out to try to {{intercept}} shipping between Santa Maria di Leuca and Valona. Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Falkhausen, U-6s commander since November 1915, attempted to pass underneath two drifters that formed {{a part of the}} Otranto Barrage. While submerged, von Falkhausen heard an unexplained noise on the hull <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> which was likely the sound of U-6 fouling one of the anti-submarine nets deployed from the drifter Calistoga. The drifter's skipper was alerted to the submarine's presence when one of the indicator buoys had fired. Calistoga launched signal flares that attracted the attention of two nearby drifters Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II. In the meantime, von Falkhausen surfaced U-6 to try to cut loose the buoy being dragged behind his boat. When the hatch was opened, the crew discovered the boat entangled in the net.|$|E
5|$|Shooting in Venice {{took place}} on August 8. For scenes such as Indiana and Brody {{greeting}} Elsa, shots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> chase, and Kazim telling Indiana where his father is, Robert Watts gained control of the Grand Canal from 7 am to 1 pm, sealing off tourists {{for as long as}} possible. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe positioned the camera to ensure no satellite dishes would be visible. San Barnaba di Venezia served as the library's exterior. The next day, filming moved to the ancient city of Petra, Jordan, where Al Khazneh (The Treasury) stood in for the temple housing the Grail. The cast and crew became guests of King Hussein and Queen Noor. The Treasury had previously appeared in Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger. The main cast completed their scenes that week, after 63 days of filming.|$|E
