However, <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> connectivity between <b>the</b> fractures and their measurement techniques, and its application in modelling {{are still under}} great debate. Various studies indicated that <b>the</b> aquifers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basement complex rocks in Kano are regolith and the fractures are connected at various depths.

5|$|Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee {{presented}} the Standard Template Library to the C++ standards committee in March 1994. The library received preliminary approval, {{although a few}} issues were raised. In particular, Stepanov was requested to make the library containers independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> memory model, {{which led to the}} creation of allocators. Consequently, all of the STL container interfaces had to be rewritten to accept allocators.|$|E
5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL). They were {{originally}} intended as a means to make the library more flexible and independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> memory model, allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types with the library. However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction of the memory model would incur unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E

30|$|Cognitive {{radio is}} a {{promising}} wireless technology to resolve <b>the</b> growing scarcity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indispensable electromagnetic spectrum resources. In cognitive radio, secondary users (SUs) detect spectrum holes in their radio environment for data transmission, while primary users (PUs) {{use their own}} licensed spectrum band [1]. CR techniques for spectrum access (SA) are generally classified as underlay SA, overlay SA, and interweave SA [2]. Among it, <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> SA has higher flexibility since it focuses on specific power control for satisfying a required interference to the PUs. Hence, the other {{can be understood as}} <b>the</b> special cases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> SA. Basically, <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> SA allows simultaneous transmission of SUs and PUs by sharing the spectrum as long as the interference to PUs during the secondary transmission is under a predefined threshold level called interference temperature [3]. Thus, to reduce the interference to PUs in a manner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> SA is a critical issue.|$|R
