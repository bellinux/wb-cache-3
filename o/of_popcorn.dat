5|$|Mike and Dave witness {{one of the}} klowns using shadow puppets {{to shrink}} {{a crowd of people}} into the palm of its hand, then dump them into a sack <b>of</b> <b>popcorn,</b> {{revealed}} to be sentient creatures that eagerly gobble up the human prey. Back at the police station, Mooney is innundated with calls from townspeople reporting incidents with the klowns, but he dismisses all of them. Soon after, a klown arrives at the station and Mooney arrests it, believing it to be a teen prankster. Dave returns to the station to find two prisoners encased in cocoons, and the now escaped klown using a deceased Mooney as a ventriloquist's dummy. Dave shoots the klown several times before destroying its nose, which causes it to spin wildly and explode.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Nigel Dick and was filmed from 4 to 6 October 1999 at the Mission Tiki drive-in theatre in Montclair, California. In the video, Raven sings the song while {{she is in a}} car with a boy, while Larsen sings and plays the guitar in front of another car. This footage is mixed with M2M singing together at the drive-in, people dancing, the projectionist struggling with his malfunctioning equipment, and the concession stand worker who has an overflowing popcorn maker. When the popcorn stand explodes, M2M continue to perform surrounded by people as popcorn rains down. Air cannons were used to fire 200 garbage bin-sized bags <b>of</b> <b>popcorn</b> into the air to create the raining popcorn effect. In the US the music video made its premiere on 24 October on The WB following that night's screening of 7th Heaven. It began airing on The Box and MuchMusic in early November 1999 and began airing on MTV on 15 November.|$|E

25|$|Producers {{and sellers}} <b>of</b> <b>popcorn</b> {{consider}} two major factors {{in evaluating the}} quality of popcorn: what percentage of the kernels will pop, and how much each popped kernel expands. Expansion is an important factor to both the consumer and vendor. For the consumer, larger pieces <b>of</b> <b>popcorn</b> tend to be more tender and are associated with higher quality. For the grower, distributor, and vendor, expansion is closely correlated with profit: vendors such as theaters buy popcorn by weight and sell it by volume. For both these reasons, higher-expansion popcorn fetches a higher profit per unit weight.|$|E

25|$|Popcorn will pop when freshly harvested, but not well: {{its high}} {{moisture}} content leads to poor expansion and chewy pieces <b>of</b> <b>popcorn.</b> Kernels {{with a high}} moisture content are also susceptible to mold when stored. For these reasons, popcorn growers and distributors dry the kernels until they reach the moisture level at which they expand the most. This differs by variety and conditions, but is generally {{in the range of}} 14–15% moisture by weight. If the kernels are over-dried, the expansion rate will suffer and the percentage of kernels that pop at all will decline.|$|E
25|$|Over {{one hundred}} and twenty five {{communities}} donated their time {{to work at the}} canteen. Some people travelled as far as two hundred miles to take turns on regularly appointed days. The groups also took responsibility in supplying food for the day. If a group was too small, multiple ones would band together and help fulfill the daily requirements. Benefit dances, pie socials, and other activities were held to also help raise money for the canteen. Even the youth contributed to the workload, cleaning floors and raising money in all ways possible to support the troops. One girl remembers writing their addresses onto the packaging <b>of</b> <b>popcorn</b> balls so that the troops would have someone to write to. One twelve-year-old boy even sold his pets, toys, and the shirt off his back and donated the money to the cause. Even the railroad got into the giving by donating a dishwasher and coffee urns.|$|E

500|$|The {{way that}} a person frames a {{situation}} heavily influences a decision's outcome. Research on [...] "hot" [...] and [...] "cool" [...] strategies suggests that when children cognitively represent what they are waiting for as a real reward {{by focusing on the}} reward's arousing, [...] "hot" [...] qualities (taste, smell, sound, feel, etc.) their self-control and delay of gratification decreases, while directing attention to a symbol of the reward by focusing on its abstract, [...] "cool" [...] qualities (shape, color, number, etc.), can enhance self-control and increase the delay. Optimal self-control and the longest delay to gratification can be achieved by directing attention to a competing item, especially the arousing, [...] "hot" [...] qualities of a competing item. For example, delays are increased when thinking about the taste and smell <b>of</b> <b>popcorn</b> while waiting to eat candy. This illustrates an individual's ability to manipulate his/her cognitive representation of external stimuli for goal-directed purposes.|$|E
