2500|$|Marcus Miller {{produced}} the original {{score for the}} film, while Antonio [...] "L. A." [...] Reid and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds worked on the soundtrack. With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said, [...] "sometimes we used score, sometimes we'd use a song by L.A. and Face, or sometimes Marcus would {{take some of the}} songs they had written and do score interpolations of it. For example, one of the songs, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", is a great example. That came from a line of dialogue where Halle is furious with Eddie, says 'love should've brought your ass home last night,' slaps him. At that time, L.A. leans <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> goes 'that's a great song title.' I said, 'great idea.' They write a song, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home". I said, 'well, who we going to get to sing it?' And they said 'well you know, we've got this great young singer who sang the demo, Reggie. If you like the demo then we can use her.' And I said 'great, let's use her.' So that was Toni Braxton's debut. And I remember when I finally met Toni at Babyface's wedding, L.A. said, 'you owe your career to this guy, he gave you your big break,' which was really sweet." ...|$|E

[...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E

60|$|Weeks later, Attley came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{before his}} car stopped Malachi {{let me know}} that Bettina was sitting beside the chauffeur. He greeted her by the scruff of the neck as she hopped down; and I greeted Mrs. Godfrey, Attley, and a big basket.|$|R

5000|$|Chaim Rumkowski's story raises {{difficult}} moral {{questions regarding}} power and compliance. [...] "We must {{cut off the}} legs to save the body," [...] Rumkowski asserted.

60|$|I {{was not at}} Mittleham {{when she}} came over to {{announce}} her engagement, but I heard of it when Mrs. Godfrey and Attley came, forty miles an hour, <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> Mrs. Godfrey called me names of the worst for suppression of information.|$|E

60|$|November 10.--It {{is getting}} warmer and warmer. Some land birds came and perched in the rigging today, {{though we are}} still a {{considerable}} way from our destination.

Goring came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to-day <b>and</b> asked <b>me</b> some more questions about my stone; but I answered him rather shortly, for I have not quite forgiven him yet for the cool way in which he attempted <b>to</b> deprive <b>me</b> of it.|$|R
5000|$|A grievous blow {{has struck}} the ghetto. They Germans are {{asking us to}} give up the best we possess - the {{children}} and the elderly. I was unworthy of having a child of my own, so I gave the best years of my life to children. I've lived and breathed with children, I never imagined I would be forced to deliver this sacrifice to the altar with my own hands.

6000|$|My dear Becher,--I am much {{obliged to}} you for your inquiries, and [...] shall profit by them accordingly.

60|$|I was silting at {{the open}} porch in the gloaming, turning over in my mind the {{unexpected}} events which had occurred so rapidly--the gale, the wreck, the rescue, and the strange character of the castaways--when my sister came quietly <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> put her hand in mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not. I'll tell Misery {{to bring}} all your meals to this room, {{and no one ever}} comes to this end of the garden.

6000|$|Among {{the first}} of those who met us on our arrival was a German, who was {{watching}} some horses and some supplies in a big tent close by the river bank. While pitching my tent on that first day he came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> after {{a few words of}} greeting said quietly, but with feeling, [...] "I am glad you've come, it was so lonesome here." [...] We were very busy, but I think we were reasonably kind to him in the days that followed. He often came over of an evening and stood about the fire, and although I did not seek to entertain him, I am glad to say I answered him civilly; Burton was even social.|$|R
6000|$|Ray {{opened the}} {{carriage}} door and gripped Blenavon's arm. [...] "Get in," [...] {{he said in}} a low, suppressed tone. There was something almost animal in the fury of Ray's voice.

Then Ray came <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> as he looked searchingly into my face, he pointed up the carriage drive.|$|E
6000|$|She bent <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{put forward}} her face; and then--then I {{took her in}} my arms and covered her mouth with kisses. Oh God!

60|$|Then {{she came}} swiftly <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> laid her hands upon my shoulders. There was now {{something}} more human in her face. Her {{eyes seemed to}} plead with mine, and the joy of her near presence was a very real and subtle thing. I felt my eyes kindle and my heart beat fast.

60|$|But, {{whatever}} else he may be, a pessimist is depressing, and it was, therefore, {{a great pleasure}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{have a friend who}} was an out-and-out optimist. In fact, he might be called a working optimist. He lived about six miles from my house, and had a hobby, which was natural phenomena. He was {{always on the lookout for}} that sort of thing, and when he found it he would study its nature and effect. He was a man in the maturity of youth, and if the estate on which he lived had not belonged to his mother, he would have spent much time and money in investigating its natural phenomena. He often drove <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> always told <b>me</b> how glad he would be if he had an opportunity of digging a well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll come. You'll {{likely be}} pestered {{with me at}} any hour. And I'd be proud to have you drop <b>over</b> <b>to</b> visit <b>me</b> now <b>and</b> then too.

But I've got a few little things lying around that I picked up in the queer corners I used to be poking my nose into. Mebbe they'd interest you." ...|$|R

Recasner's defense also pressured Jordan into a travelling violation in the final minute of the game. [...] However, efforts by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen saved the day for the Bulls.|$|R
