This approach has already been used to evaluate water vapour from the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite Microwave Limb Sounder (UARS MLS) [1 - 2]. Early results indicate: (1) MIPAS temperature and <b>ozone</b> <b>data</b> are consistent with the other MIPAS datasets and the meteorology [3], and (2) SCIAMACHY data are consistent with the total ozone analyses (incorporating GOME total column <b>ozone</b> <b>data)</b> provided by KNMI/ESA [4].

In this paper, we incorporate the Version 8 data into a TOMS/SBW merged total <b>ozone</b> <b>data</b> set and an S B W merged profile <b>ozone</b> <b>data</b> set. The Total Merged <b>Ozone</b> <b>Data</b> (Total MOD) combines data from multiple TOMS and SBW instruments to form an internally consistent global data set with virtually complete time coverage from October 1978 through December 2003. Calibration differences between instruments are accounted for using external adjustments based on instrument intercomparisons during overlap periods. Previous results showed errors due to aerosol loading and sea glint are significantly reduced in the V 8 TOMS retrievals. Using SBW as a transfer standard, calibration differences between V 8 Nimbus 7 and Earth Probe TOMS data are approx. 1. 3 %, suggesting small errors in calibration remain. We will present updated total ozone long-term trends based on the Version 8 data. The Profile Merged <b>Ozone</b> <b>Data</b> (Profile MOD) data set is constructed {{using data from the}} SBUV series of instruments. In previous versions, SAGE data were used to establish the long-term external calibration of the combined data set. The SBW Version 8 we assess the V 8 profile data through comparisons with SAGE and between SBW instruments in overlap periods. We then construct a consistently-calibrated long term time series. Updated zonal mean trends as a function of altitude and season from the new profile data set will be shown, and uncertainties in determining the best long-term calibration will be discussed...|$|E

The measurement latitude coverage was 54 – 71 °N and 64 – 88 °S, {{which is similar to}} the coverage of ILAS (November 1996 to June 1997). One purpose of the ILAS-II measurements was to continue such high-latitude measurements of ozone and its related chemical species in order to help accurately determine their trends. The present paper assesses the quality of <b>ozone</b> <b>data</b> in the version 1. 4 retrieval algorithm, through comparisons with results obtained from comprehensive ozonesonde measurements and four satellite-borne solar occultation sensors.
