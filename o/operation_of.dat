40|$|Abstract — Queue as a data {{structure}} has important applications to computer science, which includes, {{different types of}} long term and short term operating system scheduling algorithms can be implemented using queue, printers connected to a computer network receive print jobs in a queue. As an abstract data type, the specifications <b>of</b> the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> queue are separated from the implementation. Queue is a linear structure, which can be defined and implemented using different linear structures, like list, array etc Using the abstract data type, list to implement a queue implies using the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> the abstract data type, list to design the algorithms for the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> the abstract data type, queue. This paper uses the ADT, list to present two variants of the abstract data type, queue. For each type of queue, it uses the algorithms for the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> list to design the algorithms for the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> the abstract data type, queue.

5|$|Holmenkolbanen had {{built-up}} large debts {{in building}} the underground section to Nationaltheatret, including large amounts of compensation to house-owners who had their buildings damaged during construction. To finance their debt, the Akersbanerne-owned Smestad Line was transferred to Holmenkolbanen on 16 November 1933, with Akersbanerene taking over the majority of shares in Holmenkolbanen. The latter remained listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. From 4 January 1937, Bærumsbanen took over the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> trams on the Østensjø Line, though the ownership of the line remained with Akersbanerne. Oslo Sporveier started operating trolleybus lines from 1939. On 1 October 1944, Oslo Sporveier bought Bærumsbanen and took over the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the Lillaker and Østensjø Lines. On 1 January 1948, the municipalities of Oslo and Aker merged, and on 31 May 1949, the two municipally-owned companies, Oslo Sporveier and Akersbanerne, merged, taking the name of Oslo Sporveier. The following year, Oslo Sporveier took over Ekebergbanen. In 1975, Oslo Sporveier bought {{all but a few}} of the shares in Holmenkolbanen, and at the same time took over <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> all the suburban lines.|$|E
