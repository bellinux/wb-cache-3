5|$|During the session, {{in where}} drivers ran in packs and drafted <b>off</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> Juan Pablo Montoya {{made contact with}} Kahne and sent his car {{spinning}} into the grass on the front stretch, tearing off some of its nose. Kahne was required to use a backup car {{for the rest of}} Speedweeks. Because the qualifying grids were chosen by the order in which drivers qualified in Daytona 500 pole position qualifying, the pole was given to Carl Edwards in the first race and to Biffle in the second. Edwards was joined on the grid's front row by Dale Earnhardt, Jr., with Ambrose in third. Stenhouse and Bayne started in fourth and fifth positions respectively. Biffle was joined by Mears on the front row for the second race, with Jeff Gordon in third. Martin Truex, Jr. started fourth, and was followed by Martin in fifth.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing <b>off</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player can collect for points. An egg that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the American {{palaeontologist}} Kenneth Carpenter {{pointed out}} that the dorsal vertebrae {{from the back of the}} pachycephalosaur Homalocephale show that the back curved downwards just before the neck (which was not preserved), and unless the neck curved upwards, the head would point to the ground. He therefore inferred that the necks of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs were held in a curved posture (as is the norm in dinosaurs), and that they would therefore not have been able to align their head, neck, and body horizontally straight, which would be needed to transmit stress. Their necks would have to be held below the level of the back, which would have risked damaging the spinal cord on impact. Modern bighorn sheep and bison overcome this problem by having strong ligaments from the neck to the tall neural spines over the shoulders (which absorb the force of impact), but such features are not known in pachycephalosaurs. These animals also absorb the force of impact through sinus chambers at the base of their horns, and their foreheads and horns form a broad contact surface, unlike the narrow surface of pachycephalosaur domes. Because the dome of Stegoceras was rounded, it would have given a very small area for potential impact, and the domes would have glanced <b>off</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> (unless the impact was perfectly centred). Combating pachycephalosaurs would have had difficulty seeing each other while their heads were lowered, due to the bony ridges above the eyes.|$|E

25|$|After the uprisings, the Native Americans {{returned}} to making alliances with the European powers, using political savvy {{to get the}} best deals by playing the three nations <b>off</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The Creek were particularly good at manipulation – they had begun trading with South Carolina {{in the last years of}} the 17th century and became a trusted deerskin provider. The Creeks were already a wealthy tribe due to their control over the most valuable hunting lands, especially when compared to the impoverished Cherokees. Due to allying with the British during the Yamasee War, the Cherokees lacked Indian trading partners and could not break with Britain to negotiate with France or Spain.|$|E
25|$|During the 1956 August Faction Incident, Kim Il-sung {{successfully}} resisted {{efforts by}} the Soviet Union and China to depose him in favor of Soviet Koreans or the pro-Chinese Yan'an faction. The last Chinese troops withdrew from the country in October 1958, which is the consensus as the latest date when North Korea became effectively independent. Some scholars believe that the 1956 August incident demonstrated independence. North Korea remained closely aligned with China and the Soviet Union, and the Sino-Soviet split allowed Kim to play the powers <b>off</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> North Korea sought to become {{a leader of the}} Non-Aligned Movement, and emphasized the ideology of Juche to distinguish it from both the Soviet Union and China.|$|E
25|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of newspapers in Cornwall can be {{directly related to the}} boom in tin and copper mining throughout the county. Indeed, both the printed media and the mining industry fed <b>off</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> However, growth was not all due to mining. Agriculture benefited too. By promoting livestock markets outside of a farmer's immediate area, it stimulated expansion of the rural economy. Looking at archive newspapers in Cornwall from the 1830s and 1840s, they are full of detail about markets, property, livestock farming equipment, mining equipment and prices for buying and selling tin and copper as well as other metals. Job vacancies were widely advertised, meaning that workers did not have to toil in their immediate village or town, This became especially important when the mining slump started in the 1880s. Jobs and opportunities were advertised from far-flung places like South Africa, Australia, Bolivia and Canada, where Cornish entrepreneurs had already started new mining operations using skills they had learnt back home.|$|E

On lap 82, Jeff Gordon repassed both Busches. A lap later, Gordon was passed by David Reutimann. On lap 84, the third caution was thrown for a large crash in the tri-oval exit. It started when Kyle Busch, on the highside, turned Johnny Sauter {{into the side of}} Kurt Busch, {{starting}} a chain reaction as several cars bounced <b>off</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The other cars with damage were Matt Kenseth, Michael Waltrip, Max Papis, David Stremme, Paul Menard, Sam Hornish Jr., and Elliott Sadler. Of the cars involved in the crash, Sauter was the only car that was unable to drive back to the pits. Papis, Sauter and Waltrip were the only three drivers who were unable to continue. Under the caution Ryan Newman and Travis Kvapil stayed out to lead a lap, but they ended up pitting anyway.|$|E

500|$|Goldfrapp {{began work}} on [...] "Ooh La La" [...] in late 2004 in a small rented house in the {{countryside}} of Bath, England.

500|$|As {{part of her}} {{character}} arc, the plot moves GLaDOS from her anger with Chell for her actions in Portal, which Wolpaw said [...] "was going to get old pretty quick", to an internal struggle. The reuse of McLain's voice {{led to the creation}} of a backstory and subplot about GLaDOS's creation. The writers panicked when they realized that their plans to have Chell and GLaDOS play <b>off</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> would only work if both players spoke. To remedy this, they created the Caroline subplot to give GLaDOS an external situation to deal with and to drive the story during the middle act of the game.|$|E
500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2it {{called the}} episode a [...] "pretty low-key affair" [...] and [...] "a nice {{pause in the}} harvest festival story".

Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said she liked seeing Ben interact with characters other than Leslie, and enjoyed the development between Ann and Chris.

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Sleater-Kinney albums, {{most of the}} lyrical themes on The Hot Rock {{are more}} intimate, exploring failed relationships and personal uncertainty. As Weiss recalled, the songs are [...] "really honest, even if they're sometimes unpleasant. The lyrics evoke so many emotions. Our analogies are visual and the metaphors are direct. Corin and Carrie are singing about things they care about". The album features a notable amount of vocal and guitar interplay between Tucker and Brownstein, who interweave their voices and play <b>off</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to create very atmospheric songs such as [...] "The End of You" [...] and [...] "Burn Don't Freeze". Music critic Robert Christgau said that [...] "even reading the booklet it's hard {{to keep track of}} who's saying what to whom about what, as if they'd fallen in love with (or to) the Velvets' 'Murder Mystery'".|$|E
