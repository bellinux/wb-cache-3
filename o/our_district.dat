500|$|In February 1918, Watts Morgan was {{selected}} as the Labour candidate for the newly formed Rhondda East constituency. As one of the [...] "patriotic" [...] miners' leaders, the Lloyd George coalition did not run a candidate against him, therefore Watts Morgan was elected to the seat unopposed. There was evidence that some wished to run a Liberal candidate against Watts Morgan, but nothing came of it. Watts Morgan made his maiden speech in the House of Commons in April 1919, on one of his special interests, housing. He addressed the House on the state and shortage of housing in the Welsh coalfields as [...] "the chief cause of the industrial unrest. People have been herded together, and that is the reason why there is much unrest in <b>our</b> <b>district</b> at present".|$|E
500|$|The primary {{race was}} bitter. Miller called McEwen [...] "Pinocchio," [...] and McEwen said of Miller, [...] "His misrepresentations and falsehoods are gargantuan. I {{tried to be}} his best friend in the delegation. I am deeply {{disappointed}} at the meanness of his effort." [...] Tom Deimer of Cleveland's Plain Dealer wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues: [...] "both are textbook Republican conservatives, opposed to abortion, gun control, high taxes, and costly government programs — unless located in their districts." [...] Miller noted he had no overdrafts at the House bank, saying, [...] "the score is 166 to nothing." [...] McEwen said [...] "every one of my checks was free and clear. Every month's statement had a balance." [...] McEwen ran commercials against Miller claiming the long-time congressman [...] "has fallen {{out of touch with}} Ohio" [...] and [...] "doesn't live in <b>our</b> <b>district</b> and isn't even registered to vote here." [...] Miller struck back in a live-television interview by taking a Wheat Thin, claiming it to be McEwen, and then taking a bite out of it.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the shooting, Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of {{political}} rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship. On the eve of the shooting, Giffords had written to a Republican friend, Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky, saying, [...] "we need {{to figure out how to}} tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." [...] In March 2010, Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats, including Giffords's, in Arizona's 8th district. Shortly after the map's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month, Giffords said, [...] "We're in Sarah Palin's 'targeted' list, but the thing is that the way she has it depicted, we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over <b>our</b> <b>district.</b> When people do that, they've got to realize that there are consequences to that action." [...] At that point in the interview, however, the interviewer said, [...] "campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years." [...] The image was removed from Palin's [...] "takebackthe20" [...] website following the January shootings. Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a [...] "blood libel" [...] to blame her and the right wing for the attacks.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2010, Palin {{posted to}} her Facebook page to seek {{contributions}} to SarahPAC to help defeat 20 House Democrats in the 2010 Congressional election. [...] Her post featured a graphic that used gunsight crosshairs {{to mark the}} Democrats' districts. [...] She also tweeted to her supporters, [...] "'Don't Retreat, Instead – RELOAD!' Pls see my Facebook page." [...] Palin critics said she was inciting violence. [...] One of the targeted Democrats, Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, objected to the graphic, saying, [...] "we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over <b>our</b> <b>district.</b> When people do that, they've got {{to realize that there}} are consequences to that action."

I will thus set aside some of the important normative and practical questions associated with what kind of redistricting reform we should pursue and focus instead on how to get from here to there. As we think about getting redistricting reform passed, we ought to ask ourselves three questions. First, what should our goals be during the 2010 cycle? Second, moving from principle to practice, what specifically can we do to promote reform during this period? Third, if we succeed in getting some traction with reform post- 2010, what kind of reform proposals should we push...|$|R
