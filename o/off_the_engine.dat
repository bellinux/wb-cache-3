5|$|In March 1945, Johnson patrolled as Operation Plunder and Operation Varsity pushed Allied armies into Germany. There {{was little}} {{sign of the}} Luftwaffe. Numerous ground-attack {{operations}} were carried out instead. On 26 March Johnson's wing was relocated to Twente and {{he was promoted to}} group captain. Days later Johnson took command of No. 125 Wing. On 5 April, after returning from patrol in Spitfire Mk XIV MV268, he switched <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> just as a Bf 109 flew overhead. Seeing the Spitfire, it turned in for an attack; Johnson took cover under his fighter while the airfield defences shot down the 109. On 16 April 1945 Johnson's Wing moved to RAF Celle in Germany.|$|E
5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a power take-off shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a generator that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E
25|$|Practice summary: A {{total of}} 32 drivers {{completed}} 2,165 laps without any major incidents. Several drivers took time driving in packs, simulating race conditions. Dario Franchitti, along with Honda, topped the speed chart {{for the first}} for the month. The only minor incident of the day involved Sebastián Saavedra. His car lost paint and decals <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> cover, bringing out a yellow for debris and track inspection. Sixteen of the full-time entries had passed the required 2,000-mile threshold, and took to the track Wednesday with fresh powerplants.|$|E

500|$|On 25May 1942, Barr had {{to land in}} {{the desert}} when his engine overheated. Having just taken <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> cowling, he spotted enemy tanks {{approaching}} and immediately took off with the engine exposed to the elements, safely landing back at base. He was shot down {{for the second time}} on 30May, when he engaged eight Bf109s and destroyed one before being hit and forced to crash land at high speed in no-man's land. He came down in a minefield during a fierce tank battle, and was forced to remain where he was as troops of both sides slowly converged on him; British forces managed to reach him first and, after treatment for wounds, he again returned to his squadron. On 26June, however, after being attacked by two Bf109s and bailing out of his burning Kittyhawk, he was captured by Italian soldiers and taken as a prisoner-of-war, first to Tobruk, and then to Italy, where he received hospital treatment for serious wounds. He later learned that the pilot who shot him down was Oberleutnant Werner Schroer, a Luftwaffe ace credited with sixty-one victories in North Africa. Bobby Gibbes, having recovered from his own injuries, again took command of No.3 Squadron. During his incarceration, on 5February 1943, Barr was awarded a Bar to his DFC for [...] "destroying further enemy aircraft".|$|E
500|$|On 20 May, two {{flights of}} F-86 Sabres {{encountered}} multiple MiG-15s in MiG Alley, and through radio communications, two additional flights of F-86 Sabres joined the battle, including Jabara. In {{preparation for the}} oncoming battle, Jabara and the other F-86 Sabre pilots were ordered to jettison their auxiliary fuel tanks to improve their maneuverability. Jabara's fuel tank failed to separate from his wing, and protocol required he return to base as the aircraft would be impeded by the extra weight and imbalance, and limit his potential to match off with a MiG. However, Jabara decided to continue to the air battle, where {{he was able to}} still handle his aircraft well enough to be credited with shooting down two MiG-15s with [...]50 caliber machine gun fire. The first was in a group of three MiGs and the other was the last in a six-plane group. Jabara was able to see the first aircraft explode from his gunfire, but he only saw his second victory go into a tailspin as he was avoiding being targeted by another MiG. His fifth and sixth victories made Jabara the first American in history to use jet aircraft to become an ace. The Americans said the 20-minute air battle had included 36 F-86 Sabres against nearly 50 MiG-15s (Russian data shows 30 MiGs), and the American pilots recorded Jabara's two victories and another pilot's [...] "probable". While returning to base, Jabara's F-86 Sabre was so low on fuel, he turned <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and glided towards the base before turning it on prior to landing. Data-matching with Soviet records made available {{since the end of the}} Cold War has since shown that only one MiG was lost in the combat, and that Jabara's jet-versus-jet tally was four at best. Nevertheless, American military forces claimed that Jabara was the first jet-versus-jet ace. Jabara later stated in an interview, [...] "That was my bag for the day, and it made me feel pretty good to know that I was the first jet ace in the history of aerial warfare." [...] The mission was his 63rd Korean mission of an eventual 163; he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest decoration.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1911, the United States {{gathered}} {{much of the}} Regular Army {{in south}} Texas as {{a show of force}} to Mexican revolutionaries, forming the [...] "Maneuver Division". On March 3, 1911, Foulois and Parmalee made the first official military reconnaissance flight (without crossing the border), looking for Army troops between Laredo and Eagle Pass, Texas, with a ground exercise in progress. Two days later, returning from a cross-country flight, they accidentally shut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> and in trying to restart it, crashed into the Rio Grande. Neither was injured and the airplane was eventually repaired and returned to Collier.|$|E
50|$|On June 15, 2016, SpaceX {{failed to}} land {{the first stage of}} the Falcon 9 on OCISLY during the Asia Broadcast Satellite/Eutelsat mission. Elon Musk tweeted that one of <b>the</b> three <b>engines</b> had low thrust, and when the rocket was just <b>off</b> <b>the</b> deck, <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> ran out of oxidizer.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{guidance}} {{strategy is}} to apply acceleration (i.e. <b>engine</b> thrust) in <b>the</b> direction of VTBG. This will {{have the effect of}} making the actual velocity come closer to Vc. When they become equal (i.e. when VTBG becomes identically zero) it is time to shut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines,</b> since <b>the</b> missile is by definition able to reach the desired target at the desired time on its own.|$|R

2500|$|Good Humor became {{unprofitable}} {{beginning in}} 1968. An increase in gasoline prices {{during the early}} 1970s made the situation worse. After absorbing losses for ten years, in 1978 Good Humor decided to sell the fleet and become a distributor itself. The trucks were sold for $1,000 to $3,000 per vehicle, {{and many of the}} former Good Humor vendors became independent business owners. As one reported, [...] "I make sure I shut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> when I stop now that I'm paying for the gas." [...] Ironically, many former competitors also became distributors of Good Humor products.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Insight had {{a conventional}} manual transmission. Starting with the 2001 model, a CVT {{variant of the}} Insight was available; the CVT {{is similar to that}} used in the Honda Civic Hybrid and the Honda Logo. A traditional transmission shifts between a fixed set of engine-to-wheel ratios; however, a CVT allows for an infinite set of ratios between its lowest gear and its highest. A feature shared by the two hybrids (and now appearing in others) is the ability to automatically turn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> when the vehicle is at a stop (and restart it upon movement). Since it is more powerful than most starters of conventional cars, the Insight's electric motor can start the engine nearly instantaneously. The Integrated Motor Assist is run by an [...] "Intelligent Power Unit (IPU)", a desktop computer-sized box. The Intelligent Power Unit, the Power control Unit, the Electronic Control Unit, the vehicle's batteries, dc-to-dc converter and a high-voltage inverter are all located under the cargo floor of the vehicle, behind the seats.|$|E
2500|$|The Mercury-Redstone's {{automatic}} in-flight abort {{sensing system}} solved {{this problem by}} monitoring the rocket's performance during flight. If it detected an anomaly which might threaten the astronaut, such as loss of flight control, engine thrust, or electrical power, it would automatically abort, shutting down the engine and activating the capsule's escape system. The abort system could not shut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> until at least 30 seconds after liftoff {{in order to prevent}} a malfunctioning launch vehicle from coming down on or near the pad; during the initial 30 seconds, only the Range Safety Officer could terminate the flight. Review of flight data from the more than 60 Redstone and Jupiter C launches since 1953 was used to analyze the most likely failure modes of this launch vehicle family. In the interest of simplicity, the abort sensing system had to be kept as simple as possible and only monitor parameters that were vital to booster operation. An automatic abort could be triggered by any of the following conditions, all of which could be indicative of a catastrophic launch vehicle malfunction: ...|$|E

2500|$|While five Mk2 chassis, {{complete}} with four-cam Ford V8s, {{qualified for the}} 1966 Indianapolis 500, the Weslake V12 was not available {{for the start of}} the Formula one season. The first Mk1s took to the track with old 2.7-liter Coventry Climax FPF inline-4 engines in their place. Once the Weslake was ready, however, the car proved to be highly competitive, if [...] unreliable. The high-revving V12 had been constructed using surplus machine tools dating from World War I, so tolerances and parts interchangeability were poor. Nevertheless, when running the Weslake was an immediately arresting engine, with a distinctive V12-scream, and developed 360bhp even in its earliest development phase. By the end of the 1967 season this figure was over 400bhp, easily competing with the Ferrari and Honda V12s, and the newly introduced Cosworth DFV V8. One mechanical flaw that limited the engine's power output involved a design mistake in the oil scavenging system. This problem—discovered too late in the development process to correct—caused oil to pool in the engine's sump, slightly reducing power. Gurney described the effect as [...] "taking the edge" [...] <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> after three or four laps of a race.|$|E
