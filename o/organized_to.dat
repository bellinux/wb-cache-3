5|$|Hurricane Wilma was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone in the Atlantic basin on record, with an atmospheric pressure of 882hPa (mbar, 26.05inHg). Wilma's destructive journey began in {{the second week of}} October 2005. A large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the Caribbean Sea and gradually <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> the southeast of Jamaica. By late on October 15, the system was sufficiently organized for the National Hurricane Center to designate it as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, there was {{increasing}} {{rebellion against the}} rule of Somali President Siad Barre, a military dictator who maintained tight control of power and had a record of human rights abuses.

5|$|On August 12, a {{tropical}} wave <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> {{a tropical}} depression about 930miles (1,495km) east-southeast {{of the island}} of Barbados. Operationally, the system was not detected until August 14, and it was {{believed to have been}} an area of low pressure when it moved through the eastern Caribbean. It moved to the west-northwest, and it slowly <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> a minimal tropical storm on August 14. Although Hurricane hunters reported winds of hurricane force in squalls, the system was discounted as an easterly wave. On August 15, Tropical Storm Charlie quickly intensified, attaining maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120km/h) after passing through the Lesser Antilles. The small center of circulation passed between Dominica and Guadeloupe in the early morning hours.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June 12, and eventually developed into Tropical Depression One {{in the southeastern}} Gulf of Mexico. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center designated this system as Tropical Depression Two, which led to confusion because of Subtropical Storm One in April, and then another Tropical Depression Two in July. Outflow from Hurricane Celia in the Pacific Ocean and a trough in the Gulf of Mexico generated wind shear on the depression, which prevented it from intensifying into a tropical storm. The depression curved north-northeastward and eventually made landfall in near Tampa, Florida on June 26 around 1500UTC. As it was moving ashore, the National Hurricane Center noted that the depression was too poorly <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> locate the center of circulation, and discontinued advisories on the system.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Dow {{returned}} to his leadership of the prohibition movement, co-founding the National Temperance Society and Publishing House with James Black in 1865. He {{spent the rest of}} the 1860s and 1870s giving speeches in support of temperance across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. His efforts produced little success, as the public turned against prohibition and the alcohol industry was better <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> resist. Dow expended a great deal of effort organizing and giving speeches in support of the Liberal Party before the British elections of 1874, as their leader, William Ewart Gladstone, was sympathetic to prohibition; the Liberals lost decisively, a result Gladstone and Dow blamed on liquor interests. Dow continued to promote prohibition in Britain until May 1875 when, exhausted, he returned home.|$|E

5|$|Around 0000UTC on September25, the {{disturbance}} was sufficiently <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> be declared a tropical depression. Shortly after, the NHC issued their first advisory {{on the system}} as it intensified into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Kyle. The {{center of the storm}} was slightly elongated but moderate wind shear continued to impact the circulation. Kyle track northward in response to an area of high pressure east of Bermuda and an area of low pressure along the eastern United States. The sheared structure of the storm led to problems with recording the intensity of the storm throughout the day. Hurricane Hunters continuously flew into the storm to record information; however, their estimates were considered too high as the storm was disorganized.|$|E
5|$|By October 10, 2004, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} situated well to the southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Later that day, a surface low pressure system developed, and convection began to organize into slightly curved bands. The disturbance continued to in this manner, and at 1800 UTC on October 11, the low level circulation had become sufficiently <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> be designated as a tropical depression. At the time, the depression consisted of a well-defined circulation, with some deep thunderstorm activity. Despite weak steering currents, the system started what was initially {{thought to be a}} westward drift, though just a few hours later was found to be towards the northwest. A small cyclone, a burst of deep convection formed at around the same time, and was said could have produced tropical storm-force winds.|$|E
5|$|Early in January 1864, the Yavapai raided {{a number}} of ranches that {{supplied}} cattle to the miners in the Prescott and Agua Fria area. As {{a result of this}} and a series of recent killings, a preemptive attack was <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> discourage future depredations. Therefore, a group of well-armed volunteers were quickly outfitted with King S. Woolsey as their leader. Their mission was to track the raiding party back to their rancheria. What followed was an infamous footnote in Arizona history known today as the Bloody Tanks incident.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Igor {{was first}} {{identified}} as a broad {{area of low pressure}} accompanying a tropical wave over western Africa in early September2010. Tracking nearly due west, the system emerged into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on September6. Gradual development took place as convection– thunderstorm activity– consolidated around its center. At 0600UTC on September8, the low was deemed sufficiently <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> be classified as a tropical depression while situated roughly 90mi (140km) southeast of the Cape Verde Islands. Attaining gale-force winds six hours later, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was subsequently named Igor by the National Hurricane Center (NHC).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Tico is one {{of three}} major hurricanes to strike Mazatlan. The origins of Hurricane Tico were from a weak {{tropical}} disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October7, 1983. Over warm waters, the system was sufficiently <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One on October 11, about 575mi (930km) south of Acapulco. On October12 it turned sharply northward; the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October13. Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify. Two days after becoming a tropical storm, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status. Early on October19, it reached peak winds of 130mph (215km/h). It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500UTC that day Tico made landfall near Mazatlán with winds of 125mph (205km/h). The remains were tracked into the Mid-Atlantic States for five more days.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, the Whitman {{massacre}} and the Cayuse War in {{what became}} southeastern Washington raised fears among white settlers {{throughout the region}} {{and led to the}} formation of large volunteer militias <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> fight Indians.

After Indians attacked a group of returning miners along the Rogue in 1850, former territorial governor Joseph Lane negotiated a peace treaty with Apserkahar, a leader of the Takelma Indians. It promised protection of Indian rights and safe passage through the Rogue Valley for white miners and settlers.|$|E

5|$|Moderate easterly {{wind shear}} {{that had been}} {{affecting}} the developing system began to relax almost immediately after formation, allowing upper-level outflow to expand in most directions and the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Adrian. A small central dense overcast materialized early on June19, followed shortly thereafter by hints of an eye-like feature. Thus, in accordance with increasing satellite intensity estimates, Adrian was upgraded to the season's first hurricane by 00:00UTC on June20 while located about 485mi (780km) south-southeast of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The storm further <b>organized</b> <b>to</b> attain its peak as a Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (160km/h) as the aforementioned eye-like feature became readily apparent in satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|On November 2, a trough of {{low-pressure}} {{was analyzed}} near the Lesser Antilles. The system moved westward into the Caribbean Sea without much organization.
