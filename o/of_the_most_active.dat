5|$|Karl {{holds the}} record for the northernmost {{formation}} of a November tropical or subtropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean. It also attained hurricane strength at an unusual latitude, and contributed to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> Novembers on record in terms of tropical cyclones. However, it stayed over open waters and did not have any effects on land. It was the 11th named storm of the season, and {{due to the lack of}} damage, its name was not retired.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> Atlantic {{hurricane season}}s since records began in 1851 in which nineteen named storms formed. The season officially began on June1 (with Hurricane Alex, the first hurricane {{of the season}} forming on June15) and ended on November30, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} executions Calcraft carried out is unrecorded, {{but it has}} been {{estimated}} at 450, of whom 35 were women, making him one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> of British executioners. Among his better-known victims was François Courvoisier, executed on 6 July 1840 outside Newgate Prison. Courvoisier had been valet to Lord William Russell, and had murdered his master after being caught stealing silverware from the household.|$|E

5|$|Economic {{development}} in Sitakunda is largely {{driven by the}} Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the railway. Though Sitakunda is predominantly an agricultural area, {{it also has the}} largest ship breaking industry in the world. The industry has been accused of neglecting workers' rights, especially concerning work safety practices and child labor. It has also been accused of harming the environment, particularly by causing soil contamination. Sitakunda's ecosystems are further threatened by deforestation, over-fishing, and groundwater contamination. The upazila is also susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes, cyclones, and storm surges. It lies on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> seismic faults in Bangladesh, the Sitakunda–Teknaf fault.|$|E
5|$|Glacier Peak is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> of Washington's volcanoes. The volcano formed {{during the}} Pleistocene epoch, about one million years ago, {{and since the}} most recent ice age, it has {{produced}} some of largest and most explosive eruptions in the state. When continental ice sheets retreated from the region, Glacier Peak began to erupt regularly, erupting explosively five {{times in the past}} 3,000 years. It has erupted repeatedly during at least six periods; two of these eruptions have been among the largest in Washington.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1913, Stojanović {{commenced}} {{the final year of}} his secondary education. National Unity was visited that year by a group of activists of Young Bosnia who were university students in Prague, Vienna, and Switzerland. They held a series of lectures for the members of the association, explaining their views on the current political situation, and promoting the unity of South Slavic peoples in their struggle to liberate themselves from Austria-Hungary. These lectures influenced Stojanović to adopt a Yugoslavist stance. At the beginning of 1914, Ilić and Stojanović became, respectively, the president and the vice-president of National Unity, which numbered 34 members, including four Muslims and four Croats. At that time, National Unity was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> groups of Young Bosnia.|$|E

The volcano's remoteness limits opportunities for its study, and the Alaska Volcano Observatory relies heavily on satellites for monitoring. The volcano is primarily hazardous to aircraft; many of the flights over the north Pacific approach {{the vicinity of the}} volcano, and volcanic ash released from eruptions can damage sensitive electronic equipment and sensors.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the first}} 15 {{years of its}} existence, the breed club {{registered}} 12,500 ponies.

The Pony of the Americas Club hosted its first national convention in 1988, and in 1990, the Club developed a Hall of Fame for its members and ponies. As of 2012, the Pony of the Americas Club has registered over 50,000 ponies.

5|$|Belief in {{the medieval}} {{tradition}} of the Trojan War that followed Dictys and Dares survived the Revival of Learning in the Renaissance {{and the advent of}} the first English translation of the Iliad in the form of Chapman's Homer. (Shakespeare used both Homer and Lefevre as sources for his Troilus.) However the two supposedly eye-witness accounts were finally discredited by Jacob Perizonius {{in the early years of}} the 18th century. With the chief source for his portrayal as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> warriors of the Trojan War undermined, Troilus has become an optional character in modern Trojan fiction, except for those that retell the love story itself. Lindsay Clarke and Phillip Parotti, for example, omit Troilus altogether. Hilary Bailey includes a character of that name in Cassandra: Princess of Troy but little remains of the classical or medieval versions except that he fights Diomedes. However, some of the over sixty re-tellings of the Trojan War since 1916 do feature the character.|$|E

5|$|He faced {{a similar}} {{challenge}} with the impoverished bishopric of Argyll in the 1240s. He {{was given the}} job of restoring {{the viability of the}} diocese and installing a new bishop; this involved forming a close relationship with King Alexander II of Scotland. Clement was with the king during his campaign in Argyll in 1249 and was at his side when he died during this campaign. In 1250 Clement had been able to install a new bishop in Argyll and had become one of the Guardians appointed to govern Scotland during the minority of King Alexander III. By 1250 he had established a reputation as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> Dominican reformers in Britain. Clement helped to elevate Edmund of Abingdon and Queen Margaret to sainthood. After his death, he received veneration as a saint himself, although he was never formally canonised.|$|E
5|$|Success was {{forthcoming}} in 1942. Later, in February 1942, Coastal Command {{identified the}} Luftwaffe Würzburg radar sets in France. Eager to evaluate them, the British Army carried out Operation Biting, a commando raid to capture, dismantle and transport {{an example of}} the mobile radar to Britain. The force increased to 70 aircraft in eight flights as the year progressed. Operations were carried out in the Atlantic, over Scandinavia, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea. In November, PR units operated from Gibraltar in support of Operation Torch, the Allied landing in French North Africa. It was detailed to keep watch on the movements of the Vichy French Fleet at Toulon, France. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> squadrons at this time operated Spitfires.

5|$|With eleven {{depressions}} {{and eight}} tropical cyclones, {{this was one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> seasons in the ocean along with 1987, 1996, and 2005. The season caused a large loss of life, most of which was from one storm. Over 10,000 {{people were killed in}} India when Tropical Cyclone 03A brought a 4.9-metre (16ft) storm surge to the Kathiawar Peninsula, inundating numerous salt mines. Total damages from the storm amounted to Rs.120billion (US$3billion). Tropical Cyclone 01B killed at least 26 people and left at least 4,000 fishermen missing in eastern Bangladesh on May20. A short lived depression in mid-October killed 122 people after triggering severe flooding in Andhra Pradesh. In November, Tropical Cyclone 06B killed six people and caused property damage worth BTN880million (US$20.7million) in eastern India. An additional 40 people were killed and 100 fishermen were listed as missing after Tropical Cyclone 07B affected Bangladesh.|$|E

5|$|Goebbels {{was first}} offered the {{position}} of party Gauleiter for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and {{by the middle of}} October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern Gauleiters group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful. Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the Gau. Goebbels was given control over the local Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) and answered only to Hitler. The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings. Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany. Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues. His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{hurricane}} were from a tropical wave that exited the west African coast on September7. It moved rapidly westward, developing into a tropical depression on September11 about 800miles (1300km) east of the Windward Islands. It was one of seven active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin that day, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> single days on record. It existed at a fairly low latitude and failed to intensify due to the unfavorable combination of Hurricane Ginger and a long trough to its northwest. On September 13, the depression passed just south of Barbados and subsequently entered the Caribbean Sea. Interacting with the terrain of South America, the center became broad and ill-defined, although Curaçao reported winds of near tropical storm force as it crossed the island on September 16. It later moved near or over northern Venezuela and Colombia. As it approached the western Caribbean, the depression was able to organize more, with less influence from landmass or the trough to its north. At 0000 UTC on September 17, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status; that day, it was named Irene about 350 miles (560 km) east of San Andrés. Initially, the storm was expected to track west-northwestward toward the northwest Caribbean, similar to the track taken by the destructive Hurricane Edith two weeks prior.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the 2010 Pacific {{hurricane}} season, which tied 1977 for {{the least}} active year in the reliable records, the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season ended as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>active</b> in recorded history. It began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that conventionally delimit the period during each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first system of the season, Hurricane Alex, developed on June25; the final system of the season, Hurricane Tomas, dissipated on November7. A total of 21 tropical depressions formed within the basin, of which 19 intensified into tropical storms, 12 intensified into hurricanes, and 5 further intensified into major hurricanes. The season's 19 tropical storms tied with previous years 1887 and 1995, as well as subsequent years 2011 and 2012, for the third highest count on record; only 2005 and 1933 featured more activity. The year's 12 hurricanes matched 1969 for the second highest count on record, exceeded only by 2005. There were more tropical storms in the Atlantic than the West Pacific in 2010, the second such occurrence on record after 2005. Throughout the entire Atlantic tropical cyclone database, 2010 is the only year with more than 10 hurricanes not to feature a hurricane landfall on the United States.|$|E
