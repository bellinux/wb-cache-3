5|$|Like <b>other</b> <b>insects,</b> beetles have open circulatory systems, {{based on}} {{hemolymph}} rather than blood. As in <b>other</b> <b>insects,</b> a segmented tube-like heart {{is attached to}} the dorsal wall of the hemocoel.

5|$|The park is an {{important}} refuge for other wildlife, including woodpeckers, squirrels, rabbits, snakes, frogs, toads, stag beetles and many <b>other</b> <b>insects</b> plus numerous ancient trees and varieties of fungi. It is particularly notable for its rare beetles.|$|E
5|$|Flea {{phylogeny}} {{was long}} neglected, {{the discovery of}} homologies with the parts of <b>other</b> <b>insects</b> being made difficult by their extreme specialization. Whiting and colleagues prepared a detailed molecular phylogeny in 2008, with the basic structure shown in the cladogram.

5|$|Grasshoppers have a {{wide range}} of predators at {{different}} stages of their lives; eggs are eaten by bee-flies, ground beetles and blister beetles; hoppers and adults are taken by <b>other</b> <b>insects</b> such as ants, robber flies and sphecid wasps, by spiders, and by many birds and small mammals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their large compound eyes, wasps have several simple eyes known as ocelli, which are typically arranged in a triangle just forward of the vertex of the head. Wasps possess mandibles adapted for biting and cutting, like those of many <b>other</b> <b>insects,</b> such as grasshoppers, but their other mouthparts are formed into a suctorial proboscis, which enables them to drink nectar.|$|E
5|$|Insect life-histories show {{adaptations to}} {{withstand}} cold and dry conditions. Some temperate region insects {{are capable of}} activity during winter, while some others migrate to a warmer climate or go {{into a state of}} torpor. Still <b>other</b> <b>insects</b> have evolved mechanisms of diapause that allow eggs or pupae to survive these conditions.|$|E

5|$|Many dipterans serve {{roles that}} are useful to humans. Houseflies, blowflies and fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae) are {{scavengers}} and aid in decomposition. Robber flies (Asilidae), tachinids (Tachinidae) and dagger flies and balloon flies (Empididae) are predators and parasitoids of <b>other</b> <b>insects,</b> helping {{to control a}} variety of pests. Many dipterans such as bee flies (Bombyliidae) and hoverflies (Syrphidae) are pollinators of crop plants.|$|E
5|$|The book's list of {{contents}} reveals Thayer's {{heavy reliance on}} bird examples, filling 16 of the 27 chapters. Other vertebrates occupy 5 chapters. Insects receive 3 chapters, of which two are dedicated to lepidoptera - one to caterpillars, one to adult butterflies and moths; the remaining one devotes 14 pages to all <b>other</b> <b>insects,</b> starting with orthoptera including the leaf-mimic grasshoppers.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with <b>other</b> <b>insects,</b> he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E

5|$|Ants are {{distinct}} in their morphology from <b>other</b> <b>insects</b> in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, {{and a strong}} constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like petiole. The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or {{the second and third}} abdominal segments).|$|E
5|$|As in many <b>other</b> <b>insects,</b> {{the lift}} {{generated}} by butterflies {{is more than}} can {{be accounted for by}} steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{have converged}} to take {{advantage}} of similar birds. Flowers compete for pollinators, and adaptations reduce unfavourable effects of this competition. The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and <b>other</b> <b>insects</b> would be inactive. Ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to fruit and seeds, {{a number of}} other food items are taken by many species. Some, particularly the ground doves and quail-doves, eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms. One species, the atoll fruit dove, is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey. Snails, moths, and <b>other</b> <b>insects</b> are taken by white-crowned pigeons, orange fruit doves, and ruddy ground doves.|$|E
5|$|Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or 'egg-layers'. Lepidopteran eggs, {{like those}} of <b>other</b> <b>insects,</b> are centrolecithal in that the eggs have a central yolk {{surrounded}} by cytoplasm. The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the embryo caterpillar until it escapes from the shell. The cytoplasm is enclosed by the vitteline envelope and a proteinaceous membrane called the chorion protects the egg externally. The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>other</b> <b>insects,</b> {{cockroaches}} breathe {{through a}} system of tubes called tracheae which are attached to openings called spiracles on all body segments. When the carbon dioxide level in the insect rises high enough, valves on the spiracles open and carbon dioxide diffuses out and oxygen diffuses in. The tracheal system branches repeatedly, the finest tracheoles bringing air directly to each cell, allowing gaseous exchange to take place.|$|E
