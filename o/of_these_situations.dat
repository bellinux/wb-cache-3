5|$|Around 1960, ANAK held {{a series}} of secret dinner {{meetings}} with the families of Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long, Jr. and Lawrence Michael Williams, Georgia Tech's first three African American students. The goal of these meetings, facilitated through the Georgia Tech YMCA, was to discuss the range of potential situations that could arise when the three students enrolled at Georgia Tech the following year, as well as appropriate reactions to each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situations.</b> When Greene, Long, and Williams enrolled in the fall semester of 1961, ANAK members discreetly kept a close watch on the three students for the first two weeks to ensure their safety. As a result of ANAK's efforts and those of other Institute and city organizations, none of the students was involved in any serious incident, paving the way for continued peaceful racial integration.|$|E

25|$|Spey casting is {{used for}} fishing large rivers for salmon and large trout such as steelhead and sea trout. Spey {{technique}} is also used in saltwater surf casting.

25|$|If {{stalemate}} were a {{loss for}} the player unable to move, the outcome of some endgames would be affected. In some situations the superior side can force stalemate but not checkmate. In others, the defending player can use stalemate as a defensive technique to avoid losing (under the current rule). If the proposed rule change were made, both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situations</b> would become wins for the superior side instead of draws.|$|E
25|$|An example <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situations</b> is Michael Castle, then Representative for Delaware, who ran in 2010 for the Senate seat {{vacated by}} Vice President Joe Biden. At {{a town hall}} meeting, Castle was confronted by {{constituents}} who jeered him for insisting that Obama is {{a citizen of the}} United States. Castle, one of the leading Republican moderates in the House, was later defeated by Tea Party-backed Christine O'Donnell in the Republican primary, who herself later lost the general election to Democratic nominee Chris Coons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The car’s {{interior}} atmosphere {{must always}} be favorable for the passengers to survive. But if the passengers inside the car experience any <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situation</b> like pollution entering inside the cabin, tail gate leakage, A/C compartment leakage and for a prolonged time all windows of the car are closed with passengers in it then it will slowly {{pave the way to}} unpleasant situation i. e. hazardous for the passengers to survive and finally even leads to death.

25|$|Cheek kissing between adults, when {{it occurs}} at all, {{is most often}} done {{between a man and}} woman who know each other well, such as between {{relatives}} or close friends. In this case, a short hug (generally only upper-body contact) or handshake may accompany the kiss. Likewise, hugs are common but not required. A hug alone may also suffice in both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situations,</b> and is much more common. Particularly in the southeastern United States (Southern), elderly women may be cheek kissed by younger men as a gesture of affection and respect.|$|E
25|$|During the winter, belugas {{commonly}} become {{trapped in}} the ice {{without being able to}} escape to open water, which may be several kilometres away. Polar bears take particular advantage <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situations</b> and are able to locate the belugas using their sense of smell. The bears swipe at the belugas and drag them onto the ice to eat them. They are able to capture large individuals in this way; in one documented incident, a bear weighing between 150 and 180kg was able to capture an animal that weighed 935kg.|$|E
25|$|Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment {{specifies}} if the House of Representatives has {{not chosen}} a president-elect {{in time for}} the inauguration (noon EST on January 20), then the vice president-elect becomes acting president until the House selects a president. Section 3 also specifies Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if there is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect {{in time for the}} inauguration. Under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, the Speaker of the House would become acting president until either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice president.

25|$|Caesarean section, {{also known}} as C-section or {{caesarean}} delivery, {{is the use of}} surgery to deliver one or more babies. A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk. This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth in some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situations,</b> including after C-section, may be possible. The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.|$|E
25|$|Rated Power– Nominal (or even continuous) power, and peak (or maximum short-term) power a {{loudspeaker}} can handle (i.e., maximum input power before destroying the loudspeaker; {{it is never}} the sound output the loudspeaker produces). A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies. Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situations</b> might pass more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage. In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing.|$|E
25|$|In {{all three}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situations,</b> a guide line or {{lifeline}} from the exit to the diver {{is the standard}} method of {{reducing the risk of}} being unable to find the way out. A lifeline fixed to the diver is more reliable as {{it is not easy to}} lose, and is often used when diving under ice, where the line is unlikely to snag and the distance is reasonably short, and can be tended by a person at the surface. Static guidelines are more suitable when a lifeline is likely to snag on the environment or on other divers in the group, and may be left in situ to be used for other dives, or recovered on the way out by winding back onto the reel. Guide lines may be very much longer than lifelines, and may be branched and marked. They are used as standard practice for cave diving and wreck penetration.|$|E

In turn, each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situations</b> are constructed out of sequences of gags in which the characters improvise, in the words of commentator Constantin Parvulescu, [...] "like various instruments of a band": [...] "Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situations</b> can be broken down into gags. There are several such gags reminiscent of early comedy in Loves of a Blonde: the soldiers-getting-off-the-train gag; the wine-bottle gag; the wedding-ring gag; the palm-reading gag; the roll-up-blinds gag; and the three-guys-in-two-beds gag." [...] Interspersed with these gags are extended character improvisations, such as Milda's discussion of Picasso, his mother's rants at the dining table, and the factory supervisor's appeal for the army's support.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} reasons to avoid cars when a tornado is imminent.

Any <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>situations</b> can leave drivers stranded {{in the path of the}} tornado far from substantial shelter. [...] When coupled with driver panic, they may also result in dangerous but preventable accidents. [...] This situation would be magnified greatly if all the residents of a warned area left in their vehicles, which would cause traffic jams and accidents as the tornado approached. [...] Numerous victims of the deadly Wichita Falls, Texas tornado on April 10, 1979 died in their vehicles in such a situation.|$|E
