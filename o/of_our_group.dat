In addition two 6-inch guns made a surprise attack on the Ottoman railhead at Beit Hanun at a range of , supported by balloon observation. Between 27 October and the attack on Gaza, 15,000 rounds were fired by the heavy artillery; three hundred rounds were allocated {{for the destruction of}} each Ottoman battery which had been located. The anti–battery bombardments between 29–31 October also fired gas shells, which apparently had little or no effect. Together with the corps' three divisional artilleries, the guns produced the heaviest bombardment of World War I outside European theatres. The sixth night's bombardment from onshore and offshore guns produced [...] "an even heavier concentration of fire on a small area than had been put in {{on the first day of}} the Battle of the Somme."

The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>group.</b> At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that.

Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela.

2500|$|The unit sphere S2 is {{partitioned}} into orbits by {{the action}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>group</b> H: two points {{belong to the}} same orbit if and only if there's a rotation in H which moves the first point into the second. (Note that the orbit of a point is a dense set in S2.) The axiom of choice can be used to pick exactly one point from every orbit; collect these points into a set M. Now (almost) every point in S2 can be reached in exactly one way by applying the proper rotation from H to the proper element from M, and because of this, the paradoxical decomposition of H then yields a paradoxical decomposition of S2 into four pieces A1, A2, A3, A4 as follows: ...|$|E

Soon a large man passed out, and gave him a pat on the shoulder. That was what the boy was waiting for--the large man's notice. The pat made him proud and happy, and the exultation inside of him shone out through his eyes; and his mates were there to see the pat and envy it and wish they could have that glory. The boy belonged down cellar in the press-room, the large man was king of the upper floors, foreman of the composing-room. The light in the boy's face was worship, the foreman was his lord, head of his group. The pat was an accolade. It was as precious to the boy as it would have been if he had been an aristocrat's son and the accolade had been delivered by his sovereign with a sword. The quintessence of the honor was all there; {{there was no difference in}} values; in truth there was no difference present except an artificial one--clothes.|$|E
