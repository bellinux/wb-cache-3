5|$|Because of Nintendo's solid {{infrastructure}} for the DS, Igarashi {{wanted to try}} the online components, and test for possible online game play, in future Castlevania titles. Igarashi commented the two player game play was homage to , his favorite Castlevania game. The anime style of artwork was retained from Dawn of Sorrow, which Igarashi had switched to in the previous title to appeal more to the younger demographics of the Nintendo handheld systems. Portrait of Ruins development cycle took roughly the same amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> Dawn of Sorrow did. Koji Igarashi stated that the schedule became tight due to Nintendo Wi-Fi difficulties, considering it was their first online enabled game.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{fuel stop}} at Nicosia International Airport, the pilots {{were forced to}} fly towards Munich-Riem Airport, where the hijackers {{initially}} had intended the exchange to take place. When the aircraft had arrived in Austrian airspace at around noon and it became evident that their demands could not be fulfilled in time, this plan was changed, and the Lufthansa crew had to divert instead to Zagreb {{in what was then}} the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, circling over Zagreb Airport until the Black September members had been brought there. This put the Germans under a pressure <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> the aircraft would eventually run out of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, {{blond hair}} and blue eyes—changed radically over the course <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>As</b> a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage.

5|$|The season's first {{storm had}} limited {{reported}} impacts on land, {{and the subsequent}} system caused more severe damage in southern Texas and northern Mexico. Hurricane Three dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico before striking the same region as the previous cyclone.

Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season, buffeting western Cuba {{for an extended period}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> it slowly executed a counterclockwise loop.

5|$|There {{are often}} {{substantial}} {{differences between the}} remiges and rectrices of adults and juveniles of the same species. Because all juvenile feathers are grown at once—a tremendous energy burden to the developing bird—they are softer and of poorer quality than the equivalent feathers of adults, which are moulted {{over a longer period}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> (<b>as</b> long as several years in some cases). As a result, they wear more quickly.|$|E
5|$|Also {{frequently}} performed is the Fifth Symphony (Op. 50, 1921–22) presenting another {{battle between}} the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In the Sixth Symphony (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems {{similar to that in}} Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.|$|E
5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E

5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment for a period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E
5|$|Declan McCullagh {{asserts that}} during the trial, the judge sealed the entire court file, forbade the defense from issuing subpoenas to witnesses, granted the {{prosecution}} significant latitude in making negative suggestions about Bell's character, and refused requests for a mistrial. McCullagh also asserts that he was subpoenaed by two Treasury Department agents {{to appear before the}} court, without being notified ahead <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> required by federal regulations regarding subpoenas involving the media. Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing his case to the Supreme Court, and filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a fair trial and an unbiased, court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense attorneys.|$|E
5|$|During Dunderdale's {{tenure as}} premier the Fisheries {{portfolio}} {{has seen a}} significant overturn at the ministerial level. In {{less than three years}} Dunderdale had appointed her fourth Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. Keith Hutchings became that fourth minister after his appointment on October 9, 2013. Following his appointment a representative with the Fish, Food and Allied Workers union said he hoped to see the minister stay in his portfolio for a longer period <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> he was the seventh minister in the portfolio in ten years. Dunderdale's first Fisheries minister was Clyde Jackman, who had been the minister when Dunderdale succeeded Williams as premier. Jackman remained minister until after the 2011 provincial election, when Darin King took over the portfolio. Eleven months later King was succeeded by Derrick Dalley who was minister for the next year. Opposition parties criticized government after Hutchings appointment saying the overturn in ministers showed that there was no plan for the fishery.|$|E

5|$|Enrique {{steadily}} intensified and {{by early}} on July 16, the National Hurricane Center was anticipating {{for the system}} to reach hurricane intensity. Continuing to strengthen, it reached hurricane status On July 17. However, this was {{for a short period}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> it developed an eye. Due to uncertainty in the storm's intensity that day, it is possible {{that it could have been}} a hurricane earlier than originally estimated. Wind shear associated with a trough and passage over cooler waters caused Enrique to begin weakening and the cyclone center soon became exposed. Enrique was downgraded to a depression on July 19 and the weakening cyclone crossed into the central Pacific on July 20. Enrique dissipated shortly thereafter. Enrique's remnants managed to maintain a very weak center as it passed well to the north of the Hawaiian Islands and then passed near Midway Island. As the storm approached the International Dateline, the system started to redevelop. Shortly after crossing the dateline, Enrique became a tropical storm again on August 1. It lasted for less than 24 hours before it lost its convection and thus the cyclone began to dissipate. No damages or casualties were caused by Enrique.|$|E
5|$|Ocarina of Times {{gameplay}} introduced {{features such}} as a target-lock system and context-sensitive buttons that have since become common in 3D adventure games. In Japan, more than 820,000 copies were sold in 1998, making it the tenth best-selling game of that year. During its lifetime, 1.14 million copies of Ocarina of Time were sold in Japan, and over 7.6 million copies were sold worldwide. The game won the Grand Prize in the Interactive Art division at the Japan Media Arts Festival, and won six honors at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. , it is the highest-rated game on review-aggregating site Metacritic, with a score of 99/100; in 2008 and 2010, Guinness World Records listed Ocarina <b>of</b> <b>Time</b> <b>as</b> the highest-rated game ever reviewed.

5|$|The Wind Waker was {{released}} on December 13, 2002 in Japan, on March 24, 2003 in North America, and on May 2, 2003 in Europe. To promote the release, Nintendo offered a bonus disc as a pre-order incentive which included a GameCube port of Ocarina <b>of</b> <b>Time</b> <b>as</b> well as its previously unreleased expansion, Ura Zelda. Ura Zelda, largely an adaptation of Ocarina of Time with some changes, including new dungeon challenges, had been developed for the Nintendo 64's 64DD peripheral, but was shelved when that system failed. Ura Zelda was named Ocarina of Time Master Quest in North America and Europe. Ocarina of Time/Master Quest discs became popular items {{in their own right}} in North America, with some customers making and then cancelling preorders to get them. To avoid this issue in Europe, Nintendo released the item only in two-disc packages with The Wind Waker.|$|E
