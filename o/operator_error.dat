5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and <b>operator</b> <b>error</b> resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E

25|$|Charles Perrow, in {{his book}} Normal {{accidents}} says that multiple and unexpected failures are built into complex and tightly-coupled systems, such as nuclear power plants.

25|$|The {{incident}} devastated Audi {{sales in}} the United States, which did not rebound for 15 years. The initial incidents which prompted the report were found by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Transport Canada to have been attributable to <b>operator</b> <b>error,</b> where car owners had depressed the accelerator pedal instead of the brake pedal.

25|$|During sea trials, the {{submarine}} was often forced back to port because of equipment problems, where the Navy personnel found that ASC engineers would diagnose and repair systems {{using a combination}} of supplier data and diagnostic tools not available to the sailors. Problems with the training were compounded by an attitude from ASC that problems were always the fault of the Navy operators. However, most were the result of equipment failure, and the problems caused by <b>operator</b> <b>error</b> could be attributed to poor training or a lack of training, both of which were the responsibility of ASC.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, the Hellmuth Walter KG-conceived turbine used {{hydrogen}} peroxide {{for use in}} submarines while submerged; it {{was found to be}} too noisy and require too much maintenance compared to diesel-electric power systems.

25|$|May 1968: Soviet {{submarine}} K-27 reactor near meltdown. 9 people died, 83 {{people were}} injured. In August 1968, the Project 667 A - Yankee class nuclear submarine K-140 {{was in the}} naval yard at Severodvinsk for repairs. On August 27, an uncontrolled increase of the reactor's power occurred following work to upgrade the vessel. One of the reactors started up automatically when the control rods were raised to a higher position. Power increased to 18 times its normal amount, while pressure and temperature levels in the reactor increased to four times the normal amount. The automatic start-up of the reactor {{was caused by the}} incorrect installation of the control rod electrical cables and by <b>operator</b> <b>error.</b> Radiation levels aboard the vessel deteriorated.|$|E

25|$|Most {{multimeters}} {{include a}} fuse, or two fuses, which will sometimes prevent {{damage to the}} multimeter from a current overload on the highest current range. (For added safety, test leads with fuses built in are available.) A common error when operating a multimeter is to set the meter to measure resistance or current, and then connect it directly to a low-impedance voltage source. Unfused meters are often quickly destroyed by such errors; fused meters often survive. Fuses used in meters must carry the maximum measuring current of the instrument, but are intended to disconnect if <b>operator</b> <b>error</b> exposes the meter to a low-impedance fault. Meters with inadequate or unsafe fusing were not uncommon; this situation {{has led to the}} creation of the IEC61010 categories to rate the safety and robustness of meters.|$|E
500|$|Following the accident, the {{engineer}} and {{conductor of the}} Capitol Limited filed lawsuits against Amtrak, CSX {{and the state of}} Maryland for $103 million (1996 USD) alleging negligence, singling out the removal of the signal between Kensington and Georgetown Junction and the <b>operator</b> <b>error</b> by the MARC engineer. Both men claimed that the injuries they sustained in the crash [...] "prevent them from returning to work." [...] In 1999, responding to the crash, the Federal Railroad Administration issued comprehensive rules for passenger car design, [...] "the first ...in the 169-year history of rail passenger service." [...] The new rules required that new control cars and multiple units be built to higher crashworthiness standards.|$|E
500|$|The ship ran aground near Newport, Rhode Island in September 1896. <b>Operator</b> <b>error</b> {{combined}} with signal failure were blamed. A few officers, including future Governor of Guam Alfred Walton Hinds, were publicly reprimanded. While under repairs in New York, the yoke that secured the main injection valve in the starboard engine room broke on 9 November 1896. Water pressure unseated the valve {{and allowed the}} compartment to flood as the receiving pipe had earlier been removed for repair. Leaks in the watertight doors, voicepipes and holes in the bulkheads for electrical cables allowed the flooding to spread to the other engine and boiler rooms, the coal bunkers adjacent to them, {{as well as most}} of the magazines and shell rooms. The ship settled to the bottom, but the water was so shallow as to aid salvage efforts. By the 11th most of the water had been pumped out, but she was still drawing too much water to enter the drydock. An estimated [...] of coal would have to be removed to lighten Texas enough to enter the drydock.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of the fourth rotor did not catch Bletchley Park by surprise, because captured material dated January 1941 had made reference to its development as an adaptation of the 3-rotor machine, with the fourth rotor wheel to be a reflector wheel.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} incident, WMATA General Manager John Catoe {{stated that the}} cause was not known but that [...] "the system is safe." [...] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began an investigation. WMATA and NTSB {{investigators}} considered several possible causes, which might include <b>operator</b> <b>error,</b> brake failure, fault in the computerized signal and operation system, {{or a combination of}} the three. During rush hour operation, train movement is typically controlled by a centralized computer system, and a separate decentralized system can automatically apply the brakes to prevent a collision. These systems had failed at least once in the past, and the NTSB subsequently identified incompatible specifications, from the maximum deceleration capability of the trains to the deceleration rates used in the wayside system design. [...] The train has a manual emergency brake, which can be applied by the driver {{in the event of an}} imminent collision, if the driver can see and identify the hazard with sufficient time to stop. Officials indicated that the manual brake was indeed engaged. It is possible that the brake system failed to perform as designed, or that the operator applied the brake too late. The lead car of the moving train was two months overdue for scheduled brake maintenance. In a press conference the evening of June 22, Catoe stated that the last car on the stopped train was a CAF 5000-Series car (car 5066), which entered service in 2001, and that the lead car on the moving train was a Rohr Industries 1000-Series car. WMATA later confirmed that all of the cars on the moving train were 1000-Series.|$|E

40|$|Growing use of {{computers}} in safety-critical systems increases the need for Human Computer Interfaces (HCIs) to be both smarter | to detect human errors | and better designed | to reduce likelihood of errors.
