The 40 μm thick CoCrAlY coating has a cyclic oxidation life of around 160 h, and the <b>oxidation</b> <b>constant</b> is 1. 915 × 10 − 7 mg 4 ·cm− 8 ·s− 1. However, severe spallation of the oxides containing Co, Cr, Ni, Ta and Ti occurs with longer cyclic oxidation. The degradation in oxidation resistance for the coating {{is related to the}} depletion of Al due to the oxide spallation and interdiffusion. Severe interdiffusion between the coating and underlying substrate occurs at 1 050 °C. The composition of the substrate has an important effect on the thermal cycling lifetime of the coating. The influencing mechanism is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableOver {{twenty million}} hernia repair {{surgeries}} are performed worldwide each year. Many of these repairs are accomplished {{through the use}} of a prosthetic mesh material rather than sutures because meshes have been shown to reduce post-operative complications and recurrence rates. Long-term implants, such as hernia meshes, continuously activate the inflammatory response, bathing the material with oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid. Polypropylene, the most commonly-used hernia repair material worldwide, is an aliphatic hydrocarbon, which is susceptible to <b>oxidation.</b> <b>Constant</b> exposure of the mesh to these oxidants may lead to degradation of the material over time. There is evidence that many patients experience chronic pain and/or embrittlement of the mesh material over time, particularly for polypropylene hernia mesh materials. For this reason, mechanical testing was utilized to characterize polypropylene meshes explanted from human subjects to determine if oxidative degradation could play a role in these changes. We expected to find a decrease in the overall strength and percent elongation of the materials and increase in Young's Modulus after exposure to the harsh biological environment.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} limiting the application of conducting polymers as commercial materials has been the lack of solubility in most common solvents. An alternative approach might be the preparation of sterically stabilized conducting polymer colloids via dispersion polymerization. In general the oxidation of pyrrole and aniline is {{carried out in the}} presence of a steric stabilizer to produce a colloidal dispersion. In this work various stabilizers such as PVP, PVA, and PEO were used for colloid formation. The preparation, characterization and electrical properties of polypyrrole and polyaniline colloids have been studied. It was found that type and concentration of stabilizer affects the morphology, electroactivity, conductivity and yield of polymer. Electrocoagulation of colloids onto various substrates was considered. The electrochemical oxidation/polymerization of pyrrole and aniline monomer in the presence of steric stabilizers (PVP, PVA, PEO) and the properties of the resultant polymers was also investigated. Various techniques such as galvanostatic <b>oxidation</b> (<b>constant</b> current), potentiostatic <b>oxidation</b> (<b>constant</b> potential), and potentiodynamic (potential ramp) oxidation were used to initiate this process. It was found that the type and concentration of stabilizer affects the rate of polymerization as well as the electroactivity and morphology of the resultant colloidal sol. It was found that the rate of polymerization and the electroactivity decreased with increased concentration of stabilizer. The effect of rotation rate, type of stabilizer and stabilizer concentration on the rate of polymerization were studied. The results indicated that rate of polymerization/deposition decreased with increased electrode rotation rate and with stabilizer concentration. For the first time the use of electropolymerization in the presence of the steric stabilizers with various counterions in order to produce conducting polymer colloids has been investigated. The colloids produced are sterically stable and are electroactive. Applications for conductive polymer colloids were considered. For example, the preparation of conductive electroactive paints has been investigated using polypyrrole and polyaniline colloids mixed with standard acrylic paints. The electroactivity, conductivity and adhesive strength of the resultant paints was investigated. The use of colloids for the development of novel conductive polymer composites was studied. The electrodeposition of mixtures of polypyrrole and polyaniline colloids, polyaniline colloids and pyrrole monomer or polyaniline colloids with polystyrene sulphonate particles was investigated. Thermal degradation of polyethylene in the presence of colloidal polypyrrole and polyaniline was investigated. The results indicated that polypyrrole and polyaniline colloids might be used as a stabilizing additive to prevent the thermal degradation of polyethylene. This study indicated that conducting polymer colloids can be prepared both chemically and electrochemically and these colloids can be used for various applications...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{oxidation}} behaviour of AISI 304 and AISI 439 stainless steels was studied at high temperatures, under various oxygen pressures {{and in the}} presence or not of water vapour. Thermogravimetric analyses were conducted in isothermal conditions from 850 to 950 ◦C for 50 h and microstructural and chemical analyses of the oxide films grown by oxidation were performed by SEM and EDX. The oxide films were also analysed by grazing X-ray diffraction and by X photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The AISI 439 steel has higher oxidation resistance than AISI 304, above 850 ◦C, under high oxygen pressures. On the other hand, the AISI 304 steel has higher oxidation resistance under low oxygen pressures in the whole temperature range. In order to check whether the growth kinetics of Cr 2 O 3 formed by the oxidation of stainless steels was controlled by oxygen or/and chromium diffusion through the oxide film, the <b>oxidation</b> <b>constants</b> were theoretically calculated {{on the basis of}} diffusion data using Wagner's Theory.

40|$|Nineteen {{bacteria}} {{were tested}} for growth on paraffin wax {{as the sole}} source of carbon. Paraffin wax is a solid mixture of hydrocarbons including n-alkanes ranging from C 18 H 38 to C 37 H 76. Of the nineteen bacteria tested, four bacteria (Arthrobacter paraffineus ATCC 19558, Mycobacterium OFS, Pseudomonas fluorescens Texaco and Rhodococcus IS 01) grew well on paraffin wax. However, only one, Rhodococcus IS 01, was found to rapidly and completely degrade a mixture of paraffin wax liquefied with hexadecane using the Self-Cycling Fermentation (SCF) technology. This strain was able to degrade n-alkanes ranging from dodecane to heptatriacontane as well as highly branched hydrocarbons such as pristane and hepta-methyl-nonane. Kinetic studies performed with Rhodococcus IS 01 growing on mixtures of n-alkanes showed that the hydrocarbons were degraded in ascending order of chain length: shortest to longest chain. The short lag period between the biodegradation of the different n-alkanes suggested that the growth of Rhodococcus IS 01 on mixtures of n-alkanes followed some form of diauxie. Further kinetic studies were conducted growing Rhodococcus IS 01 on individual and various mixtures of n-alkanes; these showed that the initial first-order <b>oxidation</b> <b>constant</b> decreased with increasing chain length. This trend is suspected {{to be due to}} an enzyme specificity constraint rather than to a mass transfer limitation. In addition, it was also observed that the maximum specific growth rate constant (mumax) increased with increasing n-alkane chain length. Rhodococcus IS 01 was also found to produce a cell-associated biosurfactant...|$|E
40|$|Toxic at low concentrations, phenol {{is one of}} {{the most}} common organic {{pollutants}} in air and water. In this work, phenol biodegradation was studied in extreme conditions (80 A degrees C, pH = 3. 2) in a 2. 7 l bioreactor with the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus 98 / 2. The strain was first acclimatized to phenol on a mixture of glucose (2000 mg l(- 1)) and phenol (94 mg l(- 1)) at a constant dissolved oxygen concentration of 1. 5 mg l(- 1). After a short lag-phase, only glucose was consumed. Phenol degradation then began while glucose was still present in the reactor. When glucose was exhausted, phenol was used for respiration and then for biomass build-up. After several batch runs (phenol < 365 mg l(- 1)), specific growth rate (mu(X)) was 0. 034 +/- A 0. 001 h(- 1), specific phenol degradation rate (q(P)) was 57. 5 +/- A 2 mg g(- 1) h(- 1), biomass yield (Y-X/P) was 52. 2 +/- A 1. 1 g mol(- 1), and oxygen yield factor (Y-x/o 2) was 9. 2 +/- A 0. 2 g mol(- 1). A carbon recovery close to 100 % suggested that phenol was exclusively transformed into biomass (35 %) and CO 2 (65 %). Molar phenol <b>oxidation</b> <b>constant</b> (Y-o 2 /P) was calculated from stoichiometry of phenol oxidation and introducing experimental biomass and CO 2 conversion yields on phenol, leading to values varying between 4. 78 and 5. 22 mol mol(- 1). Respiratory quotient was about 0. 84 mol mol(- 1), very close to theoretical value (0. 87 mol mol(- 1)). Carbon dioxide production, oxygen demand and redox potential, monitored on-line, were good indicators of growth, substrate consumption and exhaustion, and can therefore be usefully employed for industrial phenol bioremediation in extreme environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of a PEMFC with Pt anode under CO poisoning was experimentally investigated. Especially, {{the possibility}} and {{conditions for the}} occurrence of autonomous potential oscillation in galvanostatic operation were analysed [1]. A specific experimental setup, consisting of a differential fuel cell in H 2 /H 2 operation, was used in order to eliminate the masking effect of the cathode and to avoid spatial distributions along the channel. In galvanostatic operation, potential oscillations were observed (Fig. 1). In a first measurement series, the influence of CO concentration on the behaviour of the oscillations was analysed. Higher CO concentrations were found to increase the oscillation frequency because of enhanced CO adsorption [2]. In a second measurement series, {{the influence of the}} cell temperature was investigated. By means of activation energy analysis, an unequal influence of the temperature on the oscillation frequency has been found for Pt catalyst (EA = 40. 5 ± 0. 6 kJ mol- 1) compared to the previously reported case at PtRu (EA = 60. 9 kJ mol- 1) [3]. Additionally, oscillations were found in H 2 /O 2 operation, too. They occur if the anode over¬potential is forced to increase until the onset potential for CO oxidation is reached. Nevertheless, in technical fuel cells operated with passive loads, the anode overpotential does usually not reach such high values, because a large fraction of the voltage loss is caused by cathodic and ohmic losses. As an additional side effect, an increase of the Tafel slope at ηA≈ 350 mV was observed in some of the galvanostatic polarisation curves. Two hypotheses for the occurrence of a second Tafel slope were drawn: on the one hand, the Heyrovski mechanism could enhance hydrogen adsorption at higher overpotentials; on the other hand, spatial distributions of the overpotential could lead to local CO oxidation and with this to enhanced hydrogen oxidation in parts of the reactor (e. g. under the ribs, where CO transport could be diffusion limited). Finally, a model of Zhang and Datta [3], developed for PtRu and recently applied to PtPd [4], was adapted to fit the measurements. The adapted parameter set was compared to the original values and reasonable physical explanations for the adaptations were given. The main differences between Pt and PtRu were found to be a lower water dissociation constant and a lower CO <b>oxidation</b> <b>constant...</b>|$|E

Using polynomial chaos (PC) methods, we propagate uncertainties in physicochemical properties and emissions for the PAHs benzo[a]pyrene, pyrene and phenanthrene to simulated spatially resolved concentration uncertainties. We find that the leading contributors to parametric uncertainty in simulated concentrations are the black carbon-air partition coefficient and <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constant</b> for benzo[a]pyrene, and the <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constants</b> for phenanthrene and pyrene. NH geometric average concentrations are more sensitive to uncertainty in the atmospheric lifetime than to emissions rate.

40|$|The {{long-term}} electrochemical cycling {{stability of}} AB 5 -type compounds in alkaline media {{can be improved}} either by lowering the specific surface area of the applied hydride-forming powder or by lowering the <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constant</b> of the intermetallic compound. Both parameters are shown to be intrinsic material properties. Reducing the specific surface area {{can be accomplished by}} making use of non-stoichiometric compounds in which the A-type atoms in the crystal lattice are partly replaced by dumbell pairs of B-type atoms. Electrochemically stable non-stoichiometric compounds are characterized by the absence of a clear discrete a-to-ß phase transition upon hydridization, through which particle size reduction of the powder during electrochemical activation remains limited. Compounds with a composition close to or above the as-denoted 2 ̆ 2 critical composition 2 ̆ 2 meet this requirement.

40|$|Subsurface {{aeration}} is the in situ oxidation of Fe from groundwater {{that is used}} to make {{drinking water}} potable. When subsurface aeration is applied to an anaerobic groundwater system with pH > 7, Fe(II) is oxidised heterogeneously. The heterogeneous oxidation of Fe(II) can result in the in situ formation of Fe colloids. To study this, the effect of substances commonly found in groundwater (e. g. PO 4, Mn, silicate and fulvic acid) on the heterogeneous oxidation process was measured. The heterogeneous oxidation of Fe(II) becomes retarded when PO 4, Mn, silicate or fulvic acid is present in the groundwater in addition to Fe(II). Phosphate and fulvic acid retarded the oxidation process most. The heterogeneous oxidation was described using a model with a homogeneous (k(1)) and an autocatalytic <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constant</b> (k'(2)). From the modelling it followed that the homogeneous <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constant</b> was not affected or even slightly elevated whereas the autocatalytic <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constant</b> decreased remarkably by the addition of PO 4, Mn, silicate or fulvic acid. From speciation calculations it followed that the decreased availability of the Fe(H) species can only explain {{a small part of the}} retarded autocatalytic oxidation process. Therefore exploratory calculations were performed to gain insight into whether the adsorption of PO 4 or fulvic acid could explain the retarded autocatalytic oxidation. These calculations showed that the adsorption of fulvic acid could explain the retarded autocatalytic oxidation process. In contrast the adsorption of PO 4 only partly explained the retarded autocatalytic oxidation process. In terms of colloid formation this study shows that the heterogeneous oxidation of Fe(II) in presence of PO 4, Mn, silicate or fulvic acid leads to the formation of Fe colloids.

The kinetics of IBP removal by sonolysis or MST-assisted sonocatalysis was systematically evaluated with various operational parameters such as pH, temperature, ultrasound (US) frequency, and mechanical mixing intensity. For the first time, authors found that mechanical mixing had an opposite effect on the <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constants</b> of IBP removal by sonolysis or sonocatalysis according to US frequency. Specifically, the magnitude orders of <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constants</b> in sonolysis and sonocatalysis with mixing (350 rpm) were the same (35 > 1000 > 300 > 500 > 700 kHz), but sonolysis without mixing showed the following order: 500 > 1000 > 35 kHz. In addition, the removal rate constant of IBP by sonocatalysis at the lowest US frequency (35 kHz) increased exponentially as the mechanical mixing speed increased.

Summary The oxidation of discontinuous metal films offers a simple and sensitive method for measuring low-tem-perature <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constants.</b> The advantages of the method include control of variables such as im-purities and heat of adsorption which can change the experimentally measured rates. These factors must be eliminated, or at least controlled, since they do {{not appear in the}} theoretical expressions for <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constants.</b> In addition, the surface structure of the metal can be controlled, and even single crystal surfaces can be utilized in films grown by epitaxial techniques. Uni-form island size can be obtained by anneal ing the films for a long time, provided, of course, that the vacuum is high enough to prevent formation of a monolayer of gas. The discontinuous film method is limited to the ex-amination of tarnishing reactions, i. e., to temperatures below ~ 500 ~ Experimental techniques are rela-tively difficult, and all the interfering effects, such as film rearrangement, have not yet been eliminated. Despite these complications, themethod offers a pow-erful tool for measuring tarnishing rates under very difficult conditions of pressure and temperature. Re-finements in both theory and practice will allow the experimental results to be directly related to the microscopic parameters used in deriving reaction rate constants.

This Sialon had an average modulus of rupture ranging from 404 megapascals (58. 6 ksi) at room temperature to 254 megapascals (36. 8 ksi) at 1400 C. Oxidation tests at 1400 C in air showed it to have a parabolic <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constant</b> {{less than or equal}} to 2. 8 x 10 to the - 10 th power sq g/cm 4 hr, which is smaller than that of any other Si 3 N 4 -base ceramic reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Pacific Northwest and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories, in {{collaboration}} with Washington State University, are developing fundamental data on the precipitation/dissolution reactions of Cr(III) compounds and the kinetics of oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) at room and elevated temperatures and under conditions relevant to high-level waste (HLW) processing. This integrated approach, which involves measuring solubility and <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constants</b> and spectroscopic characterization of aqueous and solid species {{as a function of}} ionic strength, alkalinity, redox conditions, and temperature, will provide thermodynamic and kinetic data. These data are necessary to predict changes in chromium solubility and speciation in response to changes in pretreatment strategies or to develop cost-effective tank waste processing technologies that result from reducing the total amount of chromium in processed waste...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of dioxygen {{with a series}} of para-substituted meso-tetraphenylporphinatomanganese (II) complexes, MnII(T (p-x) PP) (nBuNH 2) where x = H, CH 3, Cl, OCH 3 in chloroform was studied. <b>Oxidation</b> rate <b>constants</b> were determined at room temperature using spectrophotometric methods. Fitting the observed values for the autoxidation rate constants to the Hammett equation (logkb vs 4 σ) gave a Hammett pb value of - 0. 280. The effect of substitutents upon the pseudo-first-order rate constants is discussed. In comparison, the half-wave potentials (E 1 / 2) for the metal centred redox reaction, [(MnII(T(p-x) PP) (BuNH 2) ] ⇋ [MnIII(T(p-x) PP) (BuNH 2) ]+ + e, were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. A relationship between E 1 / 2 and the Hammett constants was found. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} oxide scales on Ni at high {{temperatures}} was observed {{by means of}} X-ray diffraction using a diffractometer combined with a high temperature device for temperatures between 20 and 1700 degree Celsius. A procedure for a kinetic evaluation is described, which detects the increase of the oxide peaks during the experiment. The resulting curves were calibrated {{to the growth of}} the scale with time xsubm (t) or with temperature xsubm (T) respectively. Mathematical curves describing the absorption conditions in the growing layer and the expected time law of its growth were fitted to the measured data yielding the rate constants. In the non-isothermal case the temperature dependence of the <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constant,</b> described by the Arrhenius relation, is obtained in only one experiment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceArsenic {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{widespread}} toxic trace elements, whose presence in environment is linked either to geological background or human activities. The fate of arsenic in environmental compartments is closely linked to the microbial transformations of the inorganic species AsIII and AsV. In order to monitor the evolution of microbial As-related global activities, a simple batch test has been designed and applied. The principle of the test is based on the monitoring of oxidation of 1 mM AsIII in a basal medium inoculated with environmental samples. Results are interpreted considering of oxidation rate or rate constant, and lapse time. Several phenomena are likely to influence the global oxidation rate, such as the relative activity of diverse oxidizing microbes and the competition between oxidizing and reducing processes, in relation to organic matter bioavailability. AsIII oxidizing activities of microorganisms in eight surface soils from polluted sites were quantified with and without addition of organic substrates to the basal medium. Results suggested that AsIII <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constant</b> was limited by the low concentration of organic substrate, this limitation being removed by supplying 0. 08 g/L of organic carbon. Higher organic carbon input negatively affected AsIII <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constant.</b> Then, the AsIII oxidizing test was applied to a soil highly polluted by the destruction of chemical weapons, simultaneously with the enumeration of AsIII-oxidizing microbes using the Most Probable Number method. Results suggested that the concentration of AsIII-oxidizing microbes was correlated with the lapse time and not with the oxidation rate. Experiments performed with a pure AsIII oxidizing bacterium confirmed a correlation between the lapse time and initial concentration of active cells, AsIII oxidation being detected when the bacterial concentration was close to 107 cells ml- 1. In these conditions, the oxidation rate was independent from bacterial concentration. In a next step, the influence of microbial AsV reduction parameters will be considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of four pharmaceutical compounds (PhACs), ibuprofen (IBU), diphenhydramine (DP), phenazone (PZ), and phenytoin (PHT) was investigated via ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and UV/H 2 O 2 process with a low-pressure (LP) LTV lamp. For each PhAC tested, direct photolysis quantum yields at 254 nm {{were found to}} be ranging from 6. 32 x 10 (- 2) to 2. 79 x 10 (- 1) mol E- 1 at pH 7. The second-order rate constants of the reaction between the PhACs and (OH) -O-center dot were determined to be from 4. 86 x 10 (9) to 6. 67 x 10 (9) M- 1 s(- 1) by using a competition kinetic model which utilized para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) as a reference compound. The overall effect of (OH) -O-center dot radical scavenging from humic acid (HA) and anions HCO 3 -, NO 3 - was measured utilizing R-OH,R-UV method through examining the aqueous photo{{degradation of}} pCBA as a probe compound. Moreover, these fundamental direct and indirect photolysis parameters were applied in the model prediction for <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constants</b> of the PhACs in UV/H 2 O 2 process. It was found that the predicted <b>oxidation</b> rate <b>constants</b> approximated the observed ones. The results indicated that the new R-OH,R-UV probe compound method was applicable for measuring background (OH) -O-center dot radical scavenging effects in water treatment process of UV/H 2 O 2. Furthermore, by GC-MS analysis, most of the intermediates created during the photodegradation of the selected PhACs in UV/H 2 O 2 process were identified. For the photodegradation of PZ, a competition mechanism existed between the direct UV photolysis and the oxidation of (OH) -O-center dot. An appropriate dosage of H 2 O 2 could hinder the occurrence of the direct photolysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
