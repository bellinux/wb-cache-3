40|$|Economic {{development}} in agriculture is {{often accompanied by}} strong environmental pressures that present risks, {{which could lead to}} irreversible damage of the associated agro-ecosystem. A form of agricultural management that utilizes natural resources rationally yet maintains ecological stability is necessary. Ecologically sound, yet productive, use of resources requires indicators that assess not only productive and economic factors, but also environmental impact and ecological effects. Thus, to study an agricultural activity and its interaction with the environment, a holistic approach, capable of considering ecological, biophysical and socio-economic aspects is appropriate. Here we use emergy analysis and its indicators as given in Odum (Science 242 (1988) 1132 – 1139), to evaluate how sustainability of a soybean crop in south Tuscany (Italy) is increased using the specific bacteria inoculation to satisfy, through fixation, the nitrogen need of the crop. Cultivation was studied with two options: (1) utilization of chemical fertilizers to supply nitrogen needs as often done in the past, and as a viable present alternative and (2) the symbiotic activity of Bradyrhizobium bacteria, given as inoculum, to cover all nitrogen needs. This article shows that proper agricultural management should help maintain, and increase, system capacity, i. e. the quality of the system environment (soil, water,…), to sustain biomass, and prevent environmental degradation. For an Italian agro-ecosystem, the results demonstrate that agricultural production is more than doubled and the use of non-renewable and toxic inputs, such as chemical fertilizers, is reduced by use of the inoculum. The good results for soybean suggests development of analogous cultivation methods for <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>species,</b> such as gramineous, for which different N-fixing bacteria such as Azospirillum, have been already identified...|$|E

40|$|In central Brazil after soybean or <b>other</b> annual <b>agricultural</b> <b>species</b> is harvested, sorghum hybrids {{are planted}} in the fall in order to {{establish}} pastures for grazing animals. This study conducted for two consecutive years aimed at quantifying the contents of hydrocyanic acid in the leaves and determining plant height, forage dry matter yield and the leaf/stem ratio for sorghum hybrid 1 P 400 at different ages. Statistical analysis was performed by regression analysis based on plant age. Leaf HCN content decreased with plant growth, ranging from 205. 0 and 230. 3 mg HCN/ 100 g leaf DM at two weeks old to 5. 9 and 6. 1 mg HCN/ 100 g leaf DM at five weeks old in the first and second year, respectively. The average heights measured varied from 60 and 56 cm, in the 4 th week, to 117 and 151 cm, in the 8 th week, during the first and second experimental year, respectively. Forage mass increased linearly with age and displayed average of 1. 411 and 1. 637 kg DM/ha in the first year and, 2. 905 and 3. 640 kg DM/ha in the second year, during the 7 th and 8 th week, respectively. Leaf proportion decreased while stem increased linearly with plant age. The leaf/stem ratio decreased with plant growth, elongation and increasing stem weight. The sorghum hybrid should be grazed only after five weeks or when the plant height is above 80 cm, {{in order to avoid the}} risk of cyanide poisoning...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} overexpressing a pumpkin gibberellin (GA) 20 -oxidase gene encoding an enzyme that forms predominantly biologically inactive products on GA biosynthesis and plant morphology in transgenic lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv Vanguard) plants. Lettuce was transformed with the pumpkin GA 20 -oxidase gene downstream of a strong constitutive promoter cassette (El 2 – 35 S-Ω). The transgenic plants in which the pumpkin gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction were dwarfed in the T 2 generation, whereas transformants with a normal growth phenotype did not contain the transgene. The result of Southern-blot analysis showed that the transgene was integrated as a single copy; the plants segregated three dwarfs to one normal in the T 2 generation, indicating that the transgene was stable and dominant. The endogenous levels of GA 1 and GA 4 were reduced in the dwarfs, whereas large amounts of GA 17 and GA 25, which are inactive products of the pumpkin GA 20 -oxidase, accumulated in these lines. These results indicate that a functional pumpkin GA 20 -oxidase is expressed in the transgenic lettuce, resulting in a diversion of the normal pathway of GA biosynthesis to inactive products. Furthermore, this technique may be useful for controlling plant stature in <b>other</b> <b>agricultural</b> and horticultural <b>species...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many <b>agricultural</b> <b>species</b> {{and their}} {{pathogens}} have sequenced genomes {{and more are}} in progress. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>species</b> provide food, fiber, xenotransplant tissues, biopharmaceuticals and biomedical models. Moreover, many agricultural microorganisms are human zoonoses. However, systems biology from functional genomics data is hindered in <b>agricultural</b> <b>species</b> because <b>agricultural</b> genome sequences have relatively poor structural and functional annotation and agricultural research communities are smaller with limited funding compared to many model organism communities. Description To facilitate systems biology in these traditionally <b>agricultural</b> <b>species</b> we have established "AgBase", a curated, web-accessible, public resource [URL] for structural and functional annotation of agricultural genomes. The AgBase database includes a suite of computational tools to use GO annotations. We use standardized nomenclature following the Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature guidelines and are currently functionally annotating chicken, cow and sheep gene products using the Gene Ontology (GO). The computational tools we have developed accept and batch process data derived from different public databases (with different accession codes), return all existing GO annotations, provide a list of products without GO annotation, identify potential orthologs, model functional genomics data using GO and assist proteomics analysis of ESTs and EST assemblies. Our journal database helps prevent redundant manual GO curation. We encourage and publicly acknowledge GO annotations from researchers and provide a service for researchers interested in GO and analysis of functional genomics data. Conclusion The AgBase database is the first database dedicated to functional genomics and systems biology analysis for agriculturally important species and their pathogens. We use experimental data to improve structural annotation of genomes and to functionally characterize gene products. AgBase is also directly relevant for researchers in fields as diverse as agricultural production, cancer biology, biopharmaceuticals, human health and evolutionary biology. Moreover, the experimental methods and bioinformatics tools we provide are widely applicable to many other species including model organisms. </p...|$|R

We show that pedigree data can be directly represented on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), allowing highly efficient massively parallel simulation of the flow of genes. Operating on the whole pedigree in parallel, the transmission of genes can occur for all individuals in a single clock cycle. By using FPGA, the algorithms to estimate inbreeding coefficients and allelic probabilities are shown to operate hundreds to thousands of times faster than the corresponding sequentially based algorithms. Where problems can be largely represented in an integer form, FPGA provide an efficient platform for computations on pedigree data...|$|R
