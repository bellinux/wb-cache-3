40|$|As main result we {{show that}} for each g > 1 there is some {{translation}} surface of genus g whose Veech group is a non congruence subgroup of SL(2,Z). We use origamis/square-tiled surfaces to produce our examples. The article {{is divided into two}} parts: In the first part we introduce translation surfaces, <b>origamis,</b> Veech groups and Teichmueller curves and show for two <b>origamis</b> in genus 2 that their Veech groups are non congruence groups; in the second part we provide a technique that produces sequences of <b>origamis</b> whose Veech groups are decreasing.

40|$|DNA based {{nanostructures}} {{built on}} a long single stranded DNA scaffold, known as DNA <b>origamis,</b> offer the possibility to organize various molecules at the nanometer scale in one pot experiments. The folding of the scaffold is guaranteed {{by the presence of}} short, single stranded DNA sequences (staples), that hold together separate regions of the scaffold. In this paper, we modelize the annealing-melting properties of these DNA constructions. The model captures important features such as the hysteresis between melting and annealing, as well as the dependence upon the topology of the scaffold. We show that cooperativity between staples is critical to quantitatively explain the folding process of DNA <b>origamis...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Japanese paper-folding art of <b>origami</b> {{has been}} {{reworked}} mathematically by Tomoko Fusé using modules, congruent {{pieces of paper}} such as squares, and making them into polyhedra or tilings.

The mathematics of paper folding has been explored in Maekawa's theorem, Kawasaki's theorem, and the Huzita–Hatori axioms.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We compute {{explicitly}} {{the action}} of the group of affine diffeomorphisms on the relative homology of two remarkable <b>origamis</b> discovered respectively by Forni (in genus 3) and Forni-Matheus (in genus 4). We show that, in both cases, the action on the non trivial part of the homology is through finite groups. In particular, the action on some 4 -dimensional invariant subspace of the homology leaves invariant a root system of D 4 type. This provides as a by-product a new proof of (slightly stronger versions of) the results of Forni and Matheus: the non trivial Lyapunov exponents of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle for the Teichmüller disks of these two <b>origamis</b> are equal to zero.

40|$|We give {{an example}} of a Teichmüller curve which contains, in a factor of its monodromy, a group which was not {{observed}} before. Namely, it has Zariski closure equal to the group SO^*(6) in its standard representation; up to finite index, this is the same as SU(3, 1) in its second exterior power representation. The example is constructed using <b>origamis</b> (i. e. square-tiled surfaces). It can be generalized to give monodromy inside the group SO^*(2 n) for all n, but in the general case the monodromy might split further inside the group. Also, we take the opportunity to compute the multiplicities of representations in the (0, 1) part of the cohomology of regular <b>origamis,</b> answering a question of Matheus-Yoccoz-Zmiaikou.

5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid <b>origami</b> (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, {{who was a}} post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are DNA <b>origami</b> and DNA-based hybrid materials.|$|E
5|$|Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, {{inserted}} into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an <b>origami</b> unicorn, is {{seen by many as}} showing that Deckard is a replicant—because Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for in situ visualization of the biomechanics of DNA structural networks using 4 D electron microscopy. Vibrational oscillations of the DNA structure are excited mechanically through a short burst of substrate vibrations {{triggered by a}} laser pulse. Subsequently, the motion is probed with electron pulses to observe the impulse response of the specimen in space and time. From the frequency and amplitude of the observed oscillations, we determine the normal modes and eigenfrequencies of the structures involved. Moreover, by selective “nano-cutting” at a given point in the network, {{it was possible to}} obtain Young’s modulus, and hence the stiffness, of the DNA filament at that position.

40|$|SETS (Self-Erecting Temporary Shelter) is {{a project}} born to realize a temporary, flexible, lightweight, {{experimental}} pavilion. It is a synthesis between the ancient <b>origami’s</b> art and the innovative vacuumatics. So SETS is able to switch from two-dimensional configuration, for transportation and storage, to the spatial one, adaptable to several uses (from fashion shows to emergencies). To achieve this goal SETS is based on two qualifying items: a strong geometric control, due to the parametric design tool, and the vacuum technology, that is able to ‘freeze’ it into the chosen configuration.

40|$|Covalent bridges play {{a crucial}} role in the folding process of sequence-defined biopolymers. This feature, however, has not been recreated in {{synthetic}} polymers because, apart from some simple regular arrangements (such as block co-polymers), these macromolecules generally do not exhibit a controlled primary structure-that is, it is difficult to predetermine precisely the sequence of their monomers. Herein, we introduce a versatile strategy for preparing foldable linear polymer chains. Well-defined polymers were synthesized by the atom transfer radical polymerization of styrene. The controlled addition of discrete amounts of protected maleimide at precise times during the synthesis enabled the formation of polystyrene chains that contained positionable reactive alkyne functions. Intramolecular reactions between these functions subsequently led to the formation of different types of covalently folded polymer chains. For example, tadpole (P-shaped), pseudocyclic (Q-shaped), bicyclic (8 -shaped) and knotted (alpha-shaped) macromolecular <b>origamis</b> were prepared in a relatively straightforward manner...|$|R

40|$|Plasmonics is {{the science}} and {{technology}} exploiting the optical properties of surface free electrons in noble metals. After {{more than a decade}} of exploration of the properties of metallic films patterned by top-down lithographic approaches, the specific properties of metal nanoparticles have appeared to be relevant not only for sensing applications but also potentially for information processing using localized plasmons. Yet the challenges facing colloidal plasmonics are primarily the design of nanoparticles with specific spectral and spatial optical properties and their organization into ordered higher-scale architectures. The structural quality of superstructures resulting from self-assembly processes would immensely benefit from the exploitation of designed biomolecules. This tutorial will be divided into four sections. The first one will provide background information on the achievements and challenges of both top-down and bottom-up approaches of plasmonics. Secondly, the confinement, enhancement of the electromagnetic field in individual or coupled nanoparticles will be exposed. We will then overview some strategies to build larger architectures from colloids by applying some simple principles of self-assembly.
