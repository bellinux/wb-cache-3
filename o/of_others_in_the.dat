5|$|The {{involvement}} of Dante and Petrarch {{in establishing the}} sestina form, together with the contributions <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, account for its classification as an Italian verse form—despite not originating there. The result was that the sestina was re-imported into France from Italy in the 16th century. Pontus de Tyard was the first poet to attempt the form in French, {{and the only one}} to do so prior to the 19th century; he introduced a partial rhyme scheme in his sestina.|$|E

Indeed, if trilliums are {{available}} deer will seek these plants, with a preference for T. grandiflorum, to the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> course of normal browsing, deer consume larger individuals, leaving shorter ones behind. This information can be used to assess deer density and its effect on understory growth in general.|$|E
5|$|Military {{aircraft}} {{flying at}} night {{have often been}} painted black or other dark colors, applied to just the underside of some aircraft and to the entirety <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of {{reducing the risk of}} being seen in enemy searchlights or by night fighters. However, aircraft camouflaged with black paint are actually darker than the night sky, making them more visible to observers not using searchlights. The undersides of Heinkel 111 night bombers were painted black. The De Havilland Mosquito was similarly initially painted black when used as a night fighter; matt black was found to be the best at reducing the aircraft's visibility against searchlights, but the aircraft's speed was reduced by 15mph (25kph) compared to glossy black, which, being smoother, produced less drag. Since, however, black camouflage made the planes conspicuous on moonlit nights and against cloud, a variation of a day camouflage scheme was eventually chosen.|$|E

5|$|The fake will {{in which}} the Shunzhi Emperor had {{supposedly}} expressed regret for abandoning Manchu traditions gave authority to the nativist policies of the Kangxi Emperor's four regents. Citing the testament, Oboi and the other regents quickly abolished the Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus. Over the next few years, they enhanced {{the power of the}} Imperial Household Department, which was run by Manchus and their bondservants, eliminated the Hanlin Academy, and limited membership in the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers to Manchus and Mongols. The regents also adopted aggressive policies toward the Qing's Chinese subjects: they executed dozens of people and punished thousands <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wealthy Jiangnan region for literary dissent and tax arrears, and forced the coastal population of southeast China to move inland in order to starve the Taiwan-based Kingdom of Tungning run by descendants of Koxinga.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Kinect was {{released}} by Microsoft as a 3D scanner/webcam hybrid peripheral device which provides full-body detection of Xbox 360 players and hands-free control of the user interfaces of video games and other software on the console. This was later modified by Oliver Kreylos of University of California, Davis {{in a series of}} YouTube videos which showed him combining the Kinect with a PC-based virtual camera. Because the Kinect is capable of detecting a full range of depth (through computer stereo vision and Structured light) within a captured scene, Kreylos demonstrated the capacity of the Kinect and the virtual camera to allow free-viewpoint navigation of the range of depth, although the camera could only allow a video capture of the scene as shown {{to the front of the}} Kinect, resulting in fields of black, empty space where the camera was unable to capture video within the field of depth. Later, Kreylos demonstrated a further elaboration on the modification by combining the video streams of two Kinects in order to further enhance the video capture within the view of the virtual camera. Kreylos' developments using the Kinect were covered among the works <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kinect hacking and homebrew community in a New York Times article.|$|E

25|$|Growing to {{a height}} of up to , the Cornish Elm is a slender, slow-growing {{deciduous}} tree, distinguished by its long, straight trunk, which culminates in a narrow fan-shaped crown comprising short, straight, ascending branches. The leaves are small, obovate to oval, typically acuminate at the apex, 6cm long by 3.5cm broad, with a dark-green upper surface, glossy and smooth. The perfect apetalous wind-pollinated flowers occur in clusters of 1520 on very short pedicels.

25|$|A {{number of}} studies {{conducted}} among the Muslim youth in various western European countries have showed that Muslim children have far more antisemitic ideas than Christian children- in 2011 Mark Elchardus, a Belgian sociologist, published a report on Dutch-language elementary schools in Brussels. He found that about 50 percent of Muslim students in second and third grade could be considered anti-Semites, versus 10% <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> same year Unther Jikeli published his findings from the 117 interviews he conducted with Muslim male youngsters (average age 19) in Berlin, Paris and London. The majority of the interviewees voiced some, or strong antisemitic feelings. They expressed them openly and often aggressively.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of the ethnic Ukrainian territory of Volhynia to the USSR created several issues. Having avoided the Bolshevik repression, the Orthodox church of this rural region outnumbered {{the rest of the}} Ukrainian SSR by nearly a thousand churches and clergy as well as many cloisters including the Pochayiv Lavra. The ecclesiastical link with the Moscow Patriarchate was immediately restored. Within months nearly a million Orthodox pilgrims, from all over the country, fearing that these reclaimed western parishes would share the fate <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> USSR, took the chance to visit them. However, the Soviet authorities, although confiscating some of the public property, did not show the repressions of the post-revolutionary period that many expected and no executions or physical destruction took place.|$|E

25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories {{are more likely to}} engage in counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are {{more likely to engage in}} CWB when they feel threatened. Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E
25|$|The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{is adapted}} from the Inclusion <b>of</b> <b>Others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Self (IOS) Scale by Aron et al. (1992). The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{contains}} seven pairs of Venn diagrams that range in how far apart the circles are. In the first pair, there is no overlap but as {{you get to the}} second, or third pair, the circles begin to overlap more and more. In the last pair (the seventh pair) the circles completely overlap. Participants respond to eight items by choosing the pair of circles that best denotes their connection with that particular item. A sample item is “The connection between you and a wild animal (such as a squirrel, deer, or wolf).” There are also eight other items to this scale that assess how connected participants feel to people. This scale shows acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.75) and validity (correlations with concern for environment). This scale is not contaminated with social desirability biases. The NR scale, the Allo-Inclusive scale, and the CN scale are highly correlated with one another suggesting they {{are all part of the}} nature connectedness construct.|$|E
