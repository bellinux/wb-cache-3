Fossil fuels {{will continue to}} dominate other sources of energy although it is non-renewable and harm global climate. Problems associated with fossil fuels have driven the search for alternative energy sources <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>biodiesel</b> is one option. Biodiesel is renewable, non-toxic, environmental-friendly and an economically feasible options to tackle the depleting fossil fuels and its negative environmental impact. It can be produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, waste oils and algae. However, nowadays, the major feedstocks of biodiesel are edible oils and this has created food vs fuel debate. Therefore, the future prospect is to use non-edible oils, animal fats, waste oils and algae as feedstock for biodiesel. Selection of non-expensive feedstock and the extraction and preparation of oil for biodiesel production is a crucial step due to its relevance on the overall technology. There are three main conventional oil extraction methods: mechanical, chemical/solvent and enzymatic extraction methods. There are also some newly developed oil extraction methods {{that can be used}} separately or in combination with the conventional ones, to overcome some disadvantages of the conventional oil extraction methods.

30|$|There are {{two reasons}} which cause the {{discrepancy}} of temperature sensitivity of these fluids: One is {{the difference in the}} viscosity–temperature characteristics of the base oils, i.e., biodiesel and petrodiesel. The effects of chain length, double bond number, cis–trans isomerism, and type of ester head groups on the viscosity–temperature characteristic <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> (<b>which</b> naturally influences the viscosity–temperature characteristic of BBDF) are well-documented in literature (Moser 2011; Knothe and Steidley 2005). Another reason is that there are differences of molecular interactions between the base oil and all sorts of chemicals in the drilling fluids. Even if identical additives are used in BBDF and OBDF, the values of rheological parameters and viscosity characteristics of the two fluids would be different from one to another. These facts mean that we should select a biodiesel having suitable rheological properties and develop/choose eligible additives for designing a high-performance BBDF.|$|R

Thus with my research, {{it will be a}} major breakthrough for the usage of biodiesel in any weather no matter cold or warm. Pour point (PP) is defined as the lowest temperature where the biodiesel flows or can be pumped. Pour point can also be described as the lowest temperature at which a fuel performs satisfactorily and beyond this temperature, the fuel stops flowing and starts to freeze. The cloud point (CP) of the fuel is defined as the temperature where crystals become visible forming a hazy or cloudy suspension. Pour point and cloud point are the most important parameters which are involved in determining whether cold flow properties are improved or not. There are many methods used for this purpose such as winterization, fractanation and also biodiesel and petro diesel blending but the method of two types of different biodiesel just been rarely tested. Thus, I came up with this method and tried it using two types <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> <b>which</b> are jatropha oil and palm oil. The FFA (free fatty acid) produced from both of this oil is blended in different proportion and the biodiesel is produced. After the biodiesel is produced, the samples are sent to the GCMS analysis to determine whether biodiesel is produced or not. Then, the cold flow properties are determined for each sample. The pour point, cloud point, density, viscosity and kinematic viscosity were determined. From the results, the main objective of this research is achieved where the blending of two types of biodiesel can improve the cold flow properties of biodiesel.
