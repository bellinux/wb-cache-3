5|$|I-8 enters Arizona from California at the Colorado River {{bridge at}} Yuma. It {{initially}} heads south through Yuma until the interchange with US95, where the freeway begins {{to turn to}} the east and passes through eastern Yuma and Fortuna Foothills, briefly paralleling US95. West of Wellton, the highway takes a northeasterly course, paralleling the Gila River and passing to the south of Roll. Through this part of Arizona, I-8 passes along the northern edge of the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range and to the south of the Yuma Proving Ground. It keeps a northeastern heading, passing through the community of Dateland, until it reaches Gila Bend. There, the freeway intersects SR85 heading north to Phoenix and south to the <b>Organ</b> <b>Pipe</b> Cactus National Monument.|$|E

25|$|Flutes may be open at {{one or both}} ends. The ocarina, xun, pan pipes, police whistle, and bosun's whistle are closed-ended. Open-ended flutes such as {{the concert}} flute and the {{recorder}} have more harmonics, and thus more flexibility for the player, and brighter timbres. An <b>organ</b> <b>pipe</b> may be either open or closed, depending on the sound desired.|$|E

25|$|In most areas, {{various species}} of cacti {{can be seen}} such as the <b>organ</b> <b>pipe</b> and nopals, {{as well as the}} yucca. Trees adapted to dry climates include mesquite, willows and cypress, near streams and rivers. Animal life mostly {{consists}} of small mammals, deer, predatory birds and reptiles. In some areas, monarch butterflies can be seen as well. Nature reserves in the municipality include the Peña Colorado, Tángano, Parque Ecologicao Joya-La Barreta and the El Cimatario National Park.|$|E
25|$|The {{tube length}} determines whether the tube {{acoustic}} pressure or velocity {{is the dominant}} influence on {{the frequency of the}} tube. Simple models of <b>organ</b> <b>pipe</b> resonance is based on open-open pipe resonance (λ=) but corrections must be made to take into account that one end of the pipe radiates into the surrounding medium and the other radiates through a slit with a jet flow. Boelkes and Hoffmann have made measurements of end correction for open-open tubes and derived the relation δ=0.33D. This cannot be exact since the driving end is not open.|$|E

25|$|Black soldier fly - Stratiomyidae - have {{potential}} {{for use in}} forensic entomology. The larvae are common scavengers in compost heaps, are found in association with carrion, can be destructive pests in honey bee hives, and are used in manure management (for both house fly control and reduction in manure volume). The larvae {{range in size from}} 1/8 to 3/4 of an inch (3 to 19 millimeters). The adult fly is a mimic, very close in size, color, and appearance to the <b>organ</b> <b>pipe</b> mud dauber wasp and its relatives.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{physical}} {{systems can be}} modeled as sets of coupled oscillators. The motions of such oscillators can be decomposed into normal modes, like the vibrational modes of a piano string or the resonances of an <b>organ</b> <b>pipe.</b> On the other hand, equipartition often breaks down for such systems, {{because there is no}} exchange of energy between the normal modes. In an extreme situation, the modes are independent and so their energies are independently conserved. This shows that some sort of mixing of energies, formally called ergodicity, is important for the law of equipartition to hold.|$|E
25|$|With Northern California as a {{permanent}} base, Yerkes now painted for herself. She had ready access {{to some of the}} West’s greatest natural wonders. She traveled, camped and painted from Yosemite Valley to Santa Fe and from Tucson to Alberta, Canada. Travelogues, kept by her husband, showed detailed records of these adventures all throughout the 1930s and 40s. They toured in their specially modified 1920s Buick which was equipped with extra storage pockets and a canvas sling for an interior bed. Yerkes, her husband, and their daughter Mary, (nicknamed Min), spent weekends and holidays traveling on dirt roads to explore the inner sanctums of the newly established National Parks. Extended expeditions took them several times throughout the West and they toured many National Parks including; Crater Lake, Mt Rainier, Glacier, Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Rainbow Bridge and Arches, Mesa Verde, Joshua Tree, Death Valley, Grand Canyon, <b>Organ</b> <b>Pipe</b> Cactus National Monument and Yosemite, as well as the Oregon, Washington and California coasts. Yosemite Valley was a particular favorite subject matter and destination because of its beauty and proximity to San Mateo.|$|E

500|$|The {{southern}} terminus of SR85 {{is located}} at the United States-Mexico border near Lukeville in Pima County. The road continues across the border into Mexico to the town of Sonoita as Mexican Federal Highway 8. SR85 heads north from the border as a two-lane road, passing through the <b>Organ</b> <b>Pipe</b> Cactus National Monument. The highway leaves the monument boundary and heads to a junction with SR86 in Why. SR86 heads east from this junction towards Tucson and southeastern Arizona. SR85 heads northwest from this junction to the town of Ajo. From Ajo, the highway heads north and enters the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range. While within the range, the highway enters Maricopa County. After the highway passes through the range, it continues towards the north to a junction with I-8 in Gila Bend. After passing I-8, the highway intersects the business loop of I-8 and turns towards the east to run concurrently with business loop along Pima Street in Gila Bend. The two highways split, with the business loop heading towards the southeast and SR85 heading northeast providing access to Gila Bend Municipal Airport ...|$|E

50|$|The unusual {{shape of}} Jackson Creek <b>Organ</b> <b>Pipes</b> is {{attributed}} to the columnar structure which is rare and occurred at strategic location where the down cutting action of the stream created the post-volcanic valley.
