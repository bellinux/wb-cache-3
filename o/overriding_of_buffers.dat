40|$|ABSTRACT: Buffers {{are often}} used in Construction to prevent the {{negative}} impact of Variability and Uncertainty on projects. Inventories of materials, budget contingencies, time float, and excess of equipment capacity are examples of the type <b>of</b> <b>Buffers</b> found in construction. However, usually the design and management <b>of</b> <b>Buffers</b> is based mostly on intuition and performed informally. New production philosophies such as Lean Production, Lean Construction and Theory of Constraints allow a more systematic and rigorous approach to the Design and Management <b>of</b> <b>Buffers.</b> This paper discusses the role of production management philosophies in the Design and Management <b>of</b> <b>Buffers,</b> and how selected IT tools can support this process. The paper also provides some guidelines for the design <b>of</b> <b>Buffers</b> in repetitive construction projects using a proposed conceptual model...|$|R
