Canton favorites include fresh-squeezed lemonade, smoked turkey legs, funnel cakes (pancakey batter drizzled into hot <b>oil</b> through a <b>funnel</b> and covered in powdered sugar), sausage on a stick, corny dogs, kettle corn (mildly sweet popcorn), and wonderful homemade breakfasts.

40|$|The Chad-Cameroon {{oilfield}} {{development and}} pipeline project {{was a major}} attempt {{by the international community}} to leverage an extractive industries project to promote development in a fragile state. The project is notable for its size and ambition, and for the intensive participation of multilateral institutions, multinational corporations, governments, and civil society. The centerpiece of the project was an elaborate revenue management program designed to <b>funnel</b> <b>oil</b> revenues to priority sectors in Chad. However, unanticipated developments, including a deteriorating security situation, gradually eroded the Chadian government’s compliance with the program, resulting in disbursement suspensions and renegotiations. The program was prematurely terminated when the government of Chad fully prepaid its remaining financial obligations to the World Bank after just seven years of the project’s anticipated 20 - 30 year lifespan. Once hailed as a newly emergent model for development, the project now offers important lessons stressing the need for greater pragmatism in the future. * Author note: The author would like to thank Ian Glenday and several anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on {{an earlier version of this}} article...|$|R
2500|$|Thus the White Revolution in Iran {{represented}} a new attempt to introduce reform {{from above and}} preserve traditional power patterns. Through land reform, {{the essence of the}} White Revolution, the Shah hoped to ally himself with the peasantry in the countryside, and hoped to sever their ties with the aristocracy in the city. What the Shah did not expect was that the White Revolution led to new social tensions that helped create many of the problems the Shah had been trying to avoid. The Shah's reforms more than quadrupled the combined size of the two classes that had posed the most challenges to his monarchy in the past – the intelligentsia and the urban working class. Their resentment towards the Shah also grew since they were now stripped of organizations that had represented them in the past, such as political parties, professional associations, trade unions, and independent newspapers. The land reform, instead of allying the peasants with the government, produced large numbers of independent farmers and landless laborers who became loose political cannons, with no feeling of loyalty to the Shah. Many of the masses felt resentment towards the increasingly corrupt government; their loyalty to the clergy, who were seen as more concerned with the fate of the populace, remained consistent or increased. As Ervand Abrahamian pointed out, The White Revolution had been designed to preempt a Red Revolution. Instead, it paved the way for an Islamic Revolution. The White Revolution's economic [...] "trickle-down" [...] strategy also did not work as intended.
