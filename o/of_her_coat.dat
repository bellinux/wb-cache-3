5|$|As Scully {{heads to}} the other room to get ready, her FBI badge falls out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> pocket. Scully discreetly picks it back up without Ed noticing. The tattoo begins to talk again, convincing Ed to redial Scully's last call to see who she was {{speaking}} to. An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone and text, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile phone rang from a pocket <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat,</b> which was still in the flat. He found that her purse and keys were also at the flat, and that their cat appeared to have been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E
25|$|Chang's {{eventual}} downfall {{was caused}} by his association with Violet Payne, also known as Mary Deval or Ruby Duval. Payne was a chorus girl or actress and a drug addict living in Maple Street, near Tottenham Court Road. On 23 February 1924, police saw Payne in the Commercial Tavern, Pennyfields, with packets of an unknown substance. She {{was taken to the}} police station, searched, and found to have cocaine hidden in the lining <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat.</b> There were marks on her body indicating the use of a hypodermic syringe. Payne made a statement to the police and Chang's home was searched at 11.30 pm the same day. A single bag of cocaine was found behind a loose board in a cupboard. Chang was subsequently arrested and charged with possessing and supplying cocaine.|$|E
6000|$|She {{rubbed her}} cheek against the comfortable, rough, heather-smelling {{shoulder}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>coat,</b> while he patted her and smiled, [...] "Good girl! I {{better get out}} and help." ...|$|R
60|$|Ah, well! Time {{enough to}} face things when they came. She would only think of seeing him! And {{she put the}} letter back to burn what hole it liked in the pocket <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fur <b>coat.</b>|$|R
6000|$|And a girl saw, {{and as she}} saw {{her heart}} leaped to her mouth. Her small hand gripped the sleeve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>coat.</b> [...] "The king, father," [...] she cried. [...] "It is the king." ...|$|R
2500|$|The exhibit {{features}} many {{references to}} Sook, but two items {{in particular are}} always favorites of visitors: Sook's [...] "Coat of Many Colors" [...] and Truman's baby blanket. Truman's first cousin recalls that as children, he and Truman never had trouble finding Sook in the darkened house on South Alabama Avenue because they simply looked for the bright colors <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat.</b> Truman's baby blanket is a [...] "granny square" [...] blanket Sook made for him. The blanket became one of Truman's most cherished possessions, and friends say he was seldom without it – even when traveling. In fact, he took the blanket {{with him when he}} flew from New York to Los Angeles to be with Joanne Carson on August 23, 1984. According to Joanne Carson, when he died at her home on August 25, his last words were, [...] "It's me, it's Buddy," [...] followed by, [...] "I'm cold." [...] Buddy was Sook's name for him.|$|E
2500|$|Laura's cake is {{complete}} {{but she is}} not happy. It is less than she had hoped it would be. She had invested great and desperate hopes in the cake, like an artist working on a great piece of art, and in her mind, she failed. Laura catalogues what she will do to keep busy {{for the rest of the}} day: prepare for Dan's party. She knows Dan will be happy with whatever she prepares. This slightly annoys her. She realises her husband's happiness [...] "depends only on the fact of her, here in the house, living her life, thinking of him". She tries to tell herself this is a good thing and that she is being difficult but is suddenly hit by the image of Virginia Woolf putting a stone into the pocket <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> and walking into a river. This psychic connection to another ‘desperate housewife’ is interrupted by a tap on the back door.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{ran to her}} {{saddle and}} got the {{biscuits}} out of the pockets <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat,</b> and she {{ran back to the}} rider.|$|E
50|$|The album's cover art {{was created}} by British artist Boo Ritson, using <b>her</b> {{technique}} <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> <b>her</b> subjects with high gloss emulsion and photographing the result.|$|R
50|$|Bjarne Erbo Grønfeldt, Deputy Private Secretary to the Queen, {{confirms}} that Princess Elisabeth's {{coat of arms}} consists of a shield <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grandfather's <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms supported by two savages holding clubs, surrounded by the Order of the Elephant, all under a canopy ensigned with a crown <b>of</b> <b>her</b> rank.|$|R
50|$|Between 1914 and 1919 Edith Rosenbaum was American press attaché for the {{governing}} {{body of the}} French fashion industry, the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, now called Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture and {{a division of the}} Fédération française de la couture. She was a highly critical observer of the fashion industry, both in New York and Paris, and her opinions were frequently quoted in the press. In 1915 she served as an advisor on the American Fashion Exhibit at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. Edith continued as a correspondent for Womens Wear Daily until about 1917, although she contributed occasional articles thereafter. In 1916 Edith designed a collection of sportswear for Sidney Blumenthal & Co., including golf skirts and jackets. One <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coats</b> for Blumenthal she officially copyrighted.|$|R
60|$|She turned away, spasmodically {{tearing the}} twigs of spindleberry from the hedge, and {{fastening}} them, with vibrating fingers, in the bosom <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{advanced}} to the table behind which the general stood and, taking a folded paper from an inside pocket <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat,</b> handed it to him.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{face was}} like an open word [...] When brave men speak and choose, [...] The very colours <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> [...] Were better than good news.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the only}} thing we could save from a wreck off the Spurn," [...] said her husband. [...] "Scottish as I take it. The rogues seem to have taken to their boats, leaving behind them a poor woman and her child. I trust they met their deserts and were swamped. We saw the {{fluttering}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coats</b> as we made for the Humber, and I sent Goatley and Jaques in the boat to see if anything lived. The poor wench was gone before they could lift her up, but the little one cried lustily, though it has waxen weaker since. We had no milk on board, and could only give it bits of soft bread soaked in beer, and I misdoubt me whether it did not all run out at the corners of its mouth." ...|$|R
50|$|The current {{version of}} the royal {{standard}} was introduced on 16 November 1972 when the Queen adopted a new version <b>of</b> <b>her</b> personal <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms. The royal standard is the flag of Denmark with a swallow-tail and charged with the monarch’s coat of arms set in a white square. The centre square is 32 parts in a flag with the ratio 56:107.|$|R
50|$|Ottilie died on 15 August 1517 in Baden-Baden and {{was buried}} in the local Collegiate Church. Her bronze Epitaph shows an image <b>of</b> <b>her</b> with the <b>coats</b> <b>of</b> arms of Württemberg and Katzenelnbogen at her feet.|$|R
60|$|She {{rose to her}} feet. He made no movement, but {{his eyes}} watched her, and the muscles of his body stiffened. He watched the white hand which stole irresolutely towards the loose folds <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what did}} I tell you of him?" [...] he asked, rejoicing, as they started: a {{question}} for all answer to which, before she took his arm, the girl thrust her paper, crumpled, into the pocket <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sanford Quest {{was smoking}} his after breakfast cigar with a relish {{somewhat}} {{affected by the}} measure of his perplexities. Early though it was, Lenora was already in her place, bending over her desk, and Laura, who had just arrived, was busy divesting herself <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> and hat. Quest watched the latter impatiently.|$|E
5000|$|Maria {{is often}} {{referred}} (like her mother) as a protector {{of the arts and}} writing. She sponsored several building projects, particularly in Carnide, then a village in the Lisbon countryside. There she was patron to the building of the Church of Nossa Senhora da Luz and the Hospital of Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres, which currently houses the Colégio Militar, both of which still boast large reliefs <b>of</b> <b>her</b> personal <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> arms.|$|R
50|$|That same day, Wilhelmina's hormone {{treatments}} {{have her}} behaving more lovingly than usual, with assistance from Marc, {{who has to}} inject the shots while she binges on ice cream. But hours later, Wilhelmina's doctor tells her that she can't carry a child because she has a hostile womb and she'll {{have to find a}} surrogate, so she asks her manicurist, Brandy, who already has five children. Brandy agrees to it and Wilhelmina offers <b>her</b> one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fur <b>coats</b> as a done deal.|$|R
60|$|The Groac'h seemed overjoyed to see her, {{and told}} her that never before had she beheld such a {{handsome}} young man. Very soon she led her visitor into the great hall, where wine and fruit were always waiting, and on the table lay the magic knife, left there by Houarn. Unseen by the Groac'h, Bellah hid it in a pocket <b>of</b> <b>her</b> green <b>coat,</b> and then followed her hostess into the garden, and to the pond which contained the fish, their sides shining with a thousand different colours.|$|R
60|$|So he chattered, {{scarcely}} {{aware of}} what he said, only knowing he was putting berries in the bosom <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat,</b> while she stood patiently for him. And she watched his quick hands, so full of life, {{and it seemed to}} her she had never SEEN anything before. Till now, everything had been indistinct.|$|E
6000|$|... "Though, really," [...] he said, as he fitted {{them into}} the breast <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat,</b> [...] "you ought to object to my getting them, because of the birds. But they don't care much for rose-hips in this part, {{where they can get}} plenty of stuff. You often find the berries going rotten in the springtime." ...|$|E
60|$|But Toolooha's {{love was}} wise {{as well as}} strong. If all else failed, she was wont to apply {{corporal}} punishment, and whacked her baby with her tail. Be not shocked, reader. We refer to the tail <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat,</b> which was so long that it trailed on the ground, and had a flap at the end which produced surprising results when properly applied.|$|E
60|$|Chingatok {{seemed the}} {{personification}} of savage dignity as he stood there, leaning on a short walrus spear. Evidently his little mother doted on him. So did Oblooria, a pretty little girl of about sixteen, who was his only sister, and the counterpart <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother, hairy <b>coat</b> and tail included, only a few sizes smaller.|$|R
5000|$|A {{record was}} given <b>of</b> <b>her</b> trial by Cotton Mather in [...] "The Wonders of the Invisible World." [...] In his book, Mather {{recorded}} that several people testified against Bishop, {{stating that the}} shape of Bishop would pinch, choke or bite them. The shape also threatened to drown one victim {{if she did not}} write her name in a certain book. During the trial, anytime Bishop would look upon one of those supposed to be tortured by her, they would be immediately struck down and only her touch would revive them. More allegations were made during the trial including that of a woman saying that the apparition <b>of</b> Bishop tore <b>her</b> <b>coat,</b> upon further examination <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> was found to be torn in the exact spot. Mather mentions that the truth of these many accusations carried too much suspicion, however.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{begins with}} Jerry and George at a drug store to {{purchase}} medicine where George becomes {{involved in an}} altercation with the cashier (played by Gwen Shepherd), accusing <b>her</b> <b>of</b> short-changing him ten dollars. He is removed by the security guard. George gets invited to a party on Long Island and brings Elaine and Jerry with him. Jerry and Elaine have a bad time trapped in boring conversations, and Elaine confronts a woman because <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fur <b>coat.</b> At one point during the party, Elaine does a mock Australian accent from the film A Cry in the Dark and exclaims [...] "Maybe the dingo ate your baby?" ...|$|R
60|$|Emily, however, {{regretted that}} she had no shawl, and so Lettie must needs wear a black coat over her summer dress. It fitted so absurdly that we all laughed, but Leslie was very angry that she should appear ludicrous before them. He showed her all the polite attentions possible, {{fastened}} the neck <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> with his pearl scarf-pin, refusing the pin Emily discovered, after some search. Then we sallied forth.|$|E
60|$|He {{fastened}} one of {{his great}} hands in the front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat</b> {{and gave her a}} pull. So powerful was it that Carley came hard against him, almost knocking her breathless. There he held her a moment and then put his other arm round her. It seemed to crush both breath and sense out of her. Suddenly limp, she sank strengthless. She seemed reeling in darkness. Then she felt herself thrust away from him with violence. She sank on the couch and her head and shoulders struck the wall.|$|E
60|$|His reticence {{served only}} to fortify her trust--to elevate it. It was {{impossible}} for her not to feel something of that which was in him and crying for utterance. She was a woman. And if this one action had been but the holding <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>coat,</b> she would have known. A man who could keep silent under these conditions must indeed be a rock of might and honour; and she felt sure now, with a surging of joy, that the light she had seen shining from it was the beacon of truth. A question trembled on her lips--the question for which she had long been gathering strength. Whatever {{the outcome of this}} communion, she felt that there must be absolute truth between them.|$|E
60|$|A {{few yards}} off, a man stood under a tree. His {{back was to}} Margaret, but the dark object across his {{shoulder}} was a slung rifle and she thought she knew him. Stannard leaned against a trunk opposite. He wore dinner dress and a loose light coat. He was in the moonlight, and when {{he shook his head}} Margaret thought his smile ironical. The other's pose was stiff and his fist was clenched. Margaret put her hand in the pocket <b>of</b> <b>her</b> deerskin <b>coat</b> and then moved a branch. The man turned and his hand went to his rifle. Margaret heard the sling rattle.|$|R
5000|$|For example, a 1969 Fold-In asking, [...] "What is the {{one thing}} protest marches have greatly improved?" [...] {{depicted}} a stream of placard-carrying marchers, but folded into the image of the underside of a worn-out sole and the answer, [...] "SHOE SALES." [...] A drawing of a fearsome panther stalking a variety of jungle animals accompanying the question [...] "What predatory creature most threatens the survival of endangered species?" [...] contracted to the image of a lavishly swaddled woman and the solution [...] "FUR LOVERS." [...] (In the larger drawing, the two halves <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fur <b>coat</b> had been the foliage of trees.) Following the 1991 Tailhook scandal, a Navy war room became a female officer being sexually molested by a gauntlet <b>of</b> <b>her</b> comrades.|$|R
60|$|Arriving {{in the hot}} {{main street}} <b>of</b> Ripton, <b>her</b> sharp eyes descried the Record sign over the drug store, and in an astonishingly short time {{she was in the}} empty office. Mr. Pardriff was at dinner. She sat down in the {{editorial}} chair and read a great deal of uninteresting matter, but at last found something on the floor (where the wind had blown it) which made her laugh. It was the account of Austen Vane's difficulty with Mr. Blodgett. Victoria did not know Austen, but she knew that the Honourable Hilary had a son of that name who had gone West, and this was what tickled her. She thrust the clipping in the pocket <b>of</b> <b>her</b> linen <b>coat</b> just as Mr. Pardriff came in.|$|R
