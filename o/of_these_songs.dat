5|$|In 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen {{recorded}} Smith playing acoustic {{songs for}} the short film Lucky Three: An Elliott Smith Portrait. Two <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>songs</b> would appear on his next album, Either/Or, which was another Kill Rock Stars release. Either/Or came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass guitar, drums, keyboards, and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title {{was derived from the}} two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, whose works generally deal with themes such as existential despair, angst, death, and God.|$|E
5|$|According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold {{approximately}} 215,000 {{copies in}} the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, {{making it the}} 12th-top-selling game in that month. These numbers were {{not considered to be}} strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with the possibility that the mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game. In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>songs</b> was rather small.|$|E

The Solo Remix version features a remixed soundtrack from the original DS release. New assets {{at the conclusion of}} the iOS game hint at a possible sequel, but no confirmation has been made by Square Enix.

25|$|The {{names of}} Kirkby and Hudson {{provided}} a top-line attraction {{for many years}} and they made great capital out of songs specially written for them by Weston and Lee.

25|$|It {{is obvious}} that the first popular music played in Cuba after the Spanish conquest was brought by the Spanish conquerors themselves, and was most likely {{borrowed}} from the Spanish popular music in vogue during the 16th century.

Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>songs</b> with picturesque names such as Sarabande, Chaconne, Zambapalo, Retambico and Gurrumbé, among others, shared a common trait, its characteristic rhythm called Hemiola or Sesquiáltera (in Spain).|$|E
25|$|The youth, {{labor and}} kibbutz {{movements}} {{played a major}} role in musical development before and after the establishment of Israeli statehood in 1948, and in the popularization of many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>songs.</b> The Zionist establishment saw music as a way of establishing a new national identity, and, on a purely pragmatic level, of teaching Hebrew to new immigrants. The national labor organization, the Histadrut, set up a music publishing house that disseminated songbooks and encouraged public sing-alongs (שירה בציבור). This tradition of public sing-alongs continues to the present day, and is a characteristic of modern Israeli culture.|$|E
