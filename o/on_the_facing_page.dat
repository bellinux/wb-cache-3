Amid his travels Praetorius {{found time to}} publish an impressive series of collections of musical compositions, in all {{more than a thousand}} works. Praetorius’s three-volume Syntagma musicum (Musical Encyclopedia) belongs to the last years of his life. Volume I, Musicae artis analecta (1614 / 15, in Latin), treats principles and practices of religious music, from a decidedly Lutheran perspective. Volume II, De organographia (1619, in German) deals with musical instruments, in particular with the organ. Volume III, Termini musici (1619, in German) explores the practice of music, both improvisation and composition. The Syntagma musicum is the first comprehensive treatment of music in the German language. The publication before you is the first English translation of Volume II, Parts III–V, specifically <b>on</b> <b>the</b> organ. Its belated appearance would have puzzled Praetorius, who declares the organ to be “a perfect (indeed one might also say ‘most perfect’) musical instrument … which … takes pride of place above all other musical instruments, most of which can be incorporated into this single instrument. ” This work includes: A precise description of ancient and modern organs, their manual and pedal keyboards, bellows, stoplists, and various kinds of stops, as well as how to tune regals and harpsichords easily and precisely; and what to consider when accepting a [newly‑built] organ, together with an appended detailed table … This edition shows <b>the</b> German original <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left and <b>the</b> English translation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>facing</b> right-hand <b>pages.</b> Translator Dr. Quentin Faulkner is Larson Professor of Organ and Music Theory/History (emeritus) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
