500|$|Speaking {{of their}} {{strained}} relationship {{during an interview}} with Hot 97.5, Minaj said: [...] "It gets {{a little hard to}} have a real connection when people are on different sides of the world, working on different things. You just never know who people got in their ear or what they're feeling <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> felt wronged in some way. I don't know. I just know that Drake is my baby, and Wayne is my everything." [...] However, Drake said their relationship has improved, and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue, saying: [...] "I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up, I had already solved that issue. I wrote that a while ago, and I kinda felt guilty changing it. It was a sentiment that I had when I started this album and felt like that's how it should be. The album should start one place and end in another...I haven't talked to her since it's been out. I'm not sure. I haven't spoke to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bow won {{an evening}} gown {{and a silver}} trophy, and the {{publisher}} committed to help her [...] "gain a role in films", but nothing happened. Bow's father told her to [...] "haunt" [...] Brewster's office (located in Brooklyn) until {{they came up with}} something. [...] "To get rid of me, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> really meant to (give me) all the time and were just busy", Bow was introduced to director Christy Cabanne, who cast her in Beyond the Rainbow, produced late 1921 in New York City and released February 19, 1922. Bow did five scenes and impressed Cabanne with true theatrical tears, but was cut from the final print. [...] "I was sick to my stomach," [...] she recalled and thought her mother was right about the movie business.|$|E

50|$|The swords are {{frequently}} mentioned throughout the books as curved blades, {{and on the}} two UK hardback covers, are depicted as katanas. However, the swords are also described as being scabbarded in a single, curved sheath roughly five feet in length. This would suggest shorter weapons, such as short sabres <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> as <b>they</b> are being depicted as katana they could be kodachi.|$|R
50|$|As can be seen, such an {{increase}} in prices would induce a certain substitution for our hypothetical firm, in fact, 200 units less will be sold. This may be so because some consumers have started to buy a substitute product, the same consumers have bought a smaller quantity of the product given its price increase <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>they</b> have stopped from buying that type of product.|$|R

Now I {{think there may}} be a new generation of players who don't realise how lucky they are to be able to leave a club and join another, even if they are the fifth or sixth foreigner there. I am proud of the ruling because people will still be talking about it in years to come, maybe even after I am gone in 20 or 30 years <b>or</b> whatever. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> will think they should at least thank me, nothing more."

60|$|Now, Jim Leonard said, Pony {{must run}} off right away, and {{not wait for}} the river to rise, or anything. As soon as the river rose, Jim would follow him on the raft; but Pony must start first, and he must take the pike for the city, and sleep in fence corners. They must {{provision}} him, and not eat {{any of the things}} before he started. He must not take a bundle or anything, because if he did people would know he was running off, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> would think he was a runaway slave from Kentucky, he was so dark-complexioned. At first Pony did not like it, because {{it seemed to him that}} Jim Leonard was backing out; but Jim Leonard said that if two of them started off at the same time, people would just know they were running off, and the constable would take them up before they could get across the corporation line. He said that very likely it would rain in less than a week, and then he could start after Pony on the raft, and be at the Ohio River almost as soon as Pony was.|$|E

40|$|Cooperation in {{planning}} activities between governments, provincial hydroelectric Crown Corporations, and aboriginal peoples {{is a well-known}} trend in current Canadian hydroelectric development. Cases from Canadian economic history teach us that native communities were excluded from participation in hydroelectric development, even when their life was largely changed due to its negative effects. New forms of public debate assure the aboriginal peoples new pportunities for participation, {{but at the same}} time, as many critics note, they easily become instruments of control {{in the hands of the}} government. Our research is oriented towards comparing different stages of hydroelectric development in terms of aboriginal participation, and we will try to show why modern practices of deliberative democracy are (<b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> why <b>they</b> are not) different than before...|$|R
5000|$|... "Instro" [...] is {{the only}} {{original}} composition here and is a rare instrumental from the band; perhaps the lack of studio time prevented them from writing lyrics and recording vocals, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> deemed it unworthy of completion.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{a higher}} {{dividend}} yield {{has been considered}} to be desirable among many investors. A high dividend yield can {{be considered to be}} evidence that a stock is underpriced or that the company has fallen on hard times and future dividends will not be as high as previous ones. Similarly a low dividend yield can be considered evidence that the stock is overpriced or that future dividends might be higher. Some investors may find a higher dividend yield attractive, for instance as an aid to marketing a fund to retail investors, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>they</b> cannot get their hands on the capital, which may be tied up in a trust arrangement. In contrast some investors may find a higher dividend yield unattractive, perhaps because it increases their tax bill.|$|R
40|$|Inoue,Tomoo:Dining is an {{essential}} activity in our lives, during the mealtimes, family members {{get a chance to}} talk and share experiences. However, sometimes not everyone can join the meal, either they are busy, <b>or</b> the <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> live apart, in recent years the wide variety of videoconferencing technologies have broadened the ways the people communicate with each other. But most of these technologies require that both sides are available {{at the same time to}} have communication. In this research we propose a time-shifted tele dining system “KIZUNA” for family members to enjoy a meal together even when they are unable to physically meet together. A person can enjoy a meal while watching a pre-recorded video of a remote family members dining. The system adapts the displayed videos playback speed according to the local diners eating behavior. This is likely to enhance the communication and increase the enjoyment while dining...|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} July 1950 the Odsal Tudors {{replaced}} the Odsal Boomerangs. At {{the time it was}} said that the name change was due to the riders hating the Boomerang nickname, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> believed that a change of name would herald a change of fortune. The Tudors of 1951 repeated the feat of the Boomerangs of 1948 and finished bottom of the National League.|$|E
5000|$|Next Generation {{gave the}} Sega CD version (which was {{ultimately}} never released) {{three out of}} five stars, describing it as [...] "a perfect example of graphic-adventure-as-nightmare ...

"Well, that's it," [...] said Mr. Deering; and he {{shut his}} knife and slipped it into his pocket, {{in order to take}} his knee between his clasped hands and lift his leg from the ground.

50|$|Later on, Sinclair {{and another}} man discuss Mary again, talking about how she {{might have to be}} killed. Meanwhile, Mary finds a {{homeless}} woman who wants to die. When Mary asks why, she tells her that in her past life, she had a pretty good life, but now she hates her present life. Mary tries to make her believe that she is needed here and now, by Mary herself, because she doesn't have anyone <b>or</b> anything. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> could start over together. Mary runs to get help but runs into Sinclair and they drug and kidnap her. When she awakens in an empty warehouse, Mary discovers that the fact that she doesn't know her past lives makes her someone these people need. They put her under and she starts talking about herself but still no information about her past lives. When they discover she is telling the truth, they want her to help them forget their past lives.|$|R
50|$|Like Pharaohs, {{rulers of}} the Oryx nome were deeply {{concerned}} with their lives after death. Because the pyramid building age was over <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>they</b> {{could not afford to}} construct their own pyramids, the rulers of Mena'at Khufu chose the limestone cliffs of the eastern desert overlooking a gentle curve in the Nile as an ideal spot on which to carve their tombs. These chapel-tombs at Beni Hasan are the only remnant of the era when Minya rulers wielded power and wealth. Today these thirty nine rock-cut tombs can be visited in the limestone cliffs above the modern day village of Beni Hasan. Though not as great and magnificent as other monuments of ancient Egypt, the Beni Hasan tombs are extremely important as their walls reveal more information about life in Egypt 4,000 years ago more than any other monument in Egypt. In fact these tombs provide more insight about daily life in Egypt than about the rulers who constructed them.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2007, Clinton {{suggested}} that every newborn baby receive $5,000 upon reaching their 18th birthday. Clinton {{said that with}} this money, [...] "they {{will be able to}} access it to go to college <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> {{will be able to make}} that downpayment on their first home". In October 2007, Clinton withdrew this proposal and according to USA Today stated that [...] "it was just an idea and not a policy proposal".|$|E

Julie, accepting her fate, calms down and takes comfort in Harry's words, and the movie fades out as the tar fills the compartment. A final explosion seems to imply a direct hit has taken place.|$|E

50|$|Although Tavo and Fito possess such {{different}} personalities (<b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> that's why), <b>they</b> are inseparable. Also their friendship is very competitive, {{which is why}} we always see them trying to show who is the best at everything. This benefits the business but also puts them in constant problems. Tavo is often intimidated by the constant attacks and insults from the twins Nora and Nori, who he hates more than anyone in the world. Tavo is very obsessive, controlling and paranoid, and falls into problems and even fights with his friends because of his personality. Compared to some people, Tavo has a conservative look and has no piercings and rings on his body; always well managed.|$|R
5000|$|Henríquez {{attended}} Northwestern University; she {{majored in}} English, graduating in 1999. She then earned an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop. She has described {{her time in}} the Iowa program as [...] "a great experience", highly valuable both for validating her writing as well as developing her skills: [...] "I have all my notebooks...and I still open them {{every once in a}} while to find something that Chris Offutt said about dialogue or something that Sam Chang said about structure or that Marilynne Robinson said about subordinate clauses. I could not have gotten that specific knowledge anywhere else." [...] At the same time, responding to Junot Diaz's criticism of the [...] "unbearable too-whiteness" [...] MFA programs, Henríquez notes that while in Iowa, she often spent her own time writing about Panama (which later became the setting for her first two books), but submitted only stories about the United States and American characters to her classes, subsequently wondering whether this choice stemmed from some sense that in the MFA setting, the stories on Panama [...] "weren't going to be as acceptable, <b>or</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> were going to be taken in a different way than the stories that were set in the United States and that I was trying in a way inoculate myself." ...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the facts}} {{mentioned}} in the comic are present and developed in the TV series first season. There are some details which are slightly different though. The comic {{it is supposed to}} be based on Mattel's Max Steel Sourcebook and since the creative control of the TV series changed three times due to the bankruptcy of the two initial animation studios, it is possible that few of the hints mentioned in the comic never had a chance to be developed in the series, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> were discarded in favor of further development of the characters.|$|E
50|$|The Me 109 that Laws {{attacked}} was on {{the tail}} of Blue 1. Assuming the Messerschmitt had some ammunition left, the pilot of Blue 1 had reason to be thankful. It was Pilot Officer Gilbert, who was destined to survive the war. There is almost an air of disappointment {{in the description of}} the enemy tactics in the last paragraph of the squadron combat report. They may have been largely new pilots, drafted in to replace mounting Luftwaffe losses of more experienced fighters. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> had expended too much ammunition and fuel in previous engagements and were simply running for home. The cloudy conditions meant that none of the aircraft engaged could be confirmed as destroyed.|$|E

Then <b>maybe</b> after 10 <b>or</b> 15 years, <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> can have their own style." [...] (Trindle, 2007 [...] ). Hip-hop is often {{performed}} in English and many believe Chinese is not suitable; “people said, straight up, you can’t rap in Chinese, Chinese does not work for rap… Chinese is not suitable for rap music because it’s tonal.” XIV of the rap group Yin Ts’ang put it clearly. “I {{can tell you about}} what we don’t rap about: gangbangin', pushin' drugs, or the government, that’s a good way to not continue your career (or your life).” A big and important part of the localization of Chinese hip-hop “is encouraging Chinese rappers to rap in Chinese” (Trindle, 2007).|$|R

He also sang in a group song with all other singers in the Paris By Night show in the song “Nếu Chỉ Còn Một Ngày”. Quang Lê then treated to the audience to “Tương Tư Nàng Ca Sĩ” from Cong Thanh Bich. The success of this song spurred {{the release of a}} full album, titled “Tương Tư Nàng Ca Sĩ”. The album included more songs that were requested from his fans including “Buồn Chi Em Ơi”, “Em Hãy Về Đi”, and a duet with Mai Thiên Vân, “Các Anh Về”.|$|R
