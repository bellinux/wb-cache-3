25|$|From the Israeli perspective, a key {{concern is}} security, {{and whether the}} major Palestinian figures and {{institutions}} are in fact trying to fight terrorism and promote tolerance and co-existence with Israel. Israeli concerns are based on abundant documentary and empirical evidence of many Palestinian leaders having in fact promoted and supported terrorist groups and activities. Furthermore, there is much concrete evidence of Palestinians having supported and expressed incitment against Israel, its motives, actions, and basic rights as a state. The election of Hamas has provided evidence for this view, with the Hamas charter stating unequivocally {{that it does not}} recognize Israel's right to exist. However, there remain some activists <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side</b> who claim that there are still some positive signs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side,</b> and that Israel should use these to cultivate some positive interactions with the Palestinians, even in spite of Hamas's basic opposition to the existence of the Jewish State. Since mid-June 2007, Israel has cooperated with Palestinian security forces in the West Bank at unprecedented levels, thanks in part to United States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian National Security Forces and Presidential Guard.|$|E
25|$|The Franco-British {{boundary}} agreement of 1920 described an imprecisely defined boundary between Lebanon and Palestine. It appeared to pass {{close to the}} north of al-Bassa, leaving the village <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side</b> but cut off from much of its lands. However the French government included al-Bassa in a Lebanese census of 1921 and granted citizenship to its residents. Meanwhile, a joint British-French boundary commission was working to determine a precise border, making many adjustments in the process. By February 1922 it had determined a border that confirmed al-Bassa as being in Palestine. This became official in 1923. The citizenship of the residents was changed to Palestinian in 1926.|$|E
25|$|In June 2007, Hamas {{took control}} of the Gaza Strip {{in the course of the}} Battle of Gaza, seizing {{government}} institutions and replacing Fatah and other government officials with its own. Following the takeover, Egypt and Israel imposed a partial blockade, on the grounds that Fatah had fled and was no longer providing security <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side,</b> and to prevent arms smuggling by terrorist groups. On 6 September 2007, the Israeli Air Force destroyed a nuclear reactor in Syria. On 28 February 2008, Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the constant firing of Qassam rockets by Hamas militants. On July 16, 2008, Hezbollah swapped the bodies of Israeli soldiers Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, kidnapped in 2006, in exchange for the Lebanese terrorist Samir Kuntar, four Hezbollah prisoners, and the bodies of 199 Palestinian Arab and Lebanese fighters.|$|E

To put that into perspective, Yardenit has more than 400.000 visitors p.a.|$|R
25|$|The Arab revolt in Mandatory Palestine was unsuccessful, and its {{consequences}} affected {{the outcome of the}} 1948 Palestine war. It caused the British Mandate to give crucial support to pre-state Zionist militias like <b>the</b> Haganah, whereas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Arab <b>side,</b> <b>the</b> revolt forced the flight into exile of <b>the</b> main <b>Palestinian</b> Arab leader of the period, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem – Haj Amin al-Husseini.|$|R

2500|$|Leftist {{journalists from}} Israel, such as Haim Hanegbi and Daniel Gavron, {{have called for}} the public to [...] "face the facts" [...] and accept the binational solution. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side,</b> similar voices have been raised. [...] Israeli Prime Minister Olmert argued, in a 2007 {{interview}} with the Israeli daily Ha'aretz, that without a two-state agreement Israel would face [...] "a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights" [...] in which case [...] "Israel [...] finished".|$|E
2500|$|The party's {{platform}} on {{the peace}} process is simple. Aryeh Deri has suggested that [...] "there is currently no negotiating partner <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side,</b> so {{the basis of the}} next government should be socioeconomic". On that subject, Shas' economic plan calls for an {{increase in the minimum wage}} to NIS 30 an hour, lowering the value-added tax on basic household items and requiring 7.5% of every building plan to be devoted to public housing. Shas insist that their housing plan create Mixed-income housing rather than segregating rich and poor neighborhoods.|$|E
5000|$|Rafah is {{the site}} of the Rafah Border Crossing, the sole {{crossing}} between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Formerly operated by Israeli military forces, control of the crossing was transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority in September 2005 as part of the larger Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. A European Union commission began monitoring the crossing in November 2005 amid Israeli security concerns, and in April 2006, Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas's Presidential Guard assumed responsibility for <b>the</b> site <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority <b>side.</b> [...] <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian side, the responsibility is assumed by the 750 Border Guards allowed by an agreement of Egypt with Israel. The agreement was signed in November 2005 forced by US pressure, and specifies that it is under security requirements demanded by Israel.|$|R
50|$|Both sides {{presented}} their own {{maps of the}} West Bank. The maps served {{as a basis for}} <b>the</b> discussion <b>on</b> territory and settlements. The Israeli side presented two maps, and <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side</b> engaged <b>on</b> this basis. <b>The</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side</b> presented some illustrative maps detailing its understanding of Israeli interests in the West Bank. The Israeli side stated that the Clinton proposals provide for annexation of settlement blocs, areas which only had a small number of <b>Palestinians.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side</b> did not agree that the parameters included blocs, and did not accept proposals to annex blocs. <b>The</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side</b> stated that blocs would cause significant harm to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> interests and rights, particularly to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> residing in areas Israel sought to annex.|$|R
50|$|After the 1995 Oslo Accords, Israel {{was allowed}} to retain the {{security}} corridor. Following Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza-strip in 2005, the Philadelphi Accord with Egypt was concluded, which authorized Egypt to deploy 750 border guards along the route to patrol <b>the</b> border <b>on</b> Egypt's <b>side.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> border was controlled by <b>Palestinian</b> Authority, until <b>the</b> 2007 takeover by Hamas. The joint authority for the Rafah border crossing was transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority and Egypt for restricted passage by Palestinian ID card holders, and by others by exception.|$|R
2500|$|During this trip, Ellison {{stated that}} Israel {{did not permit}} him to travel to Gaza, where a {{conflict}} was occurring. In a 2009 interview with reporter Shihab Rattansi, Ellison expressed his disappointment at his inability to see the humanitarian situation for himself. In the same interview, {{he called for a}} more open discussion on Gaza, stating: [...] "The people who have a strong sympathy for the Israeli position... dominate the conversation. And it’s really not politically safe to say, look, there are two sides to this, and Israel has not been an angel in this, and certainly there have been people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side</b> who have not contributed to a constructive solution." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Palestinian negotiators {{indicated}} they wanted full Palestinian sovereignty {{over the entire}} West Bank and the Gaza Strip, although they would consider a one-to-one land swap with Israel. Their historic position was that Palestinians had already made a territorial compromise with Israel by accepting Israel's right to 78% of [...] "historic Palestine", and accepting their state on the remaining 22% of such land. This consensus was expressed by Faisal Husseini when he remarked:'There can be no compromise on the compromise'. They maintained that Resolution 242 calls for full Israeli withdrawal from these territories, which were captured in the Six-Day War, {{as part of a}} final peace settlement. In the 1993 Oslo Accords the Palestinian negotiators accepted the Green Line borders (1949 armistice lines) for the West Bank but the Israelis rejected this proposal and disputed the Palestinian interpretation of Resolution 242. Israel wanted to annex the numerous settlement blocks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side</b> of the Green Line, and were concerned that a complete return to the 1967 borders was dangerous to Israel's security. The Palestinian and Israeli definition of the West Bank differs by approximately 5% land area as the Israeli definition does not include East Jerusalem (71km²), the territorial waters of the Dead Sea (195km²) and the area known as No Man's Land (50km2 near Latrun).|$|E

He however assert that he has friends both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Israeli and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> conflict. In 2003, he congratulated Israel for the assassination of Ahmed Yassin and Russia for the liquidation of Aslan Maskhadov. Before the 2009 election, {{he said that his}} most important issues was to [...] "fight for our basic democratic, liberal and human society values against external pressure, mainly from Islamic societies".|$|R
