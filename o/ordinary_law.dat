25|$|In the Netherlands, the {{restrictions}} on the manufacture and sale of absinthe were successfully challenged by the Amsterdam wine seller, Menno Boorsma, in July 2004, thus confirming the legality of absinthe once again. Similarly, Belgium lifted its longstanding absinthe ban on January 1, 2005, citing (as did the Dutch judge) a conflict with the adopted food and beverage regulations of the Single European Market. In Switzerland, the constitutional ban on absinthe was repealed in 2000 during {{an overhaul of the}} national constitution, although the prohibition was simultaneously rewritten into <b>ordinary</b> <b>law</b> instead. That law was later repealed such that as of March 1, 2005, absinthe was made again legal in its country of origin. Absinthe is once again distilled and sold in its Val-de-Travers birthplace, with Kübler and La Clandestine Absinthe among the first new brands to emerge.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, a SWAT (Special Weapons And Tactics) team {{is a law}} {{enforcement}} unit which uses specialized or military equipment and tactics. First created in the 1960s to handle riot control or violent confrontations with criminals, the number and usage of SWAT teams increased in the 1980s and 1990s during the War on Drugs {{and later in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks. In the United States as of 2005, SWAT teams were deployed 50,000 times every year, almost 80% of the time to serve search warrants, most often for narcotics. SWAT teams are increasingly equipped with military-type hardware and trained to deploy against threats of terrorism, for crowd control, and in situations beyond the capabilities of <b>ordinary</b> <b>law</b> enforcement, sometimes deemed [...] "high-risk." [...] Other countries have developed their own paramilitary police units (PPUs) that are also described as or compared to SWAT forces.|$|E
2500|$|One {{area which}} English law takes outside the <b>ordinary</b> <b>law</b> of {{misrepresentation}} {{is what is}} typically called [...] "mistakes" [...] about identity. In this group of cases, the common fact pattern is that Alice gives a valuable good to Bob thinking that Bob will pay. Bob is a fraudster and has misrepresented his identity or creditworthiness or both, and has left Alice with a dud cheque, or simply does not fulfil a promise to pay later. The valuable good is then sold by Bob to Claire. Bob disappears and cannot be charged for fraud. Alice finds that Claire has the valuable good and sues Claire to get back the good. The dilemma courts face is whether to prefer one innocent party over another innocent party. Alice has {{been a victim of}} fraudulent misrepresentation. Claire is also defrauded in the sense that Bob represented to her that he had good title to the good he sold on. Claire has paid good money for the good. But because Bob cannot be found, Alice has no remedy.|$|E
2500|$|To that end, Ritchie {{held that}} the meaning of rights and freedoms in the Bill of Rights {{is exactly the same}} meaning [...] "which it bore in Canada at the time when the Bill was enacted, and it follows that the phrase 'equality before the law' is to be {{construed}} in light of the law existing in Canada at that time." [...] In Ritchie's opinion, 'equality before the law' cannot be construed as [...] "the egalitarian concept exemplified by the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution [...] [...] [...] [...] " [...] Instead, citing the preamble of the Bill of Rights, Ritchie contended that 'equality before the law' should be construed {{in the context of the}} rule of law. Drawing from the writings of Dicey, Ritchie remarked that 'equality before the law' is described as an aspect of the rule of law that [...] "carries the meaning of equal subjection of all classes to the <b>ordinary</b> <b>law</b> of the land as administered by the ordinary courts." [...] Ritchie also extended this interpretation of 'equality before the law' to the [...] "application of the law by law enforcement authorities." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once a person's work {{contract}} is categorised, {{the courts have}} specific rules for determining, beyond the statutory minimum charter of rights, what are its terms and conditions. Analogous rules for incorporation of terms, and implication terms exist as in the <b>ordinary</b> <b>law</b> of contract. However, in Gisda Cyf v Barratt, Lord Kerr emphasised that if it affects statutory rights, the process of construction is one that must be [...] "intellectually segregated" [...] from the general law of contract, because of the relation of dependency an employee has. In this case, Ms Barratt was told her employment was terminated in a letter that she opened 3 days after its arrival. When, 3 months and 2 days after arrival, she lodged an unfair dismissal claim, the employer argued it was time barred {{on the ground that}} in ordinary contract law one is bound by a notice when a reasonable person would have read a message. The Supreme Court held that Ms Barratt was in time for a claim because she was only bound by the notice when she actually read it. The applicable in employment was different, given the purpose of employment law to protect the employee. From formation to termination, employment contracts are to be construed in the context of statutory protection of dependent workers.|$|E
2500|$|An {{exception}} to the law on misrepresentation – that contracts are voidable at the instance of the misrepresentee, but the right to rescission can be barred inter alia by the intervention of third party rights – arises when someone is induced by the fraudulent misrepresentation to enter an agreement through a written document at a distance (and not when a transaction is face to face). In Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson a crook obtained Mr Patel's credit details and bought a Mitsubishi Shogun on hire purchase contract at a car dealer. Shogun Finance was faxed through Mr Patel's details, and agreed to finance {{the purchase of the}} car, letting the crook drive away. Subsequently, Mrs Hudson bought the car from the crook. The crook disappeared. Then Shogun Finance, who had predictably never been paid, found Mrs Hudson and sued to retrieve the car. A bare majority in the House of Lords held that to protect the certainty of commercial dealings through a signed document, the contract between the finance company and the crook was void (the same consequence as if there had never been any offer mirrored by an acceptance). They had only ever intended to contract with Mr Patel. And because nobody can convey property they do not have (nemo dat quod non habet) Mrs Hudson never acquired legitimate title to the car from the crook and had to give back the car. The minority held that this situation should follow <b>ordinary</b> <b>law</b> of misrepresentation, and should mean that the right of the finance company to rescind the contract would be barred by the intervention of Mrs Hudson's rights as a bona fide third party purchaser, just like all of Europe, the United States, and previous decisions of the Court of Appeal suggest. However, because of the majority's decision this special category of [...] "mistake about identity" [...] cases remains a general {{exception to}} the English law on misrepresentation.|$|E
2500|$|On May 12, an {{agreement}} to provide legal security to the final agreement was reached. Once signed, the final agreement would {{be considered as a}} special agreement under the terms of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and form part of the Constitution of Colombia's constitutionality bloc (as international humanitarian law). The government would present before Congress an <b>ordinary</b> <b>law</b> to approve the final agreement as a special agreement, Congress would approve or reject it as a whole within 8 days and the Constitutional Court would review it. Afterwards, the government would present a constitutional amendment (legislative act) to incorporate the text of the final agreement to the Constitution as a transitory article. Finally, after signature of the final agreement, the President would make a unilateral declaration {{in the name of the}} Colombian State before the Secretary General of the UN, relating the final agreement to [...] The announcement ensured legal security to the agreement, increasing the FARC's confidence that the agreements would be followed - constitutional entrenchment of a final agreement would protect it from future changes in political conditions, and commit the Colombian government before the international community. By agreeing to this procedure, the FARC signalled their acceptance of the political institutions which it had rejected and fought against for decades. At the same time, without yet endorsing the plebiscite itself, the FARC indicated that the final agreement would be submitted for popular ratification, and thereby implicitly dropped their insistence on a constituent assembly as an implementation mechanism. The details of the agreement on legal security sparked legal controversy in Colombia. Álvaro Uribe called it a coup d'état, while Inspector General Alejandro Ordóñez, another major critic of the peace process, wrote a letter to Santos in which he accused him of wishing to replacing the Constitution in tandem with the FARC and threatened him with disciplinary action. However, lawyers not necessarily opposed to the peace process also raised questions about the legality of the measures detailed in the May 12 agreement, such as the incorporation of the final agreement into constitutional jurisprudence.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are three}} [...] "pillars" [...] of the UK pension system, which aim to ensure dignity {{and a fair}} income in retirement. The first pillar is the state pension, {{administered}} by the government, and funded by National Insurance contributions. The third pillar is private, or [...] "personal pensions", which individuals buy themselves. The second pillar, and deriving from the contract of employment, is occupational pensions. Traditionally, these came from a collective agreement, or from an employer setting one up. The Pensions Act 2008 gives every [...] "jobholder" [...] (defined as a worker, age 16 to 75, with wages between £5,035 and £33,540) {{the right to be}} automatically enrolled by the employer in an occupational pension, unless the jobholder chooses to opt out. This is a simple [...] "defined contribution" [...] scheme: whatever the jobholder contributes, they get out. Although collectively invested, benefits are individualised, meaning the risk of living longer and running out of money grows. To reduce administration costs, a non-departmental trust fund called the National Employment Savings Trust was established as a [...] "public option" [...] competing with private asset managers. Employers set aside an agreed percentage of jobholders' wages, and negotiate how much they will contribute. This is particularly important for people who do not created a union and collective bargained for an occupational pension. Collectively bargained pensions are often better, and historically had [...] "defined benefits": on retirement, people receive money based either on their final salary, or a career average of earnings {{for the rest of their}} lives. Living longer does not become an individual risk, but is collectivised among all contributors. In principle, the rules for pension trusts differ from <b>ordinary</b> <b>law</b> of trusts as pensions are not gifts and people pay for their benefits through their work. Pensions operating through contracts also engender mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship. An employer is under a duty to inform their staff about how to make the best of their pension rights. Moreover, workers must be treated equally, on grounds of gender or otherwise, in their pension entitlements. The management of a pension trust must be partly codetermined by the pension beneficiaries, so that a minimum of one third of a trustee board are elected or [...] "member nominated trustees". The Secretary of State has the power by regulation, as yet unused, to increase the minimum up to one half. Trustees are charged with the duty to manage the fund in the best interests of the beneficiaries, in a way that reflects their preferences, by investing the savings in company shares, bonds, real estate or other financial products.|$|E

60|$|The {{wages of}} superintendance are {{distinguished}} from ordinary wages by another peculiarity, {{that they are}} not paid in advance out of capital, like the wages of all other labourers, but merge in the profit, and are not realized until the production is completed. This takes them entirely out of the <b>ordinary</b> <b>law</b> of wages. The wages of labourers who are paid in advance, are regulated by the number of competitors compared with the amount of capital; the labourers can consume no more than what has been previously accumulated.

The extensive heritable jurisdictions of his Grace excluded the interference of other magistrates with those living on his estates, and they who were in immediate dependence on him would receive orders to give the young woman no disturbance.
