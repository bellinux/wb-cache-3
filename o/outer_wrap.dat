5000|$|... == Historical {{development}} == The Kinsale Cloak, {{also known}} as the West Cork Cloak or Irish Cloak, evolved from cloaks which were worn throughout Europe since at least the Bronze Age. Worn since prehistoric times in Ireland, by the early historic period, the <b>outer</b> <b>wrap</b> garment had become a four-cornered “brat” of almost rectangular shape. In a 1904 discovery in Armoy, County Antirm, Ireland, late Bronze Age tools were found wrapped in a woolen brat sewn from two pieces of wool, giving evidence that cloaks were worn in Ireland as far back as 750BC.|$|E
5000|$|The grip of {{the club}} is {{attached}} to {{the opposite end of the}} shaft from the club head, and is the part of the club the player holds on to while swinging. Originally, the grip was composed of one or more leather strips wrapped around the shaft. The leather <b>outer</b> <b>wrap</b> on a grip is still seen on some clubs, most commonly putters, but most modern grips are a one-piece [...] "sleeve" [...] made of rubber, synthetic or composite material that is slid over the shaft and secured with an adhesive. These sleeve grips allow club makers and golfers to customize the grip's diameter, consistency (softness/firmness) and texturing pattern to best fit the player. Clubs with an outer [...] "wrap" [...] of leather or leather-like synthetic still typically have a [...] "sleeve" [...] form underneath to add diameter to the grip and give it its basic profile.|$|E

50|$|Zyex string {{offers more}} rebound efficiency, i.e. gut-like dynamic stiffness, than other {{synthetic}} strings, particularly when strung at low tensions. This gives it playability {{that is more}} similar to natural gut than, arguably, other synthetic materials. It also has low overall stiffness. The ProKennex IQ Element Z string, for instance, has the lowest stiffness of any synthetic string yet tested. The drawback of Zyex is that the <b>outer</b> <b>wrapping</b> materials in Zyex tennis string tend to be much less durable than the Zyex filaments inside the string and do not bond with them. This {{can lead to the}} <b>outer</b> <b>wrapping</b> wearing away, leaving the inner Zyex filaments.|$|R

40|$|Using single-molecule optical-trapping techniques, we {{examined}} the force-induced dynamic behavior of a single nucleosome core particle. Our experiments using the DNA construct containing the 601 nucleosome-positioning sequence revealed that the nucleosome unravels {{in at least two}} major stages. The first stage, which we attributed to the unraveling of the first DNA wrap around the histone octamer, could be mechanically induced in a reversible manner, and when kept at constant force within a critical force range, exhibited two-state hopping behavior. From the hopping data, we determined the force-dependent equilibrium constant and rates for opening/closing of the <b>outer</b> <b>wrap.</b> Our investigation of the second unraveling event at various loading rates, which we attributed to the inner DNA wrap, revealed that this unraveling event cannot be described as a simple two-state process. We also looked at the behavior of the mononucleosome in a high-salt buffer, which revealed that the outer DNA wrap is more sensitive to changes in the ionic environment than the inner DNA wrap. These findings are needed to understand the energetics of nucleosome remodeling...|$|E

Lots of structural model test results and prototype observation data indicate that under initial water pressure stress, the steel lining and <b>outer</b> <b>wrapped</b> concrete shell can work with the good joint, joint bearing. The paper uses general finite element calculation software to do the nonlinear analysis for steel lined {{reinforced concrete}} penstock of manwan hydropower station and study three kinds principles: the change principle of the stress of steel lining arising along with the increasing of internal pressure, the elastic-plastic distribution principle of <b>outer</b> <b>wrapped</b> concrete and the crack development principle of concrete. The analysis results indicate that the design project of the steel lined reinforced concrete pressure penstock of manwan hydropower station is reasonable. The structure meets the requirements of strength, which pressure penstock structure will not crack, under the design load. Pressure penstocks meet the requirements of stiffness, that the transformation is small. The structure design is economic and reasonable, safe and reliable.

50|$|Sellers recuperated and {{returned}} to his job within a few weeks. By the end of 1948, nearly two years after the discovery of the scrolls, no scholar had yet located the cave where the fragments had been found. With the unrest in the country, no large scale search could be undertaken. Sellers attempted to get the Syrians to help locate the cave, but they demanded more money than Sellers could offer. The cave was finally discovered on January 28, 1949 by a UN observer, and Sellers brought his box brownie camera to take the first photos of the cave, which were soon published in Life Magazine. In an attempt to date the scrolls, Sellers took some linen found in the cave, presumably from an <b>outer</b> <b>wrapping</b> of the scrolls, and brought it back to the University of Chicago. Unfortunately, the carbon-14 test, done at Chicago in 1950, was inconclusive, with a range from 245 BCE to 245 CE. It was later found that the carbon-14 test's margin of error was at 500 years.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Fag el-Gamous {{cemetery}} is a 125 hectare Graeco-Roman necropolis on {{the eastern}} edge of the Fayoum Depression. The 1000 + burials excavated to date at the cemetery are found largely in rectangular shafts at 0. 3 – 3. 0 m deep and oriented on an east–west axis. The high burial density, varying between 1. 3 and 3. 0 burials per square meter, is due in part to multiple burials in the same shaft. The stratigraphically deepest burials in a shaft are buried head east and later burials in the same shaft are buried head west. It has been argued that this directional shift occurred as early as the late first to the early second century AD. AMS radiocarbon dating of the available samples shows that the deepest and presumably oldest head-east burial dates to AD 79 – 230, and the oldest head-west burial dates to AD 128 – 284. One of the deepest signs of Christianity, a cross symbol, is present in the <b>outer</b> <b>wrapping</b> of a burial dated AD 545 – 645.
