The National Audubon Society estimates the global population of the brown pelican at 300,000. Numbers <b>of</b> <b>brown</b> pelican plummeted in the 1950s and 1960s, largely {{as a consequence of}} environmental DDT pollution, and the species was listed as endangered in the US in 1970. With restrictions on DDT use in the US from 1972, its population has recovered, and it was delisted in 2009.|$|E

Some individuals of Lumbricus terrestris have reached tremendous sizes, with the largest weighing 12.7 grams. This is speculated to be due to the good quality soil, and absence of predators.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{relatively}} large fruiting bodies of R.pulcherrimus are distinctive, {{they might be}} confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species has a much thicker stalk.

30|$|Our {{results are}} in line with {{findings}} of other authors in apples and bananas. In apple, some cultivars showed a positive correlation between the degree <b>of</b> <b>browning</b> and enzyme activity. In some cultivars (Classic Delicious, RI Greening, McIntosh, and Cortland), PPO activity was directly related to degree <b>of</b> <b>browning</b> while in others (Empire, Rome, and Golden Delicious), the degree <b>of</b> <b>browning</b> was related more to the final phenolic concentration. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the phenolics in apple showed that the types of phenolic compounds in all cultivars were similar and that no one particular compound could account for the differences observed in browning [45]. They concluded that the increase of the phenolic compounds and the activity of enzymes could be the factor that causes the increase in the degree <b>of</b> <b>browning</b> <b>of</b> fruits when exposed to low temperatures [45]; although, {{this was not the case}} in all varieties tested.|$|R

5|$|Polar {{bears are}} thought to have diverged from a {{population}} <b>of</b> <b>brown</b> bears, Ursus arctos, that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula). The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the polar bear diverged from the brown bear roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades <b>of</b> <b>brown</b> bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the polar bear might not be considered a species under some species concepts.|$|E
