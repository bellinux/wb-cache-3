5|$|Cope {{had three}} children, Elizabeth, Martha Ann, and Daniel. Martha Ann died {{shortly after her}} birth. His son, Daniel, was born with severe autism; he has lived {{most of his life}} at the Allegheny Valley School, an {{institution}} specializing in intellectual developmental disabilities. Cope devoted much of his time and energy to Pittsburgh causes addressing autism, and spoke candidly about his experiences as the parent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> autism and his efforts to better educate the public at large about autism.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{profiling}} is {{also used}} in DNA paternity testing to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal DNA sequencing methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.|$|E

5|$|Developmental verbal dyspraxia, {{also known}} as Childhood apraxia of speech, is a {{developmental}} motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production. The speech <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> developmental verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible {{to the point that}} daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> the identified gene.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 1 in 25,000 babies born in the United States will {{have some form of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that only individuals inheriting the defective gene from both parents are affected. (The exception is MPS II, or Hunter syndrome, in which the mother alone passes along the defective gene to a son.) When both people in a couple have the defective gene, each pregnancy carries with it a one in four chance that the child will be affected. The parents and siblings of an affected child may have no sign of the disorder. Unaffected siblings and select relatives <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> one of the mucopolysaccharidoses may carry the recessive gene and could pass it to their own children.|$|E
25|$|In the {{legislative}} session {{that ended in}} May 2013, Dayton pushed for and won a $2.1billion tax increase, mostly on the wealthy and cigarettes. He also signed a bill legalizing gay marriage in Minnesota, created free, statewide, all-day kindergarten and financed expansions of the Mayo Clinic, 3M and Mall of America. In the spring 2014 session, Dayton came under fire from supporters and foes alike for opposing the legalization of medical marijuana, which polls showed 65% of Minnesotans support. One supporter, the mother <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> severe epilepsy, alleged Dayton told her in a meeting {{that he would not}} legalize the drug but she could buy the drug illegally instead. Dayton denied saying that. On April 2, Marijuana Policy Project began airing an ad across the state attacking Dayton's opposition to medical marijuana legalization, featuring a St. Paul mother and her child whose severe seizures could be cured by medical marijuana.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 1937, {{a family}} boating on the River Idle in Bawtry spotted {{an object in}} the water, close to the bank. Upon closer inspection, this family {{discovered}} that the object was the partially decomposed body <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>with</b> the head and upper torso embedded in silt and trapped in a drain below water level. Her body had been weighted down with wood and metal. On {{the banks of the}} river was a torn and rotting sack which had evidently been used to transport the child's body. The location was approximately 30 miles from where Nodder had lived. The body was moved to an inn at Newington, where the clothing present with the body was identified by Wilfred Tinsley as belonging to his daughter. A subsequent autopsy at the Retford Mortuary confirmed Mona had been strangled—most likely with a ligature—and that she had been dead before entering the water. Due to the extensive period of time the body had been in the river, the extensive adipocere formation upon the corpse prevented the pathologist from being able to determine whether Mona had been sexually assaulted before her murder.|$|E

25|$|In 1912 Spielrein {{married the}} Russian Jewish {{physician}} Pavel Nahumovitch Sheftel. They moved to Berlin, where Spielrein worked alongside Karl Abraham. Spielrein {{had her first}} daughter Irma-Renata (known as Renata), in 1913. While in Berlin, Spielrein published nine further papers. One of these was an account of children’s beliefs about sex and reproduction, in which she included recollections of her own early fantasies about this. Entitled 'Contribution to the Understanding of a Child's Soul', it shows her in more Freudian mode than her previous papers. In another paper, entitled, ‘The Mother-in-Law’, she gave a sympathetic account {{of the role of}} mothers-in-law and the relationship between them, their daughters-in-law. The Dutch psychoanalyst van Waning has commented on this paper: ”Women’s studies – in the year 1913!”. Another paper from the time recounts her treatment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> a phobia of animals, {{and is one of the}} first known reports of child psychotherapy At the outbreak of World War I, she returned to Switzerland, living briefly in Zurich again before relocating to Lausanne, where she and Renate remained for the rest of the war. Her husband joined his regiment in Kiev, and they were not reunited for more than a decade. The war years were times of privation for Spielrein: she did some work as a surgeon and in an eye clinic, but also received contributions from her parents when they could get these to her. She did however manage to publish two more short papers during the war years. She composed music, and considered becoming a composer. She also began to write a novel in French. She recorded observations of her daughter's development in terms of language and play. She continued her correspondence with Freud and Jung, and to evolve her own theoretical ideas, particularly in relation to attachment in children.|$|E

40|$|It was {{identified}} {{that there was}} little published research into the lived experience <b>of</b> parenting <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> autism that utilised a qualitative approach. There was <b>a</b> paucity <b>of</b> material in the literature, beyond single parent accounts, for a nurse to turn to develop <b>a</b> beginning understanding <b>of</b> the experience. There was also little for a parent to compare their own experience with. This study of the lived experience <b>of</b> parenting <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>with</b> autism provides <b>an</b> exploration <b>of</b> the experience within the framework <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Initially nine parents were interviewed and the resulting transcripts analysed.

The parents reported a strong resonance with the analysis and the discussion fell silent.
