25|$|Because {{at least}} two of the exits were blocked by the chutes used to bring the show's big cats in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> people trying to escape could not bypass them. Some died from {{injuries}} sustained after leaping from the tops of the bleachers in hopes they could escape under the sides of the tent, though that method of escape ended up killing more than it saved. Others died after being trampled by other spectators, with some asphyxiating underneath the piles of people who fell over each other.|$|E
500|$|Patton {{arrived at}} the {{hospital}} the same day, accompanied {{by a number of}} medical officers, as part of his tour of the U.S. II Corps troops. He spoke to some patients in the hospital, commending the physically wounded. He then approached Kuhl, who {{did not appear to be}} physically injured. Kuhl was sitting slouched on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers. When Patton asked Kuhl where he was hurt, Kuhl reportedly shrugged and replied that he was [...] "nervous" [...] rather than wounded, adding, [...] "I guess I can't take it." [...] Patton [...] "immediately flared up," [...] slapped Kuhl across the chin with his gloves, then grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to the tent entrance. He shoved him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> with a kick to his backside. Yelling [...] "Don't admit this son of a bitch", Patton demanded that Kuhl be sent back to the front, adding, [...] "You hear me, you gutless bastard? You're going back to the front." ...|$|E
60|$|Snap had {{the breakfast}} well {{underway}} when Shep came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ohe, Ahmed Din! Shafiz Ullah ahoo! Bahadur Khan, {{where are}} you? Come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents,</b> as I have done, and {{fight against the}} English. Don't kill your own kin! Come out to me!' ...|$|R
60|$|Just then a boy {{of eight}} or nine years <b>of</b> age came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents,</b> rubbing his eyes sleepily.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, of Mary Avenel, my son, who {{has also}} abjured <b>the</b> faith <b>of</b> her fathers. Weep not, my Edward, weep not, my beloved son! or weep for their apostasy, and not for their union--Bless God, who hath called thee to himself, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> <b>of</b> wickedness; but for <b>the</b> grace <b>of</b> Our Lady and Saint Benedict, thou also hadst been a castaway." ...|$|R
60|$|Laura put {{her head}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> {{in which the two}} women had slept.|$|E
60|$|The youth {{took the}} hint rather indignantly, rose, and strode <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> in majestic silence.|$|E
60|$|A brisk {{first round}} {{had just come}} to a {{conclusion}} when Walton lounged <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> yawning.|$|E
60|$|The {{young men}} slept late next morning, knowing that no move {{could be made}} that day. When they came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents,</b> {{they found that the}} natives had lost no time. Before daybreak hunting parties had gone out, and a store of game was piled near the fire; or rather fires, for a dozen were now burning, and the strangers were being {{initiated}} in <b>the</b> art <b>of</b> cooking by their hosts.|$|R
25|$|There is {{considerable}} activity. Sentries are being changed, soldiers are furbishing armour and officers are passing in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King's <b>tent</b> for their orders.|$|R
60|$|Thrusting a {{withered}} yellow hand <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mystic <b>tent,</b> {{he pointed}} to a table where stood a small circular dish or cup of white earthenware, containing some brown milky liquid.|$|R
60|$|They {{turned and}} {{approached}} her silently. The two girls, fully dressed, came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> as they approached.|$|E
60|$|Malchus {{caught up}} his shield and sword, threw his helmet on his head, and rushed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> with his father.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But has he no {{hours for}} his meals, Monsieur de Meneval?' I asked, as I {{accompanied}} the unhappy secretary <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|E
60|$|The three commanders, however, {{remained}} {{beyond our}} line of vision, and, because no one save the rioting soldiery and the savages entered or came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headquarters <b>tent,</b> I began {{to suspect that the}} leaders had run away.|$|R
6000|$|... "He must ha' {{broke loose}} and jined the stampedo," [...] remarked Joe, coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chief's <b>tent</b> at <b>the</b> moment; [...] "but tie him up, Dick, and come in, for {{we want to}} settle about startin' to-morrow or nixt day." ...|$|R
50|$|The roof is made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> shingles. <b>The</b> <b>tent</b> roof above <b>the</b> presbytery and {{the nave}} is {{finished}} with a short square structure, to which conical bodies are attached to. To them baroque onion-like little roofs are fixed, finished with small shingle conical heads set with wrought iron crosses.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} {{audience}} had got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> and almost before the work of taking down the canvas was begun.|$|E
60|$|Quest, whose arm {{was in a}} sling but who was {{otherwise}} none the worse for his recent adventure, pointed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|E
60|$|Seizing the sailor's {{arm with}} her right hand, and {{mounting}} the little girl on her left, she went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> sobbing bitterly.|$|E
5000|$|At {{around this}} same time, the Ottomans had ostentatious, {{palatial}} tents transported from one military {{mission to the}} next. Entire teams of artisans travelled with the army to erect and maintain these imperial tents. As described by Professor Nurhan Atasoy, The exquisite ornamentation both inside and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> used by <b>the</b> Ottoman sultans made them imposing dwellings fit for a ruler. On ceremonial occasions tents served to create a splendid theatrical setting, as we see vividly portrayed in miniature paintings depicting banquets, audiences and celebrations {{which took place in}} <b>the</b> imperial <b>tent</b> complex over <b>the</b> centuries. <b>The</b> imperial <b>tents</b> were richly decorated as if they were pavilions, and often had designs resembling tiled panels, usually in floral patterns, either in appliés work using cloth of different colours, or embroidered in various stitches using silk and metal thread.|$|R
60|$|A shambling, loose-jointed giant rolled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents,</b> yawning {{and rubbing}} the sleep from his eyes. Then he sighted the strange canoe and was wide awake on the instant.|$|R
60|$|Quarter of an {{hour later}} all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boys had turned in. Blumpo picked <b>out</b> a corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> nearest <b>the</b> rear. Harry slept in the middle, while Jerry took up a place {{not far from the}} front flaps.|$|R
6000|$|... "O Captain Montague, {{surely you}} never hunted cats," [...] exclaimed Alice, who came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> {{with a very}} pale face, and uncommonly red eyes.|$|E
60|$|The earl and Count Jacquelin touched each other's {{hands in}} {{obedience}} to the order, went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> together, and strode off without a word in different directions.|$|E
60|$|As he {{finished}} speaking the fakir arose to his feet, {{motioned to the}} officer, and walked directly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> {{without so much as}} bidding the others goodby.|$|E
50|$|Major Margaret Houlihan reveals {{when she}} comes back from Tokyo that she is now engaged to Lieutenant Colonel Donald Penobscot, a West Point {{graduate}} who has swept her off her feet. Frank Burns doesn't take the news so well; when Margaret shows Frank her engagement ring, indicating that she will not marry him, Frank pretends to congratulate her, but walks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mess <b>tent</b> and tears off the doors in fury.|$|R
6000|$|The Abbe too {{had fallen}} asleep, as Hebert managed to assure poor Lanty, who rushed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>tent,</b> nearly naked, and bloodstained in many places, but more {{concerned}} at his separation from his foster-brother than at {{anything else that}} had befallen him. Men, women, children, and dogs were all after him, supposing him {{to be trying to}} escape, and he was seized upon and dragged back by main force, but not before the steward had called out-- ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} a tall savage came rushing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chief's <b>tent</b> with glaring eyes, {{and made for}} {{the spot where the}} boys were assembled. They seemed to know at once what was his errand, for, with one consent, they {{scattered}} and fled. The tall savage singled out Powlet, caught him, punched his head, and flung him into the river, after which he turned, and, without taking any notice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captives further than to gaze at them, returned leisurely to <b>the</b> regal <b>tent.</b>|$|R
60|$|Harry, bowing deeply, turned, {{passed through}} the curtain, {{and made his way}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b> Abdool, who was {{squatting}} near the entrance, at once rose and followed him.|$|E
60|$|With a {{burst of}} {{laughter}} Biarne fell backwards, and, partly to avoid the deluge, partly for fun, rolled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> when {{he got up and}} dried his dripping beard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish I {{could bring}} him down, {{just for the}} fun of the thing," [...] he murmured to himself, and then, {{reaching}} for his shotgun, he arose and tiptoed his way <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rabi'ah's son Adam was a {{small child}} living with a foster-mother from the Bakr tribe. The Bakr were {{at war with the}} Hudhayl. Adam crept <b>out</b> in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> and was caught in <b>the</b> cross-fire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle. A rock thrown by a Hudhayl man hit and crushed his head, which killed him.|$|R
25|$|This {{rule was}} {{sometimes}} suspended, by agreement with <b>the</b> captain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> batting side. For example, during the England–New Zealand Test Match at Lord's in 1986, England's specialist keeper, Bruce French was injured during England's first innings. England then used 4 keepers in New Zealand's first innings: Bill Athey kept {{for the first}} two overs; 45-year-old veteran Bob Taylor was pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sponsor's <b>tent</b> to keep, immaculately, for overs 3 to 76; Bobby Parks, the Hampshire keeper, was called up for overs 77 to 140; and Bruce French kept wicket for <b>the</b> final ball <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{police station}} site {{has been used}} since gold was found nearby in Arrowtown and on <b>the</b> banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shotover River in 1862. The {{adjacent}} historic Court House was built between 1875 and 1877 after operating <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tents.</b> <b>The</b> police station is at 11 Camp Street, and Queenstown was known as 'the Camp'.|$|R
