5|$|The Virgin and Child at the {{forefront}} might represent the background statues coming to life; at the time such an apparition was considered the highest form of pilgrimage experience. Their poses are similar and her tall crown is typical of those seen on statues rather than either royalty or painted figures of the Virgin. Harbison further suggests that the two pools <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the floor echo the two candles {{on either side of}} one of the statues, and notes that the copies described below retain the prayer tablet, one bringing it nearer to the foreground.|$|E
5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E

5|$|October {{started with}} an away fixture against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on 7 October. Sunderland went 2–0 down {{within the first}} 14minutes. However, Sunderland {{levelled}} the score at 2–2 with goals from Ross Wallace on the 25th minute and Kenwyne Jones on the 48minute. Arsenal won the game 3–2 after a late Robin van Persie goal. Sunderland suffered back-to-back defeats when they lost 3–1 away to West Ham United on 21 October. Kenwyne Jones got the goal for Sunderland. Fulham came to the Stadium <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> <b>on</b> 27 October, Fulham {{took the lead in}} the 32nd minute with a 30yard free kick from Simon Davies. Sunderland snatched a point when Kenywyne Jones scored an 86th-minute equaliser. The wearsiders had gone down to ten men in the 67th minute when Greg Halford was sent off.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{put an end}} to {{speculation}} linking {{him with}} a move to Tottenham Hotspur by signing a 4 and a half-year contract at the Stadium <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> <b>on</b> 27 January 2009. After a spell of six games without a goal, Jones scored against Manchester United in a 2–1 defeat. On 22 August Jones contributed to Sunderland's 2–1 victory over Blackburn Rovers scoring two goals. Jones again contributed with two goals for Sunderland when they were at home to Wolves on 27 September, in a 5–2 win. One goal being the highlight of the game, curling the ball home from 22yards out. Jones scored his fifth goal of the season with a header against Manchester United, outjumping Ben Foster to give Sunderland a 2–1 lead but in the dying moments of the match at Old Trafford, Patrice Evra's shot was deflected in for an own-goal by Anton Ferdinand to level it up and end the match as a 2–2 draw. Jones scored his sixth goal of the season with a close-range header against Manchester City which City won 4–3. On 6 February, Jones scored his seventh goal of the season with another header against Wigan Athletic which ended up 1–1 at the Stadium of Light. Jones then scored again against Manchester City bringing his tally to eight, with a spectacular header at the Stadium of Light, which ended up 1–1. He also opened the scoring against Wolves {{on the final day of}} the season, netting after a strike deflected off Jody Craddock after 8 minutes, but Wolves would go on to win 2–1.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E

25|$|In 1839, Alexandre Edmond Becquerel {{discovered}} the photovoltaic effect while studying the effect <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> electrolytic cells. Though not {{equivalent to the}} photoelectric effect, his work on photovoltaics was instrumental in showing a strong relationship between light and electronic properties of materials.

25|$|WDM, DWDM and CWDM {{are based}} on the same concept of using {{multiple}} wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>on</b> a single fiber, but differ in the spacing of the wavelengths, number of channels, and the ability to amplify the multiplexed signals in the optical space.

For CWDM, wideband optical amplification is not available, limiting the optical spans to several tens of kilometres.|$|E

25|$|The ball mouse {{replaced}} the external wheels {{with a single}} ball that could rotate in any direction. It came {{as part of the}} hardware package of the Xerox Alto computer.

This variant of the mouse resembled an inverted trackball and became the predominant form used with personal computers throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Xerox PARC group also settled on the modern technique of using both hands to type on a full-size keyboard and grabbing the mouse when required.|$|E

40|$|Summary Reports of {{the effects}} <b>of</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>on</b> mood are mainly at an anecdotal level There is little by way of {{empirical}} support and the existing evidence is problematic and contradictory. This experimental study shows that there are systematic influences <b>of</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>on</b> mood from <b>lighting</b> parameters {{within the range of}} those encountered in everyday interior conditions. The nature <b>of</b> the <b>lighting</b> effects is complex and is best summarised as initial effects and longer-term effects. Initial effects link illuminance with sensation seeking and correlated colour temperature (ccr) with hostility. Longer-term effects involve complex interactions between gender, illuminance and CCT. The results are consistent with K&uuml;ller’s proposal for short-term and long-term lighting effects. ...|$|R
