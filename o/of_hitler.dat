5|$|In 1969, Soviet {{journalist}} Lev Bezymensky's book on {{the death}} <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> {{was published in the}} West. It included the SMERSH autopsy report, but because of the earlier disinformation attempts, western historians thought it untrustworthy.|$|E
5|$|Later on 2 May, {{the remains}} <b>of</b> <b>Hitler,</b> Braun, and two dogs (thought to be Blondi and her offspring, Wulf) were {{discovered}} in a shell crater by {{a unit of the}} Red Army intelligence agency SMERSH tasked with finding Hitler's body. Stalin was wary of believing Hitler was dead, and restricted the release of information to the public. The remains <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> and Braun were repeatedly buried and exhumed by SMERSH during the unit's relocation from Berlin to a new facility in Magdeburg. The bodies, along with the charred remains of propaganda minister Goebbels, his wife Magda, and their six children, were buried in an unmarked grave beneath a paved section of the front courtyard. The location was kept secret.|$|E
5|$|Between World WarI and World WarII Australia {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the Great Depression {{which started in}} 1929. This limited Australian defence expenditure {{and led to a}} decline in the size and effectiveness of the armed forces during the 1930s. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> and the British guarantee of Polish independence.|$|E

5000|$|Maria Anna Schicklgruber (15 April 1795 [...] - [...] 7 January 1847) was {{the mother}} <b>of</b> Alois <b>Hitler,</b> and the {{paternal}} grandmother <b>of</b> Adolf <b>Hitler.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In part, Lukacs’s 1997 book, The <b>Hitler</b> <b>of</b> History, a prosopography of {{the historians}} {{who have written}} biographies <b>of</b> Adolf <b>Hitler,</b> is a {{critique}} of Irving’s work. Irving in his turn has engaged in what many consider to be anti-Semitic and racist attacks against Lukacs. Because of his Jewish mother, Irving disparagingly refers to him as [...] "a Jewish historian". In letters of 25 October and 28 October 1997 Irving threatened to sue Lukacs for libel if he published his book, The <b>Hitler</b> <b>of</b> History without removing certain passages which were highly critical of Irving's work. The American edition <b>of</b> The <b>Hitler</b> <b>of</b> History was published in 1997 with the passages included, but because of Irving's legal threats, no British edition <b>of</b> The <b>Hitler</b> <b>of</b> History was published until 2001. As {{a result of the}} threat of legal action by Irving under British libel laws, when the British edition was finally published, the passages containing the criticism of Irving's historical methods were expunged by the publisher.|$|R
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He met his lover, Eva Braun, in 1929, and married her in April 1945. In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment. It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her death {{was a source of}} deep, lasting pain. Paula Hitler, the younger sister <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> and the last living member of his immediate family, died in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Mengele's {{life was}} the {{inspiration}} for a novel and film titled The Boys from Brazil (1978), where a fictional Mengele (portrayed by Gregory Peck) produces clones <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> in a clinic in Brazil. In 2007, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum received as a donation the Höcker Album, an album of photographs of Auschwitz staff taken by Karl-Friedrich Höcker. Eight of the photographs include Mengele.|$|E
5|$|Schreck, a {{founding}} member of the SA and a close confidant <b>of</b> <b>Hitler,</b> became the first SS chief in March 1925. On 15 April 1926, Joseph Berchtold succeeded him as chief of the SS. Berchtold changed the title of the office to Reichsführer-SS (Reich Leader-SS). Berchtold was considered more dynamic than his predecessor, but became increasingly frustrated by the authority the SA had over the SS. This led to him transferring leadership of the SS to his deputy, Erhard Heiden, on 1 March 1927. Under Heiden's leadership, a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA.|$|E
5000|$|A special degree <b>of</b> the <b>Hitler</b> Youth Badge, {{known as}} the [...] "Hitler Youth Badge for Distinguished Foreigners", was {{authorized}} for presentation to non-German citizens who had benefited the goals <b>of</b> the <b>Hitler</b> Youth.|$|R
50|$|A Hitlerjugendführer was any {{adult who}} served in the {{leadership}} corps <b>of</b> the <b>Hitler</b> Youth and thus oversaw a cell (or groups of cells) comprising several Hitlerjunge which was the phrase for juvenile members <b>of</b> the <b>Hitler</b> Youth. Although the title of Hitlerjugendführer was replaced by several Hitler Youth senior leadership ranks after 1930, the term survived to refer to any member <b>of</b> the <b>Hitler</b> Youth adult leadership corps.|$|R
50|$|Paula Hitler (also {{known as}} Paula Wolff) (21 January 1896 in Hafeld, Austria - 1 June 1960 in Berchtesgaden) was the younger sister <b>of</b> Adolf <b>Hitler</b> {{and the last}} child <b>of</b> Alois <b>Hitler,</b> Sr. and his third wife, Klara Pölzl.|$|R
5|$|Accounts differ as to {{the cause}} of death; one version stated that he died by poison only and another view claimed he died by a self-inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have {{rejected}} these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions. One eyewitness stated that Hitler's corpse showed signs of having been shot through the mouth, but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments that were recovered. In 2009, American researchers performed DNA tests on a skull that Soviet officials had long believed to be that <b>of</b> <b>Hitler.</b> The tests and examination revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old. The recovered jaw fragments were not tested.|$|E
5|$|After 1:00pm on 30 April 1945, Braun and Hitler {{said their}} farewells to staff {{and members of}} the inner circle. Later that afternoon, at {{approximately}} 3:30pm, several people reported hearing a loud gunshot. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, and Hitler's SS adjutant, Otto Günsche, entered the small study and found the lifeless bodies <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> and Braun on a small sofa. Braun had bitten into a cyanide capsule, and Hitler had shot himself in the right temple with his pistol. The corpses were carried up the stairs and through the bunker's emergency exit to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were burned. Braun was 33 years old when she died.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding {{in a sense of}} duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> was based solely on their disagreements over the conduct of the war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E
5000|$|His {{struggle}} with depression influenced his studies greatly, particularly {{when he began}} researching the psychohistorical profile <b>of</b> Adolf <b>Hitler.</b> He frequently told colleagues: “the career <b>of</b> Adolf <b>Hitler</b> raises questions that can be answered neither by psychology nor by history working alone.” ...|$|R
50|$|There were a {{few members}} <b>of</b> the <b>Hitler</b> Youth who privately {{disagreed}} with Nazi ideologies. For instance, Hans Scholl—the brother of Sophie Scholl {{and one of the}} leading figures of the anti-Nazi resistance movement Weiße Rose (White Rose)—was also a member <b>of</b> the <b>Hitler</b> Youth.|$|R

5|$|Berlin {{surrendered}} on 2 May. Records in the Soviet archives obtained {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union state that the remains <b>of</b> <b>Hitler,</b> Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, the six Goebbels children, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg. The remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the Elbe. According to Kershaw, the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army found them, and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler's remains.|$|E
5|$|Eva Anna Paula Hitler (née Braun; 6 February 1912– 30 April 1945) was the {{longtime}} companion of Adolf Hitler and, for fewer than 40 hours, his wife. Braun met Hitler in Munich {{when she was}} a 17-year-old assistant and model for his personal photographer; she began seeing him often about two years later. She attempted suicide twice during their early relationship. By 1936, she was a part of his household at the Berghof near Berchtesgaden and lived a sheltered life throughout World War II. Braun was a photographer, and many of the surviving colour photographs and films <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> were taken by her. She was a key figure within Hitler's inner social circle, but did not attend public events with him until mid-1944, when her sister Gretl married Hermann Fegelein, the SS liaison officer on his staff.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief {{vacation}} in Silesia, Strachwitz {{returned to the}} 1st Panzer Division at the training grounds at Königsbrück, near Dresden. During the preparations for the fall manoeuvres the General der Kavallerie (General of the Cavalry) von Weichs was dismissed. On 18 September Panzer-Regiment 2 was relocated from Königsbrück to Fürstenberg and then to Neustrelitz. Here, under the watchful eyes <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> and Benito Mussolini from the Schmooksberg near Laage, the 1st and 3rd Panzer-Brigade, supported by Kampfgeschwader (Bomber Wings), practiced a large scale tank attack. The regiment returned to Eisenach on 30 September. Strachwitz returned to his estate but was called back shortly before the Anschluß, the annexation of Austria by Germany, in March 1938.|$|E

The film won an ACE for best documentary. In 1992, Heck was awarded a NATIONAL EMMY for [...] "outstanding historical programming".|$|R
5|$|Göring {{was noted}} for his {{patronage}} of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself. Armaments minister Albert Speer recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Göring an oversize marble bust <b>of</b> <b>Hitler.</b> As {{a member of}} the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked. Field Marshal Erhard Milch told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund. For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted Collar of Annunziata. The award reduced him to tears.|$|E
5|$|However, others {{note that}} the former Dadaist leader would often show himself a {{follower}} of political guidelines. As early as 1934, Tzara, together with Breton, Éluard and communist writer René Crevel, organized an informal trial of independent-minded Surrealist Salvador Dalí, {{who was at the}} time a confessed admirer <b>of</b> <b>Hitler,</b> and whose portrait of William Tell had alarmed them because it shared likeness with Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin. Historian Irina Livezeanu notes that Tzara, who agreed with Stalinism and shunned Trotskyism, submitted to the PCF cultural demands during the writers' congress of 1935, even when his friend Crevel committed suicide to protest the adoption of socialist realism. At a later stage, Livezeanu remarks, Tzara reinterpreted Dada and Surrealism as revolutionary currents, and presented them as such to the public. This stance she contrasts with that of Breton, who was more reserved in his attitudes.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Lympne {{was to be}} the {{destination}} for the landing of an aircraft carrying Adolf Hitler in a daring kidnap plot. A {{man by the name of}} Kiroff had given information to the British Military Attaché in Sofia, Bulgaria, that he was the brother-in-law of Hans Baur, the personal pilot <b>of</b> <b>Hitler.</b> He stated that Baur was planning to defect using Hitler's Focke-Wulf Fw 200 with him on board. The RAF made plans to receive the aircraft at Lympne and 25 March was the date that the defection was expected to occur. Baur did not defect and spent the war as Hitler's personal pilot. A few weeks later Rudolph Hess defected to Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Martin Filler {{acknowledged}} that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, {{such as in the}} probably imagined scene when George V lectures his son on the importance of broadcasting. Filler cautions that George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would have understood a newsreel <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis. They only warmed to Churchill later in the war, because of his performance as a wartime leader.|$|E
5|$|Prescribed 90 {{medications}} {{during the}} war years by his personal physician, Theodor Morell, Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments. He regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine, as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (the latter in the form of Doktor Koster's Antigaspills). He suffered ruptured eardrums {{as a result of the}} 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs. Newsreel footage <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life. Ernst-Günther Schenck and several other doctors who met Hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl {{eventually}} {{came to the}} notice <b>of</b> <b>Hitler</b> who was immediately captivated by her work. She is described as fitting in with Hitler’s ideal of Aryan womanhood, a feature he had noted {{when he saw her}} starring performance in Das Blaue Licht. After meeting Hitler, Riefenstahl was offered the opportunity to direct Der Sieg des Glaubens ("The Victory of Faith"), an hour-long propaganda film about the fifth Nuremberg Rally in 1933. The opportunity that was offered was a huge surprise to Riefenstahl. Hitler had ordered Goebbels Propaganda Ministry to give the film commission to Riefenstahl, but the Ministry had never informed her. Riefenstahl agreed to direct the movie even though she was only given {{a few days before the}} rally to prepare. She and Hitler got on well, forming a friendly relationship. The propaganda film was funded entirely by the NSDAP.|$|E
