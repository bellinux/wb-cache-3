25|$|He {{is perhaps}} best known for his portraits, and his sitters {{including}} {{some of the most important}} men and women of his time. His portrait of painter Lydia Field Emmet in 1892 depicts Emmet in a pose typically reserved for men in old masters' paintings. Emmet's hand is on her hip and she looks <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the audience.|$|E
500|$|To {{one side}} of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto {{designed}} by Bernardo Buontalenti. The lower façade was begun by Vasari [...] but the architecture of the upper storey is subverted by [...] "dripping" [...] pumice stalactites with the Medici coat of arms at the centre. The interior is similarly poised between architecture and nature; the first chamber has copies of Michelangelo's four unfinished slaves emerging from the corners which seem to carry the vault with an open oculus at its centre and painted as a rustic bower with animals, figures and vegetation. Figures, animals and trees made of stucco and rough pumice adorn the lower walls. A short passage leads to a small second chamber and to a third which has a central fountain with Giambologna's Venus in the centre of the basin, peering fearfully <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the four satyrs spitting jets of water at her from the edge.|$|E

50|$|Graziella title {{character}} was depicted by the French artist Jules Joseph Lefebvre in an 1878 oil painting on canvas. Commissioned by the art collector Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, the work depicts Graziella {{sitting on a}} rock, fishing net in hand, gazing <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> a smoking Mount Vesuvius. The painting {{is now at the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, New York. Another painting, Graziella di Lamartine, was completed by Neapolitan artist Ferdinando Ruggieri, and a sculpture by Cesare Aureli depicting a scene where Graziella cuts her hair as a sacrifice to the Virgin Mary is also recorded.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Annabel {{accepted}} the book very graciously, and, {{in spite of}} all the temptations of her toys, Venetia could not refrain from peeping <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> its contents. 'Mother,' she whispered, in a voice inaudible save to Lady Annabel, 'I may read this!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Dear, dreary old place!” cries Beatrix. “Mamma hath {{never had}} the heart to go back thither since we left it, when—never mind how many years ago,” and she flung back her curls, and looked <b>over</b> <b>her</b> fair <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the mirror superbly, as if she said, “Time, I defy you.” ...|$|R
60|$|Meriem glanced lazily <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> {{the excited}} disturber of her peace.|$|E
60|$|Miss Howard {{shook hands}} with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> John.|$|E
60|$|Arrived at {{the library}} door, Lady Janet looked <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the little {{immovable}} black figure in the chair.|$|E
6000|$|Valencia {{looked up}} at him, expecting him to go too. Mrs. Vavasour began bustling about the room, {{collecting}} little valuables, and looking <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> the now unwelcome guest. But Frank leaned back in a cosy arm-chair, and did not stir. His hands were clasped on his knees; he seemed lost in thought; very pale: {{but there was a}} firm set look about his lips which attracted Valencia's attention. Once he looked up in Valencia's face, and saw that she was looking at him. A flush came over his cheeks for a moment, and then he seemed as impassive as ever. What could he want there! How very gauche and rude of him; so unlike him, too! And she said, civilly enough, to him, [...] "I fear, Mr. Headley, we must begin packing up now." ...|$|R
60|$|And in her {{commerce}} {{with the}} great our dear friend showed the same frankness which distinguished her transactions with the lowly in station. On one occasion, when out at a very fine house, Rebecca was (perhaps rather ostentatiously) holding a conversation in the French language with a celebrated tenor singer of that nation, while the Lady Grizzel Macbeth looked <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> scowling <b>at</b> the pair.|$|R

60|$|I {{followed}} her lead, and I saw her glance back <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the young man, who seemed unaware, even, of her departure.|$|E
60|$|The dame de compagnie had {{advanced}} to the open hall-door. She glanced rapidly <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> Miss Haldin, who remained within the hall.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{a matter}} {{of two or three}} nights ago," [...] said Grey slowly, [...] "that Trigg and I were passing through Sycamore Woods, just below the hotel. It was after twelve--bright moonlight, so that we could see {{everything}} as plain as day, and we were dead sober. Just as we passed under the sycamores Trigg grabs my arm, and says, 'Hi!' I looked up, and there, not ten yards away, standing dead in the moonlight, was that dummy! She was all in white--that dress with the fairy frills, you know--and had, what's more, A HEAD! At least, something white all wrapped around it, and <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> <b>At</b> first we thought you or some of the boys had dressed her up and lifted her out there for a joke, and left her to frighten us! So we started forward, and then--it's the gospel truth!--she MOVED AWAY, gliding like the moonbeams, and vanished among the trees!" ...|$|R
60|$|And Dick Graves, being {{a little}} drunk, very faithful, and very simple-minded, {{told her that he}} thought Jacob the {{greatest}} man he had ever known. And down they sat cross-legged upon cushions and talked about Jacob, and Helen's voice trembled, for they both seemed heroes to her, and the friendship between them so much more beautiful than women's friendships. Anthony Pollett now asked her to dance, and as she danced she looked <b>at</b> them, <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> standing <b>at</b> the table, drinking together.|$|R
60|$|But the {{momentary}} {{vision of a}} waistless woman with a shawl gathered <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head and <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> the back door attracted his attention. She said something to Mateo in Spanish, and the yellowish-white of Mateo's eyes glistened with intelligent comprehension.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the great}} ruffen pushing me!" [...] screamed {{a woman in}} front of Jan <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> him when the rush was at its fiercest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so. Lynde {{said she}} had seen you on the shore once. Well"--she cast an {{uncertain}} glance <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the house--"I'm much obliged to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Regarde, regarde ces gens-la! Ne sont-ils pas des hiboux incroyables?' And {{with the}} words of French in her mouth, she would look <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the giggling party.|$|E
6000|$|Caroline stole a quiet gaze towards her, {{dwelling}} on her young, absorbed countenance, and observing a certain unconscious {{movement of the}} mouth as she read--a movement full of character. Caroline had tact, and she had fine instinct. She felt that Rose Yorke was a peculiar child--one of the unique; {{she knew how to}} treat her. Approaching quietly, she knelt on the carpet at her side, and looked <b>over</b> <b>her</b> little <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> book. It was a romance of Mrs. Radcliffe's--"The Italian." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, certainly, Mr. Langbourne!" [...] she cried, and {{he started}} away. But he had gone only a few rods when he wheeled about and hurried back. The girl was going up the walk to the house, looking <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> after him; <b>at</b> his hurried return she stopped and {{came down to the}} gate again.|$|R
50|$|Courtney {{was born}} in Brisbane, Queensland to parents Glen and Vicki Thorpe. Her love of fashion began at an early age, where she claims it all began looking <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mother’s <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> a vogue magazine. Since this early introduction, she trained as a fashion stylist, makeup artist {{and worked as a}} fashion editor for an {{international}} online publication and, until winning her title of Miss World Australia, she ran the Styling Department at Queensland’s leading fashion college. She describes herself as family girl, and a city girl with a country girl alter-ego with a love for the outdoors and travel.|$|R
60|$|She did not {{certainly}} as she shook the popper laughingly, and looked <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> him, with the bloom of fire-light on her cheeks, its cheerfulness in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} my aunt's first dinner-gown very brightly, {{and how she}} stood before {{the fire in the}} drawing-room confessing once unsuspected pretty arms with all the courage she possessed, and looking <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> herself in a mirror.|$|E
6000|$|Diving {{suddenly}} {{into the}} recesses of something, she produced an exiguous round silver box. Prizing it open, she looked <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the Bigwigs, then placed her little finger on {{the contents of the}} little box, and said very softly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never, never, never {{wished to}} break with Tom! It's wicked of you to say so, Dora! It is you who were for ever sneering at him: it is you who are always envious because I happen--at least, because gentlemen imagine that I am not ill-looking, and prefer me to some folks, {{in spite of all}} their {{learning}} and wit!" [...] cries Flora, tossing <b>her</b> head <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and looking <b>at</b> the glass.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're quite right, Harry; and yet, do you know, I {{think there}} must be something, too, in {{sticking}} to one's own opinions, like Mr. Le Breton. I should stick to mine, I'm sure, and wear whatever dress I liked, in spite of anybody. It's a sweet thing, really, isn't it?' And she turned herself round, craning <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> to look <b>at</b> the effect, in a vain attempt to assume an objective attitude towards her own back.|$|R
60|$|And {{then through}} the last clump of waving ferns broke {{the figure of the}} {{foremost}} creature, which came leaping toward me on light feet as I stood with my rifle to my shoulder covering the point at which I had expected it would emerge. I must have looked foolish indeed if my surprise and consternation were in any way reflected upon my countenance as I lowered my rifle and gazed incredulous at the lithe figure of the girl speeding swiftly in my direction. But I did not have long to stand thus with lowered weapon, for as she came, I saw her cast an affrighted glance <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and <b>at</b> the same moment there broke from the jungle at the same spot at which I had seen her, the hugest cat I had ever looked upon.|$|R
6000|$|As Clym {{descended into}} the valley Thomasin came down by the other path, and {{met him at the}} gate. [...] "What do you think I have to tell you, Clym?" [...] she said, looking archly <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
60|$|The {{green sun}} was now topping the black desolations of the horizon, and {{the vision of}} the room was very faint. Plattner could see that the white of the bed struggled, and was convulsed; and that the woman looked round <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> it, startled.|$|E
6000|$|Gillespie {{pulled the}} leatherwood latch-string which lifted the catch of his door, {{and pushed it}} open. [...] "Go in, Jane," [...] {{he said to his}} daughter, and the girl {{vanished}} slimly through, with a glance <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> Dylks where he stood aloof a few steps from her father.|$|E
6000|$|... 20th.--I hate Sir Percival! I flatly deny {{his good}} looks. I {{consider}} {{him to be}} eminently ill-tempered and disagreeable, and totally wanting in kindness and good feeling. Last night the cards for the married couple were sent home. Laura opened the packet and saw her future name in print for the first time. Sir Percival looked <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> familiarly <b>at</b> the new card which had already transformed Miss Fairlie into Lady Glyde--smiled with the most odious self-complacency, and whispered something in her ear. I don't know what it was--Laura has refused to tell me--but I saw her face turn to such a deadly whiteness that I thought she would have fainted. He took no notice of the change--he seemed to be barbarously unconscious that he had said anything to pain her. All my old feelings of hostility towards him revived on the instant, and all the hours that have passed since have done nothing to dissipate them. I am more unreasonable and more unjust than ever. In three words--how glibly my pen writes them!--in three words, I hate him.|$|R
6000|$|The girl led {{him then}} to a door, opened it, and when he entered shut it softly without announcing him. The room in which he found himself was a long one, lighted from the roof. The walls were hung with pictures. At the far end, with their backs towards him, were two ladies: Lydia, and a woman whose noble {{carriage}} and elegant form would, have raised hopes of beauty in a man less preoccupied than Cashel. But he, after advancing some distance with his eyes on Lydia, suddenly changed countenance, stopped, and was actually turning to fly, when the ladies, hearing his light step, faced about and rooted him to the spot. As Lydia offered him her hand, her companion, who had surveyed the visitor first with indifference, and then with incredulous surprise, exclaimed, with a burst of delighted recognition, like a child finding a long-lost plaything, [...] "My darling boy!" [...] And going to Cashel with the grace of a swan, she clasped him in her arms. In acknowledgment of which he thrust his red, discomfited face <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> winked <b>at</b> Lydia with his tongue in his cheek, and said, ...|$|R
50|$|Lagertha's tale is {{recorded}} in passages {{in the ninth}} book of the Gesta Danorum, a twelfth-century work of Danish history by Saxo Grammaticus. According to the Gesta (¶ 9.4.1-9.4.11), Lagertha's career as a warrior began when Frø, king of Sweden, invaded Norway and killed the Norwegian king Siward. Frø put {{the women of the}} dead king's family into a brothel for public humiliation. Hearing of this, Ragnar Lodbrok came with an army to avenge his grandfather Siward. Many of the women Frø had ordered abused dressed themselves in men's clothing and fought on Ragnar's side. Chief among them, and key to Ragnar's victory, was Lagertha. Saxo recounts:Ladgerda, a skilled Amazon, who, though a maiden, had the courage of a man, and fought in front among the bravest with <b>her</b> hair loose <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> All-marvelled <b>at</b> <b>her</b> matchless deeds, for her locks flying down her back betrayed that she was a woman.Impressed with her courage, Ragnar courted her from afar. Lagertha feigned interest and Ragnar arrived to seek her hand, bidding his companions wait in the Gaular valley. He was set upon by a bear and a great hound which Lagertha had guarding her home, but killed the bear with his spear and choked the hound to death. Thus he won the hand of Lagertha in marriage. According to Saxo, Ragnar had a son with her, Fridleif, as well as two daughters, whose names are not recorded.|$|R
