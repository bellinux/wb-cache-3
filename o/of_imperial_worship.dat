50|$|The five {{mountains}} {{are among the}} best-known natural landmarks in Chinese history, and since the early periods in Chinese history, they have been the ritual sites <b>of</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>worship</b> and sacrifice by various emperors.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to extend the archeoastronomical study sample on the {{orientation}} of Roman cities {{to the analysis of}} a number of cases in the Rhine area. The starting point is a study of the orientation of Augusta Treverorum (present day Trier; Goethert, 2003). Goethert assumed that the orientation of the decumanus maximus was towards sunrise at the autumn equinox, on September 23 rd as the dies natalis of the city. This event would deliberately coincide with the anniversary of the birth of Augustus, and would have determined the establishment and orientation of the new urban layout. However, our in situ measurements of the orientation of the urban network at several sites of the Roman town rule out this hypothesis. We find an orientation that is more in line with those documented for other Roman cities and camps elsewhere in the Roman provinces (González-García et al., 2014; Rodríguez-Antón et al., 2016). Moreover, measurements made in the Lenus Mars temple indicate a recurrent phenomenon of cultural hybridization. Here the temple, located outside the city walls on {{the west bank of the}} river Moselle, combines a possibly Celtic orientation with Roman symbolic beliefs. In reality, the alleged orientation towards the dies natalis of Augustus is verified for Cologne. There are a number of circumstances that make this choice logical for a city that was initially planned as the capital of the Augustan province of Germania and the seat of an ara <b>of</b> <b>imperial</b> <b>worship...</b>|$|E

The definitive version is available at: [URL] contemporary scholarly discussions, political uses <b>of</b> <b>imperial</b> pasts are typically associated with the rise of modern nation-states and nationalist principles of identity formation. Although clearly important, this approach can lead us to neglect the appropriations <b>of</b> <b>imperial</b> myths based on other types of ideological frameworks. In communist Eastern Europe, official representations of the past followed the imperatives of a historicalmaterialist vision of history, which, at least in its initial form, necessitated a rejection of both imperialism and nationalism. It is therefore reasonable to expect that communist appropriations <b>of</b> <b>imperial</b> legacies were significantly different from those found in Western Europe at the time. This article examines these different uses <b>of</b> <b>imperial</b> pasts – informed by either communismor nationalismor both – by focusing on the competing perceptions <b>of</b> <b>imperial</b> history and heritage at the Italo-Yugoslav border during the early Cold War...|$|R
