5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania became {{increasingly}} interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially {{to gain control}} of Baltic seaports, such as Riga, and for other economic benefits. Livonia was by the 1550s largely Lutheran, traditionally ruled by the Brothers of the Sword knightly order. This put Poland and Lithuania <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Moscow and other regional powers, which had also attempted expansion in that area.|$|E
5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls {{could be}} identified as to which bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched {{in close proximity to}} each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one of the opposite sex. Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signal for traffic control. Individual greater bulldog bats honk when <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> each other.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the Solar System {{is stable}} in {{that none of}} the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years. Beyond this, within fivebillion years or so Mars's {{eccentricity}} may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether or send it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Venus or Earth. This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed.|$|E

5|$|Warning from Space {{influenced}} Toho's Gorath, a 1963 film which {{depicts a}} rogue planet <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth. The planet Paira in Warning from Space {{may have been}} an influence in the later Daiei film Gamera vs. Guiron, which features the planet Terra, another planet on the opposite of Earth's orbit. Critics have also noted plot similarities to the later Toho film Invasion of Astro-Monster, in that a friendly planet warns Japan of the atom bomb and subsequently assists in celestial defense. The Pairans' asteroidean appearance {{is similar to that of}} a later pentagrammic creation, Starro, a villain from DC Comics' Justice League.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The sudden {{loss of the}} {{flagship}} and the fleet admiral threw the already scattered Swedish line into confusion and sapped morale. Four ships from Creutz's and Uggla's squadrons immediately fled when they saw that {{the flagship}} was lost. Claes Uggla was next in command after Creutz and became the acting commander of the Swedish fleet. When the line came about, Uggla and his ship Svärdet came <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the still floating wreckage of Kronan, and were forced to jibe (turn the stern into the wind direction) to avoid it. Svärdets second turn was interpreted by many ships as a signal to turn again; others interpreted it {{as the beginning of}} a general retreat, leading to major disorder. Uggla reduced speed in an attempt to gather his forces, but instead was separated from his squadron.|$|E

5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the Aurigas systems, Call sets it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} 2001, {{the space station}} Silicon Valley was launched, housing {{numerous}} animals. Seven minutes after its launch, it vanished. Believed to have disappeared forever, it reappears in the year 3000, and the many expeditions sent to retrieve the space station vanished without explanation. Following this, the duo of Dan Danger and Evo were sent to investigate; they discover that the animal cargo has evolved and merged with the station's technology, resulting in animals such as an electronically-powered fox with motorised wheels, and a steam-powered hippopotamus. Evo sets out to fix the control station, which is <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth. Upon arriving at the control room, Evo confronts the Evil Brain, who is fascinated by Evo's abilities and wants to keep him to complete the collection of robotic animals. The Evil Brain threatens to destroy the Earth, but is quickly defeated by Evo. Despite this, Evo is unable to stop the space station from spinning out of control; it collides with Earth, landing in New York Harbor. The robotic animals escape and flee around New York City, and Evo sets out to terminate them before they terrorise the planet.|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} {{supported}} by the EU funded myCopter project. Abstract. We have developed a method for the detection of both generic flight neighbouring aircrafts and those <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course.</b> Our approach employs a sliding window linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature representation. An extension of this approach to the spatio-temporal domain is also considered and we demonstrate its advantage for the detection of aircrafts <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> path. We evaluated our approach for the detection of both small rotorcraft and larger fixed-wing aircrafts in challenging video sequences. Our results show that aircrafts <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> can be detected more reliably than when assuming a generic flight path. This is very interesting in practice, since this case is of critical importance. We also show that our spatio-temporal approach improves the detection accuracy with respect to conventional singleframe approaches. ...|$|R

The 2011 film Melancholia uses the motif of an impact event incorporated in the aesthetics of Romanticism.|$|E
25|$|A {{public debate}} about {{the cause of the}} {{accident}} arose after the report, in part because of sightings of fighter jets. Such reports had been appearing in the media since shortly after the accident. Fremover reported in January 1987 that radar had observed an unidentified aircraft which was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the Twin Otter. The issue escalated with the captain's brother, Widerøe's chief pilot John Hovring, stating that the crash must have occurred {{as a result of a}} collision with a fighter or missile. He further stated that General Mohr as an air force officer had a vested interest in covering up the real cause.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, France was {{establishing}} {{a foothold in}} neighbouring Vietnam, putting it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Siam. Under the orders of Napoleon III, French gunships under Rigault de Genouilly attacked the port of Da Nang in 1858, causing significant damage, and holding the city for a few months. de Gnouilly sailed south and captured the poorly defended city of Saigon in 1859. From 1859 to 1867, French troops expanded their control over all six provinces on the Mekong delta and formed a French Colony, Cochin China. In 1863, France and King Norodom of Cambodia signed a treaty of protection with France, which transferred the country from Siamese and Vietnamese overlordship to French colonial rule. A new treaty was signed between France and Siam on 15 July 1867.|$|E
25|$|The {{imperial}} {{factor was}} a double-edged sword: Rhodes {{did not want}} the bureaucrats of the Colonial Office in London to interfere in the Empire in Africa. He wanted British settlers and local politicians and governors to run it. This put him <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> many in Britain, as well as with British missionaries, who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from London. Rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of South Africa against his future mining profits. The Colonial Office did not have enough funding for this. Rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of Britain: preventing the Portuguese, the Germans or the Boers from moving into south-central Africa. Rhodes' companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions, as exemplified by the Rudd and Lochner Concessions.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{challenge}} to the NBA's eligibility rules came from Spencer Haywood. He {{graduated from high school}} in 1968, at a time when college Freshmen were not allowed to play varsity sports for NCAA member schools. He played 3 years at a Colorado junior college, followed by a season at the University of Detroit. After the 1970–71 season, he left college for the NBA's rival at the time, the ABA, which had no rule restricting college underclassmen from entering the league, and had a spectacularly successful rookie season with the Denver Rockets (the predecessor to today's Denver Nuggets), being named the ABA's Rookie of the Year and MVP. Near the end of the season, he turned 21; shortly after its end, he repudiated his contract with the Rockets, claiming he had been defrauded. Haywood then signed a contract with the Seattle SuperSonics, which put him and the Sonics <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the NBA, as he was only three years removed from his high school graduation.|$|E

He follows them to a giant space station called the ARK with it, where he again scuffles with Rouge over the Emerald. He saves her from falling into a constructed pit of lava; she decides the shards are worthless and dismissively lets him keep them, so he reassembles the Emerald and runs off.

25|$|In {{the morning}} of 8 April 1940, {{on the eve of}} the German {{invasion}} of Norway, Sæl was docked at the Marineholmen naval base in Bergen between patrol missions. By 02:30 on 9 April she had finished coaling, having been ordered to make war preparations the previous day, and moved south towards her blocking position in the Lerøy area in the approaches to Bergen. Due to a lack of information as the position of the intruding German forces she sailed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the German Kampfgruppe 3. When the German ships were spotted by Sæl they were at such close range that the Norwegians had to make evasive manoeuvres to avoid a collision and were unable to launch a torpedo. As the Kriegsmarine ships passed her at only 10–15 metres distance, Sæl turned around and gave chase in the hope of catching up with the Germans and get within range for a torpedo shot. As dawn was soon approaching Sæls commander, Fenrik (Ensign) L. Gulbrandsen, decided to disengage and temporarily place his ship in cover behind the Bratholmen islet.|$|E
25|$|Előre (Forward) (September 1905 – October 1921) — Előre was the {{official}} {{organ of the}} Hungarian Socialist Federation, a weekly magazine first published in New York City in 1905 which came under the direct control of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in 1915. Előre was a staunch supporter of the SPA's anti-militarist position against World War I — a position which put it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the administration of President Woodrow Wilson when he led America into the European conflict {{in the spring of}} 1918. The government impeded the mailing of the publication and conducted police investigations of its editorial staff, forcing the paper to the financial brink. When the Hungarian Socialist Federation was suspended from the SPA during the factional war of 1919 for having lent its support to the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, supporters of the Communist Party of America gained control over the publication. The publication declared bankruptcy in October 1921, apparently to clear its debts, and was succeeded by a newly named New York publication only 10 days later, Új Előre.|$|E
