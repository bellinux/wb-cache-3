40|$|This study {{examined}} whether {{the method of}} hair cortisol analysis is applicable to <b>orang-utans</b> (Pongo spp.) and can help to advance the objective monitoring of stress in non-human primates. Specifically, we examined whether fundamental prerequisites for hair cortisol analysis are given in <b>orang-utans</b> and, subsequently, whether segmental hair analysis may provide a retrospective calendar of long-term cortisol levels. For this, hair samples were examined from 71 zoo-living <b>orang-utans</b> (38 males, mean age= 22. 5 years; 33 females, mean age= 24 years) for which detailed records of past living conditions were available. Hair samples were cut from defined body regions and were analyzed either in full length or in segments. Results showed that hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) were unrelated to age or sex of the individual animal. HCC {{were found to be}} higher in <b>orang-utans,</b> with perceived long-term stressful periods (mean HCC= 43. 6 ± 26. 5 pg/mg, n= 13) compared to animals without perceived stressful periods (19. 3 ± 5. 5 pg/mg, n= 55, P 40 cm. The possibility of obtaining a retrospective calendar of stress-related cortisol changes through hair analysis was further supported by data of three case studies showing close correspondence between the segmental HCC results and keeper reports of stress exposure during the respective time periods. Finally, low within-animal variation in HCC from different body regions (CV%: 14. 3) suggested that this method may also be applicable to naturally shed hair, e. g., as found in nests of wild <b>orang-utans</b> and other great apes. Therefore, using HCC may provide an ideal non-invasive tool for both captive management as well as conservation in <b>orang-utans</b> and potentially other great apes...|$|R
40|$|Mating {{systems are}} thought to be an {{important}} determinant of dispersal strategies in most animals, including the great apes. As the most basal taxon of all great apes, <b>orang-utans</b> can provide information about the evolution of mating systems and their consequences for population structure in this Family. To assess the sex-specific population structure in <b>orang-utans,</b> we used a combination of paternally transmitted Y-chromosomal genetic markers and maternally transmitted mitochondrial DNA sequences. Markers transmitted through the more philopatric sex are expected to show stronger differentiation among populations than the ones transmitted through the dispersing sex. We studied these patterns using 70 genetic samples from wild <b>orang-utans</b> from seven Bornean and two Sumatran populations. We found pronounced population structure in haplotype networks of mitochondrial sequence data, but much less so for male-specific markers. Similarly, mitochondrial genetic differentiation was twice as high among populations compared to Y-chromosomal variation. We also found that genetic distance increased faster with geographic distance for mitochondrial than for Y-linked markers, leading to estimates of male dispersal distances that are several-fold higher than those of females. These findings provide evidence for strong male-biased dispersal in <b>orang-utans.</b> The transition to predominantly female-biased dispersal in the great ape lineage appears to be correlated with life in multimale groups and may reflect the associated fitness benefits of reliable male coalitions with relatives or known partners, a feature that is absent in <b>orang-utans...</b>|$|R

40|$|Investigating how {{different}} evolutionary forces have shaped patterns of DNA variation within and among species requires detailed {{knowledge of their}} demographic history. <b>Orang-utans,</b> whose distribution is currently restricted to the South-East Asian islands of Borneo (Pongo pygmaeus) and Sumatra (Pongo abelii), have likely experienced a complex demographic history, influenced by recurrent changes in climate and sea levels, volcanic activities and anthropogenic pressures. Using the most extensive sample set of wild <b>orang-utans</b> to date, we employed an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach to test the fit of 12 different demographic scenarios to the observed patterns of variation in autosomal, X-chromosomal, mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal markers. In the best-fitting model, Sumatran <b>orang-utans</b> exhibit a deep split of populations {{north and south of}} Lake Toba, probably caused by multiple eruptions of the Toba volcano. In addition, we found signals for a strong decline in all Sumatran populations ~ 24 ka, probably associated with hunting by human colonizers. In contrast, Bornean <b>orang-utans</b> experienced a severe bottleneck ~ 135 ka, followed by a population expansion and substructuring starting ~ 82 ka, which we link to an expansion from a glacial refugium. We showed that <b>orang-utans</b> went through drastic changes in population size and connectedness, caused by recurrent contraction and expansion of rainforest habitat during Pleistocene glaciations and probably hunting by early humans. Our findings emphasize the fact that important aspects of the evolutionary past of species with complex demographic histories might remain obscured when applying overly simplified models...|$|R

Sequence analysis of the amplicons revealed considerable differences between the PyVs from Bornean and Sumatran <b>orang-utans.</b> The genome from two PyVs, one from each species, was therefore amplified and sequenced. Both viral genomes revealed a characteristic PyV architecture, but lacked an obvious agnogene.

500|$|The Anthropological Review {{notes that}} while the {{descriptions}} of animal life are [...] "full of interest", [...] "our readers, as anthropologists, will, however, take a keener interest" [...] in the [...] "great man-like ape of Borneo,—the <b>orang-utan,</b> or mias, {{as it is called}} by the aborigines". Two pages are taken up with a discussion of the orang utan. The review then turns to Wallace's observations on [...] "the races of man" [...] in the book, observing that the anthropological details given are useful but perhaps chosen to support [...] "a particular theory", namely Wallace's belief that there were eastern and western races—"Malays" [...] and [...] "Papuans", though the boundary between them was east of the Wallace line. The review accepts Wallace's data on natural history, but suspects he was selective in recording details of individuals. It notes that Wallace agreed with French authors that the Polynesians (included in his Papuans) [...] "had a local origin". The review remarks that [...] "Mr Wallace relies more on the diversity of moral features to prove differences of race than on physical peculiarities, although he declares that these are strongly marked" [...] and doubts the difference, and wonders whether the [...] "Javan chief" [...] and the Dyak do not differ more.

40|$|Behavioural {{diversity}} {{is thought to}} be essential for survival in the wild but rehabilitated animals often show behavioural deficiencies due to previous captivity. Using Shannon's index of diversity, this study assessed behavioviral diversity in 4 reintroduced adult female <b>orang-utans</b> and 7 of their semi-wild-born offspring at Semenggoh Wildlife Centre, Seurawak, Malaysia. In the majority of cases, the behavioiual diversity of the <b>orang-utans</b> born and reared in semi-wild conditions at Semenggoh exceeded that of their mothers, suggesting that they were well adapted to their environment. Despite being somewhat behavioiurally deprived, the rehabilitated <b>orang-utans</b> were able to raise offspring successfully, a major goal of reintroduction. One rehabilitated individual d i d show significantly higher behavioural diversity than was expected, and this was attributed to a suite of behaviours involving interaction with and manipulation of man-made objects, as well as minrucking human behaviour. Such behavioiurs were probably due to a combination of her captive history and personality, which highlights the importance of these factors in the outcome of reintroduction. Interestingly, some of these behaviours were exhibited by all of the rehabilitated animals, but oiUy some of their offspring, suggesting that the transmission of behaviours may also be affected by individual differences such personality, gender and age.

Dawkins wrote an essay in The Great Ape Project, a book published by supporters of the project in which they expressed their views, along with Jane Goodall, Jared Diamond, and others. A passage from Dawkins's contribution is as follows: The word 'apes' usually means chimpanzees, gorillas, <b>orang-utans,</b> gibbons and siamangs. We admit that we are like apes, but we seldom realise that we are apes. Our common ancestor with the chimpanzees and gorillas is much more recent than their common ancestor with the Asian apes — the gibbons and <b>orang-utans.</b> There is no natural category that includes chimpanzees, gorillas and <b>orang-utans</b> but excludes humans.|$|R

40|$|Proximate {{factors of}} primate food sharing, in {{contrast}} to its evolutionary explanations, have received little attention. Active food sharing is considered prosocial, since possessors may benefit others by spontaneously passing food or by reacting to ‘signals of need’. However, {{in contrast to}} passive sharing, active food sharing is rare in most nonhuman primates. Surprisingly, previous research showed that captive Sumatran <b>orang-utans</b> actively share food more frequently than chimpanzees and bonobos, and hence, appear more prosocial. Yet these comparisons with the two Pan species were relying on previously published studies, which differed with regard to methods and food types used. Here we used the identical procedure and food type to compare the food-sharing behaviour of 10 captive Sumatran <b>orang-utans</b> and 18 chimpanzees, in situations where individuals could monopolize a sharable food source. We focused on communicative behaviours used to initiate food transfers, and assessed whether and how much food was transferred {{in response to these}} initiation attempts. In both species, most transfers were initiated by taking the food, resulting in passive sharing, while active sharing by offering food or after requesting it occurred only rarely. However, <b>orang-utans</b> differed from chimpanzees in several aspects. Because the food was mostly monopolized by the adult male, <b>orang-utans</b> attempted to initiate food transfers more frequently, resisted more to taking attempts, and were less likely to transfer whole food items. In both species, requests were less likely to result in food transfers, indicating that in situations involving access to food, they do not necessarily respond to ‘signals of need’. We argue that in addition to instances of active sharing, other factors such as the degree of food monopolization, response rates to ‘signals of need’, and {{the quality and quantity of}} transferred food need to be considered to gain a more detailed picture of prosociality across species...|$|R
