40|$|Abstract. SORBITOLDEHYDROGENASE (SDH, EC 1. 1. 1. 14) catalyses the interconversion of polyols and ketoses (e. g. {{sorbitol}} $ fructose). Using {{two independent}} Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)

Sorbitol content increased in both wild-type (WT) and mutant plant leaves during drought stress, but mutants showed a dramatically different phenotype, dying even if rewatered. The lack of functional SDH in mutant plants was accompanied by accumulation of foliar sorbitol and at least 10 -fold more ribitol, neither of which decreased in mutant plants after rewatering. In addition, mutant plants were uniquely sensitive to ribitol in a concentration-dependent manner, which either prevented them from completing seed germination or inhibited seedling development, effects not observed with <b>other</b> <b>polyols</b> or with ribitol-treated WT plants. Ribitol catabolism may occur solely through SDH in A. thaliana, though at only 30 % the rate of that for sorbitol.

40|$|Natural-abundance {{high-resolution}} 13 C NMR spectra (linewidth, 10 Hz) of the hyphal fungus Aspergillus nidulans {{have been}} obtained after growth on glycolytic or gluconeogenic carbon sources. Various polyols, some tricarboxylic acid-cycle intermediates and amino acids, and some phospholipids and fatty acyl compounds are present. The polyols found are mannitol, arabitol, erythritol, and glycerol. The nature of the carbon source has a pronounced effect on the pool sizes of the various polyols. All are present when the fungus is grown on sucrose or sucrose/acetate under strongly aerobic conditions. When grown on acetate, both arabitol and glycerol levels are low, whereas on glycerol erythritol is also hardly detectable. The effect of oxygen is most outspoken in glycolytically grown cultures. Limited oxygenation leads to low levels of arabitol and glycerol. Strong oxygenation changes the ratio of erythritol to mannitol, favoring the C 4 polyol. An increase in oxygen supply leads to (i) stimulation of the fluxes through the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis, (ii) an overflow of reduced metabolites both at the pentose phosphate pathway level (erythritol and arabitol) and at the C 3 level of the glycolytic pathway (glycerol), and (iii) the usual accumulation of mannitol. Upon starvation, glycerol, the <b>other</b> three <b>polyols,</b> and the tricarboxylic acid-cycle intermediates and their associated amino acids disappear in this order.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{codling moth}} (Cydia pomonella) {{is a major}} insect pest of apples worldwide. Fully grown last instar larvae overwinter in {{diapause}} state. Their overwintering strategies and physiological principles of cold tolerance have been insufficiently studied. No elaborate analysis of overwintering physiology is available for European populations. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We observed that codling moth larvae of a Central European population prefer to overwinter in the microhabitat of litter layer near the base of trees. Reliance on extensive supercooling, or freeze-avoidance, appears as their major strategy for survival of the winter cold. The supercooling point decreases from approximately - 15. 3 °C during summer to - 26. 3 °C during winter. Seasonal extension of supercooling capacity is assisted by partial dehydration, increasing osmolality of body fluids, and the accumulation of a complex mixture of winter specific metabolites. Glycogen and glutamine reserves are depleted, while fructose, alanine and some <b>other</b> sugars, <b>polyols</b> and free amino acids are accumulated during winter. The concentrations of trehalose and proline remain high and relatively constant throughout the season, and {{may contribute to the}} stabilization of proteins and membranes at subzero temperatures. In addition to supercooling, overwintering larvae acquire considerable capacity to survive at subzero temperatures, down to - 15 °C, even in partially frozen state. CONCLUSION: Our detailed laboratory analysis of cold tolerance, and whole-winter survival assays in semi-natural conditions, suggest that the average winter cold does not represent a major threat for codling moth populations. More than 83 % of larvae survived over winter in the field and pupated in spring irrespective of the overwintering microhabitat (cold-exposed tree trunk or temperature-buffered litter layer) ...|$|R
