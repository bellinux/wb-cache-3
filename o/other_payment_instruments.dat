Moreover, I show that removing transactions demand from aggregate consumer credit can alter conclusions about the relationship between credit and consumption. ...|$|E

However, the conditions under which the <b>other</b> <b>payment</b> <b>instruments</b> are used in each European country remain disparate. To date, each country has its own legal framework and technical standards.

40|$|The authors present key {{insights}} from the Bank of Canada's 2009 Methods-of-Payment survey. In the survey, about 6, 800 participants completed a questionnaire with detailed information regarding their personal finances, {{as well as}} their use and perceptions of different payment methods. In addition, about 3, 500 participants completed a 3 -day diary recording information on each transaction, including the value and the <b>payment</b> <b>instrument</b> chosen. One of the main findings from the diaries is that, even though debit and credit cards account for close to 80 per cent of all transactions in terms of total value, cash is still the predominant payment method in terms of volume, accounting for 54 per cent of all transactions. Using the payment records from the diaries, the authors estimate a simple model of choice between cash and <b>other</b> <b>payment</b> methods. The results suggest that the main reasons why cash is still a popular <b>payment</b> <b>instrument</b> in Canada, especially for small-value transactions, are its wide acceptance among merchants, high ease of use or speed, low handling costs, simplicity as a tool to control spending, and anonymity...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Reserve Financial Services Strategic Plan for 2012 - 2016 {{specifies}} five main {{policy goals}} {{for the next few}} years. The second of its goals is to "Maintain public confidence in the end-to-end safety and security of clearing and settlement systems. " Indeed, in each annual Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC), respondents consistently rank security as the most important characteristic of payment methods. However, in regressions of consumer payment use, security is not as significant as <b>other</b> <b>payment</b> attributes, such as cost, convenience, or record keeping. We analyze that puzzle by looking closely at how consumers' assessments of payment method security relate to their actual payment behavior, including testing whether consumers are more likely to use payment methods they consider more secure. Econometric results show that concerns about security create an obstacle to the adoption of some of the bank account-based payments - debit cards, online banking bill pay, and bank account number payments - but once adopted, there is no significant effect of security rating on the use of those <b>payment</b> <b>instruments.</b> The reverse is found for more established payment methods - cash, checks, and credit cards: consumers' perception of security does not influence adoption, but it does affect their actual payment use. Policy simulation results show that security improvements applied to individual <b>payment</b> <b>instruments</b> would increase the adoption of some payments, but once those <b>payment</b> <b>instruments</b> were adopted, security improvements would have only a small effect on the use of those payments...|$|R

However, many questions remain regarding patterns of debit card use, consumer preferences when using debit, and how consumers might respond to explicit pricing of card transactions.

In addition, consumers ’ stated reasons for using debit cards are used to analyze how consumers substitute between debit and <b>other</b> <b>payment</b> <b>instruments.</b> We also examine the relationship between household financial conditions and payment choice. Finally, we use a key variable on bank-imposed transaction fees to analyze price sensitivity of card use, and find a 12 percent decline in overall use in reaction to a mean 1. 8 percent fee charged on certain debit card transactions; we believe this represents the first microeconomic evidence in the U.

40|$|The {{substitution}} of noncash (check, giro, and credit and debit card) payments for cash transactions {{is difficult to}} gauge {{because there are no}} data series on the actual value or volume of cash transactions in any country. However, determining the degree of cash substitution is important because it will negatively affect government seigniorage revenue and, if cash use falls fast enough, may require tax revenues to redeem excess currency holdings. We utilise a novel method for approximating the volume of cash transactions using public information on currency stocks and noncash payments. Applying this method, we estimate how cash has been substituted by <b>other</b> <b>payment</b> <b>instruments</b> in 10 European countries. We also provide a forecast of future cash use by country. We find that the trend in cash substitution across countries is quite similar. However, the countries themselves are at significantly different stages of this substitution process. The spread of debit and credit card payments has been the key factor behind the substitution away from cash as use of e-cash innovation is still in its infancy. Country-specific differences in the substitution process are largely explained by differences in the level of implementation of each country’s card payment technology. cash substitution; learning curves; seigniorage...|$|E
