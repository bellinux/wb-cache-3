60|$|I was for {{the first}} time really vexed. I went to the nearest drawer and pulled it out sharply. It stuck as it had before, leaving a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> unopened. By working it, however, I {{discovered}} that it was impeded by some obstacle that had slipped to the upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawer,</b> and held it firmly fast. Inserting my hand, I pulled out the impeding object. It was the missing cigar case! I turned to him with a cry of joy.|$|E

50|$|During this period, {{beginning}} with {{the middle and upper}} classes, hose became longer and more fitting, and they reached above the knees. Previously, they were looser and worn with drawers that ranged from knee- to ankle-length. <b>The</b> new type <b>of</b> hose was worn with <b>drawers</b> that reached <b>the</b> knees or above, and they were wide enough at the top to allow <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> to be tucked into them.

50|$|A writing table (French bureau plat) has {{a series}} <b>of</b> <b>drawers</b> {{directly}} under <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, to contain writing implements, {{so that it}} {{may serve as a}} desk.

40|$|Nuclear {{materials}} inventory-verification {{techniques for}} large split-table fast critical assemblies are being studied in this program. Emphasis {{has been given}} to techniques that minimize fuel handling in order to reduce facility downtime and radiation exposure to the inventory team. The techniques studied include drawer seals, autoradiography, and spectral index measurements. Two-drawer sealing techniques have been studied, and the relative strengths and weaknesses are pointed out. The rod-type locking mechanism would not disrupt the reactor cooling air flow or interfere with autoradiography but is more expensive to implement. Passive autoradiography was used in a ZPPR inventory to verify to a 93 % confidence level that less than 8 -kg plutonium was missing. The inventory was completed in four days by a five-member team with radiation exposures well within acceptable limits. Two autoradiographic film packages were developed to distinguish HEU from a DU matrix. The 30 -mil pack requires an exposure between 4 and 16 hours and fits into most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawers.</b> <b>The</b> 40 -mil pack requires only a two-hour exposure but fits into less than half <b>the</b> <b>drawers...</b>|$|R

6000|$|... 11. The box {{behind which}} the Automaton is placed, is {{precisely}} three feet six inches long, two feet four inches deep, and two feet six inches high. These dimensions are fully {{sufficient for the}} accommodation of a man very much above the common size--and the main compartment alone is capable of holding any ordinary man in the position we have mentioned as assumed by the person concealed. As these are facts, which any one who doubts them may prove by actual calculation, we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon them. We will only suggest that, although {{the top of the}} box is apparently a board of about three inches in thickness, the spectator may satisfy himself by stooping and looking up at it when the main compartment is open, that it is in reality very thin. The height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> also will be misconceived by those who examine it in a cursory manner. There is a space of about three inches between the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> as seen from the exterior, and the bottom of the cupboard--a space which must be included in the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawer.</b> These contrivances to make the room within the box appear less than it actually is, are referrible to a design {{on the part of the}} inventor, to impress the company again with a false idea, viz. that no human being can be accommodated within the box.|$|E
30|$|Inside the hospital, stents first {{enter the}} {{incoming}} goods department (first visual inspection), then enter central storage (second intensive inspection), then enter within-hospital package/delivery and finally reach the angio suite’s inventory {{where they are}} again finally checked before implementation. Given that stents can be considered specialised—almost custom fit—medical items, a direct delivery to <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> usage was considered smoother. All previous inspections were considered NVA waste and could be eliminated. <b>The</b> architectural position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angio suites inside the hospital was considered given. <b>The</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inventory rooms inside the angio suites and <b>the</b> arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> were considered useful and ergonomic.|$|R

40|$|A {{cognitive}} map is a representative expression of an individual's {{cognitive map}} knowledge, where cognitive map knowledge is an individual's {{knowledge about the}} spatial and environmental relations of geographic space.

This map can be analyzed using classification schemes or quantitatively using spatial statistics. <b>The</b> drawing <b>of</b> a cognitive map is supplemented by a range of other measures designed to measure various aspects of cognitive map knowledge, including distance and direction tasks and more recently brain scans. These measures are important because they reveal fundamental aspects of cognition and reveal the cognitive processes that underlie spatial decision and choice making...|$|R
40|$|Curated by Day+Gluckman, group show Finding, collecting, selecting, editing, eradicating, revealing, transforming. Artists are {{infinitely}} resourceful, finding {{materials and}} ideas from wide ranging sources to produce individual and unique works. The artists {{in this exhibition}} share a process of using 'found', or everyday objects, creating a visceral response to their surroundings and {{the world in which}} we live. This transformation can be seen as a kind of alchemical moment: when something seemingly redundant or unremarkable takes on a surprising new identity. From the clinical to the domestic, Judith Cowan exhibits Melancholia Exists, a contemplative work that uses a battered old chest of drawerss as both plinth and vessel. <b>The</b> poignancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> partially open, perhaps revealing hidden secrets and <b>the</b> menace <b>of</b> rope, coiled within a pristine neon structure, hints at <b>the</b> internal workings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human psyche...|$|R
