25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face),</b> <b>and</b> holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who would later become better known for portraying Denny Duquette in medical drama Grey's Anatomy and as The Comedian in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, strongly disliked portraying a Xindi Reptilian in [...] "Carpenter Street". He later explained to Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I had to pay my bills. I knew I'd play some guy saying some stuff. Then I got a call saying I needed to go in for a prosthetic fitting. I remember them dripping goop <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> I had straws sticking out of my nose. I couldn't eat lunch. I was claustrophobic. I'd go home in tears. This was the job that made me want to quit acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Scott Speedman, {{the actor}} who portrays Michael in the franchise, about how his [...] "personal lack of gun {{knowledge}} worked in his favor"; [...] "I get to carry a gun once in the movie and I didn't know what I was doing, and that was appropriate. I'm the [...] "girlfriend". Every time I've got this shocked look <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> she throws me to the ground. I'm screaming in terror. When I was watching it I was like, [...] "Wow, how weird." [...] I'm fine with it. I'm glad I didn't {{have to know what}} I was doing with guns. That was easy for me".|$|E

60|$|Indeed, {{the strong}} odor of cat was very pronounced; and that, without the big fresh tracks, made the skin <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> tighten <b>and</b> chill. As we turned a jutting {{point in the}} wall, a number of animals, which I did not recognize, plunged helter-skelter down the canyon slope.|$|R
60|$|The instant {{this was}} decided {{a wave of}} emotion--love, regret, bitterness, anger--surged over me, making me shake. I felt the skin <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> tighten <b>and</b> chill. I grasped her with {{strength}} that might have need to hold a plunging, unruly horse. I hurt her. I held her as in a vise.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{comments}} made by Cain regarding Muslims have caused controversy. He {{said that he was}} [...] "uncomfortable" [...] when he found that the surgeon operating on his liver and colon cancer was a Muslim. [...] He later explained: [...] "based upon the little knowledge that I have of the Muslim religion, you know, they have an objective to convert all infidels or kill them". He has also spoken of his distrust of another Doctor when his name [...] "sounded too foreign", telling the audience at a Biblically themed amusement park [...] "My mind immediately started thinking, wait a minute, maybe his religious persuasion is different than mine! She [...] could see the look <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> she said, 'Don't worry, Mr. Cain, he's a Christian from Lebanon'. Hallelujah! Thank God!" ...|$|E

Wot {{do you suppose}} I have a three-days' growth of bristly beard <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> for, <b>and</b> a cap with flaps? Give me the oil, quick, and let me grease the bit, so I won't wake up your mamma, who is lying down with a headache, and left you in charge of Felicia who has been faithless to her trust." ...|$|R
60|$|The Houyhnhnms, {{who came}} to visit my master out of a design of seeing and talking with me, could hardly believe {{me to be a}} right Yahoo, because my body had a {{different}} covering from others of my kind. They were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head, <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> hands; but I discovered that secret to my master upon an accident which happened about a fortnight before.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how did you}} {{discover}} me?" [...] resumed Cheenbuk. [...] "I not only spoke with a deeper voice, but I put black and oil <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> pulled my hood well forward." ...|$|E
60|$|And when {{it struck}} me--oh, I was so frightened. I thought {{it must be}} written <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> {{everyone}} must see. I knew it was wrong. I knew I mustn't. I couldn't help myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Child, {{you have}} {{followed}} me far," [...] said the Queen, [...] "and {{now you are}} rewarded, for you have looked <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> I have refreshed you; and the Sun, my father, will never more hurt you for my sake." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the moment}} I shrank from speaking, perceiving what a sad blow to Mr. Carvel my words must be. And then I spoke up boldly, {{catching}} the exulting sneer <b>on</b> <b>my</b> Uncle Grafton's <b>face</b> <b>and</b> the note of triumph reflected in Mr. Allen's.|$|R
5000|$|Hayes {{claims to}} have become a comedian and a Christian at {{more or less the}} same time, at the age of 11: [...] "My mother put me in church plays and one time I just went up on a line and to cover I went into a Judy Holliday impression. There was stunned silence until the {{minister}} burst out laughing, and I looked and I saw the pride <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mother's <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> I told her I was ready to accept Christ and I was baptised." ...|$|R
60|$|I started forward restlessly. I did {{not need}} my sight to pace the poop of my ill-starred first command with perfect assurance. Every square foot of her decks was {{impressed}} indelibly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> brain, to the very grain and knots of the planks. Yet, all of a sudden, I fell clean over something, landing full length <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hands <b>and</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "'But time traced furrows <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> I grew silver hair'd, [...] For locks of brown, {{and cheeks}} of youth, she left this brow and beard; [...] Once rich, {{but now a}} palmer poor, I tread life's latest stage, [...] And mingle with your bridal mirth the lay of frozen age.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Here I often laid for hours, {{covered with}} a gauze-like veil of tappa, while Fayaway, seated beside me, and holding in her hand a fan woven from the {{leaflets}} of a young cocoa-nut bough, brushed aside the insects that occasionally lighted <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> Kory-Kory, {{with a view of}} chasing away my melancholy, performed a thousand antics in the water before us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, see or not see, we will go, Luka. If {{we are to}} {{be killed}} it shall be making a fight for it, and not having our throats cut like sheep. Now, I think you are more {{accustomed}} to chewing tough food than I am, so I will roll over <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> do you set to work and bite through the thong." ...|$|E
6000|$|I rode home very soberly. When I reached The Maples I {{did what}} I {{had not done}} for years...looked {{critically}} {{at myself in the}} mirror. The realization that I had grown older came home to me with a new and unpleasant force. There were marked lines <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lean <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> silver glints in the dark hair over my temples. When Betty was ten she had thought me [...] "an old person." [...] Now, at eighteen, she probably thought me a veritable ancient of days. Pshaw, what did it matter? And yet...I thought of her as I had seen her, standing under the pines, and something cold and painful laid its hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> heart.|$|R
60|$|The {{next time}} {{he came to see}} me, I was lying betwixt sleep and waking, my eyes wide open in the darkness, the {{sickness}} quite departed, but succeeded by a horrid giddiness and swimming that was almost worse to bear. I ached, besides, in every limb, and the cords that bound me seemed to be of fire. The smell of the hole in which I lay seemed to have become a part of me; and during the long interval since his last visit I had suffered tortures of fear, now from the scurrying of the ship's rats, that sometimes pattered <b>on</b> <b>my</b> very <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> now from the dismal imaginings that haunt the bed of fever.|$|R
6000|$|Scarce had I ceased when from a {{tamarisk}} near [...] Two Proctors leapt upon us, crying, 'Names:' [...] He, standing still, was clutched; but I began [...] To thrid the musky-circled mazes, wind [...] And {{double in}} and out the boles, and race [...] By all the fountains: fleet I was of foot: [...] Before me showered the rose in flakes; behind [...] I heard the puffed pursuer; at mine ear [...] Bubbled the nightingale and heeded not, [...] And secret laughter tickled all my soul. [...] At last I hooked my ankle in a vine, [...] That claspt the feet of a Mnemosyne, [...] <b>And</b> falling <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> was caught <b>and</b> known.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she took}} {{scissors}} from her tiring-table, and, bidding me be seated, she cut off my locks, clipping the hair {{close to the}} head. Next she found stains of such sort as women use to make dark the eyes, and mixed them cunningly, rubbing the stuff <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> hands and on the white mark in my hair where the sword of Brennus had bitten to the bone.|$|E
60|$|Feet swayed about me, {{and some}} hobnailed miner kicked my ankle and went stumbling. There were shouts and curses, and then {{everything}} had swept past me. I rolled over <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> beheld the chauffeur, young Verrall, and Lord Redcar--the latter holding up his long skirts of fur, and making a grotesque figure--one behind the other, in full bolt across a coldly comet-lit interval, towards the open gates of the colliery.|$|E
6000|$|And thus, {{with words}} few enough, but great delight, the minutes went past, till {{she lifted her}} wet face and her {{fragrant}} hair; and between laughing and crying, studied <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> caressed me, touching my thin cheek, and wept and laughed again. [...] "I was mad," [...] she whispered; [...] "it seemed as if a devil entered into me. But She spoke to me and cast him out, and she bade me repent." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryan Forbes as Marsh: Forbes had {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} supporting roles in films, including The Small Back Room (1949), An Inspector Calls (1954) and The Colditz Story (1955). However he later became better known as a director, with films such as Whistle Down the Wind (1961), The L-Shaped Room (1962) and The Stepford Wives (1975) among his best-known credits. Forbes later recalled of the film: “I {{was one of the people}} attacked by the alien pods. This pod exploded and I ended up with what was supposed to be a terrible alien growth <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> Come lunchtime <b>and</b> we all went off to the pub. Of course, I couldn't take this stuff off, the makeup was too complex; the landlord refused to serve me.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It's a {{survival}} thing. I {{made a lot}} of devil's bargains and I stuck to them. As a result, I live somewhat dangerously, and quite comfortably. My mother, who no longer recognizes me, has the best room at the clinic. I get up every morning, put <b>on</b> <b>my</b> game <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> do what I have to... We've spent so much time and money on you, you're so pivotal to the coming cataclysm, that I sometimes forget how dense you can be. The game face, the one I worked so hard to get, I became that years ago. Just like you've become simpering and good from yours. You're the new poster boy for human? Thank you very much, I don't want it... You think you can awaken some buried spark of decency in me? Is that the way you [...] "help your helpless"? I'm not helpless. I'm glad you came along, because I was sitting here -- [...] "what's it all about?" [...] -- and now I know. It is all about making the rest of your eternal life miserable." ...|$|R
5000|$|I was {{overcome}} by the mighty fulness of power and went down under it. For three hours He wrought wonderfully in me. My body was worked in sections, a section at a time. And even the skin <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> was jerked <b>and</b> shaken, and finally I felt my lower jaw begin to quiver in a strange way. This continued for some little time, when finally my throat began to enlarge and I felt my vocal organs being, as it were, drawn into a different shape. O how strange and wonderful it was! and how blessed {{it was to be}} thus in the hands of God. And last of all I felt my tongue begin to move and my lips to produce strange sounds which did not originate in my mind.|$|R
60|$|I {{was spared}} {{the trouble of}} answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me {{to the top of}} the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.|$|E
6000|$|Still, {{now that}} my life is over, I am glad to have lived, glad to have known the dear breath of woman's love, and that true {{friendship}} which can even surpass the love of woman, glad to have heard the laughter of little children, to have seen {{the sun and the}} moon and the stars, to have felt the kiss of the salt sea <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> watched the wild game trek down to the water in the moonlight. But I should not wish to live again! ...|$|E
60|$|I woke with {{a feeling}} as though the blessed rain were falling <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> head. Slowly, and with great difficulty, I opened my eyes, then shut them again, having seen a vision. For a space I lay thus, while the rain {{continued}} to fall; I saw now that I must be asleep, or off my head with thirst and fever. If I were not off my head how came I to imagine that a lovely dark-eyed girl was bending over me sprinkling water on my face? A white girl, too, not a Kaffir woman. However, the dream went on.|$|E
60|$|Just as I am intently {{watching}} to see how my hatless little Waterton will deal with his serpent, a startling bark, following by a canine shriek, then a yell, resound through the silent garden; and over the lawn rush those three demoniacal fox-terriers, Snap, Puzzy, and Babs, all determined to catch something. Away fly the birds, and though now high overhead, the baffled brutes continue wildly careering about the grounds, vexing the air with their frantic barkings. No more birds to-day! But now the peace-breakers have discovered me, and come tearing across the lawn, {{and on to the}} half-way chair, then to the hammock, scrambling over each other to inflict their unwelcome caresses <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hands <b>and</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{knew not}} what {{happened}} till I found myself groping my way up the winding stair. Here, {{in comparison with the}} solid darkness of the crypt, it seemed almost light. The dim expanse of the church sent a few straggling rays down the vaulted steps, and as I could see, be it never so dimly, I felt I was not in absolute darkness. With the light came a sense of power and fresh courage, and I groped my way back into the crypt again. There, by now and again lighting matches, I found my way to the tomb and recovered my lantern. Then I took my way slowly--for I wished to prove, if not my own courage, at least such vestiges of self-respect as the venture had left me--through the church, where I extinguished my lantern, and out through the great door into the open sunlight. I seemed to have heard, both {{in the darkness of the}} crypt and through the dimness of the church, mysterious sounds as of whispers and suppressed breathing; but the memory of these did not count for much when once I was free. I was only satisfied of my own consciousness and identity when I found myself on the broad rock terrace in front of the church, with the fierce sunlight beating <b>on</b> <b>my</b> upturned <b>face,</b> <b>and,</b> looking downward, saw far below me the rippled blue of the open sea.|$|R
5000|$|Pauline {{was a sort}} of Mrs. Miniver {{on camera}} and off. She never turned a hair when we arrived at her house with 25 muddy extras in German uniform. She cooked vast amounts of stew, found {{everyone}} places to sleep and still found time to play her own part... Her nursing experience proved invaluable during the film - we even made her character a nurse....We realised we had that rarest of creatures, a natural actress.... Towards the end of the film, when she found herself playing opposite seasoned professionals like Sebastian Shawand Fiona Leland, she wrote to me after seeing the rushes; [...] "Sebastian and Fiona seemed alive, real people and I look like a vicious moron. If we hadn't got so far, I'd say get someone else. I honestly feel the lack of expression <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> is disastrous <b>and</b> could ruin the whole thing for you."Fortunately, we could see what she couldn't - that in her restraint lay her strength. For Pauline Murray was the film. And as it depended on her performance, so we all grew to depend on her. Brownlow [...] After her part in It Happened Here, Murray never acted in film again, but she continued to appear in village plays.|$|R
