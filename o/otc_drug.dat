2500|$|Synephrine, or, more specifically, p-synephrine, is an alkaloid, {{occurring}} {{naturally in}} some plants and animals, {{and also in}} approved drugs products as its m-substituted analog known as neo-synephrine. p-Synephrine (or formerly Sympatol and oxedrine [...] ) and m-synephrine {{are known for their}} longer acting adrenergic effects compared to norepinephrine. This substance is present at very low concentrations in common foodstuffs such as orange juice and other orange (Citrus species) products, both of the [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "bitter" [...] variety. The preparations used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), also known as Zhi Shi, are the immature and dried whole oranges from Citrus aurantium (Fructus Aurantii Immaturus). Extracts of the same material or purified synephrine are also marketed in the US, sometimes in combination with caffeine, as a weight-loss-promoting dietary supplement for oral consumption. While the traditional preparations have been in use for millennia as a component of TCM-formulas, synephrine itself is not an approved <b>OTC</b> <b>drug.</b> As a pharmaceutical, m-synephrine is still used as a sympathomimetic (i.e. for its hypertensive and vasoconstrictor properties), mostly by injection for the treatment of emergencies such as shock, and rarely orally for the treatment of bronchial problems associated with asthma and hay-fever.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In Germany, {{over-the-counter}} (<b>OTC)</b> <b>drugs</b> {{are normally}} reimbursed {{up to the}} age of 12  years only. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse prices of over-the-counter drugs used by adolescents in Germany and their association with socioeconomic factors. Methods Based on the German GINIplus and LISAplus birth cohorts, data on drug utilization among 15 -year-old adolescents (n[*]=[*] 4677) were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The reported drugs were subdivided into prescription <b>drugs</b> and <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs.</b> The drugs’ prices were tracked by the pharmaceutical identification numbers. Results Overall, 1499 <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs</b> with clearly identifiable prices were eligible for analysis. Their mean price was € 9. 75 (95 % confidence interval: € 9. 27 – 10. 22). About 75 % of the <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs</b> cost less than € 10. Higher mean prices were associated with residing in Munich (€ 10. 74; 95 % confidence interval: € 9. 97 – 11. 52) and with higher paternal education (e. g. highest education level: € 10. 17; 95 % confidence interval: € 9. 47 – 10. 86). Adolescents residing in Munich (in comparison with the less wealthy region of Wesel) and adolescents with higher educated fathers were also significantly more likely to use <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs</b> costing ≥ € 10 or ≥ € 25, respectively. Conclusions The price of € 10 for non-reimbursable <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs</b> may represent a (psychological) threshold. Higher prices could discourage especially adolescents from a lower socioeconomic background from taking medically advisable but non-reimbursable <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: During {{the last}} few years there has been a {{considerable}} value growth in the demand for the so-called over-the-counter <b>drugs</b> (<b>OTC,</b> available without doctor’s prescription). Using <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs</b> is related to self-treatment, aimed at mitigating first symptoms of a cold, flu, or various types of pain. The omnipresent advertisements for <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs</b> encourage and contribute to the elevated demand. Unfortunately, the marketing techniques used in advertisements fail to provide reliable and objective information to the viewers about specific products. Aim of the research: To determine the respondents’ opinions on using <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs</b> and to assess how advertisements influence the consumers’ needs. Material and methods : The study was conducted by means of a diagnostic survey using a questionnaire. For the purpose of the study, the authors prepared a survey questionnaire, which was used as a research tool. The study included 114 respondents, falling within an age bracket of 18 – 66 years. Results : The most frequently used <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs</b> were painkillers and medicines for cold and flu symptoms (68. 33 % of women and 59. 09 % of men). The drugs were usually bought in pharmacies and grocery/convenience stores. Conclusions: Taking <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs</b> is a widespread phenomenon, both in women and men. The obtained results clearly indicate that advertisements have a considerable impact upon target groups and contribute to increased consumption of <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R

The amended law permitted stores to sell certain over-the-counter drugs without having a pharmacist on staff, opening up the market to convenience stores, supermarkets, and other such stores. 7-Eleven was the first convenience store {{to take advantage of}} the amended law, while Aeon supermarkets also began selling <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs</b> at a 20% to 40% discount to competing drug stores (including Aeon-affiliated companies). The amendment was expected to put significant competitive pressure on drug stores. However, the law continued to ban internet sales of <b>OTC</b> <b>drugs,</b> which the Ministry of Health had previously justified by stating that drug sales should only be conducted in person by pharmacists or other qualified vendors who could explain the side effects of the drugs.|$|R

50|$|Both methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are illicitly trafficked {{and sold}} owing to their {{potential}} for recreational use. The highest prevalence of illegal methamphetamine use occurs in parts of Asia, Oceania, and in the United States, where racemic methamphetamine, levomethamphetamine, and dextromethamphetamine are classified as schedule II controlled substances. Levomethamphetamine is available as an over-the-counter (<b>OTC)</b> <b>drug</b> for use as an inhaled nasal decongestant in the United States. Internationally, the production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or banned in many countries, due to its placement in schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty. While dextromethamphetamine is a more potent drug, racemic methamphetamine is sometimes illicitly produced due to the relative ease of synthesis and limited availability of chemical precursors.|$|E

According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, there were nearly 12,000 cases of hand sanitizer ingestion in 2006. If ingested, alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause alcohol poisoning in small children. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends using hand sanitizer with children to promote good hygiene, under supervision, and furthermore recommends parents pack hand sanitizer for their children when traveling, to avoid their contracting disease from dirty hands.|$|E
