5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E

5|$|At the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century {{most of the}} European {{settlements}} {{were related}} to the fur trade. The largest of these settlements were trading posts established by the North West Company, particularly those at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, and Fond du Lac. Historian Grace Lee Nute has documented over 100 fur trading posts of varying sizes in the Minnesota area before statehood. Most of these posts were eventually taken over by the American Fur Company. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered the United States by way of the Red River Valley, instead of moving to eastern Canada or returning to Europe, adding to the Minnesota region's population.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2006 season, Sanchez {{competed for}} the {{starting}} quarterback position; once Booty, a junior, suffered severe back spasms caused by a pre-existing back condition, surgery was required and Sanchez was promoted to run the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recovered. Coaches stated Booty would be considered {{the starting quarterback}} when he returned for fall practice. During the 2006 season, Sanchez saw limited playing time in games against Arkansas, Stanford and Oregon. Through those three games, Sanchez completed 3 of his 7 pass attempts for 63 yards and one interception. He also saw additional action against Arizona, Michigan, and Notre Dame {{but he did not}} attempt a pass in those contests.|$|E

5|$|At the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility.

This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E

5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} at the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, but they {{were found to be}} unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E
