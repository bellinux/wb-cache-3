5|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} samarium {{and its compounds}} is as catalyst and chemical reagent. Samarium catalysts assist decomposition <b>of</b> <b>plastics,</b> dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {{as well as the}} dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate (Sm(OTf)3, that is Sm(CF3SO3)3), {{is one of the most}} efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis, for example in the desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton Taxol total syntheses; strychnine total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.|$|E

30|$|Figure  3 is a {{geometric}} {{illustration of}} the state <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse. In what follows, {{it is assumed that}} the increase in the loading parameters does not lead to unloading. It is convenient to divide curve 1 into three segments, namely qk, ks and sw. If the initiation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> yielding occurs at some point of the segment qk, then the only possible mechanism <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse is localization <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation at ρ[*]=[*]a. In Figure  3, this mechanism <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse corresponds to a point of the line tk. If the initiation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> yielding occurs at some point of the segment sw, then the only possible mechanism <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse is the fully plastic disk. In Figure  3, this mechanism <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse corresponds to a point of the curve sd. Finally, if the initiation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> yielding occurs at some point of the segment ks, then either mechanism <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> collapse is possible. Moreover, both mechanisms occur simultaneously if the values of the loading parameters correspond to point f. A special feature of the solution corresponding to point k is that the plastic collapse occurs by strain localization when the entire disk is elastic (except the line ρ[*]=[*]a). A special feature of the solution corresponding to point s is that the entire disk becomes plastic at the values of the loading parameters corresponding to the initiation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> yielding.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{two major}} sections: {{an assessment of}} the incidence <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> particles at sea and in seabirds {Chapters 1 - 3), and an investigation of the postulated effects <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> ingestion on seabirds (Chapters 4 - 7). The incidence <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> at sea was recorded from neuston trawls performed monthly at 120 sampling stations off the southwestern Cape, South Africa, during 1977 - 78. The types <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> particles collected are described, and the temporal and spatial distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> pollution are discussed. Ingested plastic was recorded from 36 of 60 seabird species sampled. The effect of different sampling techniques on the incidence <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> is discussed. The frequencies <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> colour-types in birds are compared with those of particles collected at sea in neuston trawls. Pale particles were under-represented in all species, but the disparity was less for small than for large species, which may account for the higher incidence <b>of</b> ingested <b>plastic</b> in small than in large species...|$|R

5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types <b>of</b> <b>plastics</b> are {{commonly}} welded materials. Unlike metals, {{which have a}} specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The real values <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> {{properties}} <b>of</b> {{steel sheets}} are basic input parameters for objectification of deep drawing technological processes. The loss <b>of</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> properties is the criterion <b>of</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> properties <b>of</b> steel sheets in most cases. The loss <b>of</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> properties depends on stress-strain scheme in real conditions of deep drawing of sheets. In the contribution will be evaluated the loss <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> properties stability <b>of</b> thin double reduced packaging sheets made from low carbon steels. For evaluation <b>of</b> strength and <b>plastic</b> properties <b>of</b> thin packaging sheets is the tensile test most used at present. The material is stressed by uniaxial tension during this test. In {{the conditions of}} technological processes of drawing, which thin packaging sheets are mostly treating, is this way of stress not very objective. In most cases it deals about multiaxial stress of sheet by deformation of sheet to require draw cup. At the present, the biggest problem of thin steel sheets by uniaxial tension test evaluation is the loss <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation stability (localization <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation). Therefore, obtained results <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation during this test do not correspond with real <b>plastic</b> properties <b>of</b> thin steel sheets. In the contribution, will be compared the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> properties <b>of</b> these sheets by uniaxial and biaxial load. Biaxial load is unfavourable from stress point, but less sensitive on loss stability <b>of</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation from conditions test influence point...|$|R
5|$|Elemental {{chlorine}} is commercially {{produced from}} brine by electrolysis. The high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine {{led to the}} development of commercial bleaches and disinfectants, and a reagent for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, and many intermediates for the production <b>of</b> <b>plastics</b> and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.|$|E
5|$|Ingestion {{of plastic}} flotsam is another problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic in the seas has {{increased}} dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that {{should be used for}} food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion <b>of</b> <b>plastics</b> results in declining body weight and body condition. This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the direct cause of death, this plastic causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the chances of survival.|$|E

25|$|While {{containers}} {{are usually}} {{made from a}} single type and color of plastic, making them relatively easy to sort, a consumer product like a cellular phone may have many small parts consisting of over a dozen different types and colors <b>of</b> <b>plastics.</b> In such cases, the resources {{it would take to}} separate the plastics far exceed their value and the item is discarded. However, developments are taking place in the field of active disassembly, which may result in more product components being reused or recycled. Recycling certain types <b>of</b> <b>plastics</b> can be unprofitable as well. For example, polystyrene is rarely recycled because the process is usually not cost effective.
