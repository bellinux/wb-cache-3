40|$|This paper {{describes}} the safety improvements {{that were made}} to an 11 km long section of Class-I highway in Hexian county {{in the province of}} Anhui (chainage K 45 to chainage K 56) and summarizes the results of tests used to evaluate the likely changes in risk. Class-I highways mainly function as arterial highways with high design speeds (e. g. 80 km/h, 100 km/h) but have at-grade intersections and access points (that is, they are not accessed controlled). They typically have two lanes in each direction with a median. Following the occurrence of two deaths and four injuries on the road section during a four month period, conditions on the road were examined, including conducting a ChinaRAP assessment, and improvements were rapidly made. The improvements included speed management, adjustment of median <b>openings,</b> <b>installation</b> of protected turn lanes and delineation. In the 12 months after the improvements were made, no fatal or serious crashes occurred. Evaluations also show that there have been reductions in speed, improvements in the ChinaRAP risk scores and good acceptance of the changes by the local community...|$|R

40|$|This {{study of}} the American {{business}} presence in Russia from the late 19 th Century to the early Soviet period, focuses on more than twenty individual firms that operated there or otherwise conducted business with Russia. They are presented as primary and secondary case studies in three distinct groups: financial industries, manufacturing industries, and sales, services and light manufacturing industries. The primary cases, American Express, Case and Vacuum Oil Company, offer a detailed insight into: motives for <b>opening</b> <b>installations</b> in Russia, daily operations, the effects of war, revolution and nationalization as well as business relations under the early Soviet government. The secondary case studies include, Citibank, Chase Manhattan Bank, Morgan Guaranty and New York Life Insurance Company in the financial group; Western Electric, Westinghouse Airbrake and General Electric in the manufacturing group; and United Shoe, Otis, Moline Plow, Kodak, Parke, Davis & Co., Chesebrough-Pond's and Continental Gin in the sales, services and light manufacturing group. Collectively these firms present a comprehensive account of the largely neglected and misunderstood role of private American business in Russia. The experiences of these companies help dispel conventional notions of U. S. commercial interests in Russia and place American involvement in proper perspective...|$|R

50|$|Sembach is {{the home}} of the United States Army's 230th Military Police Company, the 95th Military Police Battalion, 18th Military Police Brigade, the 30th Medical Command http://www.eur.army.mil/30thMEDCOM/, and the 786th Security Forces Squadron {{regional}} training center. Given additional downsizing by the U.S. Army, and Congressional demands for more base closings in Germany, Sembach will probably close soon. Although congress never reviewed or approved of this new Army base, the money being spent in its renovations will provide soldiers stationed in the area with adequate living conditions and reduce the need for soldiers to acquire housing on the economy in the surrounding area. The purpose of <b>opening</b> this <b>installation</b> is to facilitate the consolidation and closure of several other US Army posts throughout Germany.|$|R

The investment will be completed by 2019 and projects the additional construction of the power unit and development of the terminal for liquid chemicals in Police port. The terminal will make it possible to host ships with LPG. The propylene production will allow for <b>opening</b> new chemical <b>installations</b> in the upcoming years, enabling the Company to produce more technologically advanced plastics. The estimated value of the project is PLN 1.7 billion.|$|R
2500|$|During the reconstruction, {{there was}} vocal {{opposition}} {{from a number}} of nearby residents and companies, on a variety of issues. The main points of opposition were the noise levels of the park after <b>opening,</b> and the <b>installation</b> of a [...] tall steel roller coaster (to be named the Big Dipper after the original). The Environmental Protection Authority approved the construction of the new Big Dipper, on the condition that the Trust abided by strict noise control guidelines and covered the cost of soundproofing for any residents affected by excessive noise. In addition, North Sydney Council imposed a series of times when the roller coaster could not operate.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the history of}} the exploitation of geothermal waters in Uniejów. Interest in the use of geothermal waters in the area Uniejów began in the late 1960 s, when the parameters of water examined during the drilling of the well Koło IG- 3 were found to be satisfactory. The first hydrogeological well was drilled in Uniejów in 1978. The next two wells were drilled in the early 1990 s as part of a large project, which aimed at creation of two doublets and multi-variant use of geothermal waters in Uniejów. Unfortunately, the <b>opening</b> of geothermal <b>installations</b> had to wait until the year 2001. The article also describes the current development of geothermal energy and water in Uniejó...|$|R
40|$|Designing a {{rock bolt}} {{reinforcement}} system for underground excavation involves determining bolt pattern, spacing, and size. In this paper, a topology optimisation technique is presented and employed to simultaneously optimise these design variables. To improve rock bolt design, the proposed technique minimises a displacement based function around the <b>opening</b> after bolt <b>installation.</b> This optimisation technique {{is independent of}} the material model and can be easily applied to any material model for rock and bolts. It is also extremely flexible in {{that it can be}} applied to any mechanical analysis method. To illustrate the capabilities of this method, numerical examples with non-linear material models and discontinuities in the host rock are presented. It is shown that the complexity of systems optimised using this approach is only restricted by limitations of the method used to analyse mechanical system responses...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of concentration and emissions distribution of gases such as ammonia (NH 3) in agricultural installations is of growing importance {{due to its}} effect on health and productivity of animals and workers. The objective {{of this study was}} to use validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model as a tool to predict NH 3 concentration distribution and mass fluxes in a non-insulated broiler chicken installation with natural ventilation, typically found in subtropical and tropical contries. Results from this study indicated that simulation with CFD can be used to predict NH 3 concentration distribution and mass flux inside similar installations with incident winds from different directions of entrance at the lateral <b>opening</b> of the <b>installation.</b> The most direct application of the proposed mode would be to help improving the existing buildings and also to help in the conception of new ones, and may also apply the model to help in the development of NH 3 emission inventories...|$|R
40|$|OAK-B 135 University of Washington Lab Report to SNEAP, 1999. The NPL tandem Van de Graaff {{accelerator}} chains ran 1869 hours between 9 / 1 / 98 and 8 / 31 / 99. The DEIS ran 356 {{hours and}} the SpIS ran 667. There were 28 experiment-days {{in which the}} LINAC and tandem were used together and seven days when the tandem was used, {{with one of the}} external ion sources, as a tandem. Four of these were with light ions and three with heavy ions. There were 68 days of Tandem Terminal Ion Source (TIS) development or repair, and 46 days of TIS installation or removal or changing TIS ion species. The TIS/tandem was used a total of 70 days to deliver p, d, {sup 3 }He, or {sup 4 }He beams for use by an experimenter. There were 47 experiment-days during which the injector deck was used to generate C{sub 60 } or LiF{sub 3 } clusters, which were then investigated without further acceleration. They had 25 tank openings over the year. There were three scheduled <b>openings</b> for the <b>installation</b> or removal of the TIS, and seven to change the TIS ion species. There were 10 openings for {sup 4 }He ion source and column resistor gradient development. There were four openings for various repairs other than ion source, and one to replace the LE grid, which was found undamaged after all...|$|R
40|$|The Gulf of Mexico is {{considered}} one of the world's major marine ecosystems, supporting important fisheries and habitats such as barrier islands, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, coral reefs etc. It also hosts a range of complex offshore petroleum exploration, extraction, and refining industries, which may have chronic or acute impacts on ecosystem functioning. Previous work on the marine effects of this activity is geographically incomplete, and has tended to focus on direct hydrocarbon impacts, while impacts from other related contaminants (e. g. heavy metals, salt-rich drilling muds) which may be discharged from oil facilities have not been widely assessed. Here, we examine historical trace element accumulation in marine sediments collected from four sites in the Tamaulipas shelf, Gulf of Mexico, in the area of the Arenque oil field. Dated sediment cores were used to examine the sources, and historical and contemporary inputs, of trace metals (including those typically present in oil industry discharges) and their potential biological impact in the Tamaulipas aquatic environment over the last 100 years. CaO (i. e. biogenic component) normalized data showed increasing V, Cr, Zn, Cu, Pb, Zr and Ba towards the sediment surface in three of the four cores, with Ba and V (based on an adverse effect index) possibly associated with adverse effects on organisms. Dated Ba/CaO profiles show an increase of 30 – 137 % after <b>opening</b> of oil <b>installations</b> in the study area, and can be broadly correlated with increasing oil industry activities across the wider Gulf of Mexico. Data do not record however a clear enhancement of Ba concentration in sediment cores collected near to oil platforms over more distal cores, indicating that any Ba released from drilling platforms is incorporated quickly into the sediments around the drilling sites, and once this element has been deposited its rate of resuspension and mobility is low...|$|R
40|$|The OPCS {{report on}} cancer {{incidence}} and mortality {{in the vicinity}} of nuclear installations in England and Wales provides a mass of information that is so large that {{it should be possible to}} detect quite small changes in disease levels with considerable confidence. The data on cancer mortality are less subject to selective bias than the registration data on which incidence rates are based, and they provide the firmest grounds on which evidence of any effect can be obtained. These data show conclusively that there has been no general increase in cancer mortality {{in the vicinity of}} nuclear installations in a 22 -year period beginning several years after the <b>opening</b> of the <b>installations</b> that have released the largest amounts of radionuclides to the environment. On the contrary, the mortality from cancer has tended to be lower in the LAAs in the vicinity of nuclear installations than in control LAAs selected for their presumed comparability with the former. This is unlikely to be due to a protective effect of ionizing radiation and suggests that, despite the efforts that were made to choose comparable control areas, there were non-installation differences between the populations relevant to the risk of dying from one or other type of cancer. Detailed examination of the few types of cancer that were relatively more common in the installation areas suggest that several of the differences were most likely to be due to chance, diagnostic artefacts or social factors rather than to any hazard specifically related to the installations. One disease provides a possible exception: namely, leukaemia in the age group 0 - 24 years. Two other diseases need further investigation, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin's disease in the older age group 25 - 74 years. The excess mortality rates recorded from these cancers were not large, and it has yet to be established that they are not due to general confounding by other environmental or socio-economic factors...|$|R
