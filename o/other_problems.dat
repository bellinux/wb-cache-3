50|$|The series {{revolves}} around the lives of four couples and their trials and tribulations. When Sonia, Saba, Natasha and Rubina meet in a park every day, they share each <b>other’s</b> <b>problems</b> as they take their evening walk. Apart from recreation, {{this is a time}} when these women bare their souls to each other, console each other and in some cases even try to solve each <b>other’s</b> <b>problems</b> by lending a helping hand; this often leads to hilariously catastrophic results.|$|R

5|$|Bilis and its {{associated}} flooding left over 400,000people homeless, and over 2million more had to be evacuated {{in the face of}} rising waters. Following the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided food, blankets, and water purification kits to over 100,000 Hunan residents in mass evacuation shelters. The relief effort was complicated by an earthquake in Yunnan, as well as three more tropical cyclones: Typhoon Kaemi, Typhoon Prapiroon, and Typhoon Saomai. All of the storms were stronger than Bilis, and exacerbated flooding and <b>other</b> <b>problems</b> in the region.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>problems</b> {{faced by}} the ZNG {{included}} a shortage of trained officers, inadequate troop training, a shortage of weapons and especially a shortage of ammunition. Mobilisation proved particularly successful, however, and troops were plentiful; in Zagreb, approximately 80 percent of those called up in September and October reported for service. The ZNG were short of uniforms; 20 percent of those drafted in Zagreb during this period received uniforms, while the remainder fought in civilian clothes. The ZNG also relied on the civilian infrastructure for food, fuel and medical care.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps seen by Amerigo Vespucci in 1503, it {{was first}} {{formally}} described in 1839.

The enigmatic Trachylepis tschudii, supposedly from Peru, may well be the same species.|$|E

Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased {{as a function of}} time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as nitrogen narcosis and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression.|$|E

5|$|After {{the third}} volume, a new editor was {{assigned}} to the series. Kamiya noted the third volume contained a lot of plot progression, and was going to balance it out in the fourth volume with more lighthearted and carefree events.. Volumes four and five were written as a single volume; since volume four lacked a climatic ending, Kamiya had to restructure the story. This, along with communication problems with his new editor, and <b>other</b> <b>problems</b> in Kamiya's life caused a month delay in volume four's release. After completing volume five, Kamiya was asked to submit volume six's manuscript before 2014 for the anime adaptation, and to complete the volume before the anime's premiere.|$|E
