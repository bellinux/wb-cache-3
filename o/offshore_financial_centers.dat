5000|$|Offshore {{investment}} is the keeping {{of money in}} a jurisdiction other than one's country of residence. Offshore jurisdictions are a commonly accepted means of reducing the taxes levied in most countries to both large and small-scale investors alike. Poorly regulated offshore domiciles have served historically as havens for tax evasion, money laundering, or to conceal or protect illegally acquired money from law enforcement in the investor's country. However, the modern, well-regulated offshore centres allow legitimate investors {{to take advantage of}} higher rates of return or lower rates of tax on that return offered by operating via such domiciles. The advantage to offshore {{investment is}} that such operations are both legal and less costly than those offered in the investor's country - or [...] "onshore". Locations favored by investors for low rates of tax are known as <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centers</b> or (sometimes) tax havens.|$|E

5000|$|Antigua and Barbuda is {{advertised as}} [...] "an {{attractive}} offshore jurisdiction." [...] The country {{was the first}} to sign the United Nations' anti-money laundering act. This agreement came out of a conference in 1999 which urged worldwide <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centers</b> to introduce laws to tighten their policing of money laundering activities. The United Kingdom exerted considerable pressure on Antigua and Barbuda to reform laws to combat money laundering, even issuing an advisory in April 1999 to British financial institutions that Antigua and Barbuda's anti-money laundering laws were wanting. Antigua and Barbuda responded to this concern, and a subsequent joint United States and United Kingdom review reported they were satisfied that the country had taken positive steps to check illegal activity in this sector. In September 2000 the government of Antigua and Barbuda announced that it had strengthened its surveillance of money laundering and drug trafficking. In March 2009, the Stanford Financial Group, based in Antigua was found by regulators there and in the United States, of be operating a massive ponzi scheme. The international bank controlled by the Stanford group is now in receivership pending the outcome of an investigation.|$|E

40|$|This book brings {{together}} the issues surrounding banking secrecy and confiscation of criminal proceeds. The book examines the existing legal agreements at the international, {{regional and national}} levels and their interaction in the substantive areas of confiscation, anti-money laundering and banking confidentiality laws.

In this paper I will analyze the roles played by corporate, professional, and personal networks {{in the creation of}} a superior reputation among competing OFCs. Empirical evidence has shown that the success of an OFC is driven by appropriate financial regulation and supervision addressing the critical precepts of reputation and trust. Such spatially focused regulation can be created by networks of professional associations such as banking or insurance associations interacting with public sector officials on a regular basis. Continued growth of an OFC occurs through marketing efforts of both corporate and personal networks. The dynamic nature of these networks and their social structure encompassing power and gender relations will be explored. ...|$|R

Recently however, academic writings have pointed to the fact that OFCs might have beneficial economic effects. In this context, we address the question whether pressure exerted by international organizations on <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centers</b> may be effective enough to enforce compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. Supposing that onshore and offshore banking centers compete with each other, we show that if costs of being lax (in particular, reputation costs) in customer identification are high enough, offshore banks have an incentive to comply credibly and that in spite of the existence of bank secrecy. Furthermore, the likelihood that an offshore bank credibly opts for monitoring foreign deposits increases with the degree of international financial integration and with the tax difference between onshore and offshore centers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{use of the}} Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) as a {{distributive}} {{medium is}} seen by many businesses as a legitimate way to cut costs of operation. Confidence is growing {{in the use of}} this medium to transact business because of the increasing sophistication of firewalls, encryption software, and digital key technology.

The results show that all firms surveyed for this study use the Internet for routine brochure-ware purposes and the larger firms (particularly in the offshore life insurance sector) are developing more sophisticated customized transactional functions via extranet platforms. Tensions exist though with respect to "regulatory grasp" via the Internet, as offshore places are being put under increased pressure by supranational organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to require greater transparency in <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> transactions.
