5|$|In May 1795, {{with much}} of the winter's damage repaired, the French {{commander}} Vice-amiral Villaret de Joyeuse sent a squadron of three ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> several frigates under Contre-amiral Jean Gaspard Vence to Bordeaux with orders to escort a convoy of merchant ships carrying wine and brandy to Brest. On 8 June, as Vence's convoy passed the fortified island of Belle Île on the southern Breton coast they were discovered by a British battle squadron of five ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> two frigates under Vice-Admiral William Cornwallis. Vence ordered his outnumbered ships to shelter under the batteries of Belle Île, and after a brief skirmish Cornwallis withdrew his forces with eight captured merchant ships. While Cornwallis was escorting his prizes to the mouth of the Channel, Vence sailed out of the Belle Île anchorage and discovered on 15 June that the main force of the Atlantic fleet had sailed to rescue him, a mission ordered by government over the objections of the fleet's officers that Vence would be able to easily extricate himself from the anchorage due to the proximity of the port of Lorient.|$|E
5|$|In May 1798, a large French {{fleet of}} {{warships}} and transports crossed the Mediterranean Sea with {{an army of}} more than 35,000 men under General Napoleon Bonaparte, intent on an invasion of Egypt, then nominally held by the neutral Ottoman Empire. Pausing to capture Malta, the French force then pressed on eastwards aware that a fleet under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson had entered the Mediterranean and was in pursuit. Successfully avoiding Nelson's forces, the fleet reached Alexandria on 29 June and immediately invaded, rapidly advancing inland and defeating the Mamluk rulers of Egypt at the Battle of the Pyramids on 21 July. While the army had pushed inland, the fleet, under Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers, had anchored in Aboukir Bay near Alexandria, and was found there in the afternoon of 1 August by Nelson's fleet. Despite the growing darkness, Nelson attacked at once and in the three-day Battle of the Nile destroyed or captured eleven ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> two frigates. Just two ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> two frigates escaped and {{among the more than}} 3,000 casualties was Admiral Brueys, killed on his flagship Orient.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries fleets had relied on {{two types of}} major warship, the ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> the frigate.

5|$|On 1 August 1798 a British {{fleet of}} 13 ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> one fourth rate ship under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson {{discovered}} a French fleet of 13 ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> four frigates at anchor in Aboukir Bay on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. Nelson {{had been in}} pursuit of the French for three months, crossing the Mediterranean three times in his efforts to locate the fleet and a convoy under its protection which carried the French army commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte intended for the invasion of Egypt. The convoy successfully eluded Nelson and the army landed at Alexandria on 31 June, capturing the city and advancing inland. The fleet was too large to anchor in Alexandria harbour and instead Bonaparte ordered its commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers to take up station in Aboukir Bay.|$|E

40|$|In a {{first study}} to analyze <b>the</b> {{feasibility}} <b>of</b> electron beam-induced deposition (EBID) for creating certain patterns in advanced lithography, line patterns were fabricated on silicon wafers using EBID.

5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>and</b> the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced {{as if they were the}} length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Blackwood rapidly gained on {{the ship}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under the stern of Guillaume Tell and {{beginning}} a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in {{the stern of the}} ship. Decrés recognised that if he stopped to engage Penelope then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy ship of the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' stern repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship.|$|E
