40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} the social workers relationship / contact to the foster parents' <b>own</b> <b>children</b> in a foster home. The aim is also to understand a social workers perspective on foster parents' <b>own</b> <b>children</b> in the foster home. We {{wanted to find out}} how social workers relationship/contact to the foster parents <b>own</b> <b>children</b> looks like, which has shown to differ between municipality to municipality. The study has shown that the perspective on the <b>own</b> <b>children</b> in the family, differs from municipality to municipality and that the own children’s meaning for the foster home as a social contribution, has a varied meaning amongst social workers. Based on several theories and concepts we have analyzed our result we got from the interviews, we found out that social workers looks at and works differently with foster parents <b>own</b> <b>children.</b> We found out that social workers perspective on foster parent’s <b>own</b> <b>children</b> is, that they are a very important resource and they participate in the fostering of the foster child. It also became clear in our result that a paradox appears in social workers work when although they don’t have any regulated documents on how to work with the foster parent’s <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> they still experience that they are restricted in their work by the organization they work under...|$|R

Regional and local committees {{for children and}} families are to be set up, with members from all groups involved in child protection. Previously each local authority managed their <b>own</b> <b>child</b> protection register, a list of children believed to be at risk, and no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases, led to the implementation of the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time the report was published.|$|E

5|$|Andriamanelo was {{the oldest}} son of the reigning Vazimba queen (alternately given in the oral {{histories}} as Rafohy or Rangita) and her Hova husband Manelobe, who may have had origins in the Zafiraminia people of Anosy. At {{the time of the}} marriage between Rafohy and Manelobe, the Hova were a minority clan who had recently moved into the Vazimba-dominated highlands from their ancestral homeland in the southeast. The marriage produced two sons, Andriamanelo and his younger brother Andriamananitany, as well as a sister named Rafotsindrindramanjaka. In a bid to counteract further fracturing of their kingdom, Rafohy and Rangita decided that while the Vazimba had historically been ruled by queens, Andriamanelo would inherit the crown upon his mother's death and would be succeeded not by his <b>own</b> <b>child</b> but by his younger brother. This system of succession, ordered by the queens to be followed for all time, was called fanjakana arindra ("organized government") and applied to families as well: in any instance where there was an elder child and a younger one, the parents would designate an elder child to assume authority within the family upon their death, and that authority would be handed to the designated younger child in the event of the death of the elder child. The queen gave the village of Alasora to Andriamanelo to rule as his territory while she still lived, while Andriamananitany was given the village of Ambohitrandriananahary.|$|E

When the laboratory floods, they leave for the mountain and the robot helps them ascend. On the way, they find a cave with human prisoners including Ana's mother. They need to defeat the Mother Ship to free the prisoners. Another robot (implied to be an upgraded version of the one fought at the cabin) attacks at the summit, and George's robot self-destructs to destroy it, leaving behind the seventh melody.
