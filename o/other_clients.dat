Brown helped organize the public protest and helped attract media coverage. His role in the protests gave him the notoriety to run for the State Assembly.|$|E
25|$|Michael Oft’s was {{a teacher}} in Virginia who had no prior {{psychiatric}} nor deviant behavior history. At the age of forty, his behavior suddenly changed. He began to frequent massage parlors, collect child pornography, abuse his step-daughter, and was soon found guilty of child molestation. Mr. Oft opted for a treatment program for pedophiles, but still couldn’t resist soliciting sexual favors from staff and <b>other</b> <b>clients</b> at the rehabilitation center. A neurologist advised a brain scan, which showed a tumor growing {{at the base of}} his orbitofrontal cortex, compressing the right prefrontal region of his brain. After the tumor was removed, Mr. Oft’s emotion, behavior and sexual activity returned to normal. But after several months of normal behavior Mr. Oft again began to collect child pornography. Neurologists rescanned his brain and found that the tumor had grown back. After the second surgery removing the tumor, his behavior have been totally appropriate.|$|E

While the Internal Audit function of AIB did identify some inappropriate dealing practices in 1991 and 1993, {{there is no evidence that}} the Faldor account was identified in these audits. No disciplinary action was taken against individuals involved in these practices at the time and compensation was not paid to the unit trusts affected. When this episode of law breaking was exposed a disciplinary process was put in place within AIB and compensation has been paid to those who were disadvantaged. Tom Mulcahy, group chief executive of AIB from 1994 to June 2001, resigned the chairmanship of the board of Aer Lingus on 28 May 2004 following the disclosure of this matter.|$|E
