5|$|A {{short-lived}} medicane developed {{near the}} end of September2006 along the coast <b>of</b> <b>Italy.</b> The origins of the medicane {{can be traced to the}} alpine Atlas mountain range on the evening of 25September, likely forming as a normal lee cyclone.

As the latter low approached the Strait of Sicily, it met an eastward-moving convection-producing cold front, resulting in significant intensification, while the system simultaneously reduced in size. It then achieved a minimum atmospheric pressure of approximately 986mbar (29.12inHg) after transiting north-northeastward across the -wide Salentine peninsula in the course of roughly 30minutes at 0915UTC the same day.|$|E
