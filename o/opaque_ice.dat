40|$|A daytime climatological spatio-temporal {{distribution}} of high <b>opaque</b> <b>ice</b> cloud (HOIC) classes over the Indian subcontinent (0 – 40 &deg; N, 60 &deg; E– 100 &deg; E) is presented using 25 -year {{data from the}} Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRRs) for the summer monsoon months. The HOICs are important for regional radiative balance, precipitation and troposphere-stratosphere exchange. In this study, HOICs are sub-divided into three classes based on their cloud top brightness temperatures (BT). Class I represents very deep convection (BT&lt; 220 K). Class II represents deep convection (220 K&le;BT&lt; 233 K) and Class III background convection (233 K&le;BT&lt; 253 K). Apart from presenting finest spatial resolution (0. 1 &times; 0. 1 degrees) and long-term climatology of such cloud classes from AVHRRs to date, this study {{for the first time}} illustrates on 1) how these three cloud classes are climatologically distributed during monsoon months, and 2) how their distribution changes during active and break monsoon conditions. It is also investigated that how many overshooting convective clouds reach the tropopause layer during individual monsoon months. It is seen that Class I and Class II clouds dominate the Indian subcontinent during monsoon. The movement of monsoon over continent is very well reflected in these cloud classes. During monsoon breaks strong suppression of convective activity is observed over the Arabian Sea and the western coast of India. On the other hand, the presence of such convective activity is crucial for active monsoon conditions and all-India rainfall. It is found that a significant fraction of HOICs (3 – 5 %) reach the tropopause layer over the Bay of Bengal during June and over the north and northeast India during July and August. Many cases are observed when clouds penetrate the tropopause layer and reach the lower stratosphere. Such cases mostly occur during June compared to the other months...|$|E
40|$|Microwave {{brightness}} {{temperatures of}} new, young, and optically <b>opaque</b> sea <b>ice</b> grown {{in a large}} tank were obtained {{in the course of}} a joint microwave experiment at CRREL in Hanover, NH, during the winters of 1983 - 1984 and 1984 - 1985. Dual-polarized observations were taken at frequencies of 10, 18, 37, and 90 GHz over a range of incidence angles, and the concurrent temperature and ice thickness were obtained. Emissivity and degree of polarization were observed in detail during the early stages of ice growth and variations were found indicating that the <b>ice</b> became optically <b>opaque</b> at 10 GHz for ice thickness between 30 and 50 mm. Cluster plots of the data show six distinguishable surface types: optically <b>opaque</b> bare <b>ice,</b> thin ice (less than 15 mm), roughened ice, ridged ice, rotting wet ice, and open water...|$|R
50|$|Snow grains are {{a form of}} precipitation. Snow grains are {{characterized}} as very small (<1 mm), white, <b>opaque</b> grains of <b>ice</b> that are fairly flat or elongated. Unlike snow pellets, snow grains do not bounce or break up on impact. Usually, very small amounts fall, mostly from stratus clouds or fog, and never fall {{in the form of}} a shower.|$|R
500|$|The storm's updraft, with {{upwardly}} directed wind speeds {{as high as}} , {{blows the}} forming hailstones up the cloud. As the hailstone ascends it passes into areas of the cloud where the concentration of humidity and supercooled water droplets varies. [...] The hailstone’s growth rate changes depending on the variation in humidity and supercooled water droplets that it encounters. [...] The accretion rate of these water droplets is another factor in the hailstone’s growth. [...] When the hailstone moves into an area with {{a high concentration of}} water droplets, it captures the latter and acquires a translucent layer. [...] Should the hailstone move into an area where mostly water vapour is available, it acquires a layer of <b>opaque</b> white <b>ice.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{stainless-steel}} platen with a {{centrally located}} pressure sensor {{on the front}} face, {{has been used to}} crush mono-crystalline, bubble-free fresh water ice samples. Two electrical conductors, located {{on the face of the}} pressure sensor, were connected to a bridge circuit so that the presence of liquid between the two conductors could be detected and its thickness measured. Video records of the ice/steel contact zone during crushing were obtained by mounting samples on a thick Plexiglass plate which permitted viewing through the specimen to the ice-steel interface. Total load and pressure records exhibited a sawtooth pattern due to the compliance of the ice and the testing apparatus, and spalling of ice from the contact zone. When the region of contact was in the vicinity of the pressure transducer, liquid was detected and peaks occurred in the liquid sensor output when load drops occurred. Contact between the platen and the ice consisted of low pressure zones of highly damaged crushed and/or refrozen <b>ice,</b> <b>opaque</b> in appearance, and transparent, high-pressure regions of relatively undamaged ice. Upper limits for the liquid-layer thickness on the high-pressure regions of relatively undamaged ice. Upper limits for the liquid-layer thickness on the high-pressure undamaged ice were 35 m on the sharp descending sides. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|A {{stainless-steel}} platen, with {{arrays of}} pressure sensors and thermocouples {{on the front}} face, {{has been used to}} crush mono-crystalline, bubble-free freshwater ice samples at - 100 C and - 50 C at various constant speeds. One of the thermocouples was located {{at the center of the}} platen's central pressure transducer. Video records of the ice/steel contact zone during crushing were obtained by mounting samples on a thick plexiglas plate which permitted viewing through the specimens to the ice/steel interface. Total load and pressure records exhibited a sawtooth pattern. The relative movement of the ice towards the platen was not uniform but was much slower on the ascending side of each sawtooth, where elastic energy built up in the ice and apparatus, than on the steep descending portion, where the energy was released and the main damage of the ice occurred. This mode of periodic failure was caused by the compliance of the ice and the testing apparatus. Peak pressures were in the pressure melting range for the temperatures investigated. Contact between the platen and the ice consisted of low pressure zones of highly damaged crushed and/or refrozen <b>ice,</b> <b>opaque</b> in appearance, and regions of relatively undamaged ice, transparent in appearance, where 88...|$|R
