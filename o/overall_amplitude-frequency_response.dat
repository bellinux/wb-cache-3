40|$|There {{are many}} systems which {{consist of a}} {{nonlinear}} oscillator attached to a linear system, examples of which are nonlinear vibration absorbers, or nonlinear systems under test using shakers excited harmonically with a constant force. This paper presents {{a study of the}} dynamic behaviour of a specific two degree-of-freedom system representing such a system, in which the nonlinear system does not affect the vibration of the forced linear system. The nonlinearity of the attachment is derived from a geometric configuration consisting of a mass suspended on two springs which are adjusted to achieve a quasi-zero stiffness characteristic with pure cubic nonlinearity. The response of the system at the frequency of excitation is found analytically by applying the method of averaging.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the dynamic behaviour of a coupled system {{which includes a}} nonlinear hardening system driven harmonically by a shaker. The shaker is modelled as a linear single degree-of-freedom system and the nonlinear system under test is modelled as a hardening Duffing oscillator. The mass of the nonlinear system is {{much less than the}} moving mass of the shaker and thus the nonlinear system has little effect on the shaker dynamics. The nonlinearity is due to the geometric configuration consisting of a mass suspended on four springs, which incline as they are extended. Following experimental validation, the model is used to explore the dynamic behaviour of the system under a range of different conditions. Of particular interest is the situation when the linear natural frequency of the nonlinear system is less than the natural frequency of the shaker such that the frequency response curve of the nonlinear system bends to higher frequencies and thus interacts with the resonance frequency of the shaker. It is found that for some values of the system parameters a complicated frequency response curve for the nonlinear system can occur; closed detached curves can appear {{as a part of the}} <b>overall</b> <b>amplitude-frequency</b> <b>response.</b> These detached curves can lie outside or inside the main resonance curve, and a physical explanation for their occurrence is given...|$|E

A single-buoy {{wave energy}} {{converter}} (WEC) consisting of double hydraulic cylinders is designed to promote the conversion power of traditional oscillating buoy WEC by absorbing the energy of pitching motion. On the condition of linear, regular waves, the nonlinear coupled equations of the pitching-heaving motions of buoy and energy conversion expressions are deduced with a wave incident angle of zero. Then the motion characteristics and power responses are analyzed. Calculations indicate that the heaving and pitching motions can be expressed as approximate simple harmonic motions with wave period. The wave circular frequency and draft of buoy have obvious influences on the <b>amplitude-frequency</b> <b>responses.</b> When the draft is larger than 1. 0 m, the curves of heaving motion exhibit single-peak patterns and the peak values are discovered at the circular frequency of about 2. 5 rad/s.

The heaving motion and pitching motion together influence the conversion power. For the cases in this paper, larger draft can increase the conversion power on the whole.
