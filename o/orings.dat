Minimizing the strain energy in an oring seal {{has been identified}} as a mode of improving its useful lifetime. The intent of this research was to manipulate the strain energy content in oring seals by varying material properties and material behavior over the crosssection of the oring. Oring designs were developed that contained regions of modified material properties referred to as insets. These oring designs incorporating insets were evaluated numerically to determine the effects that the inset’s stiffness, size, and placement, had on the strain energy content and maximum sealing pressure of the oring design. Achievements included the development of oring designs that demonstrated lower strain energy content than a baseline design made of a single homogeneous material. Experimental <b>orings</b> were created using commercially available materials. Compression set and compression stress relaxation experiments were conducted. Performance of new oring designs including insets made of a softer material than the main oring was compared to baseline single material <b>orings.</b> Improved sealing performance was demonstrated by a decreased rate of sealing force decay over time, and by decreased compression set, for the new oring designs proposed...|$|E
40|$|A {{document}} discusses a lightweight, functional mockup of the Pistol Grip Tool for {{use during}} underwater astronaut training. Previous training tools have caused shoulder injuries. This new version {{is more than}} 50 percent lighter [in water, weight is 2. 4 lb (= 1. 1 kg) ], and can operate for a six-hour training session after 30 minutes of prep for submersion. Innovations in the design {{include the use of}} lightweight materials (aluminum and Delrin(Registered TradeMark)), creating a thinner housing, and the optimization of internal space with the removal of as much excess material as possible. This reduces tool weight and maximizes buoyancy. Another innovation for this tool is the application of a vacuum that seats the <b>Orings</b> in place and has shown to be reliable in allowing underwater usage for up to six hours...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{discuss the}} {{completeness}} of an axiomatization of Monadic Second- Order Logic (MSO) on infinite words (or streams). By using model-theoretic tools, we give an alternative proof of D. Siefkes' result that a fragment with full comprehension and induction of second-order Peano's arithmetic is com- plete w. r. t. {{the validity of}} MSO-formulas on streams. We rely on Feferman- Vaught Theorems and the Ehrenfeucht-Fra ̈ıss ́e method for Henkin models of second-order arithmetic. Our main technical contribution is an infinitary Feferman-Vaught Fusion of such models. We show it using Ramseyan fac- torizations similar to those for standard infinite words. We also discuss a Ramsey's theorem for MSO-definable colorings, and show that in linearly ordered Henkin models, Ramsey's theorem for additive MSO-definable col- <b>orings</b> implies Ramsey's theorem for all MSO-definable colorings...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} offer an {{explanation}} {{as to why the}} late Oxford philosopher J. L. Austin's celebrated masterpiece How to Do Things with Words is strewn with passages where the author freely resorts to the use of humor and banter, normally considered "foreign" and even "antithetical" to philosophical discourse. The explanation is based on Gregory Schrempp's ingenious interpretation of Elliott <b>Oring's</b> formula for humor. According to <b>Oring's</b> formula, humor results from the perception of a certain "appropriate incongruity", a certain structural relationship between the humorous passage and the passages adjacent to it. Schrempp's contention that the formula has a much wider range of application than originally imagined by Oring is taken as the starting point for exploring the hypothesis that, far from being a mere ornament, the use of humor by Austin may well turn out to be part and parcel of his overall philosophical project and, have important consequences for the thesis he is putting forward. Austin claimed {{towards the end of the}} book that he had been concerned, all along, "to play Old Harry with" two fetishes viz., "the true/false" fetish and the "fact/value" fetish. For all we know, the one final fetish that Austin was anxious to deconstruct (or, at any rate, that does get deconstructed, perhaps unbeknownst to the author himself) was the very opposition between humor and seriousness...|$|R

40|$|Japanese {{spacecraft}} Hayabusa, which {{returned from}} near-Earth-asteroid Itokawa, successfully returned its reentry capsule to the Earth, the Woomera Prohibited Area in Australia in Jun 13 th, 2010, as detailed in another paper [1]. The capsule {{introduced into the}} Planetary Material Sample Curation Facility in the Sagamihara campus of JAXA {{in the early morning}} of June 18 th. Hereafter, we describe a series of processes for the returned capsule and the container to recover gas and materials in there. A transportation box of the recovered capsule was cleaned up on its outer surface beforehand and introduced into the class 10, 000 clean room of the facility. Then, the capsule was extracted from the box and its plastic bag was opened and checked and photographed the outer surface of the capsule. The capsule was composed of the container, a backside ablator, a side ablator, an electronic box and a supporting frame. The container consists of an outer lid, an inner lid, a frame for latches, a container and a sample catcher, which is composed of room A and B and a rotational cylinder. After the first check, the capsule was packed in a plastic bag with N 2 again, and transferred to the Chofu campus in JAXA, where the X-ray CT instrument is situated. The first X-ray CT analysis was performed on the whole returned capsule for confirming the conditions of latches and O-ring seal of the container. The analysis showed that the latches of the container should have worked normally, and that the double <b>Orings</b> of the container seemed to be sealed its sample catcher with no problem. After the first X-ray CT, the capsule was sent back to Sagamihara and introduced in the clean room to exclude the electronic box and the side ablator from the container by hand tools. Then the container with the backside ablator was set firmly to special jigs to fix the lid of container tightly to the container and set to a milling machine. The backside ablator was drilled by the machine to expose heads of bolts, which combined the ablator to the outer lid of the container, and after the drilling had been finished, all the bolts were unscrewed and the backside ablator was removed from the container. Then, the container was sent to the Chofu X-ray facility again to examine in detail by a micro X-ray CT instrument in order to reconfirm that the condition of the latches of the lid of container was normal and that its double O-ring seemed to have been sealed after the last X-ray CT analysis...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} to monitor the aging performance of Viton{reg_sign} GLT O-rings used in the Model 9975 package has been ongoing for seven years at the Savannah River National Laboratory. Seventy tests using mock-ups of 9975 Primary Containment Vessels (PCVs) were assembled and heated to temperatures ranging from 200 to 450 F. They were leak-tested initially and have been tested periodically {{to determine if they}} meet the criterion of leak-tightness defined in ANSI standard N 14. 5 - 97. Fourteen additional tests were initiated in 2008 with GLT-S O-rings heated to temperatures ranging from 200 to 400 F. High temperature aging continues for 33 GLT O-ring fixtures at 200 - 300 F. Room temperature leak test failures have been experienced in all of the GLT O-ring fixtures aging at 350 F and higher temperatures, and in 7 fixtures aging at 300 F. No failures have yet been observed in GLT O-ring fixtures aging at 200 F for 41 - 60 months, which is still bounding to O-ring temperatures during storage in K-Area Complex (KAC). Based on expectations that the fixtures aging at 200 F will remain leak-tight for a significant period yet to come, 2 additional fixtures began aging within the past year at an intermediate temperature of 270 F, with hopes that they may leak before the 200 F fixtures. High temperature aging continues for 6 GLT-S O-ring fixtures at 200 - 300 F. Room temperature leak test failures have been experienced in all 8 of the GLT-S O-ring fixtures aging at 350 and 400 F. No failures have yet been observed in GLT-S O-ring fixtures aging at 200 - 300 F for up to 26 months. For O-ring fixtures that have failed the room temperature leak test and been disassembled, the <b>Orings</b> displayed a compression set ranging from 51 - 96 %. This is greater than seen to date for packages inspected during KAC field surveillance (24 % average). For GLT O-rings, separate service life estimates have been made based on the O-ring fixture leak test data and based on compression stress relaxation (CSR) data. These two predictive models show reasonable agreement at higher temperatures (350 - 400 F). However, at 300 F, the room temperature leak test failures to date experienced longer aging times than predicted by the CSR-based model. This suggests that extrapolations of the CSR model predictions to temperatures below 300 F will provide a conservative prediction of service life relative to the leak rate criterion. Leak test failure data at lower temperatures are needed to verify this apparent trend. Insufficient failure data exist currently to perform a similar comparison for GLT-S O-rings. Aging and periodic leak testing will continue for the remaining fixtures...|$|E
40|$|This is {{an interim}} status report for tasks carried out per Task Technical Plan SRNL-STI- 2011 - 00506. A series of tasks/experiments are being {{performed}} at the Savannah River National Laboratory to monitor the aging performance of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) <b>Orings</b> used in the H 1616 shipping package. The data will support the technical basis to extend the annual maintenance of the EPDM O-rings in the H 1616 shipping package and to predict {{the life of the}} seals at bounding service conditions. Current expectations are that the O-rings will maintain a seal at bounding normal temperatures in service (152 F) for at least 12 months. The baseline aging data review suggests that the EPDM O-rings are likely to retain significant mechanical properties and sealing force at bounding service temperatures to provide a service life of at least 2 years. At lower, more realistic temperatures, longer service life is likely. Parallel compression stress relaxation and vessel leak test efforts are in progress to further validate this assessment and quantify a more realistic service life prediction. The H 1616 shipping package O-rings were evaluated for baseline property data as part of this test program. This was done to provide a basis for comparison of changes in material properties and performance parameters as a function of aging. This initial characterization was limited to physical and mechanical properties, namely hardness, thickness and tensile strength. These properties appear to be consistent with O-ring specifications. Three H 1616 - 1 Containment Vessels were placed in test conditions and are aging at temperatures ranging from 160 to 300 F. The vessels were Helium leak-tested initially and have been tested at periodic intervals after cooling to room temperature to determine if they meet the criterion of leaktightness defined in ANSI standard N 14. 5 - 97 (< 1 E- 07 std cc air/sec at room temperature). To date, no leak test failures have occurred. The cumulative time at temperature ranges from 174 days for the 300 F vessel to 189 days for the 160 F vessel as of 8 / 1 / 2012. The compression stress-relaxation (CSR) behavior of H 1616 shipping package O-rings is being evaluated to develop an aging model based on material properties. O-ring segments were initially aged at four temperatures (175 F, 235 F, 300 F and 350 F). These temperatures were selected to bound normal service temperatures and to challenge the seals within a reasonable aging period. Currently, samples aging at 300 F and 350 F have reached the mechanical failure point (end of life) which is defined in this study as 90 % loss of initial sealing force. As a result, additional samples more recently began aging at {approx} 270 F to provide additional data for the aging model. Aging and periodic leak testing of the full containment vessels, as well as CSR testing of O-ring segments is ongoing. Continued testing per the Task Technical Plan is recommended in order to validate the assumptions outlined in this status report and to quantify and validate the long-term performance of O-ring seals under actual service conditions...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{most common}} {{hereditary}} hemoglobin disorder, affecting 20 million individuals worldwide, is sickle cell disease. The vascular obstruction {{resulting from the}} sickling of cells in this disease can produce local hypoxemia, pain crises and infarction in several tissues, including the bones, spleen, kidneys and lungs. METHODS: The present study is characterized as a case control study, {{with the aim of}} identifying the baseline blood lactate concentration in individuals with hemoglobin SS and SC diseases. One-way ANOVA with the Tukey post-test was used to analyze the results and a p-value < 0. 05 was considered significant. Calculations were made using the INSTAT statistical program. The graphs were generated using the <b>ORING</b> program. The study sample was composed of 31 men and women residing in the city of Santo Antônio de Jesus, Bahia, Brazil. The individuals were divided into two groups: Group GC of 16 subjects who did not present with any type of structural hemoglobinopathy; and Group GE composed of 15 individuals with ages between 2 and 35 years old, who had the SS and SC genotypes. Sample analyses were performed with 3 mL of blood during fasting. RESULTS: The baseline blood lactate concentration of the SS and SC individuals was higher than that of the control group (p< 0. 001) with means of 4. 86 ± 0. 95; 3. 30 ± 0. 33; 1. 31 ± 0. 08 IU/L for SS, SC and controls, respectively. This corroborates the initial research hypothesis.

The application of RA on primary cultures of embryonic somites, limb buds, and neonatal limbs inhibited myogenic differentiation in a dose-dependent way as indicated by the repression of: (a) myotube formation, (b) myosin heavy chain protein accumulation, (c) myosin light chain (MLC) 1 / 3, Ctsk-actin and myogenic factor transcript expression. Expression of retinoic acid receptors (RAR) was also affected by RA treatment, specifically RARe/transcripts were induced. To further understand the pleiotropic action of RA on myogenesis, we took advantage of two muscle-specific transgene markers which consisted of CAT reporter genes driven by regulatory elements either from the myosin light chain 1 / 3 locus (MLC-CAT) or the a-skeletal actin gene (oqk actin-CAT). RA inhibited MLC-CAT transgene but not ask actin-CAT transgene expression in primary cultures from these mice. Analysis of MLC-CAT expression in transgenic mouse primary cultures and in stably transfected C 2 C 12 ceils demonstrated that repression of MLC-CAT activity by RA was dependent upon diffusible factors in chick embryo extract. We hypothesize that during development, the pleiotropic effects of RA on myogenesis do not depend solely on the distribution and concentration of RA itself, but are also influenced by extracellular signals in the embryonic environment. <b>ORING</b> development the actions of signaling molecules are required to instruct individual cells when and where to differentiate into their ultimate tissue type. Retinoic acid (RA) 1 has long been known to affect pattern formation in vertebrate embryos (reviewed in Summerbell and Maden, 1990). RA treatment causes perturbation of segment identity along the anteroposterior (AP) body axis (Kessel and Gruss, 1991; Kessel, 1992) and alteration of limb morphogenesis (Tickle et al., 1982). Recent evidence has indicated that Henson's node, a patternorganizing region at the anterior end of the primitive streak in early embryos (Waddington, 1932; Beddington, 1994) may be an endogenous source of RA (Hogan et al. ...|$|R
