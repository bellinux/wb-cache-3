5|$|In {{terms of}} any {{acknowledgement}} of the mutual existence between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers to any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius).

40|$|A {{crossover}} {{comparison of}} intravenous procainamide, disopyramide and quinidine {{was made in}} 32 patients. All three drugs had dosage-related effects on electrocardiographic intervals, refractory periods and cycle length of ventricular tachycardia. Significant linear relations between serum drug levels and changes in refractory periods and ventricular tachycardia cycle length were also observed. Ventricular tachycardia was no longer inducible {{on at least one}} drug in 11 patients but concordance of this effect on both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> was 36 % and on either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> it was 45 %. Ventricular tachycardia remained inducible on at least one drug in 28 patients and concordance of this effect on both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> was 75 % and on either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> was 79 %. Continued inducibility on quinidine, the drug producing the greatest electrophysiologic effects, was the best individual predictor of continued inducibility on <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> Subdivision <b>of</b> continued inducibility into 1) easier to induce, 2) inducibility unchanged, or 3) harder to induce dramatically decreased concordance of this effect. Thus <b>the</b> antiarrhythmic effects <b>of</b> these drugs are discordant in individual patients despite electrophysiologic similarities. Nevertheless, continued inducibility after high dosages of any one of these drugs is clinically useful for screening for continued inducibility on <b>the</b> <b>others</b> and this is dose-related rather than drug specific...|$|R
