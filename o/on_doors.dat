5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: pointing the camera, sensing the element to be inspected, if needed repointing and zooming with the camera, image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used <b>on</b> <b>doors</b> {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on {{the presence or absence of}} protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E

The bridge is the second-longest bridge in Norway, behind the Drammen Bridge.|$|E
5|$|On her own Tara finds a spell to {{help the}} town get its voices back, and goes out {{to show it to}} Willow. On the way to Willow's dorm she trips, turns around and sees The Gentlemen {{floating}} toward her. In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks <b>on</b> <b>doors</b> which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking down the hall and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E

5|$|As the {{character}} progresses through the game, experience points (XP) are earned from accomplishing various actions, such as completing a quest, killing an enemy, and so forth, {{with a new}} level granted upon reaching the necessary amount of XP. A new level grants the player the ability to allocate points to the various Skills available and thus improve upon them, making them more effective; for instance, a higher lock-picking skill allows the player {{to be able to}} tackle more difficult locks <b>on</b> <b>doors</b> and containers, while a higher medicine skill increases the amount of health recovered with Stimpaks. Once {{the character}} achieves their second level, they can be granted a Perk, which offers advantages of varying quality and form, such as being able to carry more items, finding more ammo in containers, and having a higher chance to perform a critical hit. Many Perks have a set of prerequisites that need to be satisfied, often requiring a certain Skill level to acquire them, while a new Perk can be granted for every two levels earned by the character. Additional improvements to Skill levels can be made by finding Skill books, which confer a permanent boost to levels, while players can also search for and find a series of around 20 bobbleheads that also confer a bonus to these and also primary attributes.|$|E

25|$|A lynching in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, {{changed the}} {{political}} climate in Washington. On July 19, 1935, Rubin Stacy, a homeless African-American tenant farmer, knocked <b>on</b> <b>doors</b> begging for food. After resident complaints, deputies took Stacy into custody. While he was in custody, a lynch mob took Stacy from the deputies and murdered him.

25|$|The protests slowly {{became more}} violent, and {{included}} heckling, banging <b>on</b> <b>doors,</b> smashing shop windows, and arson. Emily Davison, a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 Epsom Derby and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation. As many protesters were imprisoned {{and went on}} hunger-strike, the British government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the neighbors}} told Dulaney that while the police sealed off the four-unit block where Hedgepeth and Rosario lived with crime scene tape, they only searched the women's {{apartment}} and not {{any of the others}} in it. Nor did they search the woods behind the apartments, and they only returned later to search one other apartment in the complex. They did not seem to canvass the area, either, never knocking <b>on</b> <b>doors</b> and asking residents what they might have seen. The police also left Hedgepeth's car unsecured while they searched the apartments.|$|E
25|$|Some common compulsions include hand washing, cleaning, {{checking}} things (e.g., locks <b>on</b> <b>doors),</b> repeating actions (e.g., {{turning on}} and off switches), ordering items in a certain way, and requesting reassurance. Compulsions are different from tics (such as touching, tapping, rubbing or blinking) and stereotyped movements (such as head banging, body rocking or self-biting), which usually aren't as complex and aren't precipitated by obsessions. It can sometimes be difficult {{to tell the difference}} between compulsions and complex tics. About 10% to 40% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder.|$|E

25|$|While not recording, {{the band}} members at times ventured onto The Strip, but they also {{made an effort to}} {{experience}} Las Vegas as locals rather than merely a tourist destination. Howling Bells believed that their Las Vegas surroundings infused the spirit and the ambience of the desert and very much affected the outcome of the music. They spent time jamming <b>on</b> <b>Doors</b> and John Lennon songs, whereupon Stoermer joined them, sometimes filling in on drums. Stoermer also brought his collection of Hitchcock and cult films into the studio late at night and entertained the band with the old movies.|$|E

25|$|A major {{function}} of ACARS is to automatically detect and report {{the start of}} each major flight phase, called OOOI events in the industry (out of the gate, off the ground, on the ground, and into the gate). These OOOI events are detected using input from aircraft sensors mounted <b>on</b> <b>doors,</b> parking brakes, and struts. At {{the start of each}} flight phase, an ACARS message is transmitted to the ground describing the flight phase, the time at which it occurred, and other related information such as the amount of fuel on board or the flight origin and destination. These messages are used to track the status of aircraft and crews.|$|E
