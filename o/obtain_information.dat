5|$|An {{attempt to}} <b>obtain</b> <b>information</b> for Operation Dexterity, {{the attack on}} New Britain, with a joint Army-Navy {{reconnaissance}} team raised issues of inter-service cooperation. The Navy was mainly interested in gathering hydrographic data rather than information {{on the state of}} the Japanese defenders. Because of a breakdown in communications, the PT boat that was supposed to collect the team was unable to rendezvous with it, and the team had to spend eleven more days on the island. Finally, the Navy tried to prevent the Army commander from briefing Alamo Force headquarters on what had occurred.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how people process <b>information</b> <b>obtained</b> {{directly}} (through own observation) or indirectly (through communication). In two experiments, participants {{read about a}} complex legal case partly consisting of directly or indirectly <b>obtained</b> <b>information.</b> Next, participants made judgments about who was guilty in the case. Participants made their judgments immediately (immediate decision condition), could consciously think about their judgments {{for a couple of}} minutes (conscious thought condition), or were distracted {{for a couple of minutes}} and then made their judgments (unconscious thought condition). Results indicated that judgments about who was guilty in the conscious thought condition suffered from directly <b>obtained</b> <b>information</b> but not from indirectly <b>obtained</b> <b>information,</b> whereas the reverse was found in the immediate judgment condition. Judgments made through unconscious thinking were not influenced by the distinction between directly and indirectly <b>obtained</b> <b>information,</b> and were always better than judgments derived from immediate decisions or conscious thought...|$|R

5|$|On 1 August 1931 Heydrich {{began his}} job as chief of the new 'Ic Service' (intelligence service). He set up office at the Brown House, the Nazi Party {{headquarters}} in Munich. By October he had created a network of spies and informers for intelligence-gathering purposes and to <b>obtain</b> <b>information</b> {{to be used as}} blackmail to further political aims. Information on thousands of people was recorded on index cards and stored at the Brown House.

40|$|Understanding the informational {{needs of}} cancer {{patients}} {{is a requirement}} to plan any educative care program for them. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify Iranian cancer patients’ perceptions of informational needs. The study took a qualitative approach. Semi-structured interviews were held with 25 cancer patients in two teaching hospitals in Iran. Transcripts of the interviews underwent conventional content analysis, and categories were extracted. The results came under two main categories: disease-related informational needs and information needs related to daily life. Disease-related informational needs had two subcategories: <b>obtaining</b> <b>information</b> about the nature of disease and <b>obtaining</b> <b>information</b> about disease prognosis. Information needs related to daily life also had two subcategories: <b>obtaining</b> <b>information</b> about healthy lifestyle and <b>obtaining</b> <b>information</b> about regular activities of daily life. The findings provide deep understanding of cancer patients’ informational needs in Iran. © 2015, American Association for Cancer Education...|$|R
5|$|Schwend {{was given}} two objectives: to {{exchange}} the counterfeit money for genuine Swiss francs or US dollars, and {{to assist with}} the funding of special operations, including buying black market arms from the Yugoslav Partisans then selling them to pro-Nazi groups in Southeast Europe. He also arranged for the counterfeit notes to pay the Turkish agent Elyesa Bazna—code named Cicero—for his work in obtaining secrets from the British ambassador in Ankara.

5|$|Culverhouse's {{relationships}} with other NFL owners were occasionally, as in {{his relationship with the}} Rams, alleged to constitute conflicts of interest. His $3 million loan to help Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose with his gambling debts was one example, as it violated the NFL constitution and bylaws. On other occasions, he was criticized for his overly-secretive ways as NFL Finance Committee Chairman, as other league owners found it difficult to <b>obtain</b> <b>information</b> on how league finances were being spent. In particular, owners were upset about not being informed about money given to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a 5-year extension of his contract. The extension was awarded to him by the Finance Committee as a reward for negotiation of the league television contract in 1982, even though Rozelle had five years remaining on his current contract.|$|E

However, {{by the time the}} Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing borders to <b>obtain</b> <b>information</b> and forcing the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation Claret. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross-border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine Indonesian movements and intentions.|$|E

5|$|Normally sea duty alternated with {{periods of}} duty ashore. In 1950, Shepard was {{selected}} to attend the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. As a test pilot he conducted high-altitude tests to <b>obtain</b> <b>information</b> about the light and air masses at different altitudes over North America; carrier suitability certification of the McDonnell F2H Banshee; experiments with the Navy's new in-flight refueling system; and tests of the angled flight deck. He narrowly avoided being court-martialed by the station commander, Rear Admiral Alfred M. Pride, after looping the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and making low passes over the beach at Ocean City, Maryland, and the base; but Shepard's superiors, John Hyland and Robert M. Elder, interceded on his behalf.|$|E

5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to <b>obtain</b> <b>information</b> about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E
5|$|The first {{allegations}} of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents {{he had received}} through an access-to-information request showing that three prisoners {{in the custody of}} Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, all on the same day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture {{on the part of the}} interrogator and should be investigated. Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the documents show torture of detainees was an actual tactic used to <b>obtain</b> <b>information</b> during interrogation.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was revived {{later in the}} year; the aim was changed to forging money to finance German intelligence operations. Instead of a specialist unit within the SD, prisoners from Nazi concentration camps were selected and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp to work under SS Major Bernhard Krüger. The unit produced British notes until mid-1945; estimates vary of the number and value of notes printed, from £132.6 million up to £300 million. By the time the unit ceased production, they had perfected the artwork for US dollars, although the paper and serial numbers were still being analysed. The counterfeit money was laundered in exchange for money and other assets. Counterfeit notes from the operation were used to pay the Turkish agent Elyesa Bazna—code named Cicero—for his work in obtaining British secrets from the British ambassador in Ankara, and £100,000 from Operation Bernhard was used to <b>obtain</b> <b>information</b> that helped to free the Italian leader Benito Mussolini in the Gran Sasso raid in September 1943.|$|E

Eichmann had been in charge of the {{transportation}} and deportation of Jews in the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question: a plan, finalised at the Wannsee Conference—at which Eichmann took the minutes—to exterminate all the Jews in Europe. After the war, Eichmann hid in Austria using forged identity papers until 1950, when he left via Italy and moved to Argentina under an assumed name.

Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon arrive in Starling City to help Felicity Smoak investigate Sara Lance's death. Digger attempts to kill Lyla Michaels, Roy, and Oliver, but Barry arrives and stops him. Later, Lyla reveals Digger {{was part of the}} Suicide Squad. When Oliver uses extreme interrogation methods against a Russian mob member in order to locate Digger, Barry questions how emotionally stable Oliver is. Digger locates Oliver's hideout and wounds Lyla before escaping. In order to leave town, Digger plants five bombs around the city. While Oliver captures Digger, Barry uses both of their teams to defuse the bombs simultaneously. Digger is incarcerated on the island with Slade Wilson. Before Barry and his team's departure, he and Oliver decide to have a friendly duel.|$|E
5|$|The Material Defender {{is first}} sent to Deimos to <b>obtain</b> <b>information</b> about the {{location}} of a scientist named Dr. Sweitzer who has evidence of the PTMC's actions. He is then rescued in the Novak Corporate Prison on Phobos. After recovering the evidence, the Material Defender delivers it to PTMC President Suzuki in Seoul before leaving with his reward. When the Material Defender arrives at the Red Acropolis Research Station, the director tells him that the PTMC president has been killed and that the Red Acropolis Research Team are now accused of being terrorists, resulting in the destruction of the then-abandoned station. After a series of missions, the Material Defender and the Red Acropolis Research Team manage to develop an antivirus and convince the CED that they are not terrorists. The CED suggest to broadcast the antivirus through their strategic platform orbiting Earth, but the results are unsuccessful. The Material Defender is then sent to Venus, where Dravis has been tracked by the Red Acropolis. In the ensuing confrontation in his stronghold, Dravis is mortally wounded by the Guide-Bot's flares and the Material Defender deactivates the virus, which disables all of the PTMC's robots. The game ends with the CED destroying the PTMC's orbital headquarters while the Material Defender returns to Earth.|$|E
