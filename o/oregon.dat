5|$|As Miss <b>Oregon,</b> Anderson's {{activities}} included {{public appearances}} {{across the state}} of <b>Oregon.</b> Notable appearances included participating in local pageants, welcoming Air National Guard members home to <b>Oregon,</b> and serving as a judge for the Just For Men World Beard and Moustache Championships. Anderson's reign as Miss <b>Oregon</b> continued until June 27, 2015, when she crowned her successor, Ali Wallace, Miss <b>Oregon</b> 2015.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{an appeals}} court, the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court {{is also the}} court of last resort in <b>Oregon.</b> Although most oral {{arguments}} before the court are held in the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court Building, the court does travel around the state holding sessions in various schools. All cases are heard en banc by the court. It receives appeals from the <b>Oregon</b> Tax Court, the <b>Oregon</b> Court of Appeals, and some select cases such as death penalty appeals. Decisions of the court are published in the <b>Oregon</b> Reporter published by the <b>Oregon</b> Judicial Department. The Territorial Supreme Court was created in 1848 when the <b>Oregon</b> Territory was formed {{out of the old}} <b>Oregon</b> Country region, followed by the creation of the State Supreme Court in 1859 when <b>Oregon</b> was admitted to the Union on February 14.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the <b>Oregon</b> law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court is the final authority on <b>Oregon</b> law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of <b>Oregon</b> law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the <b>Oregon</b> Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the <b>Oregon</b> Legislature to concur).|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the <b>Oregon</b> Territory in 1848, the <b>Oregon</b> Country provisional government, through legislation on June 27, 1844 and December 19, 1845, selected <b>Oregon</b> City as the capital. Thus Oregon's first capitol was in <b>Oregon</b> City. One of the private buildings used by this government was constructed by John L. Morrison in 1850; it served as a capitol until the government moved to Salem. The designation of <b>Oregon</b> City as the seat of power was by proclamation of Governor Joseph Lane. In 1850, the legislature passed an act designating Salem the capital. However, Governor John P. Gaines refused to relocate and remained in <b>Oregon</b> City along with the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court (except justice Orville C. Pratt) until an act of Congress on May 14, 1852 settled the matter in Salem's favor.|$|E
5|$|Chana's first {{teacher was}} D.C. Sears, an <b>Oregon,</b> Illinois resident. The late 19th century saw {{at least ten}} {{individuals}} teach at Chana School at different times. By 1888, Pine Rock Township was ready {{to address the question}} of whether or not to build a high school; Chana students attended high school in <b>Oregon.</b> The question was brought to a vote but failed and Chana students continued to go to <b>Oregon</b> schools after eighth grade.|$|E
5|$|Deady {{was elected}} to the <b>Oregon</b> Territorial Legislature in 1850, where he {{represented}} Yamhill County as a Democrat in the lower chamber House of Representatives. He attended the session held in <b>Oregon</b> City beginning in December, where he met James W. Nesmith and Asahel Bush for the first time. Those three would become influential leaders of the Democratic Party in the <b>Oregon</b> Territory, and later the state of <b>Oregon.</b> Deady was an early member of the Democratic Party in the territory.|$|E

5|$|Hamlett {{played as}} a tight {{end for the}} <b>Oregon</b> State Beavers of <b>Oregon</b> State University from 2011 to 2014. In 2010, he was redshirted and shared the {{offensive}} scout MVP award with Tyler Anderson. He majored in business management at <b>Oregon</b> State.|$|E
5|$|He left in May {{and arrived}} in November {{of what was}} still the unorganized <b>Oregon</b> Country. At this time the region was under the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States after the settling of the <b>Oregon</b> boundary dispute with Great Britain the previous year. In <b>Oregon,</b> Chapman settled first in what was then Marysville, and is now Corvallis, in the Willamette Valley. In 1848, he relocated to Salem, where he learned of the California Gold Rush while at court at Knox Butte. Chapman went to California for a brief time and had some success in the gold fields before returning in 1849 to <b>Oregon,</b> which had become the <b>Oregon</b> Territory in 1848.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years, Boise {{served on the}} board of {{trustees}} at Willamette University in Salem and Pacific University in Forest Grove. Pacific gave him an honorary doctor of laws degree. Additionally, he was a trustee at the La Creole Academy preparatory school in Dallas and a regent of the <b>Oregon</b> Agricultural College (now <b>Oregon</b> State University). He also spent five terms as the master of the state grange association, and owned the Ellendale Woolen Mill. A public speaker, he gave speeches for the <b>Oregon</b> Historical Society, the <b>Oregon</b> Pioneer Society, and the <b>Oregon</b> State Bar {{as well as at the}} dedication of a monument to missionary Jason Lee.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other wines}} {{produced}} in the United States, <b>Oregon</b> wines are marketed as varietals. <b>Oregon</b> law requires that wines {{produced in the}} state must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, and for most varietals it must contain at least 90% of that variety. The exceptions to the 90% law are the following varietals: Red and White Bordeaux varietals, Red and White Rhône varietals, Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Zinfandel and Tannat. For these wines, they follow the Federal guidelines of 75%. <b>Oregon</b> law has long forbidden use of place names, except as appellations of origin. <b>Oregon</b> is most famous for its Pinot noir, which is produced throughout the state. Pinot noirs from the Willamette Valley have received much critical acclaim from wine connoisseurs and critics, and <b>Oregon</b> is {{regarded as one of}} the premier Pinot-producing regions in the world.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Paul Deady (May 12, 1824 – March 24, 1893) was a {{politician}} and jurist in the <b>Oregon</b> Territory {{and the state}} of <b>Oregon</b> of the United States. He served on the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court from 1853 to 1859, at which time he was appointed to the newly created federal court of the state. He remained on this federal trial level court, the United States District Court for the District of <b>Oregon</b> in Portland, <b>Oregon,</b> as the sole judge until his death in 1893. While on the court he presided over the trial that led to the United States Supreme Court decision of Pennoyer v. Neff concerning personal jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Norma Paulus (born March 13, 1933) is an American {{lawyer and}} {{politician}} {{in the state}} of <b>Oregon.</b> A native of Nebraska, she was raised in Eastern <b>Oregon</b> before becoming a lawyer. A Republican, she first held political office as a representative in the <b>Oregon</b> House of Representatives, and then became the first woman elected to statewide public office in <b>Oregon</b> when she became <b>Oregon</b> Secretary of State in 1977. Paulus later served as <b>Oregon</b> Superintendent of Public Instruction for nine years. She had failed bids to become Governor of <b>Oregon</b> and United States Senator. She lives in Portland where she is involved with several non-profit groups and sponsored a ballot measure to create open primaries in Oregon's statewide elections.|$|E

5|$|<b>Oregon</b> Caves National Monument and Preserve is a {{protected}} {{area in the}} northern Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern <b>Oregon</b> in the United States. The 4,554-acre (1,843ha) park, including the marble cave, is 20 miles (32km) east of Cave Junction, on <b>Oregon</b> Route 46. The protected area, managed by the National Park Service (NPS), is in southwestern Josephine County, near the Oregon–California border.|$|E

5|$|Oregon—and {{therefore}} the Chetco watershed—was jointly {{occupied by the}} United Kingdom and the United States after the Treaty of 1818 was signed. The <b>Oregon</b> Treaty was ratified in 1846, giving the United States ownership of <b>Oregon.</b> Soon after, the <b>Oregon</b> Territory was established, and <b>Oregon</b> became a U.S. state on February 14, 1859.|$|E
5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the <b>Oregon</b> court, <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other <b>Oregon</b> state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow <b>Oregon</b> law and decisions of the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on <b>Oregon</b> law, even when those federal courts are not based in <b>Oregon,</b> per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about <b>Oregon</b> law to the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in <b>Oregon</b> is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{traveled}} to the <b>Oregon</b> Country in 1845. He {{played a central role}} in blazing the last leg of the <b>Oregon</b> Trail, the Barlow Road, with Sam Barlow and others. Specifically, Palmer is noted for having climbed high on Mount Hood to observe the surrounding area when the party ran into difficulty. He wrote a popular immigrant guidebook, co-founded Dayton, <b>Oregon,</b> and served as a controversial Indian Affairs administrator. After <b>Oregon</b> became a state, Palmer served in both branches of the <b>Oregon</b> Legislative Assembly. He was selected as Speaker of the <b>Oregon</b> House of Representatives for one session in 1862, and in 1870 lost a bid to become Governor of <b>Oregon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{joining the}} court, Deady {{served in the}} {{legislature}} of the <b>Oregon</b> Territory, including time served as the President of the Council, and was elected as President of the <b>Oregon</b> Constitutional Convention in 1857. A native {{of the state of}} Maryland, his first profession was as a blacksmith. He would also spend time as a teacher in both Ohio and <b>Oregon.</b> Deady read law in Ohio and practiced law for a time in that state before immigrating to the <b>Oregon</b> Territory via the <b>Oregon</b> Trail. In <b>Oregon,</b> he helped codify the laws of the state and assisted in the foundation of the Multnomah County Library in Portland. He also was president of the University of Oregon's board of regents. The university renamed Deady Hall in his honor after his death.|$|E

5|$|Signed on June 15, 1846, the <b>Oregon</b> Treaty {{ended the}} {{dispute between the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States, by {{dividing}} the <b>Oregon</b> Country at the 49th parallel. This extended U.S. sovereignty over the region, but effective control would not occur until government officials arrived from the United States. Two years later, on August 14, 1848, the United States Congress created the <b>Oregon</b> Territory; this territory included today's states of <b>Oregon,</b> Washington, and Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming. Appointed Governor of the <b>Oregon</b> Territory by President Polk, Joseph Lane arrived at <b>Oregon</b> City on 2 March 1849.|$|E

5|$|The 50 or so {{crossings}} of the Willamette River include many historic structures, {{such as the}} Van Buren Street Bridge, a swing bridge. Built in 1913, it carries <b>Oregon</b> Route 34 (Corvallis–Lebanon Highway) over the river upstream of RM131 (RK211) in Corvallis. The machinery to operate the swing span was removed in the 1950s. The <b>Oregon</b> City Bridge, built in 1922, replaced a suspension span constructed at the site in 1888.

5|$|The <b>Oregon</b> State Capitol is the {{building}} housing {{the state legislature}} and {{the offices of the}} governor, secretary of state, and treasurer of the U.S. state of <b>Oregon.</b> It is located in the state capital, Salem. The current building, constructed from 1936 to 1938, and expanded in 1977, is the third to house the <b>Oregon</b> state government in Salem. Two former capitol buildings were destroyed by fire, one in 1855 and the other in 1935.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court (OSC) is {{the highest}} state court in the U.S. state of <b>Oregon.</b> The only court that may reverse or modify a {{decision}} of the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court is the Supreme Court of the United States. The OSC holds court at the <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court Building in Salem, <b>Oregon,</b> near the capitol building on State Street. The building was finished in 1914 and also houses the state's law library, while the courtroom is also used by the <b>Oregon</b> Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Oregon</b> wine {{industry}} {{focuses on the}} higher-priced segments of the wine market. <b>Oregon</b> growers receive a higher average return per ton and a higher average revenue per case than do growers in other wine-producing regions in the United States. Despite producing a much smaller volume of wine, <b>Oregon</b> winery revenues per capita are {{comparable to those of}} New York and Washington.|$|E
5|$|The Provisional Legislature held session {{mainly in}} <b>Oregon</b> City.
