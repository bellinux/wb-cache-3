40|$|The {{main problem}} with China <b>s</b> <b>pension</b> system, the {{inability}} of paying the pensions {{for more and more}} old people, had been supposed to be dealt with by China <b>s</b> <b>pension</b> reform. But can the reform actually reach its goal? The existing literatures had already simulated the proposed reform arrangements and policy options under certainty. 	But the effect of the pension reform in China by its nature is uncertain. The studies on its uncertainty will be more helpful on policy making. Employing a simple but complete model that had been used in simulating the certain results of China <b>s</b> <b>pension</b> reform, this paper presents a method to analyze the uncertainty of the effect of pension reform, to simulate and to compare the potential policy options. 	The uncertainty can come from two main sources: the demographic dynamic and economic development. Demographic dynamics depends on fertility, mortality and migration, while economic development depends on future unemployment, interest rate, GDP growth, inflation, real wage, etc. The uncertainties of all these variables lead to the uncertainty of the pension system. But all these factors are unknown for us. 	This paper gives the method to model the stochastic process of these random variables in term of Markov chain and introduce these variables uncertainties into the simulation model. The simulation can be done with Monte Carlo fashion. Here the method is illustrated by analysis of the uncertainty that comes from GDP growth and inflation, which both cooperate affecting the real wage. In the simple simulation model, the real wage is the key to simulate the uncertainty of the pension system variables and of the economic development. With the stochastic process description of the economic inputs, and the relationship between the economic inputs and the pension system arrangements, the uncertainty of China <b>s</b> <b>pension</b> reform can be simulated. The same work can be done to the demographic dynamic inputs, too. The suggestions on simulating the potential policy options are also given {{at the end of this}} paper. 	The method is presented by using the simple model, but it is not supposed to be used only in this model. Uncertainty exists in the nature of pension system. So it is possible and necessary to apply the uncertainty analysis to all the estimates about the future of China <b>s</b> <b>pension</b> system. We can use this method to all the variables mentioned here as well as other models about pension. There are a lot of works to be done...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in {{economic}} research that public pay-as-you-go defined-benefit pension plans penalize those who continue to work beyond a certain age by reducing the present discounted value of future retirement benefits. In discussions on the effectiveness of policies aimed at eliminating this age-dependency in worker retirement decisions, it is often assumed either that the benefits in all future periods have the same weight in the present discounted value or that the discount rate is close to unity due to low real interest rates used in this case. In this paper we show, using the example of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>pension</b> scheme, that discounting plays a crucial role, since the formula for the present discounted value of future retirement benefits is sensitive to the discount rate used.

Their average pension contribution per employee dropped {{in real terms}} from $ 2, 140 in 1981 to $ 1, 404 in 1998.

Finally, given the logic to which funded pension arrangements are subject, it is argued that the introduction of such institutions could result in a growing financialisation of the economy.

The reforms represent continuity with what went before in seeking to continue the privatisation of pension provision, but herald a new emphasis on pensioner poverty reduction. There is a clear broad strategy even though not all of the reforms fit obviously within it a generous means-tested system, extensive private provision and a diminished contributory pension. In the long term, this strategy has advantages in terms of containing public sector liabilities, but involves further downgrading the contributory principle. It will also affect the incentive to save for many individuals. Individuals currently on means-tested benefits will be able to keep more of their savings as a result of the reform. But those currently outside the means-tested benefit regime who expect to be brought into it as a result of the reforms will face a diminished incentive to save. ...|$|R

This analysis shows that a more moderate excise tax rate together with a reasonable funding threshold for asset reversions would not only enable sponsors to spend the excess funds on other corporate needs, thereby lowering the cost of sponsorship of defined benefit plans, but also would open a considerable revenue source for the government, with only a small increase in bankruptcy cost for the PBGC. Plan participants could also gain in an alternative reform, which would require a partial transfer of excess assets to them along with a still-lower reversion tax rate. These findings also hold for plan sponsors with various degrees of risk tolerance or only making the PPA-required minimum contributions. ...|$|R

However, I find that pensions had a weaker offsetting effect on wealth inequality in 2007 than in 1989. As a result, whereas standard net worth inequality showed little change from 1989 to 2007, the inequality of private augmented wealth (the sum of pension wealth and net worth) did increase over this period. These results hold up even when Social Security wealth and employer contributions to DC plans are included in the measure of wealth and when adjustments are made for future tax liabilities on retirement wealth. ...|$|R

We also study how the economic and financial crisis has affected these different schemes. Moreover, we examine the official long-run forecasts of the evolution of the unfunded pension scheme (OASDI) according to various economic and demographic scenarios. Finally, we study the nature of the public debate and the policy options for government action. Our work shows that the crisis has not jeopardized the financing of the unfunded pension scheme because the latter stays in surplus in the short and medium term. The crisis only reduced the amount of this surplus. In the long term, the accumulated trust fund should be insufficient to cover future primary deficits. A major reform can not be excluded from 2020 onwards. The financial crisis has sharply devaluated the assets of the funded pension schemes, which conducts to a problem of survival for some pension funds. Without public financial support or a sufficient recovery in financial markets, a drop in the amount of pensions is possible. US economy, pension schemes, economic crisis. ...|$|R
