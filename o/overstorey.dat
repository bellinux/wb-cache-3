25|$|Vulnerable plants {{typically}} {{die within}} a few years of infection. In southwest Western Australia, where dieback infestation is widespread, infested areas of Banksia forest typically have less than 30% of the cover of uninfested areas. Plant deaths in such large proportions can have a profound influence on the makeup of plant communities. For example, in southwestern Australia Banksia often occurs as an understorey to forests of Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), another species highly vulnerable to dieback. Infestation kills both the Jarrah <b>overstorey</b> and the original Banksia understorey, and over time these may be replaced by a more open woodland consisting of an <b>overstorey</b> of the resistant Marri (Corymbia calophylla), and an understorey of the somewhat resistant Banksia sessilis (Parrotbush).|$|E

40|$|Lichen {{species in}} the genera Cladonia (subgenus Cladina), Cetraria, Stereocaulon and Alectoria are {{important}} vegetation components on well-drained terrain and on elevated micro-sites in peatlands in boreal-Arctic regions. These lichens often form closed mats, the component thalli in which grow vertically upwards at the apices and die off in the older basal regions; they are therefore only loosely attached to the underlying soil. This growth habit is relatively unusual in lichens being found in &lt; 0. 5 % of known species. It might facilitate internal nutrienr recycling and higher growth rates and, together with the production of allelochemicals, it might underlie the considerable ecological success of mat-forming lichens; experiments to critically assess {{the importance of these}} processes are required. Mat-forming lichens can constitute in excess of 60 % of the winter food intake of caribou and reindeer. Accordingly there is a pressing need for data on lichen growth rates, measured as mass increment, in order to help determine the carrying capacity of winter ranges for rhese herbivores and to better predict recovery rates following grazing. Trampling during the snow-free season fragments lichen thalli; mat-forming lichens regenerate very successfully from thallus fragments provided trampling does nor re-occur. Frequent recurrence of trampling creates disturbed habitats from which lichens will rapidly become eliminated consistent with J. P. Grime's CSR strategy theory. Such damage to lichen ground cover has occurred where reindeer or caribou are unable to migrate away from their winter range such as on small islands or where political boundaries have been fenced; it can also occur on summer range that contains a significant lichen component and on winter range where numbers of migrarory animals become excessive. Species of Stereocaulon, and other genera that contain cyanobacteria (most notably Peltigera and Nephroma), are among the principal agents of nitrogen fixation in boreal-arctic regions. Stereocaulon-dominated subarctic woodlands provide excellent model systems in which to investigate the role of lichens in nitrogen cycling. Mat-forming lichens are sensitive indicators of atmospheric deposition partly because they occur in open situations in which they intercept precipitation and particulates directly with minimal modification by vascular plant <b>overstoreys.</b> Data from both the UK and northern Russia are presented to illustrate geographical relationships between lichen chemistry and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and acidity. The ecology of mat-fotming lichens remains under-researched and good opportunities exist for making significant contributions to this field including areas that relate directly to the management of arctic ungulates...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{relating}} to natural regeneration and tree community recovery after slash and burn agricultural practices were investigated in secondary seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) of varying land use intensity and post-disturbance management. Patterns and processes of regeneration were explored by collecting community composition data at secondary and primary sites, by conducting seedling experiments, and by investigating existing forest rehabilitation efforts in both Lao PDR (Laos) and Vietnam. In the forests surveyed in Laos, forest recovery {{in terms of}} the composition of primary forest tree species juveniles in fallow forests was high at most sites regardless of previous land use intensity. While community compositional studies indicated significant differences between primary and secondary communities, little or {{no significant differences were found}} in terms of primary tree species or family diversity, evenness, or dominance of regenerating juveniles. Significant differences appeared to be due to changes in the relative abundances of different species rather than the absence of primary forest obligate species in the secondary communities. This effect is expected to be due to the relatively common resprouting ability of SDTF species, the wide range of ecological conditions that these species can persist under, and the mosaic pattern of land-uses across the landscape. Evidence of environmental filtering affecting composition patterns in secondary communities was found for two plant traits; dispersal syndrome and plasticity of specific leaf area (SLA). Ecological strategies of primary SDTF tree species were investigated in two ways. Within the narrow range of species capable of regenerating within the primary forest environment, evidence of different life history strategies was found, indicated by significant correlations between continuous plant traits of seed size, fruit size, maximum tree height, SLA, leaf size and wood density. The correlations found largely mirrored patterns found in similar studies in Neotropical forests. Evidence of different seedling regeneration strategies was investigated by comparing species of two different successional preference groups in a seedling/light experiment. Seedlings of non-pioneer later successional species responded differently than species more associated with disturbed environments (long-lived pioneers) when exposed to both increasing absolute light treatments, and to light received under various sunfleck treatments. Earlier successional species demonstrated greater plasticity of SLA, leaf area ratio (LAR), stem elongation, and root mass ratio to increasing light. Regeneration under minimally managed monoculture and pair-wise plantations of both native and exotic species at the Laos field site was not significantly different when compared with nearby remnant primary forest in terms of diversity, evenness, and richness. Therefore, plantation <b>overstoreys</b> did not appear to be suppressing the regeneration of primary forest species. Seedlings grown in enrichment designs nearby had survival rates of approximately 50 %, and diameter increments of less than 0. 2 cm/yr after 6 to 9 years of growth. The performance of seedlings in such plantings is expected to be sufficient for conservation aims but is unlikely to encourage private investment for forestry purposes due to long expected rotation lengths. At Hai Van Pass in central Vietnam, the combination of a fast growing exotic species to capture a degraded site and ameliorate site conditions, followed by enrichment planting of native species was demonstrated to be a successful approach to reforesting degraded land, whilst funding itself through the sale of timber. The results indicate the high regeneration potential of the studied secondary forests, both in terms of observed patterns of regeneration in slash and burn fallow forests, and {{in terms of the}} general regenerative abilities of SDTF species. Decisions regarding future land-uses and secondary forest management should have consideration of this possible high level of recovery, and simple diversity sampling techniques should be included in any related processes to confirm the regeneration potential of a particular secondary forest...|$|R

50|$|Until recently, forest {{regeneration}} practices in North America have largely followed an agricultural model, with research concentrated on techniques for establishing and promoting early growth of planted stock after clearcutting (Cleary et al. 1978, Lavender et al. 1990, Wagner and Colombo 2001), followed by studies {{of growth and}} yield emphasizing single-species growth uninfluenced by <b>overstorey</b> canopy. Coates (2000) questioned this approach and proposed a shift to a more ecologically and socially based approach able to accommodate greater diversity in managed stands.

50|$|Consequent to the {{deterioration}} of the environmental conditions, the well-meaning, environmentally conscious citizens decided to rehabilitate the environment by reinvigorating the area. The first step towards this end was initiated by the National Park Service in 1972 by declaring initially an area of 65 ha of the land donated by the E. A. Green Charitable Foundation as a national park. Under Schedule 2 of The National Parks Act 1971 (Vic.), the area was declared as National Park on 12 March 1972. There were several objectives of this declaration, but the intent was to restore the park with both direct and indirect interventions to improve the ecosystem.
