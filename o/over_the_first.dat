5|$|By 1974, the {{majority}} of the freeway that US-64 was to occupy in Tulsa was complete, and it was relocated onto the completed portion of the freeway.

The next and final major modification to the designation of US-64 took place when it was moved from its route through eastern Tulsa onto the newly constructed Creek Turnpike <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> half of 1992.

5|$|In {{the days}} before the {{beginning}} of the race, there was controversy <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> stage. On arriving at the start, the teams discovered that the route used a variety of road surfaces, crossed sandy sections and included several ramps.

Although Taglioni danced and the sets were retained, the translation was eventually carried out by Meyerbeer's friend Theodor Hell. Meyerbeer wrote additional ballet music for Taglioni for the Berlin production.|$|E
5|$|Nemec's {{character}} replaced Daniel Jackson (portrayed by Michael Shanks) during season6 after Shanks {{had left}} the show amid controversy after season5. The producers based Jonas's motivation to join Stargate Command on his momentary reluctance to actively prevent Daniel's death, and his feelings of responsibility afterwards. Jonas was slowly integrated into the story in a prolonged transition stage <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> half of season6. Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season6, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season7.
