How are resource allocation decisions for the facilitation of an <b>open</b> enrollment <b>based</b> AP program determined? 3. How much funding is allocated for the facilitation of an <b>open</b> enrollment <b>based</b> AP program, what sources does the funding stem from, and what is the funding utilized for? 4. How is an <b>open</b> enrollment <b>based</b> AP program utilized to increase student achievement? [...] These questions were designed to examine the level of adequacy and equity of an <b>open</b> enrollment <b>based</b> AP program, as well as how a comprehensive high school reallocated existing resources to finance an <b>open</b> enrollment <b>based</b> AP program...|$|R

5000|$|Cloudina {{varies in}} size from a {{diameter}} of 0.3 to 6.5 mm, and 8 to 150 mm in length. [...] Fossils consist {{of a series of}} stacked vase-like calcite tubes, whose original mineral composition is unknown. Each cone traps a significant pore space beneath it, and stacks eccentrically in the one below. This results in a ridged external appearance. The overall tube is curved or sinuous, and occasionally branches. The tube walls are 8 to 50 micrometers thick, usually lying in the range 10 to 25 Î¼m. Although it used to be thought that the tubes had test-tube like bases, detailed three-dimensional reconstruction has shown that the tubes had an <b>open</b> <b>base.</b> There is evidence that the tube was flexible.|$|E

50|$|For 3G, a {{distributed}} {{base station}} architecture {{was introduced by}} Nokia, Huawei and other leading telecom equipment vendors. In this architecture the radio function unit, {{also known as the}} remote radio head (RRH), is separated from the digital function unit, or baseband unit (BBU) by fiber. Digital baseband signals are carried over fiber, using <b>Open</b> <b>Base</b> Station Architecture Initiative (the OBSAI) or Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) standard. The RRH can be installed on the top of tower close to the antenna, reducing the loss compared to the traditional base station where the RF signal has to travel through a long cable from the base station cabinet to the antenna {{at the top of the}} tower. The fiber link between RRH and BBU also allows more flexibility in network planning and deployment as they can be placed a few hundreds meters or a few kilometres away. Most modern base stations now use this decoupled architecture.|$|E

5000|$|Cloudina was {{originally}} classified in 1972 {{as a member}} of the Cribricyathea, a class known from the Early Cambrian. Glaessner (1976) accepted this classification and alsoproposed that Cloudina was similar to the annelid worms, particularly serpulid polychaetes. However, Hahn & Pflug (1985) and Conway Morris et al.. (1990) doubted both Germs' and Glaessner's suggested relationships, and were unwilling to classify it to anything more than its own family, Cloudinidae. Some specimens of Cloudina hartmannae display budding, which implies asexual reproduction. On this basis Grant (1990) classified Cloudina as a coral-like cnidarian. Since the tubes had an <b>open</b> <b>base,</b> creating a single living space rather than a series of separate chambers, Cloudina is more likely to be a stem group polychaete worm, in other words an evolutionary [...] "aunt" [...] or [...] "cousin" [...] of more recent polychaetes. This interpretation is reinforced by the even distribution of bore-holes made by predators. [...] However, as with so many Ediacaran life forms, there is great debate surrounding its position in the tree of life, and classification between the kingdom and family level may be unwise.|$|E

5000|$|The batter {{attempts}} {{to swing the}} bat and hit the ball fair (into the field of play). After a successful hit the batter becomes a baserunner (or runner) and must run to first base. The defense {{attempts to}} field the ball and may throw the ball freely between players, so one player can field the ball while another moves to a position {{to put out the}} runner. The defense can tag the runner, by touching the runner with the ball while the runner is not on a base. The defense can also touch first base while in possession of the ball; in this case it is sufficient to beat the batter to first base and an actual tag of the batter is unnecessary. A runner is said to be [...] "thrown out" [...] when the play involves two or more defensive players. Runners generally cannot be put out when touching a base, but only one runner may occupy a base at any time and runners may not pass each other. When a ball is batted into play, runners generally must attempt to advance if there are no open bases behind them; for example, a runner on first base must run to second base if the batter puts the ball in play. In such a situation, the defense can throw to the base that the lead runner is attempting to take (a force out), and the defense can then also throw to the previous base. This can result in a multiple-out play: a double play is two outs, while a triple play, a very rare occurrence, is three outs. Runners with an <b>open</b> <b>base</b> behind them are not forced to advance and do so at their own risk; the defense must tag such runners directly to put them out rather than tagging the base.|$|E
