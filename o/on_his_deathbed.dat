5|$|Furthermore, {{the late}} King had only insisted on that oath {{to protect the}} {{stability}} of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late King's royal steward, to swear that the King had changed his mind about the succession <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>deathbed,</b> nominating Stephen instead. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 22 December.|$|E

50|$|Lubach was 11 {{years old}} when his mother was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer. She died a year later. The loss of his mother, with whom he was very close, left a great impact on him, and increased his doubts about religion. After primary school, he went to the Maartenscollege in Haren. The choice was made in part because his father had promised to raise the children religiously <b>on</b> <b>his</b> mother's <b>deathbed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although the Charter of 1215 was {{a failure}} as a peace treaty, it was resurrected under the new {{government}} of the young Henry III {{as a way of}} drawing support away from the rebel faction. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>deathbed,</b> King John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal, {{one of the most famous}} knights in England. William knighted the boy, and Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, the papal legate to England, then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October.|$|E

He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>deathbed</b> always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E

5|$|In England, St-Calais {{once more}} became a leading {{advisor to the}} king. In 1093 he {{negotiated}} with Anselm, Abbot of Bec, concerning Anselm's becoming Archbishop of Canterbury; in 1095 it was St-Calais who prosecuted the royal case against Anselm after he had become archbishop. During his bishopric, St-Calais stocked the cathedral library with books, especially canon law texts. He was also active in defending the north of England against Scots raids.

5|$|It {{was only}} {{after the death of}} Ibn Killis in 991, that Mufarrij was able to return to Palestine. Ibn Killis had {{remained}} implacably opposed to Mufarrij, whom he regarded a dangerous individual: even <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>deathbed,</b> the vizier had urged al-Aziz to have Mufarrij executed should he fall into Fatimid hands, but in the event, the Caliph gave the Jarrahid a full pardon. In 992 al-Aziz invited Mufarrij to participate in the campaign against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin, but it is unclear whether Mufarrij fought in this or the subsequent campaigns, as he is not mentioned again until 996.|$|E
5|$|Larkin {{had asked}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>deathbed</b> that his diaries be destroyed. The request was granted by Jones, the main {{beneficiary}} of his will, and Betty Mackereth; the latter shredded the unread diaries page by page, then had them burned. His will {{was found to}} be contradictory regarding his other private papers and unpublished work; legal advice left the issue to the discretion of his literary executors, who decided the material should not be destroyed. When she died on 15 February 2001, Jones, in turn, left one million pounds to St Paul's Cathedral, Hexham Abbey, and Durham Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} spring Augustus {{suffered}} a severe illness, and <b>on</b> <b>his</b> supposed <b>deathbed</b> made arrangements that would ensure {{the continuation of the}} Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.|$|R

5|$|Stephen survived his doctor, {{who died}} in Moldavia in late 1503. Another Moldavian {{delegation}} was sent to Venice {{to ask for a}} replacement, but also to propose a new alliance against the Ottomans. This was one of his last acts of international diplomacy. When Stephen was dying, various boyars, who opposed Bogdan, rebelled, but they were suppressed. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>deathbed,</b> he had urged Bogdan to continue to pay the tribute to the Sultan. He died on 2 July 1504 and was buried in the Monastery of Putna.|$|E
5|$|When the General Assembly {{reversed}} {{the election results}} after a dispute, incensed Republicans armed themselves and descended on Frankfort.

Despite eventually being pardoned for any wrongdoing, he seldom returned to Kentucky. Taylor died in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1928.|$|E
50|$|During one {{rainy season}} Chief Agbadi {{and his friends}} have gone {{elephant}} hunting and having come too near the heavy creature, is thrown with a mighty tusk into a nearby sugar-cane bush and is pinned to the floor. He aims his spear at {{the belly of the}} mighty animal and kills it but not until it has wounded him badly. Agbadi passes out and it seems to all he has died. He wakes up after several days to find Ona beside him. During this period, he sleeps with her, and after eighteen days he finds out that his eldest wife Agunwa is very ill and died later. It is thought that perhaps she became ill as a result of seeing her husband <b>on</b> <b>his</b> apparent <b>deathbed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, the Genoese and Venetian trading {{communities}} in Acre came into conflict, in the [...] "War of Saint Sabas." [...] John supported the Venetians. In {{order to bring}} some order back to the kingdom, John and Bohemund VI of Antioch summoned Dowager Queen Plaisance of Cyprus {{to take over the}} regency of the kingdom for the absentee king, Conradin. Nevertheless, the Venetians defeated the Genoese in a naval battle in 1258 and the Genoese left Acre. With Plaisance and Hugh in Acre, the Ibelin family began to decline in importance, but around 1263 John began a scandalous affair with Plaisance, possibly prompting Pope Urban IV to send an official letter in protest, De sinu patris. John's wife and children were believed to have been living apart from him at the time. Maria was visiting her family in Cilicia in 1256 and 1263, and died after visiting her father, Constantine of Baberon, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own <b>deathbed.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, Wheeler and three of his {{batteries}} were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, {{they were forced to}} travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave. They soon reached the British-controlled Suez, where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the Great Bitter Lake. There, Wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to Jerusalem, where he visited Petrie <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hospital <b>deathbed.</b> Back in Egypt, he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a Wellington bomber on a bombing raid against Axis forces, to better understand {{what it was like for}} aircrew to be fired on by an anti-aircraft battery.|$|R
5|$|With the {{publishing}} {{of the first}} Swedish ecclesiastical history in 1642, {{the interpretation of the}} painting and the historical details surrounding it found a new path to follow. Relying on a publication from 1620, the sun dogs are said to have appeared first to King John III (1537–1592) <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>deathbed</b> - the painting subsequently being produced by the papist-friendly king in order to save the souls of the Protestant kingdom - and a second time before King Gustavus Adolphus shortly before his death at the Battle of Lützen in 1632.|$|E
5|$|Basset {{probably}} died in 1127, and {{was certainly}} dead in 1130. He {{is said to}} have taken ill at Northampton, and to have been clothed in a monk's habit while <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>deathbed.</b> He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey, which he left a bequest to. A copy of a charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec, recorded in a cartulary, records most of Basset's manors. While most of the estates seem to have been held by Basset as a sub-tenant, four of the estates appear to have been held as a tenant-in-chief. These estates were not very valuable, and Basset can not be considered a baron, although his son Richard managed through marriage to {{become a member of the}} barons. He held lands in nine counties, perhaps centred in Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|Charles' {{choices were}} appropriate. Philip was {{culturally}} Spanish: {{he was born}} in Valladolid and raised in the Spanish court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. Ferdinand was familiar with, and to, the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Although he too had been born in Spain, he had administered his brother's affairs in the Empire since 1531. Some historians maintain Ferdinand had also been touched by the reformed philosophies, and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained at least nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>deathbed.</b> Other historians maintain that while Ferdinand was a practicing Catholic, unlike his brother he considered religion to be outside the political sphere.|$|E
