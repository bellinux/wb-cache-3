5|$|On July 30, 2011 it was {{announced}} that Cotto would make a second defence of his WBA title against rival Antonio Margarito (38-7, 27 KOs) in a rematch to their first fight, which took place in July 2008. The fight was set to take place at Madison Square Garden on December 3, 2011. The MGM Grand was also considered as a possible venue. At first, the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) denied Margarito a boxing license on October 31, 2011. The reason for the denial was not due the cheating allegations, but instead due to the damage to Margarito's eye in the Manny Pacquiao fight. An appeal was filed and a hearing took place to where several leading eye doctors testified that Margarito should be allowed to fight. A final decision was expected on November 18, 2011. Without a license, Margarito could not fight in the state of New York. Arum initially stated that if Margarito was not licensed to fight, then Vanes Martirosyan would take his place on the card. However, Arum later stated that the fight would be moved to a venue in a state that Margarito holds a license. On November 18, 2011, the NYSAC did not make a final vote as expected. Instead, they ordered Margarito to be examined by their <b>own</b> <b>doctor.</b> Based on the findings of their <b>own</b> <b>doctor,</b> they would make a decision on whether Margarito received a license. The New York State Athletic Commission granted Antonio Margarito a license to box in New York after a hearing in Manhattan. A sold-out crowd of 21,239 {{was announced}}. Cotto avenged the defeat from 2008 stopping Margarito in the 10th round. The fight was stopped {{at the start of the}} 10th round because of the condition of Margarito's right eye, which was swollen shut. This was the same eye that was badly damaged in his fight with Pacquiao and the one that almost kept the New York State Athletic Commission from granting him his boxing license because of the special procedure that was performed on it in 2010. At the time of stoppage, Cotto lead 89-82 on all three judges scorecards. For the fight, Cottor earned a minimum $5 million, the figure would increase due to PPV shares and Margarito earned $2.5 million.|$|E

In the 1997 film Regeneration, Stuart Bunce played Owen.|$|E
25|$|There seems {{little doubt}} that Macleod's wartime injury had {{combined}} with his smoking and overwork to shorten his life. Newspaper boss Cecil King (writing in The Cecil King Diary 1970–1974) insisted that Macleod had been stricken during the 1960s by terminal cancer which had begun to affect his spine. However, Macleod's <b>own</b> <b>doctor,</b> a Dr Forster, {{said there was no}} evidence that Macleod was suffering from cancer at the time of his death.

25|$|In late August 2005, {{one month}} after Lance Armstrong's seventh {{consecutive}} Tour victory, the French sports newspaper L'Équipe claimed evidence that Armstrong had used EPO in the 1999 Tour de France. The claim was based on urine samples archived by the French National Laboratory for Doping Detection (LNDD) for research. Armstrong denied using EPO and the UCI did not penalise him {{because of the lack}} of a duplicate sample. The UCI confirmed that its <b>own</b> <b>doctor</b> Mario Zorzoli leaked the 15 forms tying Armstrong to the positive tests to L'Équipe.|$|E

500|$|Amis and {{his wife}} Jane spent September 1965 holidaying on the Greek island of Spetses and Amis used his {{experiences}} as the background to the novel. Amis followed a tradition set by Fleming of using the names of people he knew or had met during the researches for his book and Amis drew on the names of people he met in Greece for Colonel Sun. The boat Bond uses—The Altair—was {{the name of the}} boat Amis {{and his wife}} used on holiday, whilst the Bond girl's fictitious colleagues, [...] "Legakis" [...] and [...] "Papadogonas" [...] were friends who helped Amis in Greece, whilst the doctor who treats Bond in Chapter two was named after Amis and Jane's <b>own</b> <b>doctor.</b>|$|E

[...] On receiving the packet, Rodgers, who generally did not compose until Hammerstein supplied him with a lyric, immediately sat down and composed three songs. [...] Hammerstein put {{a good deal of}} his own experiences into the play. [...] According to his son, William, [...] "Most of the first act was based on his own memories of his own childhood. [...] He had always been intrigued by it, you know; his mother died when he was twelve. [...] I always felt his songs came out of his feelings about her." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Resident Evil in 1996 was {{responsible}} for its template being {{used as the basis}} for a wave of successful survival horror games, many of which were referred to as [...] "Resident Evil clones." [...] The golden age of survival horror started by Resident Evil reached its peak {{around the turn of the}} millennium with Silent Hill, followed by a general decline a few years later. Among the Resident Evil clones at the time, there were several survival horror titles that stood out, such as Clock Tower (1996) and [...] (1998) for the PlayStation. These Clock Tower games proved to be hits, capitalizing on the success of Resident Evil while staying true to the graphic-adventure gameplay of the original Clock Tower rather than following the Resident Evil formula. Another survival horror title that differentiated itself was Corpse Party (1996), an indie, psychological horror adventure game created using the RPG Maker engine. Much like Clock Tower and later Haunting Ground (2005), the player characters in Corpse Party lack any means of defending themselves; the game also featured up to 20 possible endings. However, the game would not be released in Western markets until 2011. Another game similar to the Clock Tower series of games and Haunting Ground, which was also inspired by Resident Evils success is the Korean game known as [...] (2001), this game was reportedly so scary that the developers had to release several patches adding multiple difficulty options, the game was slated for localization in 2004 but was cancelled, building on its previous success in Korea and interest, a remake has been developed in 2015. Riverhillsoft's Overblood, released in 1996, is considered one of the first survival horror games to make use of a fully three-dimensional virtual environment, second only to Riverhillsoft's <b>own</b> <b>Doctor</b> Hauzer in 1994. The Note in 1997 and Hellnight in 1998 experimented with using a real-time 3D first-person perspective rather than pre-rendered backgrounds like Resident Evil.|$|E

Finally, action taken by Count Sturmer of the Austrian Embassy in Turkey caused {{action to be taken}} from Vienna which, via the Embassy in Paris, sent a formal complaint to the French government.

When a cured Nora Fries married her <b>own</b> <b>doctor</b> and left Gotham permanently, the trauma destroys whatever is left of Fries' humanity. Mister Freeze vows to inflict on others the loss he's suffered in the episode [...] "Cold Comfort" [...] by taking away the things they value most, much to the confusion of Robin and Batgirl. When Freeze is confronted at his hideout by Batman and Batgirl, he reveals his true condition to {{them as well as}} his goal of destroying Gotham City [...] all the Dark Knight holds dear [...] by dropping a 'reverse fusion bomb' that will freeze the city. Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb. However, he is followed by Batman and they engage in a duel in which Batman uses a grappling gun to hook Freeze to the bomb and drop it into the river, where an explosion creates a huge iceberg.

In her booking photo from the arrest she appears uninjured, but for the lawsuit she submitted two pictures showing bruises all over her body. The paralegal she hired would later testify at the Jackson trial that Janet told her the beating was actually inflicted by her husband. J.C. Penney hired a psychiatrist to evaluate Janet Arvizo and found her to have rehearsed her children into supporting her story and to be both [...] "delusional" [...] and [...] "depressed," [...] although Janet's <b>own</b> <b>doctor</b> found her to be only the latter. More than two years after the original alleged incident, Janet added a further charge that one of the male officers had [...] "sexually fondled" [...] her breasts and pelvis area for [...] "up to seven minutes," [...] a claim which shocked even her lawyer.
