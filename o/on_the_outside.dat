5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the jar {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.|$|E
5|$|Cold {{seawater}} {{is used in}} the Seawater Greenhouse to both {{cool and}} humidify the interior of greenhouse-like structure. The cooling can be so effective that not only do the plants inside benefit from reduced transpiration, but dew collects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the structure and can easily be collected by gutters.|$|E
50|$|Buildings {{may have}} {{maintenance}} shafts for passage of pipes and ducts between floors. Climbing these shafts {{is known as}} shafting. The practice is similar to buildering, which is done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outsides</b> of buildings.|$|R

5|$|Duke of Marmalade did {{not appear}} again until the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October, {{for which he was}} made 4/1 second {{favourite}} despite O'Brien expressing concern over the soft ground.

5|$|Gordon led on the lap-38 restart, {{followed}} by Truex and Burton. One lap later, Burton, with assistance from Johnson, passed Gordon for the lead. Kenseth claimed first position on lap 40 after driving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> lane. Vickers followed Johnson {{on the inside}} line to reclaim the lead on the following lap, before Sadler passed Vickers around the outside for the lead on the 44th lap. On lap 45, Mears led after passing Sadler, and debris was located on the backstretch, triggering a second caution. All drivers, including Mears, elected to make pit stops. Sadler reclaimed first position and led the field back up to speed at the lap-49 restart, ahead of Mears and Kyle Busch. Hamlin and Kyle Busch led the cars driving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> lane, with Busch claiming the lead on lap 51, pulling away {{from the rest of}} the field. Kurt Busch, with help from Vickers, got ahead of Kyle Busch to move into first place.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Dal Sasso et al.. {{reported}} {{the results of}} X-ray computed tomography of the MSNM V4047 snout. As the foramina <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> all communicated with a space {{on the inside of}} the snout, the authors speculated that Spinosaurus had pressure receptors inside the space that allowed it to hold its snout at the surface of the water to detect swimming prey species without seeing them.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011 Lothian Buses {{introduced}} 60 new {{double deck}} buses. These buses continued {{with the same}} madder red and white pattern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the bus but Lothian Buses changed the seats to a matching madder red colour. They also changed {{the entrance to the}} bus to a more wooden effect. Routes 4, 5, 19, 23 and 27 were the first buses to receive this branding.|$|E
5|$|Modifications {{were made}} to the circuit from Mulsanne Corner to the Corvette Curves. The circuit was widened on the road {{connecting}} Mulsanne to Indianapolis, and again from Indianapolis to the Porsche Curves, although the kerbs remained in their previous locations. The first corner of the Porsche Curves had a larger run-off area <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> while SAFER barriers had been installed on the inside wall. The Corvette corner also now featured a gravel run-off.|$|E

5|$|More than 93,000 spectators {{attended}} the match, with fans from Sheffield travelling {{from the north}} on specially laid-on trains. Changes to the teams were made before the match, with Ted Drake available for Arsenal following an injury. Sheffield United replaced Don Bird with Bertie Williams <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> left, and Charlie Wilkinson was brought back into the team to replace Albert Cox who had played in the semi final against Fulham while Wilkinson was injured.|$|E

There are two terraces on the exterior of the building and the inside also has a kitchen area.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{mission was}} then toughened {{and made a}} bit less abstract by requiring teams {{to search for a}} toxic waste dump, map the location of partially buried randomly oriented toxic waste drums, identify the contents of each drum from the hazard labels found somewhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of each drum, and bring a sample back from one of the drums—all without any human intervention whatsoever.|$|E

30|$|Similarly, farming {{experience}} {{had a negative}} relationship with ground disposal of pesticide containers after use. This implies that as farmers gain more experience in farming, {{they are less likely}} to dispose off empty pesticide containers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> farm. Similarly, there was a positive correlation between farmers age and dumping of pesticide containers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> farm.|$|R

5|$|The {{defensive}} line (DL) consists of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT). Defensive ends line {{up on the}} ends of the line, while defensive tackles line up inside, between the defensive ends. The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and defensive tackles is to stop running plays <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> and inside, respectively, to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the linebackers can break through.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Rosey and The Hurricane {{defending}} the World Tag Team Championship against Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch. During the match, Murdoch delivered a DDT <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of the ring. WWE Medical trainers came to ringside {{to check on}} Hurricane. The match concluded when Cade pinned the legitimately injured Hurricane, to win the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} contains three sandstone fireplaces, and the countertops {{are finished}} with hand-painted tiles from Mexico. Myrtlewood is used inside as trim and for doors. Bedroom closets were constructed with drawers, shelves, and ironing boards built-in.
