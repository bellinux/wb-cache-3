40|$|Microbiological and sensorial {{characteristics}} of treated whole and peeled shrimp {{from the east}} coast of Saudi Arabia were <b>evaluated.</b> <b>Shrimp</b> samples were treated with organic acid salts with or without bifidobacterium breve culture and stored in ice. Peeling alone extended the microbiological shelf life by four days. Treatment of whole shrimp with sodium acetate alone or potassium sorbate with bifidobacteria prolonged the microbiological shelf life by three days and increased the microbial generation time from 12. 8 h (control) to 30. 1 h or 31. 4 h, respectively. The microbiological and sensory shelf life of peeled shrimp treated with sodium acetate was more than 17 days. Sodium acetate extended the microbial lag phase and lengthened the generation time (38. 7 h compared to 15. 8 h for the control). Micrococci and coryneforms were the predominant microorganisms in whole shrimp during storage.

40|$|Maintaining the {{freshness}} of shrimp is a concern to shrimp stakeholders. To improve shrimp quality management, it is of importance to <b>evaluate</b> <b>shrimp</b> spoilage characteristics. Therefore, microbiological, sensory, and chemical changes of naturally contaminated tropical brackish water shrimp (Penaeus notialis) during storage at 28 °C, 7 °C and 0 °C were assessed. H 2 S-producing bacteria were the dominant group of microorganisms at 28 °C and 7 °C whereas Pseudomonas spp. were dominant at 0 °C. Total volatile basic nitrogen and trimethylamine correlated well (R 2 > 0. 90) with the sensory scores. An empirical model to predict the shelf-life of naturally contaminated tropical shrimp {{as a function of}} storage temperature was developed. Specific groups of organisms were isolated at the sensory rejection times and assessed for spoilage potential in shrimps of which the endogenous flora was heat inactivated. Isolates capable of producing strong off-odor identified by 16 S rRNA sequencing were mainly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Enterobacteriaceae at 28 °C or 7 °C and Pseudomonas spp. and LAB at 0 °C. The study contributes to the knowledge about tropical shrimp spoilage and provides a basis for the development of methods and tools to improve shrimp quality management.

40|$|Shrimp {{breeding}} research {{focusing on}} fast growth traits {{is important to}} develop better phenotypic and genotypic characters of shrimp spawners. The aim of this research was to <b>evaluate</b> <b>shrimp</b> breeding technology to produce fry having fast growth traits. Selection was initiated from the breeding of wild shrimp spawners (F- 0)  based on full sib mating, probiotics, biosecurity, and viral diseases diagnosis. Viral disease diagnoses were performed using 7 viruses (TSV, WSSV, IHHNV, YHV, BP, MBV, and HPV) provided in the IQ- 2000 kit. The result showed that 11 families of the first generation (F- 1) shrimp were phenotypically varied (big, regular and small size). Number of fry from the first generation resulted from phenotypic selection that have fast growth trait ranged between 1. 99 % and 4. 49 % of the total fry population. Genotypic performance of the shrimp broodstock (F- 0) and the first generation (F- 1) showed different genetic variations. Heterozigosity values were 0. 2872 ± 0. 0047 (female) and  0. 5487 ± 0. 0103 (male) for shrimp broodstock (F- 0), 0. 704 ± 0. 0261 for the first generation (F- 1) having fast growth trait, and 0. 6224 ± 0. 023 for F- 1 having slow growth. Gene markers of fast growth trait were indicated by the genes with molecular weights of  1, 025; 1, 280; and 1, 325 basepairs and having different DNA sequences compared to that of slow growth shrimp...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reviews and}} <b>evaluates</b> <b>shrimp</b> pond {{culture in the}} Philippines and its {{ecological}} and socioeconomic effects. The intertwined histories of the country's mangrove forests and culture ponds are treated in depth; brackishwater aquaculture and the different shrimp culture systems are described. Intensive farming is {{discussed in terms of}} feed and water requirements, chemical inputs and waste production, and the attendant organic and nutrient overloading, longevity and toxicity of chemicals, development of antibiotic resistance, and introduction of exotic species. Most of the discussion is based on the Philippine experience, but relevant case studies from other shrimpâ€�growing countries, notably Thailand and Indonesia, and also from salmon cage culture in the temperate zone, are included. Ecologically and economically more viable, semiâ€�intensive culture is recommended as the key to the longâ€�term sustainability of the shrimp industry. Because the greatest impact of brackishwater pond culture (including shrimp farming) is the loss of mangrove habitats and their varied goods and services, massive reforestation of degraded areas should be undertaken. Other recommendations are the promotion of environmentally sound aquaculture technologies, e. g., seaweed and mollusc culture and the integrated forestryâ€�aquacultureâ€�fisheries management of mangrove plantations (tumpang sari) in coastal areas; enforcement of existing laws that protect remaining mangroves; and promulgation of new laws to regulate water use and waste disposal. Areas for future research include the prevention and control of pond wastes and shrimp diseases, and refinements of the Indonesian tumpang sari for adoption locally...|$|R
