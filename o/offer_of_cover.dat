50|$|From 1915, {{the high}} {{peaks of the}} Dolomites range were an area of fierce {{mountain}} warfare. In order to protect their soldiers from enemy fire and the hostile alpine environment, both Austro-Hungarian and Italian military engineers constructed fighting tunnels which <b>offered</b> a degree <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> and allowed better logistics support. Working at high altitudes in the hard carbonate rock of the Dolomites, often in exposed areas near mountain peaks and even in glacial ice, required extreme skill of both Austro-Hungarian and Italian miners.|$|R

The player is generally informed when both moving their units and firing on the opponent when cover comes into play.|$|R

We <b>offer</b> a model <b>of</b> <b>covered</b> bonds that features the bankruptcy remoteness and replenishment of the asset pool that backs secured funding. Encumbering assets allows a bank to raise cheap secured debt and expand profitable investment, but it also concentrates risk on unsecured debt and thus exacerbates fragility.

In addition to building underground shelters and covered supply routes for their soldiers, both sides also attempted to break the stalemate of trench warfare by tunneling under no man's land and laying large quantities of explosives beneath the enemy's positions. On 17 September 1916, Italian troops fired a mine on Monte Cimone di Tonezza in an unsuccessful attempt to halt a mining attack by Austro-Hungarian soldiers, but on 23 September 1916 the Austro-Hungarians still fired that mine. The resulting explosion created a crater 50 m wide and 22 m deep on the Monte Cimone summit. The Italians lost 1137 men in the detonation and ensuing battle, of which 500 were taken prisoner.|$|R

Looff decided to move his ship further upriver, to make it more difficult for the British to destroy her.

Policy Public officials (including Councillors and employees of Council) have an obligation to carry out their duties conscientiously, honestly and objectively. “Public officials and employees must: Never solicit gifts and benefits; Never accept gifts of money; Always consider the value and purpose of a gift or benefit before making any decisions about accepting it. ” If an employee becomes aware of a staff member soliciting gifts or benefits or accepting money, he or she must report it immediately to the General Manager. If an officer (or Councillor) is <b>offered</b> a gift <b>of</b> money (including <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> money to <b>cover</b> expenses for trips to view samples of work etc) it should be refused and the incident reported immediately to the officer’s supervisor, the General Manager or, {{in the case of a}} Councillor, to the Mayor. In deciding whether to accept a gift, consideration needs to be given to: The motive of the gift giver; The actual or perceived effect of the gift; The cost of the gift; and Other situational factors. In circumstance where an <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> a gift is made which may constitute a bribe, or an attempt to bribe, it is not only appropriate that the offer be rejected, but it is also important that the fact that the offer was made be reported to the appropriate person within the Council (the General Manager or the Manager Administrative Services or the Mayor, if the offer is made to a Councillor) and to the ICAC. The ICAC’s brochure on bribery details the steps to be taken should a public employee or Councillor be offered a bribe or otherwise suspects that bribery has occurred...|$|R
