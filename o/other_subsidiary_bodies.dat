40|$|Social {{sector is}} an {{integral}} part of public service in any society. In each state, a contemporary system of institutions and organizations has gradually evolved in social administration, and the institutions are more or less interrelated and complement each other, or they compete. Although contemporary systems in various European countries differ from each other, they have common roots in the European social doctrine. It is based on the principles of human right of dignity, freedom, solidarity and participation in democratic governance. Within the transformation of the social security system to the system of social protection of citizens in the early 1990 s, and in accordance with a scenario of social reforms, work began on the creation of three interrelated and relatively independent systems [...] the systems of social insurance, state social support, and social assistance. What is substantial for this system to function properly is the relationship between the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, as the highest umbrella body that manages, directs methodically and controls the administration performance in a relevant sector (insurance, support or care) and all the <b>other</b> <b>subsidiary</b> <b>bodies</b> of the entire social security system involved in covering a given agenda. For that reason, it was also necessary to establish necessary institutions and institutes for the purpose of fulfilling the objectives. The objective of this paper is to map the valid legislation related to public service in the social sector, to analyze any changes in the legislation related to public service in the social sector and to define the advantages and disadvantages of these legislative changes. The method of analysis of secondary sources and the content analysis of data covering the public service in the social sector were chosen for the practical part of this paper. An analysis, a synthesis and a comparison were made of documents from the sectors of public service, social security, insurance, state social support, and social care with emphasis laid on the legislation related to the reform of public service in the social sector. The results have shown that the current form of the public service in the social sector encompassed, through legislative changes, all the needs of citizens to the maximum possible extent. The reform measures have also led to improvements in the accessibility of institutions for citizens and, thanks to powers delegated to the municipalities with extended powers, institutions are more accessible. However, the results point to certain drawbacks brought about by the social reform; these drawbacks must be removed trough legislative changes in the course of the ongoing reform...|$|E
40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] The Arctic in World Affairs: A North Pacific Dialogue on International Cooperation in a Changing Arctic {{addresses}} future cooperation in five areas: patterns of Arctic investment, national Arctic strategies, Arctic state/non-Arctic state engagement, innovations applicable to the Arctic and indigenous responses to Arctic development. Bringing together prominent experts from the three North Pacific Arctic coastal states (Canada, Russia, and the United States) and three leading North Pacific non-Arctic states (China, Japan, and Korea), the book goes beyond generalities; it attempts to identify and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} innovative measures that will contribute to maintaining the Arctic as a zone of peace and promoting sustainable development in this region. Regarding patterns of Arctic investment, the book addresses Arctic natural resource development and linkages to global markets using Arctic shipping as a prominent example, but also taking a broader perspective on business and the investment environment in the Arctic. On national Arctic strategies, the book compares the national Arctic strategies of key Arctic states (Canada, Russia, and the U. S.) and those of key non-Arctic states (China, Japan, Korea), focusing on the main themes of these strategies and prospects for their implementation. Comparing national Arctic strategies will provide an understanding of the driving forces and interests behind Arctic policy formulation. In the case of Arctic state/non-Arctic state engagement, the book examines the efforts of non-Arctic states {{to play a role in}} addressing Arctic issues. The book briefly identifies areas of interest and priority issues for China, Japan, and Korea, and will review any previous experiences with the Arctic Council working groups (AMAP, PAME, EPPR, SDWG, CAFF and ACAP) and <b>other</b> <b>subsidiary</b> <b>bodies.</b> On innovations applicable to the Arctic, the book reviews developments in the area of R&D and explore their implications for the development of Arctic infrastructure. Regarding indigenous responses to Arctic development, the book devotes special attention to enhancing the understanding of non-Arctic actors regarding Arctic peoples and exploring opportunities for cooperation across this divide. Now that Korea, Japan and China are Arctic Council non-Arctic state observers, the new reality for these nations is that there are six indigenous groups sitting at the table with the Arctic states as Permanent Participants (and most are joining in the work of the technical working groups). The book attempts to fill gaps in knowledge regarding the maritime Arctic, identifying remaining uncertainties, and developing policy innovations that can promote peaceful and sustainable uses of Arctic resources in the future...|$|E
