They are then seasoned {{with salt and}} pepper, coated with plain, coarse cornmeal, and shallow fried in bacon fat {{for a few minutes}} each side, <b>or</b> <b>until</b> <b>golden</b> <b>brown.</b> Shallow frying is preferred, as the tomatoes do not float in the oil, which allows the weight of the tomato to press the cornmeal to the underside of the tomato.
