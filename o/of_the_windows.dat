5|$|Czechoslovakia's {{hardline}} {{communist government}} agreed {{to close its}} border with East Germany to choke off the exodus. The closure produced uproar across East Germany and the GDR government's bid to humiliate refugees by expelling them from the country in sealed trains backfired disastrously. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw them out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> When the trains passed through Dresden, 1,500East Germans stormed the main railway station {{in an attempt to}} board.

5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts.

More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, a {{landmine}} exploded {{near the}} south {{aisle of the}} cathedral, resulting in {{the roof of the}} nave collapsing and the shattering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> Sir Charles Nicholson was hired to rebuild the roof, and made the decision to remove the altarpiece that Rossetti had added to the north aisle. In 1949, Nicholson was replaced with George Pace of York, who in coordination with the dean at the time, Glyn Simon, saw a number of improvements in the modern style, though many fittings were clearly still influenced by the Gothic.|$|E

5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> are all asymmetrical in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} to be a dovecote took place around 1780. Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh, and dung. Although {{it is now}} a roofless ruin with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> blocked up, it previously had a chimney and the fireplace can still be seen. The National Trust acquired the freehold from Sir Henry Hugh Arthur Hoare of the Hoare baronets, whose family seat was at Stourhead, in 1915. The tower was subsequently designated as a scheduled monument in 1953 and a listed building (Grade II*) in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The {{courthouse}} is elaborately windowed. Some windows, {{mostly on}} the first floor are straight topped. On the second floor most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> are topped with limestone arches. The original, wood-framed windows were replaced in 1972. The building's two main entrances feature stone arches over recessed doors; eleven step stairways lead to both doors. New doors were installed in both entrances in 1971.|$|E

40|$|A photogrammetric {{method of}} stress {{analysis}} {{has been developed}} to test thin, nonstandard windows designed for hydrogen absorbers, major components of a muon cooling channel. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absorber <b>window</b> tests is to demonstrate an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> behavior and strength {{as a function of}} applied pressure. This is done by comparing <b>the</b> deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> measured via photogrammetry, to the deformation predicted by finite element analysis (FEA).

Photogrammetric methods were chosen to measure <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> thus providing data that are more accurate to the FEA.
