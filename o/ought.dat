5|$|I {{have never}} {{mentioned}} the boy's name except to Probyn, Montagu and Knollys {{when they were}} acting for me and I thought they <b>ought</b> to know. Had they been wise, hearing what I knew and therefore what others knew, they <b>ought</b> to have hushed the matter up, instead of stirring it up as they did, with all the authorities.|$|E
5|$|If we {{see that}} Germany is winning we <b>ought</b> to help Russia, and if Russia is winning we <b>ought</b> to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as {{possible}} although I don't want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Resolved, {{that these}} United Colonies are, and of right <b>ought</b> to be, free and {{independent}} States, {{that they are}} absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection {{between them and the}} State of Great Britain is, and <b>ought</b> to be, totally dissolved.|$|E
5|$|Some ignorant clerics reject {{calculations}} {{of this kind}} (for shame!) and {{do not wish to}} keep their phylacteries, that is, they do not preserve the order, which they have received in the bosom of mother church, nor do they persist in the holy teaching of meditation. They should consider carefully the way of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and they should spit out their doctrine like filth. A cleric <b>ought</b> to be the keeper of his own soul, just as a noble man subjects a young foal to the yoke, so he <b>ought</b> to subject his own soul to service, by filling the alabaster box with precious oil, that is, he <b>ought</b> to be inwardly subjected daily, by obeying the divine laws and admonitions of the Redeemer.|$|E
5|$|The assert statement, {{used during}} {{debugging}} {{to check for}} conditions that <b>ought</b> to apply.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they <b>ought</b> to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they <b>ought</b> to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they <b>ought</b> to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they <b>ought</b> not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E
5|$|We should infer in {{the case}} of a {{beautiful}} dwelling-place that it was built for its owners and not for mice; we <b>ought,</b> therefore, in the same way to regard the universe as the dwelling-place of the gods.|$|E
25|$|Ishihara {{has said}} that Japan <b>ought</b> to have nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|Every AA group <b>ought</b> to {{be fully}} self-supporting, declining outside contributions.|$|E
25|$|Some sources also {{indicate}} that bayonet charges already {{were known to be}} hopeless, and that Beck <b>ought</b> to have known this. The regulations had a procedure for bayonet charges, and this makes the criticism by Beck unreasonable. At the same time it can contribute to explain the outcome - {{to the extent that it}} is correct that bayonet charges already <b>ought</b> to have been disused.|$|E
25|$|The {{relation}} must be {{one which}} {{in the opinion of}} the community <b>ought</b> to be sedulously fostered.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial was}} fair in all respects, and {{mitigating}} evidence <b>ought</b> {{to be presented}} with damaging evidence when available.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholics Anonymous has {{no opinion}} on outside issues; hence the AA name <b>ought</b> never {{be drawn into}} public controversy.|$|E
25|$|Benny: You <b>ought</b> {{to do well}} in pictures, Mr. Allen, {{now that}} Boris Karloff is back in England.|$|E
25|$|Whereas Singer is {{primarily}} concerned with improving the treatment of animals and accepts that, in some hypothetical scenarios, individual animals might be used legitimately to further human or nonhuman ends, Regan believes we <b>ought</b> to treat nonhuman animals as we would humans. He applies the strict Kantian ideal (which Kant himself applied only to humans) that they <b>ought</b> never to be sacrificed {{as a means to}} an end, and must be treated as ends in themselves.|$|E
25|$|Within {{this broad}} understanding, however, {{there are a}} number of views {{regarding}} exactly how this doctrine <b>ought</b> to be interpreted.|$|E
25|$|AA, as such, <b>ought</b> {{never be}} organized; {{but we may}} create service boards or {{committees}} directly responsible to those they serve.|$|E
25|$|In sum, Garry {{suggests}} that humans have obligations to nonhuman animals; however, animals do not, and <b>ought</b> not to, have uninfringible rights against humans.|$|E
25|$|The sixth Law is that upon caution of {{the future}} time, a man <b>ought</b> to pardon the {{offences}} past of them that repenting, desire it.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{economics}} is positive, seeking {{to describe and}} predict economic phenomena. Normative economics seeks to identify what economies <b>ought</b> to be like.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus’ ideas {{found their}} {{reflection}} in the Geography of Ptolemy. In essence, Ptolemy's work is an extended attempt to realize Hipparchus’ vision of what geography <b>ought</b> to be.|$|E
25|$|His {{definition}} of liberty, influenced by Joseph Priestley and Josiah Warren, {{was that the}} individual <b>ought</b> {{to be free to}} do as he wishes unless he harms others.|$|E
25|$|If {{it is in}} {{our power}} to prevent {{something}} bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, then we <b>ought,</b> morally, to do it.|$|E
25|$|Modal or {{auxiliary}} verbs (ວິກະຕິກິລິຍາ, vikatikiligna) are verbs {{that serve}} auxiliary function, such as want, obligation or need like English <b>ought</b> to, should, must, can, etc.|$|E
25|$|Note that X7Rs {{have better}} {{frequency}} response than C0Gs. It makes sense, however, since class 2 capacitors are {{much smaller than}} class 1, so they <b>ought</b> to have lower parasitic inductance.|$|E
25|$|The Prime Minister, or the Chief Justice after {{consulting}} with the Prime Minister, may represent to the President that a Judge <b>ought</b> {{to be removed}} on {{one or more of}} the above grounds.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} he was {{transferred}} from Blue Book in 1963, Friend thought that Blue Book was effectively useless and <b>ought</b> to be dissolved, even if it caused an outcry amongst the public.|$|E
25|$|An AA group <b>ought</b> never endorse, finance, or lend the AA name to any related {{facility}} {{or outside}} enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert {{us from our}} primary purpose.|$|E
25|$|It is usual to {{say that}} Mill is {{committing}} a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the naturalistic fallacy, because {{he is trying to}} deduce what people <b>ought</b> to do from what they in fact do; the fallacy of equivocation, because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it <b>ought</b> to be desired; and the fallacy of composition, because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.|$|E
25|$|More generally, {{the defense}} would be denied to people {{experiencing}} symptoms of intoxication {{who continued to}} consume the spiked drink because they <b>ought</b> to have known {{what was happening to}} them. Equally, if no further consumption occurred but they <b>ought</b> to have recognized that they were affected by an unknown substance, beginning an activity such as driving would not fall within the defense. In other words, the policy underpinning the operation of the law favors the protection of the public as against the interests of an individual who recklessly or with wilful blindness exposes the public to danger.|$|E
25|$|Typically, casuistic {{reasoning}} {{begins with}} a clear-cut paradigmatic case. In legal reasoning, for example, {{this might be a}} precedent case, such as premeditated murder. From it, the casuist would ask how closely the given case currently under consideration matches the paradigmatic case. Cases like the paradigmatic case <b>ought</b> to be treated likewise; cases unlike the paradigm <b>ought</b> to be treated differently. Thus, a man is properly charged with premeditated murder if the circumstances surrounding his case closely resemble the exemplary premeditated murder case. The less a given case is like the paradigm, the weaker the justification is for treating that case like the paradigmatic case.|$|E
25|$|Unless the {{receiver}} knew, or <b>ought</b> {{to have known}} that the document did not truly reflect the debtor’s intention, it will not avail the debtor to argue that he made an inappropriate choice of words.|$|E
25|$|What {{we have to}} do is to reform, to civilize our masquerades, {{because we}} <b>ought</b> not to let these days of popular {{diversion}} disappear from among us, in a country that has suffered so much.|$|E
25|$|The fourteenth law is {{that those}} things which cannot be enjoyed in common, nor divided, <b>ought</b> to be adjudged to the first possessor; {{and in some cases}} to the first born, as {{acquired}} by lot.|$|E
25|$|Because of Judea's {{status as}} a Roman client kingdom, Herod's plans for the {{succession}} had to be ratified by Augustus. The three heirs therefore travelled to Rome to make their claims, Antipas arguing he <b>ought</b> to inherit the whole kingdom and the others maintaining that Herod's final will <b>ought</b> to be honored. Despite qualified support for Antipas from Herodian family members in Rome, who favoured direct Roman rule of Judea but considered Antipas preferable to his brother, Augustus largely confirmed the division of territory set out by Herod in his final will. Archelaus had, however, to be content with the title of ethnarch rather than king.|$|E
25|$|Harrington Emerson (1853 – 1931) began {{determining}} what industrial plants' products and costs {{were compared to}} what they <b>ought</b> to be in 1895. Emerson did not meet Taylor until December 1900, and the two never worked together.|$|E
