5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, {{it can be argued}} that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|Fellow {{players on}} the Italian {{national}} team nicknamed Pirlo l'architetto ("the Architect"), because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he buildt plays, and set up goal-scoring opportunities with long, lobbed through passes. In later seasons, Juventus fans also dubbed him il professore ("the professor"), Maestro, and Mozart, as {{a reference to the}} Austrian composer's prodigious ability. Pirlo was also frequently compared to fellow former Milan and Italy playmaker Demetrio Albertini early in his Milan career, due to their similar characteristics and style of play. Pirlo was often thought to be Albertini's heir for Milan and the national side; he inherited his nickname the metronome whilst playing at Milan, for the way in which he influenced games by controlling the tempo of his team's play through his direct and efficient passing game in midfield, as well as his ability to make himself available to teammates to receive and distribute the ball.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1130s England began to descend into {{a period of}} civil war known as the Anarchy, during which the {{supporters}} of King Stephen fought {{with those of the}} Empress Matilda for control of the kingdom. William de Mohun's eldest son, also called William, was a noted supporter of Matilda, and Dunster was considered one of her faction's strongest castles in the south-west. In 1138 forces loyal to Stephen besieged the castle; a siege castle was built nearby, but all trace of it has been lost. William successfully held the castle and was made the Earl of Somerset by the grateful Empress. Chroniclers subsequently complained <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he subsequently raided and controlled the region by force during the war, causing much destruction. In the aftermath of the conflict, William's son, another William, inherited the castle after a short period of royal ownership under Henry II. William appears to have insisted that his tenants agree to help repair and maintain the castle walls as part of their feudal service.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> liberal governmentality – <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> {{governing}} through freedom – might usefully generate a specifically sociological insight into some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which Indigenous peoples are currently governed in the Australian context.

However, Diogo did conduct an inquiry into the plot, the text of which was sent to Portugal in 1552 and gives us an excellent idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> plotters hoped to overthrow the king by enticing his supporters to abandon him.|$|E
25|$|When {{artificial}} light affects organisms and ecosystems {{it is called}} ecological light pollution. While light at night can be beneficial, neutral, or damaging for individual species, its presence invariably disturbs ecosystems. For example, some species of spiders avoid lit areas, while other species are happy to build their spider web directly on a lamp post. Since lamp posts attract many flying insects, the spiders that don't mind light, gain an advantage over the spiders that avoid it. This is a simple example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> species frequencies and food webs can be disturbed {{by the introduction of}} light at night.|$|E

25|$|Late Precambrian {{rocks are}} {{widespread}} on Anglesey, Llŷn and Arfon with other, more restricted occurrences in north Pembrokeshire, Radnorshire and Carmarthenshire. The often intensive metamorphism which these originally volcanic and sedimentary rocks {{have been subjected}} to and their generally faulted relationship to neighbouring rocks has meant that geologists’ understanding of them has been limited. The majority lie on or close to the margins of terranes, blocks of the Earth’s crust which have had differing geological histories before assuming their present configuration. However, in recent years there has been a progressive elucidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Wales’ many terranes came together during the late Precambrian and the Palaeozoic era.|$|E
25|$|While the 2/7th Independent Company {{had been}} {{involved}} in the campaign in New Guinea, there had been a significant re-organisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Independent Companies were administered and organised. This was due to an army-wide reorganisation as the Australian Army shifted its strategic focus away from the Middle East and began to concentrate on the Pacific. As a result of this reorganisation, the 2/7th Independent Company was renamed the 2/7th Cavalry Commando Squadron (later just commando squadron) and was absorbed into the 2/6th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment, along with the newly formed 2/9th and 2/10th Commando Squadrons.

The drawings, for the most part, are not original designs. They are drawn from buildings and artworks that he saw on his travels. In order that they might be utilised as designs for students, they were carefully annotated by a skilled calligrapher and placed into a leather portfolio.
