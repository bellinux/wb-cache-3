60|$|Window {{apertures}} {{are mainly}} of two kinds; those for outlook, and those for inlet of light, many being for both purposes, and either purpose, or both, combined in military architecture {{with those of}} offence and defence. But all window apertures, as compared with door apertures, have almost infinite licence of form and size: they may be of any shape, from the slit or cross slit to the circle;[56] of any size, from the loophole of the castle to the pillars of light of the cathedral apse. Yet, according to their place and purpose, one or two laws of fitness hold respecting them, which let us examine in the two classes of windows successively, but without reference to military architecture, which here, as before, we may dismiss as a subject of separate science, only noticing that windows, like all other features, are always delightful, if not beautiful, when their position and shape have indeed been thus necessarily determined, and that many of their most picturesque forms have resulted from the requirements of war. We should also find in military architecture the typical forms of the two classes of <b>outlet</b> <b>and</b> <b>inlet</b> windows in their utmost development; the greatest sweep of sight and range of shot on the one hand, and the fullest entry of light and air on the other, being constantly required at the smallest possible apertures.

For the appropriate adjustment of the gas boiler to the conditions of the building, computer-generated calculation results have to be obtained which can help the positioning of the appliance and the air supply outlets in the room in which the appliance is installed. Chimneys of natural draught are very sensitive to the changes in the amount of combustion air due to inside or outside ambient phenomena or forced effects. For the purposes of modelling, a numerical simulation (CFD method) can be used. The aim of numeric modelling is to investigate velocity and temperature conditions around the flue gas <b>outlet</b> <b>and</b> in the room and, subsequently, to define design approaches and the requirements for different conditions.

50|$|Mixing systems {{generally}} {{supply air}} {{such that the}} supply air mixes with the room air so that the mixed air is at the room design temperature and humidity. In cooling mode, the cool supply air, typically around 55 °F (13 °C) (saturated) at design conditions, exits an outlet at high velocity. The high velocity supply air stream causes turbulence causing the room air to mix with the supply air. Because the entire room is near-fully mixed, temperature variations are small while the contaminant concentration is fairly uniform throughout the entire room. Diffusers are normally used as the air outlets to create the high velocity supply air stream. Most often, the air <b>outlets</b> <b>and</b> <b>inlets</b> are placed in the ceiling. Supply diffusers in the ceiling are fed by fan coil units in the ceiling void or by air handling units in a remote plant room. The fan coil or handling unit take in return air from the ceiling void and mix this with fresh air and cool, or heat it, as required to achieve the room design conditions. This arrangement is known as 'conventional room air distribution'.|$|R

This experiment showed that the soil variability affects significantly the CH 4 emissions not only among different fields, but also within a field (Figure  4 a and b). Spatial variability of CH 4 emissions among toposequence positions was related to transportation and deposition of organic-rich sediment materials within toposequence rice fields in Viet Nam (Oo et al. 2013). In the current study, the observed high rates of CH 4 emission from the 1 st <b>outlet</b> <b>and</b> 2 nd <b>inlet</b> positions were associated with a high clay, TC and organic matter content (Tables  1 and 3).
