5|$|The Argentine–Chilean naval {{arms race}} was {{extremely}} expensive for both countries. The Argentine government {{was able to}} purchase £4,534,800 worth of ships between 1890 and 1898 with large foreign loans, which were given to them despite the country's role in the Baring crisis of 1890. The government's total foreign debt reached 421million gold pesos by 1896. As for Chile, it was forced {{to take out a}} £2million pound loan in order to purchase Krupp weaponry, and this combined with its <b>other</b> <b>loans</b> led the banking industry to suspend loans to Chile until the diplomatic crisis with Argentina was solved. Both the Argentine President Julio Argentino Roca and American ambassador to Argentina William Paine Lord ascribed the ending of the arms race to the diminished credit of Argentina and Chile.|$|E
25|$|Even more, {{it was the}} Harju Bank {{that belonged}} among others to Päts and Westel that transacted many of the gold sales. Päts, Westel and other big businessmen, mostly members of Päts's Farmers' Unions party, have thus been accused to use this {{transaction}} money for their own good. It has also been claimed that the Bank of Estonia gave out several loans to enterprises that were related to Päts's activities and almost all <b>other</b> <b>loans</b> were given to enterprises related {{to the members of}} the bank's own council and other top-level politicians. Having big loans was also the reason why Päts, Westel and other top-level politicians did not fight with the hyperinflation at the time.|$|E
25|$|Income {{tax refund}} {{anticipation}} loans are not technically payday loans (because they are repayable upon receipt of the borrower's income tax refund, not at his next payday), {{but they have}} similar credit and cost characteristics. A car title loan is secured by the borrower's car, but are available only to borrowers who hold clear title (i.e., no <b>other</b> <b>loans)</b> to a vehicle. The maximum amount of the loan is some fraction of the resale value of the car. A similar credit facility seen in the UK is a logbook loan secured against a car's logbook, which the lender retains. These loans may be available on slightly better terms than an unsecured payday loan, since they are less risky to the lender. If the borrower defaults, then the lender can attempt to recover costs by repossessing and reselling the car.|$|E

There are approximately 500 homeless persons in Croatia, largely living in Zagreb.|$|E
2500|$|The {{investments}} {{were called}} synthetic CDOs because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations, {{the principal and}} interest they paid out came not from mortgages or <b>other</b> <b>loans,</b> but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as [...] "credit default swaps". Goldman and some other hedge funds held a [...] "short" [...] position in the securities, paying the premiums, while the investors (insurance companies, pension funds, etc.) receiving the premiums were the [...] "long" [...] position.

2500|$|Due to Section 731, it is {{generally}} regarded that Arkansas-based banks now have no usury limit for credit cards or for any loan of greater than $2,000 (since Alabama, Regions' home state, has no limits on those loans), with a limit of 18% (the minimum usury limit in Texas) or more on all <b>other</b> <b>loans.</b> [...] However, once Wells Fargo fully completed its purchase of Century Bank (a Texas bank with Arkansas branches), Section 731 did away with all usury limits for Arkansas-based banks since Wells Fargo's main bank charter is based in South Dakota, which repealed its usury laws many years ago.|$|E

2500|$|A {{non-recourse loan}} is secured by {{the value of}} {{property}} (usually real estate) owned by the debtor. [...] However, unlike <b>other</b> <b>loans,</b> which oblige the debtor to repay the amount borrowed, a non-recourse loan is fully satisfied merely by {{the transfer of the}} property to the creditor, even if the property has declined in value and is worth less than the amount borrowed. [...] When such a loan is created, the creditor bears the risk that the property will decline sharply in value (in which case the creditor is repaid with property worth less than the amount borrowed), and the debtor does not bear the risk of decrease in property value (because the debtor is guaranteed the right to use the property, regardless of value, to satisfy the debt.) ...|$|E

The money would not last long and if he had not borrowed it, he might have paid the interest on <b>other</b> <b>loans.</b> Buying the sheep had really decided him to give the mortgage, since it had made him feel keenly the embarrassment of having very little money at command.

He could not see Hayes' object and felt suspicious, but while he pondered it began to rain and he went into the house.|$|E
60|$|The {{same effect}} on {{interest}} which {{is produced by}} government loans for war expenditure is produced by the sudden opening of any new and generally attractive mode of permanent investment. The only instance of the kind in recent history, on a scale {{comparable to that of}} the war loans, is the absorption of capital in the construction of railways. This capital must have been principally drawn from the deposits in banks, or from savings which would have gone into deposit, and which were destined to be ultimately employed in buying securities from persons who would have employed the purchase-money in discounts or <b>other</b> <b>loans</b> at interest: in either case, it was a draft on the general loan fund. It is, in fact, evident that, unless savings were made expressly to be employed in railway adventure, the amount thus employed must have been derived either from the actual capital of persons in business or from capital which would have been lent to persons in business.|$|E
