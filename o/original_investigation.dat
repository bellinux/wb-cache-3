5|$|As {{with the}} 1963 {{assassination}} of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's death {{has been the}} subject of widespread analysis.

5|$|Richard Ferguson QC, for the defence, {{argued that}} the ESDA test, which {{suggested}} that the disputed words had {{been added to the}} notes later, was not reliable. The defence also produced 14 witness statements from the two Blakelock inquiries, seven of them excerpts from Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry and seven from the <b>original</b> <b>investigation</b> in 1985, the latter read out to the jury as statements H to N.

5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the <b>original</b> <b>investigation</b> into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that {{legislation}} would be introduced to aid police officers in accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners. Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise the age at which one could own a gun, or whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009.|$|E

Ogden continued to claim the woman was not actually dead. After being arrested, Ogden consented to sign the certificate on May 4, 1937, but the authorities still could not find the body. Finally, a former member came forward and confessed to having helped her cremate the corpse shortly after the <b>original</b> <b>investigation,</b> in August 1935.

25|$|The body found beside Alistair in the <b>original</b> <b>investigation</b> was {{not that}} of his wife, but that of Dorothea; Margaret had died a month earlier {{at the hands of}} her sister, who fatally injured her as part of a {{psychotic}} episode. Before she died, she made her husband promise to protect her sister from arrest, to which both he and Zélie concealed the truth by planting Margaret's body {{at the foot of a}} cliff and fabricating the story that it was Dorothea who had died. Dorothea then took her sister's place. While she fooled the servants easily, she could not fool the Ravenscrofts' dog, which could distinguish between the sisters, thus explaining why it bit her. A month later, Alistair murdered her to prevent her from injuring anyone else, making certain she held the revolver before she was killed, and then committed suicide afterwards. Desmond and Celia recognise the sadness of the true events, but now knowing the facts are able to face a future together.|$|E

During their conversation, Mrs Burton-Cox askes her an important question regarding the deaths of Celia's parents - {{was one of them}} murdered, and if so, who killed who? Ten years earlier, the bodies of Margaret Ravenscroft, a close school friend of Oliver, and General Alistair Ravenscroft, Margaret's husband, were found near their manor house in Overcliffe. The <b>original</b> <b>investigation</b> into their deaths revealed that both had bullet wounds, and that a revolver found between their bodies bore the fingerprints of the married couples, making it impossible to prove whether {{it was a case of}} double suicide or if it was a murder/suicide and who then was the victim and the other the murderer. The death of the Ravenscrofts left both Celia and another of their children orphaned.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013 Justice Haddon-Cave granted {{permission}} for a judicial review since the original burial plans [...] ignored {{the common law}} duty [...] "to consult widely as to how and where Richard III's remains should appropriately be reinterred". [...] The judicial review opened on 13 March 2014 and was expected to last two days but the decision was deferred for four to six weeks. Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with Justice Ouseley and Justice Haddon-Cave, said the court would take time to consider its judgment. On 23 May the High Court ruled there was [...] "no duty to consult" [...] and [...] "no public law grounds for the court to interfere", so reburial in Leicester could proceed.

500|$|In a BBC investigative {{documentary}} {{broadcast in}} December 2014, an antique firearms collector named Dennis Meighan {{claimed that he}} had been hired by an unidentified senior Liberal to kill Scott, for a fee of £13,500. Having initially agreed, [...] Meighan says, he [...] changed his mind, but provided Newton with the gun used in the shooting. After confessing to the police, he was asked to sign a prepared statement which, according to him, [...] "left everything out that was incriminating, {{but at the same time}} everything I said about the Liberal Party, Jeremy Thorpe, et cetera, was left out as well." [...] The [...] BBC's Tom Mangold said that Meighan's account, if true, indicated the existence of [...] "a conspiracy at the very highest level".

500|$|The {{director}} of the <b>original</b> <b>investigation</b> stated that, [...] "the towers really did amazingly well. The terrorist aircraft didn't bring the buildings down; it was the fire which followed. It was proven that you could take out {{two thirds of the}} columns in a tower and the building would still stand." [...] The fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors, making the floors sag. The sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward. With the damage to the core columns, the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings, causing them to collapse. Additionally, the report found the towers' stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate emergency escape for people above the impact zones. NIST concluded that uncontrolled fires in 7WTC caused floor beams and girders to heat and subsequently [...] "caused a critical support column to fail, initiating a fire-induced progressive collapse that brought the building down".|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} exercise-induced {{oxidative}} stress has received considerable attention in recent years, with close to 300 <b>original</b> <b>investigations</b> published {{since the early}} work of Dillard and colleagues in 1978. Single bouts of aerobic and anaerobic exercise can induce an acute state of oxidative stress. This is indicated by an increased presence of oxidized molecules {{in a variety of}} tissues. Exercise mode, intensity, and duration, as well as the subject population tested, all can impact the extent of oxidation. Moreover, the use of antioxidant supplements can impact the findings. Although a single bout of exercise often leads to an acute oxidative stress, in accordance with the principle of hormesis, such an increase appears necessary to allow for an up-regulation in endogenous antioxidant defenses. This review presents a comprehensive summary of <b>original</b> <b>investigations</b> focused on exercise-induced oxidative stress. This should provide the reader with a well-documented account of the research done within this area of science over the past 30 years...|$|R
