5|$|The Watch (previously {{known as}} Neighborhood Watch) is a 2012 American science fiction comedy film {{directed}} by Akiva Schaffer and written by Jared Stern, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. It stars Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade. The film follows Evan (Stiller), Bob (Vaughn), Franklin (Hill), and Jamarcus (Ayoade), a group <b>of</b> <b>neighbors</b> who form a suburban neighborhood watch group. When they uncover an alien plot threatening the world, {{they are forced}} into action.|$|E
5|$|Gernet {{points out}} that {{disputes}} requiring arrest were mostly avoided or settled privately. Yet historian Patricia Ebrey states that legal cases in the Song period portrayed the courts as being overwhelmed with cases <b>of</b> <b>neighbors</b> and relatives suing each other over property rights. The Song author and official Yuan Cai (1140–1190) repeatedly warned against this, and like other officials of his time also cautioned his readers about the rise of banditry in Southern Song society and a need to physically protect self and property.|$|E
5|$|His mother {{cultivated}} the family's small {{plot of land}} and, {{like many}} women of the area, commuted {{three times a year}} to the Po Valley to work in its rice fields. Despite the Ponticelli family's hard work, they were impoverished and the children often went to bed on an empty stomach. When Lazare was two years of age, his mother moved to France to earn a better living. After the unexpected deaths of Jean Ponticelli and his eldest son, Pierre, {{the rest of the family}} moved to Paris, leaving Lazare in the care <b>of</b> <b>neighbors.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Ising {{model is}} used to model the {{behavior}} of magnetic systems. It consists of an array of cells, the state of each of which represents a spin, either up or down. The energy {{of the system is}} measured by a function that depends on the number of neighboring pairs of cells that have the same spin as each other. Therefore, if a cell has equal numbers <b>of</b> <b>neighbors</b> in the two states, it may flip its own state without changing the total energy. However, such a flip is energy-conserving only if no two adjacent cells flip at the same time.|$|E
25|$|For lattices {{where every}} site has {{an equal number}} <b>of</b> <b>neighbors,</b> this is the Ising model with a {{magnetic}} field h = (zJnbsp&−nbsp&μ)/2, where z is the number <b>of</b> <b>neighbors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Each step either takes {{constant}} time, or involves {{finding a}} vertex cover of constant size within a graph S whose size {{is proportional to}} the number <b>of</b> <b>neighbors</b> ofv. Thus, the total time for the whole algorithm {{is proportional to the}} sum of the numbers <b>of</b> <b>neighbors</b> of all vertices, which (by the handshaking lemma) is proportional to the number of input edges.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel contribution-aware neighbor-assist video {{delivery}} solution over mobile content-centric network (CNVD). CNVD allows the nodes {{to build and}} maintain neighbor relationship with other nodes to share cached video resources and achieve unicast-based video lookup. CNVD constructs an estimation model <b>of</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>neighbor</b> nodes by investigation of lookup delay, number of cached videos, lookup success rate, and geographical distance. CNVD designs the estimation methods of interest level and lookup capacity of nodes for video content, which enables the nodes {{to decide whether to}} build neighbor relationship with other nodes. A maintenance method <b>of</b> <b>neighbor</b> relationship between nodes is proposed, which enables the nodes to update valid time <b>of</b> <b>neighbor</b> relationship in terms <b>of</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>neighbor</b> nodes and decide whether to remove neighbor relationship in terms of the current valid time <b>of</b> <b>neighbor</b> relationship. Further, CNVD designs a contribution-based video lookup algorithm, which reduces lookup delay and improves lookup success rate. Extensive tests show how CNVD achieves much better performance results in comparison with other state-of-the-art solutions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Neighbor games {{arise from}} certain {{matching}} or sequencing situa-tions {{in which only}} some specific pairs of players can obtain a positive gain. As a consequence, the class <b>of</b> <b>neighbor</b> games is {{the intersection of the}} class of assignment games (Shapley and Shubik (1972)) and the class of component additive games (Curiel et al. (1994)). We first present some elementary fea-tures <b>of</b> <b>neighbor</b> games. After that we provide a polynomially bounded algorithm of order p 3 for calculating the leximax solution (cf.

Thus, in selecting a gateway node, the CH maximizes the node’s residual energy and the number <b>of</b> <b>neighbor</b> nodes <b>of</b> other clusters, and minimizes its distance to the sink node.|$|R

25|$|Old Owl however, took a {{liking to}} the fearless Neighbors.

When the Mexicans declined to sell beef to a Republic of Texas official on credit, Old Owl told them two beeves were to be forthcoming immediately, or the hacienda would be burned down and every living being killed. This proved highly effective, and the food was immediately forthcoming.|$|E
