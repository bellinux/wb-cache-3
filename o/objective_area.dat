40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades more {{attention}} has been paid by the governments of developed and developing countries to the role of higher education in general and universities in particular. Their major concern is the growing demand for higher education and the growing expenditure of that sector. These two reasons led to an inquiry into the role of higher education institutions, their objectives and their effective use of the resources allocated to them. The need to achieve better understanding and definition of the role of higher education institutions and effectiveness requires better understanding of the institutional objectives and their measure of achievement by the various constituencies involved in the institutions' activities. This study aimed to investigate the different objectives and to examine the appropriateness and degree of achievement of measures of a set of institutional goals in four Arab Universities. The study approach used included a literature survey of studies conducted on higher education institutions in Europe, North America and the Arab States and the collection of data by a questionnaire. The population sample represents administrators and faculty members in the four Arab Universities. Mean scores were used to generate the ranking of the <b>objective</b> <b>areas,</b> in terms of their perceived preferences among the four universities and among the respondent groups. Also, the analysis of variance technique was used to ascertain which of the <b>objective</b> <b>areas</b> and their measures received divergent views among the four universities and among the respondent groups. The analysis of variance technique was followed by Duncan's New Multiple Comparison test to identify pairs of factors which differ significantly, to help in the interpretation of the findings. The study revealed that there were differences in respondent ratings of the <b>objective</b> <b>areas,</b> their measures and degree of achievement among the four universities but not among the different respondents categories. The findings of the study provided the conclusion that: only in some <b>objective</b> <b>areas</b> were priorities perceived differently by the universities and by respondent groups; homogeneity exists among the respondent groups on the appropriateness of the measures and the degree of achievement of these measures; close correlation appears to exist between the ratings of the <b>objective</b> <b>areas</b> and their associated measures; and, finally, there was consensus among the respondents that all universities were performing poorly on the most highly rated <b>objective</b> <b>areas.</b> The results and conclusions of the study were utilised to draw up some recommendations which might be useful to decision-makers in achieving their institutional objectives...|$|R

The 3rd Battalion of the 501st PIR, also assigned to jump onto DZ C, was more scattered, but took over the mission of securing the exits. An ad hoc company-sized team that included the division commander, Major General Maxwell D. Taylor, reached the Pouppeville exit at 0600. After a six-hour house-clearing battle with elements of the German 1058th Grenadier Regiment, the group secured the exit shortly before 4th Division troops arrived to link up.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after midnight, the {{transport}} group entered the <b>objective</b> <b>area,</b> {{but the first}} landing attempt was hurriedly abandoned when Allied ships were discovered blocking the way. The destroyers headed north again and back-tracked closer to the shoreline for a second try. A small naval force of eight PT boats had been established by the US Navy around Puruata Island, {{but none of these}} boats detected the Japanese force. They unloaded the troops about two miles out from the beaches in Atsinima Bay, with the landing forces going ashore in 21 ramped barges, cutters and motor boats. The landing forces were put ashore near the Laruma River and Koromokina Lagoon and were initially unopposed. The landing had required a bombardment from the naval force; however, due to an Allied fleet nearby, this was not carried out. After the landing, the Japanese destroyers withdrew.|$|E
