5|$|The right lung {{has both}} more lobes and {{segments}} than the left. It {{is divided into}} three lobes, an upper, middle, and a lower, by two fissures, one <b>oblique</b> and one horizontal. The upper, horizontal fissure, separates the upper from the middle lobe. It begins in the lower <b>oblique</b> fissure near the posterior border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal surface it may be traced backward to the hilum.|$|E

5|$|Three-dimensional space can be {{represented}} convincingly in art, as in technical drawing, by means other than perspective. <b>Oblique</b> projections, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from {{the first or second}} centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. <b>Oblique</b> projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the Ukiyo-e paintings of Torii Kiyonaga (1752–1815).|$|E
5|$|Bacon did {{not return}} to the crucifixion theme until his 1962 Three Studies for a Crucifixion.

40|$|We {{argue that}} subject-like <b>obliques</b> of the impersonal {{construction}} show behavioral properties of syntactic subjects in Old Germanic, contrary to standard assumptions (Cole et al. 1980). Subject tests, including control infinitives, reveal that subject-like <b>obliques</b> in Old and Early Middle English, Old Swedish, and Old Norse-Icelandic exhibit behavioral properties of subjects, {{as they do}} in Modern Icelandic and Faroese. We also present new data from Modern German, illustrating the same syntactic behavior of corresponding arguments in that language. Thus, we conclude that subject-like <b>obliques</b> exhibit behavioral properties of syntactic subjects from the earliest attested Germanic period onwards. Our findings contradict the standard view that these arguments were objects, which gradually acquired subject properties. We show that data from Gothic intended to support the standard view has been misinterpreted. Given the validity of our findings there are no grounds for reconstructing a stage at which subject-like <b>obliques</b> were objects in Germanic. * 1. INTRODUCTION. Ou...|$|R

The result will be an eye which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards when in an inward position).

50|$|In West Coast Bajau it is {{possible}} for subjects, <b>obliques</b> and adjuncts to appear pre-verbally. Only non-subject arguments cannot appear in this position. Miller (2007: 193) suggests that there are two positions pre-verbally: topic and focus. Topic represents presupposed information whilst focus represents new information. In both AV and UV clauses, the preverbal subjects can be either topic or focus. <b>Obliques,</b> on the other hand, are always focus.|$|R

There are 25–26 upper and 23–25 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth have a single, narrow, <b>oblique</b> cusp with strongly serrated edges, and large cusplets on the trailing side.

5|$|Another Green World was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in London {{during the months}} of July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand. For the first four days in the studio, Eno failed to be productive. To look for new ideas, Eno turned to his instructional cards, the <b>Oblique</b> Strategies, and began coming up with new ideas {{as he did with}} his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).|$|E
5|$|First, Frederick {{had assumed}} {{he could use}} his trade-mark <b>oblique</b> order attack, but his {{reconnaissance}} had been incomplete. The Russians {{had been there for}} two weeks, had dug in to prepare for Frederick's arrival, and their fortifications bristled with abatis and guns. When he did arrive, Frederick had made limited efforts to assess the terrain and there was no operational reason for him not to have sent some of his cavalry to scout the area, except, perhaps, that his hussars, previously often used in reconnaissance, were being converted by Seydlitz into heavy cavalry. In the two weeks they had to prepare for the battle, the Russians and the Austrians had discovered, and reinforced, a causeway between the lakes and the marshland that allowed them to present Frederick with a united southeastern front. This effectively cancelled any advantage of the <b>oblique</b> battle order employed so successfully at Rossbach and Leuthen. Furthermore, the Russians utilized several natural defensive positions. The chain of hillocks could be enhanced by the construction of redans; the Russians were able to shape abutments from which to fire down upon the Prussians; they also constructed bastions, especially on the Spitzberge. Despite the murderous fire, Frederick's troops eventually turned the Russian left, but to little benefit. The terrain allowed the Russians and Austrians to form a compact front up to 100 men deep, shielded by the hills and marshes.|$|E
