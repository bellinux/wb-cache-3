5|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced {{compared to that}} of <b>open</b> <b>circuit,</b> so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.|$|E

5|$|The use of pure oxygen for {{accelerated}} decompression {{is limited}} by oxygen toxicity. In <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> scuba the upper limit for oxygen partial pressure is generally accepted as 1.6 bar, equivalent {{to a depth of}} 6msw (metres of sea water), but in-water and surface decompression at higher partial pressures is routinely used in surface supplied diving operation, both by the military and civilian contractors, as the consequences of CNS oxygen toxicity are considerably reduced when the diver has a secure breathing gas supply.|$|E
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E
5|$|<b>Open</b> <b>circuit</b> scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E
40|$|Master of Science in Engineering - EngineeringAn {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the failures of 88 kV line surge arrestors at an Eskom Distribution substation. The surge arrestor failed when one phase of the transmission line was <b>open</b> <b>circuited</b> and all three phases were not isolated by the protection relays. The transformer was lightly loaded and a surge arrestor blocked the neutral path to the ground. The investigation used a modified version of an equivalent circuit proposed by Marti [1]. Transformer magnetising losses, the non-linear resistance of the neutral surge arrestor and the transformer magnetising reactance of the closed-circuit phases were all included. The investigation revealed that the failure of the arrestor was due to the combined volt drops across the <b>open</b> <b>circuited</b> phase of the transformer magnetising reactance and the neutral surge arrestor. A resonance condition lowered the magnetising reactance of the <b>open</b> <b>circuited</b> phase of the transformer and forced the transformer into saturation. This resonance is characteristic of the fundamental frequency ferroresonance condition [2]...|$|R

5|$|Scuba diving {{fatalities}} have a {{major financial}} impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> scuba, and when {{the cause of death}} is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.|$|E
5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E

25|$|In rebreather diving, bailout to <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> is a {{procedure}} where the diver switches from breathing from the rebreather loop to <b>open</b> <b>circuit.</b> This is done when the loop is compromised for any reason, {{and is often}} done temporarily when there is some doubt that the gas in the loop is right for the depth.
