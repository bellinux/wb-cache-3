[...] Other collaborations between the two writers were not acknowledged on title pages or in programmes, but were plays by one turned into novels by the other, or vice versa. [...] Bolton's play, Come On, Jeeves centred on one of Wodehouse's [...] best-known characters; Wodehouse later adapted the play as the novel Ring for Jeeves. Wodehouse's novels French Leave, The Small Bachelor and others were adapted from plots by Bolton.|$|E

It is the first Filipino musical film, and dubbed as the Philippines' Mama Mia and as referred by the producers as the movie-oke(combination of movie and karaoke). In February 2012, Gary Valenciano made announced that the film he's doing after 17 years of acting hiatus is entitled I Do Bidoo Bidoo ( [...] a lyric of one of the APO's hit). During the audition at the office of Unitel Productions, which co-produced the film with Studio 5, Dos Santos recalled that she and Concepcion were asked to read excerpts from the script. The two were chosen to play the lead role because of their theatrical experience after their successful musical stage play Peter Pan. On an interview of PEP to lead actor, Sam Concepcion, he stated that the film is going to be his biggest break on his acting career. On an interview with Ogie Alcasid, he stated, ...probably the biggest film I’ve ever done in terms of its scope, the concept and the music.

2500|$|Practitioners do {{not believe}} that Satan {{literally}} exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive archetype embracing the Hebrew root of the word [...] "Satan" [...] as [...] "adversary", who represents pride, , and enlightenment, and of a cosmos which Satanists perceive to be motivated by a [...] "dark evolutionary force of entropy that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all living things". The Devil is embraced as a symbol of defiance against the Abrahamic faiths which LaVey criticized for what he saw as the suppression of humanity's natural instincts. Moreover, Satan also serves as a metaphorical external projection of the individual's godhood. LaVey espoused the view that [...] "god" [...] is a creation of man, rather than man being a creation of [...] "god". In his book, The Satanic Bible, the Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true [...] "self"—a projection {{of his or her own}} personality—not an external deity. Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism. LaVey explained that the gods worshiped by other religions are also projections of man's true self. He argues that man's unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of narcissism that would accompany self-worship. The current High Priest of the Church of Satan, Peter H. Gilmore, further expounds that [...] "...Satan is a symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates [...] Satan is not a conscious entity to be worshiped, rather a reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will. The Church of Satan has chosen Satan as its primary symbol because in Hebrew it means adversary, opposer, one to accuse or question. We see ourselves as being these Satans; the adversaries, opposers and accusers of all spiritual belief systems that would try to hamper enjoyment <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>life</b> as a human being" [...] The term [...] "Theistic Satanism" [...] has been described as [...] "oxymoronic" [...] by the church and its High Priest. The Church of Satan rejects the legitimacy of any other organizations who claim to be Satanists, dubbing them reverse-Christians, pseudo-Satanists or Devil worshipers, atheistic or otherwise, and maintains a purist approach to Satanism as expounded by LaVey.|$|E
