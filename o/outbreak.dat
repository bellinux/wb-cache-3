40|$|Abstract Background Noroviruses {{are one of}} the {{principal}} biological agents associated with the consumption of contaminated food. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyse the size and epidemiological characteristics of foodborne <b>outbreaks</b> of gastroenteritis in Catalonia, a region in the northeast of Spain. Methods In all reported <b>outbreaks</b> of gastroenteritis associated with food consumption, faecal samples of persons affected were analysed for bacteria and viruses and selectively for parasites. Study variables included the setting, the number of people exposed, age, sex, clinical signs and hospital admissions. The study was carried out from October 2004 to October 2005. Results Of the 181 <b>outbreaks</b> reported during the study period, 72 were caused by Salmonella and 30 by norovirus (NoV); the incidence rates were 14. 5 and 9. 9 per 100, 000 person-years, respectively. In 50 % of the NoV <b>outbreaks</b> and 27 % of the bacterial <b>outbreaks</b> (p = 0. 03) the number of persons affected was ≥ 10; 66. 7 % of NoV <b>outbreaks</b> occurred in restaurants; no differences in the attack rates were observed according to the etiology. Hospitalizations were more common (p = 0. 03) in bacterial <b>outbreaks</b> (8. 6 %) than in NoV <b>outbreaks</b> (0. 15 %). Secondary cases accounted for 4 % of cases in NoV <b>outbreaks</b> compared with 0. 3 % of cases in bacterial <b>outbreaks</b> (p Conclusion Norovirus <b>outbreaks</b> were larger but less frequent than bacterial <b>outbreaks,</b> suggesting that underreporting is greater for NoV <b>outbreaks.</b> Food handlers should receive training on the transmission of infections in diverse situations.
