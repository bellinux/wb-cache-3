40|$|Abstract: With the {{emergence}} of a “new economic norm ” and the development of “economic integration in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei”, electricity demand situation in Beijing will change significantly in the future. To guide the planning and construction of power grid in Beijing, it is indispensable to predict electricity demand during the 13 th Five-year. Since the factors and affecting mechanisms for electricity demand are different in different <b>sectors,</b> the <b>total</b> electricity consumption in this paper is divided into five parts: the first industry, industry, construction industry, the tertiary industry and <b>resident</b> <b>sectors.</b> The exponential smoothing method and co-integration theory are introduced to establish the forecasting model of electricity demand in different sectors. Therefore, based on the forecasting model and scenario analysis, the analysis results show that the total electricity consumption will grow {{at an annual rate of}} 4. 9 %- 6. 0 % during 13 th Five-Year-Plan period, and the consumption would reach more than 0. 1397 × 1012 kWh in 2020...|$|R

As a result, the followings are found: 1) Over 80 % of Tokyo Guesthouse residents are young workers. 2) Some of them pointed out that the merit of living in a residence type guesthouse is to be able to have the opportunity and space for a full conversation with <b>other</b> <b>residents.</b> 3) On the other hand, some of the residents try to prevent excessive interference with <b>other</b> <b>residents.</b> 4) Some of them often go out with <b>other</b> <b>residents.</b> 研究ノー...|$|R
