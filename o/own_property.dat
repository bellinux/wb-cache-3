5|$|After an {{erroneous}} scouting {{report of}} approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin {{to the ground}} on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's account was that the residents burned their <b>own</b> <b>property</b> {{to keep it out}} of the hands of the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is an attempt}} to determine the reasons for the problems currently being experienced in Dubai in the implementation of the Dubai Law Concerning Ownership of Jointly <b>Owned</b> <b>Properties.</b>   Although the Dubai Law has applied to Dubai for almost three years and is a very young law, most of the shortcomings {{can be attributed to the}} delay in the promulgation of the envisaged implementing regulations including the Master Community Declaration, the Building Management Statement and the Association Constitution.   This has motivated the writing of this thesis which seeks to examine and analyse the entire system of jointly <b>owned</b> <b>property</b> ownership in the Emirate of Dubai.   The emphasis is on the establishment of the jointly <b>owned</b> <b>property</b> schemes, the physical division of jointly <b>owned</b> <b>property</b> schemes into units and common areas, the allocation of share units in jointly <b>owned</b> <b>property</b> schemes, the rights and obligations of unit owners with regard to their units and the common areas, the enforcement of financial and social obligations, settlement of disputes and finally the management of jointly <b>owned</b> <b>property</b> schemes. An examination of the differences between the Dubai Law and several other systems has been made to find out why one works better than the other.   Does the problem lie in the nature of the governing legislation, the procedures of the Competent Authority namely, the Land Department and the Real Estate Regulatory Agency for applying and obtaining registration of a jointly <b>owned</b> <b>property</b> plan, the laws and practices relating to the development, construction, financing and conveyancing of jointly <b>owned</b> <b>property</b> or a combination of all these factors?  The insights gained by the examination of the jointly <b>owned</b> <b>property</b> industry, reveal whether the problems and issues currently faced on the ground have been the result of the law or have been caused by other factors beyond the scope of solutions prescribed by the law. The present legislation in force for jointly <b>owned</b> <b>property</b> in Dubai has provided an adequate legal structure for all the matters discussed above.   From my evaluation of the various aspects of the Dubai Law Concerning Ownership of Jointly <b>Owned</b> <b>Properties,</b> it appears that there is room for improvement in virtually every aspect examined in order to keep up with the rapid growth of jointly <b>owned</b> <b>property</b> schemes in Dubai and all over the United Arab Emirates.   In addition, the housing delivery system in Dubai must change.   Officials involved in the approval and registration of jointly <b>owned</b> <b>property</b> schemes have to be properly trained in order to ensure that they have the required knowledge of the law and care should be taken to recruit more qualified personnel in the related Offices.

5|$|The {{efforts of}} Bengali reformers {{included}} abolishing sati, {{which was a}} widow's death by burning on her husband's funeral pyre, abolishing the custom of child marriage, abolishing the disfiguring of widows, introducing the marriage of upper caste Hindu widows, promoting women's education, obtaining legal rights for women to <b>own</b> <b>property,</b> and requiring the law to acknowledge women's status by granting them basic rights in matters such as adoption.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} {{and the degree to}} which they could become emancipated, women could <b>own</b> <b>property,</b> enter contracts, and engage in business, including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the Arch of the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{campaigns are}} {{generally}} considered to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender neutrality in English, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and <b>own</b> <b>property.</b> Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims because men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{movements}} have campaigned {{and continue to}} campaign for women's rights, {{including the right to}} vote, to hold public office, to work, to earn fair wages or equal pay, to <b>own</b> <b>property,</b> to receive education, to enter contracts, to have equal rights within marriage, and to have maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to promote bodily autonomy and integrity, and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{was born}} in Yong Choon county, Fujian province, in China. He joined his father in Negri Sembilan in his youth, before moving to Singapore to set up his <b>own</b> <b>property</b> business. He was very successful, and {{achieved}} positions of leadership in the local Chinese community. He was widely {{known as one of}} the co-founders of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), and was its acting chairman during the Japanese Occupation. As one of the early Buddhist pioneers, Lee was also involved in the foundation of the Buddhist Publications Circulation Centre in 1933, and the Singapore Buddhist Lodge in 1934.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical work {{suggests}} that families live in owner-occupied housing if their investment {{demand for housing}} exceeds their consumption demand for housing. Using household data from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances, the authors test this theory by estimating an ordered probit model of whether families rent without <b>owning</b> <b>property,</b> rent while <b>owning</b> <b>property</b> other than their home, own their home without <b>owning</b> other <b>properties,</b> or <b>own</b> their home {{in addition to other}} properties. For owner-occupiers who <b>own</b> additional <b>property,</b> both the investment and consumption demands are directly observed, enabling the authors to separately identify these functions.

5|$|Most land in Saudi Arabia {{is owned}} by the {{government}} and only cultivated land and urban property are subject to individual ownership. All land titles must be registered, but there is no accurate information as to the extent of registration. Real estate could only be owned by Saudi citizens until 2000, when the property laws were amended to allow foreigners to <b>own</b> <b>property</b> in Saudi Arabia. Property investments by non-Saudis of more than 30 million Saudi riyals require approval of the Council of Ministers and foreigners remain prohibited from owning property in Medina and Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{as a wife}} an epikleros who {{had little}} estate was {{considered}} a praiseworthy action, and was generally stressed in public speeches. Such an heiress was called an epikleros thessa. If the nearest male relative {{did not wish to}} marry an epikleros who belonged to the lowest income class in Athens, he was required to find her a husband and provide her with a dowry on a graduated scale according to his own income class. This dowry was in addition to her <b>own</b> <b>property</b> and the requirement was designed to ensure that even poor heiresses found husbands. The law also did not stipulate what was to happen if the epikleros was still an infant or too young for consummation of the marriage when she was claimed.|$|E
5|$|Technically, a slave {{could not}} <b>own</b> <b>property,</b> but a slave who {{conducted}} business might be {{given access to}} an individual account or fund (peculium) that he could use {{as if it were}} his own. The terms of this account varied depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave: a slave with an aptitude for business could be given considerable leeway to generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the peculium he managed to other slaves of his household. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.|$|E

5|$|After the Norman invasion, the {{position}} of women in society changed. The rights and roles of women became more sharply defined, in part {{as a result of}} the development of the feudal system and the expansion of the English legal system; some women benefited from this, while others lost out. The rights of widows were formally laid down in law by the end of the 12th century, clarifying the right of free women to <b>own</b> <b>property,</b> but this did not necessarily prevent women from being forcibly remarried against their wishes. The growth of governmental institutions under a succession of bishops reduced the role of queens and their households in formal government. Married or widowed noblewomen remained significant cultural and religious patrons and played an important part in political and military events, even if chroniclers were uncertain if this was appropriate behaviour. As in earlier centuries, most women worked in agriculture, but here roles became more clearly gendered, with ploughing and managing the fields defined as men's work, for example, and dairy production becoming dominated by women.|$|E
5|$|As {{a part of}} the Pennsylvania system, the CL {{continued}} to operate its <b>own</b> <b>property</b> (which included the line north of Dodds after 1914) until January 1, 1921, when it was leased to the Pennsylvania. Starting at the end of 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission classified the CL as a Class I railroad, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year in operating revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL was leased.) However, net operating income, revenue minus costs, which had steadily climbed from the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania merged the CL with several other small companies—the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroadto create the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary. That company was merged into the Connecting Railway, previously a short link in Philadelphia, in 1956, and its lessee merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Transportation.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must <b>own</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E

5|$|Taoism was the {{official}} {{religion of the}} Tang. Buddhism, originating in India {{around the time of}} Confucius, continued its influence during the Tang period and was accepted by some members of imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. In an age before Neo-Confucianism and figures such as Zhu Xi (1130–1200), Buddhism had begun to flourish in China during the Northern and Southern dynasties, and became the dominant ideology during the prosperous Tang. Buddhist monasteries played an integral role in Chinese society, offering lodging for travelers in remote areas, schools for children throughout the country, and a place for urban literati to stage social events and gatherings such as going-away parties. Buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave them enough revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises. Although the monasteries retained 'serfs', these monastery dependents could actually <b>own</b> <b>property</b> and employ others to help them in their work, including their own slaves.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from London, the Demerara Court of Policy eventually passed an 'Ordinance for the religious instruction of slaves and for meliorating their condition' in 1825 which institutionalised working hours and some civil rights for slaves. The weekend {{was to be}} from sunset on Saturday to sunrise on Monday; field work was also defined to be from 6 am to 6 pm, with a mandatory two-hour break. A Protector of Slaves was appointed; whipping was abolished for women as was its use in the field. The rights to marriage and <b>own</b> <b>property</b> was legalised, as was the right to acquire manumission. Amendments and new ordinances continued to flow from London, each progressively establishing more civil rights for the slaves, but they were strongly resisted by the colonial legislature.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Meeker {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, {{and like the}} Meekers were family farmers who did not hire help. When he asked her for her hand, {{he told her he}} wanted to farm, which she accepted {{as long as it was}} on their <b>own</b> <b>property.</b> In October 1851, the couple set out for Eddyville, Iowa, where they rented a farm. They had heard that land in Eddyville would be free, but this was not the case. Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's winters—a prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the Oregon Territory's free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted for the trip to Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the Oregon Trail.|$|E
