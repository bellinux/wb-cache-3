50|$|On {{the evening}} of 23 September 1999, the Dutch widow Jacqueline Wittenberg was murdered in her house. She was found some days later. Telephone call data {{indicated}} that her personal tax advisor Ernest Louwes had been {{the last one to}} call her on that night, but Louwes himself claimed he had been outside Deventer that whole day. The most convincing piece of evidence was according to the court of justice the result of an <b>odour</b> <b>test</b> which had been performed on a knife supposedly used by Louwes to commit his crime. On the basis of this, Louwes was sentenced to twelve years in December 2000. His appeal to the court of cassation was rejected.|$|E
40|$|Vulvovaginal {{candidiasis}} (VVC) is {{the most}} common vaginal infection. It is considered to be the reason for 15 %– 30 % of all vulvovaginal symptoms. A diagnosis based only on clinical signs and/or on a syndrome-based approach, recommended by some authors and health institutions, is in many cases incorrect. There is no indisputable diagnostic method that guarantees high specificity, sensitivity and predictive value. There is no pathognomonic clinical feature of VVC. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the role of selected clinical and mycological indicators in the diagnosis of VVC using the standard complex scoring system. The research is retrospective and was conducted in several stages to give a more precise and detailed assessment of the examined clinical and microbiological indicators. Clinical, microbiological and statistical methods were used. The results showed the lowest level of compliance between clinical and laboratory diagnosis in VVC: 67. 65 %. We did not observe a statistically significant relation between the density of the vaginal smear, inflammation, <b>odour</b> <b>test</b> and VVC (p > 0. 05). The results showed a moderate association between the positive yellow swab test and VVC (p < 0. 05). A significant positive association was established between VVC and presence of microscopic signs of invasiveness (p < 0. 001). The most common isolate was Candida albicans: 72. 81 % of all vaginal Candida isolates...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a brief summary}} of the different methods for assessing odours and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. Odour assessment methods are divided into two categories: assessments at potential sources and ambient assessments at affected areas, which are usually residential areas located close to potential odour sources. Despite there being several available methodologies, {{the emphasis is on}} the following methods: source <b>odour</b> <b>testing</b> with dynamic olfactometry evaluations and dispersion modelling analysis to predict off-site odour concentrations; ambient sampling with dynamic olfactometry analysis, monitoring of ambient odour concentrations using the Nasal Ranger and the Scentroid SM 100. In addition to the brief summaries of each available methodology, seven case studies are also introduced to compare their results when different techniques are used...|$|R
40|$|The {{olfactory}} system of newly emerged houseflies (Musca domestica L.; Diptera, Muscidae) is already functional; very few differences compared to sexually mature houseflies {{exist for the}} responses to 1 -octen- 3 -ol, amylacetate, 2 -pentanone, 3 -methylphenol, R-limonene, muscalure, and 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 3 -one. Sex differences are also almost absent, except for a higher sensitivity of females to acetic acid. Large differences exist between the sensitivity of antennae and palps to different odours. Antennae are sensitive to all <b>odours</b> <b>tested.</b> Palps are mainly sensitive to 3 -methylphenol and 2 -pentanone, both in percentage of responding cells and in response level. The sensitivity to amyl acetate was similar in palps and antennae. The responses to other odours were low in the palps. We conclude that traps baited with attractive odours may lure houseflies {{of all ages and}} both sexes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study chronic {{effects of}} {{hydrogen}} sulphide (H 2 S) on cranial nerve I (nervi olfactorii), {{which have been}} only minimally described. METHODS: Chemosensations (smell and taste) were evaluated in eight men who complained of continuing dysfunction 2 - 3 years {{after the start of}} occupational exposure to H 2 S. Various bilateral (both nostrils) and unilateral (one nostril at a time) <b>odour</b> threshold <b>tests</b> with standard odorants as well as the Chicago smell <b>test,</b> a three <b>odour</b> detection and identification test and the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test, a series of 40 scratch and sniff <b>odour</b> identification <b>tests</b> were administered. RESULTS: Six of the eight patients showed deficits of various degrees. Two had normal scores on objective tests, but thought that they continued to have problems. H 2 S apparently can cause continuing, sometimes unrecognised olfactory deficits. CONCLUSION: Further exploration into the extent of such problems among workers exposed to H 2 S is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Th e goal of our {{research}} {{was to determine the}} presence of bacterial vaginosis in sexually active women in Tuzla Canton area. Diagnosis determination for bacterial vaginosis was conducted on the basis of three out of four internationally accepted criteria according to Amsel and isolation and identifi cation of Gard-nerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis) by standard microbiological procedures. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in, (/) women who asked for gynaecologist’s help due to their personal discomfort, since sig-nifi cantly higher percentage of diagnosed bacterial vaginosis of, (/) was determined in women with personal discomfort typical for this disease. All relevant factors, according to available literature, for genesis of bacterial vaginosis were processed in this research. In respect to the obtained outputs, bacterial vaginosis is signifi cantly more frequent occurrence in women who are not married, since the number of sexual partners, the time of the fi rst sexual intercourse, the use of intrauterine contraceptive device and smoking do not cause the genesis of bacterial vaginosis.

40|$|Receptor {{current and}} spiking {{responses}} were recorded simultaneously from isolated frog olfactory receptor cells using the suction pipette technique. Cells were stimulated with the odour cineole by rapid exchange {{of the solution}} bathing the olfactory cilia. The receptor current response to a 1 s odour stimulus increased in a graded manner over a 300 -fold range of odour concentration without clear saturation, and {{was accompanied by a}} train of action potentials. As the concentration of the odour stimulus increased, the frequency of firing increased also, until it saturated at the highest concentrations. The number of spikes evoked by the stimulus first increased and then decreased with increasing concentration, reaching a maximum at intermediate odour concentrations. The dose-response relation for spike firing rose at lower odour concentrations than the dose-response relation for the receptor current response. Adaptation to steady odour stimuli was investigated by exposing the cilia to a 4 s odour pre-pulse and then to a 1 s <b>odour</b> <b>test</b> pulse. As the pre-pulse concentration was increased the dose-response relations derived from the receptor current and spiking responses shifted to higher absolute test pulse concentrations. However the number of spikes fired in response to a given test pulse was little affected by the pre-pulse until, at the highest pre-pulse concentrations spike firing was abolished despite the continued presence of a receptor current response. The sensitivity of the receptor-current response to incremental stimuli fell with increasing pre-pulse concentration, declining with a limiting slope of 2. 4 in double logarithmic co-ordinates. The sensitivity determined from the spiking responses declined to zero at a lower pre-pulse concentration, reflecting the abolition of spike firing at pre-pulse concentrations which still evoked a graded receptor-current response...|$|E
40|$|The wide {{variation}} in infant maxillary morphology and cleft size {{of children with}} unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) and isolated cleft palate (CP) raise concerns about their possible influences on treatment outcome. The studies in this thesis aimed to investigate the relation between cleft size in infancy and crossbite at 5 years of age (Paper I); the impact of primary surgery on cleft size and maxillary arch dimensions from infancy to 5 years of age (Paper II); associations between cleft size, maxillary arch dimensions and facial growth in both UCLP and CP children (Paper III); and, to evaluate the relation between infant cleft size and nasal airway size and function in adults treated for UCLP (Paper IV). In homogenously treated groups of children with UCLP and CP, dental casts were used to measure cleft size and maxillary arch dimensions from infancy up to 5 years of age, and for crossbite recording at 5 years. Serial lateral cephalometric radiographs taken between 5 and 19 years {{of age in the}} same groups were used to study facial growth. Nasal airway size and function were evaluated by acoustic rhinometry, rhinomanometry, peak nasal inspiratory flow and <b>odour</b> <b>test</b> in a group of adults treated for UCLP. The main findings were: crossbite was a frequent malocclusion at 5 years of age in children with UCLP and large cleft widths {{at the level of the}} cuspid points in infancy were associated with less anterior and posterior crossbite in this group (Paper I). Cleft widths decreased after lip closure and/or soft palate closure in both UCLP and CP children. Initially, UCLP children had wider maxillary arch dimensions, but after hard palate closure, the transverse growth was reduced, and at 5 years, they had smaller maxillary arch widths than CP children had (Paper II). Maxillary arch depths and cleft widths in infancy were correlated with maxillary protrusion and sagittal jaw relationships in both UCLP and CP children (Paper III), but cleft width in infancy was not correlated with nasal airway size and function in adults treated for UCLP (Paper IV) ...|$|E
40|$|Olfactory {{disorders}} {{have been}} documented both in aging and in various neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, with memory loss as a frequent feature. The present investigation aimed at developing a standardized multiple choice <b>odour</b> recognition <b>test,</b> based on the “Sniffin’ Sticks” test kit. The test was applied on two occasions {{at a distance of}} approximately two weeks from each other to a group of 108 normosmic, healthy volunteers (51 men, 57 women, age range 18 - 95 years). The results showed that performance decreased significantly with increasing age, particularly after the age of 60. The test-retest Pearson’s coefficient of correlation between the two repeated administrations was. 90, indicating a high reliability of the task. No sex-related differences were found.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined item recognition {{memory for}} sequentially presented odours. Following {{a sequence of}} six odours participants were immediately presented {{with a series of}} 2 -alternative forced choice (2 AFC) <b>test</b> <b>odours.</b> The <b>test</b> pairs were presented in either the same order as learning or the reverse order of learning. Method of testing was either blocked (Experiment 1) or mixed (Experiment 2). Both experiments demonstrated extended recency, with an absence of primacy, for the reverse testing procedure. In contrast, the forward testing procedure revealed a null effect of serial position. The finding of extended recency is inconsistent with the single-item recency predicted by the two-component duplex theory (Phillips and Christie, 1977). We offer an alternative account of the data in which recognition accuracy is better accommodated by the cumulative number of items presented between item learning and item test...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we explore the {{existence}} of cross-cultural differences in odour-colour correspondences between two European countries with geographic proximity and shared history: England and France. Moreover, we test whether a single chromatic arrangement {{can be used to}} represent an odour in both countries, even if the odour-colour association for this odour differed. The responses of 59 British and 60 French participants to the same set of odorants were compared. Significant colour characterizations were observed for {{each and every one of}} the <b>odours</b> <b>tested</b> in both populations. Moreover, both commonalities and differences were reported between the two populations in terms of the odour-colour associations that they exhibited. In the second part of the study, the ability of “chromatic cards” to represent <b>odours</b> was <b>tested.</b> Those “chromatic cards” are objective coloured arrangements generated by a new patented scientific tool developed at Lorraine University (patent FR n° 1255688). This tool is based on a neural network algorithm for colour forecasting. It generates a chromatic card that represents any odour from its chemical composition and sensory description. In this study, participants were presented with three cards obtained from an analysis of lavender, cucumber, and peppermint odours. First, the participants had to name the odour evoked by each card. Next, they selected from amongst three different olfactory stimuli the one that best matched each card. The chromatic representations evoked the appropriate odour percept and were significantly associated to their related odours in both of the populations. These findings highlight {{the existence of}} common colour representations of odours amongst French and British participants, though some differences were also found. Despite these differences, we were able to validate the relevancy of using single chromatic arrangements in both countries in order to communicate odour information. The latter result may open-up the way for a number of potentially important applications in the design and marketing of both food and non-food products...|$|R
40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the extent to}} which re-exposure to the unique combination of odours present in a museum (the Jorvik Viking Centre in York) aids the recall of a previous visit to the museum, which had typically taken place several years earlier. To test this, three groups of participants completed questionnaires about the contents of the museum, but in different conditions. One group completed the questionnaire in the presence of exactly the same distinctive odours as those present in the museum {{at the time of their}} original visit. Those in two other groups were given either a different (control) set of odours or no odours at all. After a brief delay, the same questionnaire was presented again to participants in all three groups. Those who had initially been given a novel (control) set of <b>odours</b> were now <b>tested</b> in the presence of the genuine Jorvik museum odours, while the group that had received the Jorvik <b>odours</b> were now <b>tested</b> with the control odours. The third group received no <b>odours</b> on either <b>test.</b> Only the novel odour-Jorvik odours condition led to a highly significant improvement in performance.

40|$|In female {{mosquitoes}} of the anthropophilic species Anopheles gambiae Giles s. s. and the zoophilic An. quadriannulatus Theobald single sensillum recordings from grooved pegs were made. In both species, {{the majority}} of these sensilla responded to ammonium hydroxide, butylamine and propanoic acid, whereas a smaller part responded to acetone. Lactic acid, butanone, 3 -methyl phenol and 1 -octen- 3 -ol evoked responses in a minority of grooved pegs only. In An. gambiae these four substances evoked either excitatory or inhibitory responses. In An. quadriannulatus excitatory and inhibitory responses were only found on stimulation with lactic acid; butanone, 3 -methyl phenol and 1 -octen- 3 -ol only evoked inhibition in the pegs of this species. More than half of the grooved pegs responded to water vapour with an increase in spike frequency. As opposed to this, in some pegs inhibitory responses were found upon stimulation with vapour of low humidity. This suggests that grooved pegs {{may play a role in}} humidity perception in Anopheles. Dose-response relations were investigated for cells excited by ammonium hydroxide, butylamine and propanoic acid. Excitatory responses to these three substances were dose-dependent. No significant differences were found between the dose-response curves of the two species. It is concluded that in both species the host <b>odours</b> <b>tested</b> are not perceived by specialist cells. Combined information from generalist cells may provide a detailed 'odour profile' of the host...|$|R

To determine differences in odour reception between workers of different castes (i. e. foragers, undertakers and soldiers), further antennal sensitivity to task-related <b>odours</b> is <b>tested</b> using electroantennographic techniques. Soldiers are the most specialized caste because of their low response to all odours, except odourants related to alarm pheromones.

The data show that C. sordidus uses odour-conditioned anemotaxis in its orientation to the <b>odour</b> sources <b>tested.</b> Of the two olfactometers tested, a dual port olfactometer using a continuous airflow showed stronger discrimination by C. sordidus to the different odours compared with a double pitfall olfactometer.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the area of}} human infant olfaction, which has hitherto been a somewhat neglected area in psychology. A review of the available literature showed {{that a number of}} different experimental approaches to infant olfaction could be identified. It was concluded from this literature review that infants display a degree of olfactory competence in the weeks after birth. These previous findings are discussed in the light of a model concerned with odour significance. This model is systems-based and suggests an explanation for the apparent olfactory competence of human infants in the first weeks of life. It is argued that this may derive from pre-natal exposure to odorants and consequent acceleration of maturation in the foetal olfactory system. The experiments reported in this thesis concentrated on the cortical reactions of infants to a small range food odours. These reactions were plotted by means of a technique involving electro-encephalography. This technique involves a computerised imaging system which summarises cortical potentials from twenty-eight locations on the scalp and is known as Brain Electrical Activity Mapping (BEAM). It is believed {{that this is the first}} time that this method has been used to examine responses to odour in human infants. This study also involved the use of a special low ambient <b>odour</b> <b>testing</b> environment. A parallel study used respiratory plethysmography to <b>test</b> <b>odour</b> response. The major findings of the BEAM research are as follows: 1) The BEAM technique has been shown to be a practical method in the psychophysical measurement of cortical responses to odour in the human infant. 2) Human infants at the age of three months show a pattern of cortical activity in response to a small range of food odours. 3) There is evidence that a limited area of the infant brain is responding to these odours. It was argued that these findings lent some support to the model described above. However, similar findings to that of the BEAM work were not shown by the respiratory plethysmography study. This was explained by problems in data handling techniques. It was concluded that the BEAM method could be used to further knowledge in the area of infant olfactory response. Possible improvements to the experimental technique were discussed which would allow testing of infant response to maternal odour. Such future work could shed considerable light on the role of olfaction in the early infant-mother relationship...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of migratory galaxiid juveniles, inanga (Galaxias maculatus) and koaro (G. brevipinnis), to the odours of adult galaxiids was {{tested in a}} two-choice chamber apparatus. Both conspecific and heterospecific <b>odours</b> were <b>tested.</b> Inanga juveniles were attracted to adult inanga (G. maculatus), banded kokopu (G. fasciatus), and koaro (G. brevipinnis) odours. However, they were not attracted to odours from common bullies (Gobiomorphus cotidianus). Koaro juveniles exhibited a species-specific attraction to adult koaro odours only. These results demonstrate inanga uveniles can discriminate and are attracted to adult galaxiids during their migratory phase, whilst migratory koaro juveniles exhibit a species-specific attraction to adult odours similar to the pheromonal attraction previously described for juvenile banded kokopu. This strengthens the hypothesis {{for the use of}} pheromonal cues in stream and habitat selection by amphidromous galaxiids...|$|R
40|$|When faces, objects, or {{voices are}} encountered, naming lapses can occur, {{but this does}} not {{preclude}} knowing other specific semantic information about the nameless thing. In the experiments reported here, we examined whether this is also the case for odours, using a procedure based upon the Pyramid and Palm Trees test. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with a target odour, then two pictures, and had to pick the picture semantically associated with the target. In Experiment 2, participants were presented with a target <b>odour,</b> then two <b>test</b> <b>odours,</b> and again had to pick the semantically associated test stimulus. In each experiment, other tests followed, including a parallel verbal-based test, an odour-naming test, and various ratings. Neither experiment found any evidence of specific semantic knowledge about a target odour, unless the target odour name (Experiment 1) or all of the odour names (Experiment 2) were known. Additional tests suggested that these effects were independent of odour familiarity and similarity. We suggest that the absence of specific semantic information {{in the absence of a}} name may reflect poor connectivity between olfactory perceptual and semantic memory systems. 18 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Mixtures {{of single}} odours {{were used to}} explore the {{receptor}} response profile across individual antennae of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Seven <b>odours</b> were <b>tested</b> including floral and green-leaf volatiles: phenyl acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, b-caryophyllene, limonene, a-pinene, 1 -hexanol, 3 Z-hexenyl acetate. Electroantennograms of responses to paired mixtures of odours showed that there was considerable variation in receptor tuning across the receptor field between individuals. Data from some moth antennae showed no additivity, which indicated a restricted receptor profile. Results from other moth antennae to the same odour mixtures showed a range of partial additivity. This indicated that a wider array of receptor types was present in these moths, with {{a greater percentage of}} the receptors tuned exclusively to each odour. Peripheral receptor fields show variation in the spectrum of response within a population (of moths) when exposed to high doses of plant volatiles. This may be related to recorded variation in host choice within moth populations as reported by other authors...|$|R
40|$|Circadian rhythmicity {{plays an}} {{important}} role for many aspects of honey bees’ lives. However, the question whether it also affects learning and memory remained unanswered. To address this question, we studied the effect of circadian timing on olfactory learning and memory in honey bees Apis mellifera using the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex paradigm. Bees were differentially conditioned to <b>odours</b> and <b>tested</b> for their <b>odour</b> learning at four different “Zeitgeber” time points. We show that learning behaviour is influenced by circadian timing. Honey bees perform best in the morning compared to the other times of day. Additionally, we found influences of the light condition bees were trained at on the olfactory learning. This circadian-mediated learning is independent from feeding times bees were entrained to, indicating an inherited and not acquired mechanism. We hypothesise that a co-evolutionary mechanism between the honey bee as a pollinator and plants might be the driving force for the evolution of the time-dependent learning abilities of bees...|$|R

Here we show that search-image use assists E. culicivora in finding prey and mates when restricted to using olfaction alone. After being primed with prey odour or mate odour (control: not primed with odour), spiders were transferred to an olfactometer designed to test ability to find a prey-odour or mate-odour source that was either ‘cryptic’ (i. e. accompanied by a masking odour source, Lantana camara) or ‘conspicuous’ (no L. camara <b>odour).</b> When <b>tested</b> with conspicuous <b>odour,</b> {{the identity of the}} priming odour had no significant effect on how many spiders found the odour source.

40|$|Passerine {{birds have}} an {{extensive}} repertoire of olfactory receptor genes. However, {{the circumstances in}} which passerine birds use olfactory signals are poorly understood. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether olfactory cues play a role in natal nest recognition in fledged juvenile passerines. The natal nest provides fledglings with a safe place for sleeping and parental food provisioning. There is a particular demand in colony-breeding birds for fledglings to be able to identify their nests because many pairs breed close to each other. Olfactory orientation might thus be of special importance for the fledglings, because they do not have a visual representation of the nest site and its position in the colony when leaving the nest for the first time. We investigated the role of olfaction in nest recognition in zebra finches, which breed in dense colonies of up to 50 pairs. We performed <b>odour</b> preference <b>tests,</b> in which we offered zebra finch fledglings their own natal nest odour versus foreign nest odour. Zebra finch fledglings significantly preferred their own natal nest odour, indicating that fledglings of a colony breeding songbird may use olfactory cues for nest recognition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Individuals {{that live}} in groups may have the {{opportunity}} to learn to recognize unfamiliar predators by observing the fright responses of experienced individuals in the group. In intraspecific trials, naive fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, gave fright responses to chemical stimuli from predatory northern pike, Esox lucius, when paired with pike-experienced conspecifics but not when paired with pike-naive conspecifics. These pike-conditioned minnows retained the fright responses to pike <b>odour</b> when <b>tested</b> alone, indicating that learning had occurred, and transmitted their fright responses to pike-naive minnows in subsequent trials. Brook stickleback, Culaea inconstans, are found in mixed-species aggregations with fathead minnows and are also vulnerable to predation by northern pike. In a series of interspecific tests, pike-naive brook stickleback gave fright responses to chemical stimuli from northern pike when paired with pike-experienced minnows but not when paired with pike-naive minnows. Pike-conditioned stickleback also retained the fright responses when tested alone and subsequently also transmitted the fright responses to pike-naive minnows. Individuals may benefit from observations of the fright responses of conspecifics or heterospecifics by (1) being alerted to the immediate presence of unfamiliar predators and (2) learning to recognize unfamiliar predators as a potential threat...|$|R
40|$|In {{clinical}} settings, olfactory {{testing is}} usually performed bilaterally; thus, unilateral olfactory loss may go unnoticed. The aims {{of this study}} were to evaluate 1) whether patients presenting with self-reported olfactory disorders demonstrate significant side differences in odour perception, depending on the prevalance of measured unilateral disorder, and 2) to evaluate the existing testing procedure. In 518 patients presenting with olfactory disorders, olfactory testing was performed using the "Sniffin' Sticks" test battery (consisting of a threshold, discrimination, and <b>odour</b> identification <b>test)</b> examining each nostril separately. According to the history and results from the clinical examination, olfactory disorders were classified as related to trauma, sinunasal disease, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), tumour, congenital, idiopathic, and other. A difference of three or more points in one of the subtests or six or more points in the composite olfactory test score was considered a side difference. In almost one quarter of all presenting patients (23. 4 %), a side difference was detected. To not to miss lateralized disorders, we recommend testing each nostril separately. Depending on {{the presence or absence of}} a significant difference, testing then can be continued birhinally or separately for each nostril...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural assays {{to study}} insect {{attraction}} to specific odours are tedious, time consuming and often require {{large numbers of}} replications. Olfactometer and flight tunnel tests can usually only be conducted {{with one or two}} odour sources at a time. Moreover, chemical information on the odour sources has to be obtained in separate analytical studies. An olfactometer was developed in which six <b>odours</b> can be <b>tested</b> simultaneously for their relative attractiveness while during the assays, part of each <b>test</b> <b>odour</b> can be trapped for further analyses. The effectiveness of this six-arm olfactometer was tested by observing the responses of the solitary endoparasitoid Cotesia marginiventris (Cresson) to host-induced odours from young maize plants. For statistical analyses, we used log-linear models were adapted to account for overdispersion and possible positional biases. Female wasps responded extremely well in tests where they were offered a single odour source, as well as in tests with multiple choices. The responses of wasps released in groups were the same as those released individually and it was found that females did not attract or repel each other, but males preferred arms in which females had been released. Dose–response tests with varying numbers of plants or host larvae on plants revealed that the wasps responded in a dose-related manner, thus showing that the system is well suited to measure relative preference. The clear choices of the insects amongst six possibilities provided substantial statistical power. Gas chromatographic analyses of sampled air revealed clean and effective odour trapping, which largely facilitates the comparison of results from behavioural assays with the actual blends of volatiles that were emitted by the various odour sources. Advantages and disadvantages compared to other methods are discussed...|$|R

RESULTS: Over 70 % of patients studied (71 of 96) were outside the 95 % limit of normal on the identification test in an age matched sample and there was an unusual pattern of selective loss to certain odours, not hitherto described. The evoked potentials were significantly delayed but of comparable amplitude to a control matched population. Of the 73 patients studied only 37 had a technically satisfactory record containing a clear response to both gases and of these, 12 were delayed. For H 2 S there was more delay on stimulating the right nostril than the left. Some patients with normal smell identification test scores had delayed evoked potentials. In the pathological examination of olfactory bulbs from eight brains, changes characteristic of Parkinson's disease (Lewy bodies) were seen in every olfactory bulb, particularly in the anterior olfactory nucleus, and were sufficiently distinct to allow a presumptive diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory damage in Parkinson's disease is consistent and severe and may provide an important clue to the aetiology of the disease...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhereas odour-colour correspondences seem to {{be evident}} in {{everyday}} life, little research has attempted to investigate associations between colours and odours over the last decade. Nonetheless, some previous studies have demonstrated the existence of robust associations between specific odours (mainly fragrances) and colours (see Dematte, Sanabria, & Spence, 2006; Gilbert, Martin, & Kemp, 1996; Schifferstein & Tanudjaja, 2004). Here, we extended these findings to mainly food and drink related <b>odours.</b> Furthermore, <b>testing</b> was conducted with similar odours, which allowed us {{to better understand the}} nuances of the association. In the experiment, 155 untrained French subjects were first presented with 16 food and flower natural odorants and asked to select from among 24 colours the one that best matched each given olfactory stimulus. Secondly, they rated each odour according to five descriptors (association difficulty, intensity, familiarity, pleasantness and edibility). Participants matched olfactory stimuli with colours in a non-random manner. Indeed, significant colour characterizations were found for all odours. Significant differences in colour choice were also reported between very similar odours. These results confirm the existence of consistent odour-colour associations; and explore more precisely their subtleties. This underlines the need for {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms underlying these crossmodal correspondences...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect and react to a {{predator}} odour is crucial for prey species. In the present study 10 mice (Mus musculus) were {{used to test the}} behavioural response of mice towards two predator odours (3 -methyl- 1 -butanethiol and 3 -mercapto- 3 -methyl-butan- 1 -ol) and one fruity odour (n-pentyl acetate). All three <b>odours</b> were <b>tested</b> against a near odourless blank stimulus (diethyl phthalate). The animals were individually placed in a test chamber of two equally sized compartments divided by a vertical Plexiglas wall with a semicircular opening. Their proximity to the odours, placed beneath the floor in petri dishes in each compartment, was measured continuously with stop watches. The mice spent less time in proximity to 3 -methyl- 1 -butanethiol and n-pentyl acetate compared to diethyl phthalate (P 0, 05). The avoidance of 3 -methyl- 1 -butanethiol and n-pentyl acetate can be explained either by neophobia, {{or in the case of}} 3 -methyl- 1 -butanethiol that it contains sulphur. The lack of behavioural response towards 3 -mercapto- 3 -methyl-butan- 1 -ol may be due to its loss of intensity over time. From this study it is not certain if mice have an innate fear of predator odours...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensive}} conditioning regimens of {{a pediatric}} blood and marrow transplant (BMT) can limit voluntary intake {{leading to a}} risk of malnutrition. Poor dietary intake is likely multi-factorial with a change in taste and smell function potentially being one contributing factor limiting intake, though this is not well studied. This research aimed to assess the taste and smell function of a cohort of pediatric BMT patients. A total of ten pediatric BMT patients (8 - 15 years) were recruited to this study. Smell function was assessed using a three-choice 16 -item <b>odour</b> identification <b>test.</b> Taste function was assessed using five concentrations of sweet, sour, salty and bitter tastants. All tests were completed at admission to transplant and monthly until taste and smell function had normalised. At the 1 -month post-transplant assessment, one third of participants displayed some evidence of taste dysfunction and one third smell dysfunction, {{but there was no}} evidence of dysfunction in any patient at the 2 -month assessment. Contrary to reports of long-term loss of taste and smell function in adults, dysfunction early in transplant was found to be transient and be resolved within 2 months post-transplant in children. Further research is required to determine the causes of poor dietary intake in this population...|$|R
