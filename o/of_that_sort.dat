5|$|A {{declared}} {{purpose of}} the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humaitá fortifications and that none others <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> should be built again. However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious obstacle to the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E
25|$|In times past, some of {{the cargo}} {{terminals}} on the river were areas of lawlessness. Law enforcement and regulatory agencies have eliminated most <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of activity. When the International Ship and Port Security Code and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Act of 2002 came into force (and in the prior runup) on July 1, 2004, most opportunities for crime were eliminated.|$|E
25|$|In Henkin semantics, each sort of second-order {{variable}} has {{a particular}} domain of its own to range over, which may be a proper subset of all sets or functions <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort.</b> Leon Henkin (1950) defined these semantics and proved that Gödel's completeness theorem and compactness theorem, which hold for first-order logic, carry over to second-order logic with Henkin semantics. This is because Henkin semantics are almost identical to many-sorted first-order semantics, where additional sorts of variables are added to simulate the new variables of second-order logic. Second-order logic with Henkin semantics is not more expressive than first-order logic. Henkin semantics are commonly {{used in the study}} of second-order arithmetic.|$|E

500|$|The final lines {{spoken by}} Chang {{before he is}} obliterated by torpedo fire are lifted from Hamlet's famous soliloquy: [...] "to be, or not to be..." [...] Flinn was {{initially}} unsure about the numerous classical quotations, but when Plummer was cast, Meyer enthusiastically added more. He said, [...] "Whether it's pretentious or not, I {{think it depends on}} how it's used.

500|$|O'Brien {{claimed that}} all of the {{evidence}} given against him was false, and that as an American citizen he ought not to be facing trial in a UK court. He then went on at length to condemn the British government, the [...] "imbecile and tyrannical rulers" [...] of Ireland, until he was interrupted by the judge, who appealed to him to cease his remarks: [...] "The only effect of your observations must be to tell against you with those who have to consider the sentence. I advise you to say nothing more <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort.</b> I do so entirely for your own sake." ...|$|E
500|$|Pipette then {{tries to}} coax {{the old lady}} into leaving, kissing and hugging her, and {{appealing}} to her (hoped for) good nature. The old lady sees through her attempt, and in punishment for her [...] "telling stories" [...] compels her to kiss and cuddle all she meets. She cries out in protest that she's too shy for such behaviour, but the old lady assures her that she'll [...] "get over [...] shyness {{after a year or}} two <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of thing". Boomblehardt approaches next, and Pipette flings herself on him, crying [...] "Kiss me!". He obliges. She responds, [...] "How dare you take such a liberty! You insolent old man! Kiss me". And so he does. She boxes his ears, much to his confusion, and then retreats into the inn in tears.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, nobody wanted to step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you go make a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people who told me how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E

For them, what they are against is the kind of government who shoots an airplane full of innocent passengers" [...] (referring to Iran Air flight 655, an Iranian airliner shot down by an American naval vessel). [...] "For them, it's not the people of America, per se. For them, they are opposed to <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> policy, <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> attitude, <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> arrogance. It's not a nation.

500|$|Ross began 2008 {{platooning}} with Amézaga {{again in}} center field, though Amézaga was eventually replaced by Jacque Jones as Ross's centerfield partner. Ross played against left-handed pitchers as Amézaga and Jones faced right-handers. Ross struggled in April, batting [...]159 with no {{home runs and}} two RBI. After receiving a text message from his father {{at the beginning of}} May saying he would improve, Ross declared that he was restarting his season and had 10 home runs and 18 RBI in the month. During the month, Ross had a stretch where nine out of 10 hits were home runs, becoming the first player to have a streak <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> since Mark McGwire in 2001. On May 14, he hit a game-tying three-run ninth inning home run against Francisco Cordero in a 10-inning, 7–6 loss to the Reds. Then, on June 7 he hit a game-winning three-run home run {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning against Cordero to give the Marlins an 8–7 victory over the Reds. Jones was designated for assignment on June 11, putting Ross in sole control of centerfield. In a four-game series with the Colorado Rockies from July 3 through 6, Ross had 15 RBI, becoming the first player to have that many in a four-game series since Carlton Fisk in 1977. Fourteen of those RBI came from July 4 through 6, the most in a three-game span since Sammy Sosa had 16 in 2002. In 145 games (461 at bats), Ross hit [...]260 with 120 hits, 29 doubles, 22 home runs, and 73 RBI.|$|E
500|$|While {{dividing}} his time, Blackstone {{became an}} administrator at All Souls, securing appointment as accountant, treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746. Completion of the Codrington Library and Warton Building, first started in 1710 and 1720 respectively but not built until 1748, {{is attributed to}} his work. In 1749 he became Steward of the Manors, and in 1750 was made Senior Bursar. Records show a [...] "perfectionist zeal" [...] in organising the estates and finances of All Souls, and Blackstone was noted for massively simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college. In 1750 Blackstone completed his first legal tract, An Essay on Collateral Consanguinity, which dealt with those claiming a familial tie to the founder or All Souls {{in an attempt to}} gain preeminence in elections. Completion of his Doctor of Civil Law degree, which he was awarded in April 1750, admitted him to Convocation, the governing body of Oxford, which elected the two burgesses who represented it in the House of Commons, along with most of the university officers. With this and with his continuing work at the university, Blackstone announced on 3 July 1753 his intentions to [...] "no longer attend the Courts at Westminster, but to pursue my Profession in a Way more agreeable to me in all respects, by residing at Oxford [...] to engraft upon this Resolution a Scheme which I am told may be beneficial to the University as well as myself", which was to give a set of lectures on the common law – the first lectures <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> in the world.|$|E
500|$|Just under 10 {{million people}} voted, with an {{abstention}} rate of 28 percent, {{a level of}} apathy higher than might be suggested by the ongoing political violence. A small number of coerced voters and anarchists formed part of the abstainers. The elections of 1936 were narrowly won by the Popular Front, with vastly smaller resources than the political right, who followed Nazi propaganda techniques. The exact numbers of votes differ among historians; Brenan assigns the Popular Front 4,700,000 votes, the Right around 4,000,000 and the centre 450,000. It was a comparatively narrow victory in terms of votes, but Paul Preston describes it as a 'triumph {{of power in the}} Cortes' [...] the Popular Front won 267 deputies and the Right only 132, and the imbalance caused by the nature of Spain's electoral system since the 1932 election law came into force. The same system had benefited the political right in 1933. The political centre did badly. Lerroux's Radicals, incumbent until his government's collapse, were electorally devastated; many of their supporters had been pushed to the right by the increasing instability in Spain. Portela Valladares had formed the Centre Party, but had not had time to build it up. Worried about the problems of a minority party losing out due to the electoral system, he made a pact with the right, but this was not enough to ensure success. Leaders of the centre, Lerroux, Cambó and Melquíades Álvarez, failed to win seats. The Falangist party, under José Antonio Primo de Rivera received only 46,000 votes, a very small fraction of the total cast. This seemed to show little appetite for a takeover <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort.</b> The allocation of seats between coalition members was a matter of agreement between them. The official results (...) were recorded on 20 February. The Basque Party, who had not {{at the time of the}} election been part of the Popular Front, would go on to join it. In 20 seats, no alliance or party had secured 40% of the vote; 17 were decided by a second vote on 3 March. In these runoffs, the Popular Front won 8, the Basques 5, the Right 5 and the Centre 2. In May, elections were reheld in two areas of Granada where the new government alleged there had been fraud; both seats were taken from the national Right victory in February by the Left.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{competitive}} surfing {{has become}} an extremely popular and lucrative activity, both for its participants and its sponsors, the sport does not have its origins as a competitive pursuit. It is common to hear debate rage between purists of the sport, who still maintain the ideal of [...] "soul surfing", and surfers who engage in the competitive and, consequently, commercial side of the activity. An organisation called the Spirit of Surfing has chosen not to accept surf label sponsorship, since an association <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> could detract from the sentiment they wish to promote.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1990 British {{documentary}} made by George Case and Joe Bullman of Twenty/Twenty Productions, {{the officer}} {{in charge of the}} investigation, Detective Jack Swanson, affirmed the Omaha Police Department's fear of the Black Panther Party: [...] "We feel we got the two main players in Rice and Poindexter, and I think we did the right thing at the time, because the Black Panther Party ... completely disappeared from the city of Omaha ... and it's ... been the end <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> of thing in the city of Omaha — and that's 21 years ago." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 2004 federal {{election}} the Australian Greens were branded as [...] "environmental extremists" [...] and [...] "fascists" [...] by {{some members of}} the Liberal-National Coalition Government. John Anderson described the Greens as 'watermelons', being [...] "green on the outside and red on the inside". John Howard, while Australian Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party, stated that [...] "The Greens are not just about the environment.

2500|$|Reza Iman, {{who is a}} {{spokesperson}} for the group, claimed that the group has been active in the United States for almost 30 years, and defended Hizb ut-Tahrir's activities, stating in an interview that [...] "The call is not to bring that [...] here to this country or anything <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort.</b> The message is for Muslim countries to return to Islamic values."

2500|$|The {{majority}} {{concluded that}} {{acts of violence}} {{such as those that}} VAWA was meant to remedy had only an [...] "attenuated" [...] effect, not a substantial one, on interstate commerce. The government, however, argued that [...] "a mountain of evidence" [...] indicated that these acts in the aggregate did have a substantial effect; for this proposition it relied on Wickard v. Filburn (1942), which held that Congress could regulate an individual act that lacked a substantial effect on interstate commerce if, when aggregated, acts <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> had the required relation to interstate commerce. Once again relying on Lopez, the majority replied that the aggregation principle of Wickard did not apply because economic effects of crimes against women were indirect, and therefore could not be addressed through the Commerce Clause.|$|E
