50|$|Hand dryers {{have been}} popular with {{industries}} for their apparent economies. According to manufacturers, hand dryers can cut costs {{by as much}} as 99.5% (for example a company may spend $2340.00 per year <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels,</b> where as the hand dryer expenditure would be as low as $14.00 per year - this will vary according to the cost of paper towels and electricity). They require very little maintenance compared to paper towels, which must be replaced. An added benefit is the removal of the paper waste. Hand dryers represent a larger initial investment, so those responsible for facility management must do a careful cost analysis to determine whether they are cost effective in their building. Costs are always relative to the kWh cost that the facility is charged by its provider. In the UK, this will typically be around 10-12p, the only way to compare costs accurately is to work out the rated energy consumption and divide it by the number of drys the hand dryer is capable of performing back to back in 1 hour, this will give the energy consumption per dry. The world's lowest energy hand dryer uses just 1 watt-hour per dry and is rated at 0.24 kW.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{growing demand}} for high quality soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] seeds {{requires}} a precise seed quality control system from the seed industry. One way to accomplish this is by improving vigor testing. Cold test has been traditionally employed for corn seeds. However, {{it has also been}} used for other seed crops such as cotton (Gossypium spp.), soybean (Glycine Max), dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and pea (Pisum sativum). This study was carried out with the objective of adjusting an alternative procedure for the cold test to determine soybean seed vigor. Six commercial soybean seed lots of the cultivar BRS 133 were used. The physiological potential of the seed lots was evaluated by germination <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> and sand box, seedling field emergence, tetrazolium, accelerated aging and electrical conductivity tests. Seed moisture content was also determined. The temperature used for the cold test procedures was 10 °C during five days.

A completely randomized experimental design with eight replications was used and the means were compared by the Tukey test (p = 0. 05). To verify the dependence between the alternative test and others single linear correlation was used. All cold test procedures had similar coefficients of variation (CV), highlighting that rolled <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> with soil and the alternative procedure had the best performance, with an average of 94 % and 93 % normal seedlings and CV of 3. 2 % and 3. 6 %, respectively.

The objective of this in vitro study was to introduce antibacterial properties to standard paper towel surfaces by coating them with selenium nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy {{was used to measure}} the size and distribution of the selenium coatings on the paper towels. Atomic force microscopy was used to measure the surface roughness of paper towels before and after they were coated with selenium nanoparticles. The amount of selenium precipitated on the paper towels was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. In vitro bacterial studies with Staphylococcus aureus were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the selenium coating at inhibiting bacterial growth. Results showed that the selenium nanoparticles coated on the paper towel surface were well distributed with semispherical geometries about 50 nm in diameter. Most importantly, the selenium nanoparticle-coated paper towels inhibited S. aureus growth by 90 % after 24 and 72 hours compared with the uncoated paper towels. Thus, the study showed that nanoparticle selenium-coated paper towels may lead to an increased eradication of bacteria in a wider range of clinical environments and in the food industry, thus improving human health.

Lizards were captured by manual collection, {{with the aid of}} pressure rifle or tourniquet and, after dead, individuals were dissected for sex determination by inspection of the gonads. Females were considered reproductive in the presence of eggs in the oviducts or vitellogenic follicles and / or corpora lutea. Clutch size was estimated by counting the number of vitellogenic follicles or eggs in the oviducts. Eggs were measured in its length and width and their volumes were estimated using the volume formula to a prolate spheroid. In males, the left testicles were removed and measured in its length and width, so their volumes were estimated using the volume formula of a prolate spheroid. Histologic sections of testes removed were made, to verify the reproductive condition of males, by identifying the stage of cell maturation in spermatogenesis. Males were considered reproductive if they were in stage IV of cell maturation, corresponding to sperm production. In both sexes the fat bodies were weighed after being drained <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels.</b> The reproduction of males and females occurred throughout the sampling period, but with variation in the proportion of reproductive individuals. The reproductive peak for both sexes occurred in July/ 2010. Females reach sexual maturity at 51, 46 mm in snout-vent length (SVL) and males with 43, 39 mm SVL. Clutch size ranged from one to three eggs and was positively associated with body size of females (Spearman correlation, P < 0, 001, rs = 0, 43). The mean egg volume was associated with body size of females (F 1, 9 = 9, 48, P = 0, 01, R 2 = 0, 51), however, no association between litter size and mean egg volume was found (Spearman correlation, P = 0, 11, rs = 0, 48). Only one female had eggs in the oviducts and vitellogenic follicles simultaneously. The frequency of male reproductive suffered from long-term precipitation and temperature, with an additive effect on precipitation. The values of testis volume and the mean seminiferous tubules diameter and germinative epithelium height of males varied little throughout the study, however, higher values occurred from May to July. The mass of fat bodies of males and females was low throughout the study period, the highest value being found in the rainy season and in August/ 2010. Cnemidophorus ocellifer reproduces continuously in the area of coastal tableland of northeastern Brazil, and the reproductive peak occurs {{at the end of the}} rainy season. As with other species of lizards, the SVL is an important attribute of life history shaping both the size and quality of offspring. Chapter 2 : We studied the trophic ecology of the lizard Cnemidophorus ocellifer in coastal area in northeastern Brazil, aiming to describe the composition of the diet, to verify the relationship between the availability of items in the environment and what is consumed by lizards, and analyzing the possible occurrence of sexual variations, ontogenetic and seasonal diet of the species. The lizards were captured between September/ 2009 to August/ 2010. Stomach contents were screened with a stereoscopic microscope. The food items were measured in its length and width and estimated volume using the formula for the prolate spheroid volume one. The diet in this population is mainly insectivorous, composed mainly of insect larvae, termites and beetles. In the dry season there is an increased consumption of plant parts. Parts of lizards were found in the diet of some individuals of C. ocellifer. The numerical distribution of the items found in the stomachs of C. ocellifer differed from that available in the environment in the dry season (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 59, p = 0, 0009) but not in wet season (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 35, p = 0, 17). There was no variation in the diet of C. ocellifer between the two seasons, considering the number (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 17, p = 0, 76), volume (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 25, p = 0, 34) and frequency of occurrence of prey in the diet (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 17, p = 0, 76). The standardized food niche breadth of C. ocellifer was higher in the rainy season (0, 29) than in the dry season (0, 23). No differences were found between the diet of males and females on the number (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 15, p = 0, 92), volume (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 23, p = 0, 49) and frequency of occurrence of prey (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 19, p = 0, 72), and the average length of the food items did not differ significantly between sexes (males: 7, 36 Â 3, 61 mm, n = 171, females: 8, 06 Â 4, 03 mm, n = 99, t test, t = 0, 99, df = 160, 42, p = 0, 32). The standardized food niche breadth of C. ocellifer males (0, 23) was equal in females (0, 23). The overlap of the diet of males and females was higher when considering the volumetric values (0, 92) than when considering the numerical values (0, 58). The diet of young lizards and adults did not differ significantly on the number (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 31, p = 0, 12) and frequency of occurrence of prey ingested (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 27, p = 0, 22), however, significant differences between the volume of prey consumed by young lizards and adults were found (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 48, p = 0, 0002). Prey eaten by adults had higher average length than those ingested by young lizards (adults: 7, 62 Â 3, 78 mm, n = 270; young: 5, 14 Â 2, 34 mm, n = 97, t test, t = - 6, 00, df = 147, 35, p = < 0, 001), however, prey size independent of body size of lizards did not differ among age classes (t test, t = 0, df = 146, 68, p = 1). The average width of the standard diet of young lizards (0, 32) was higher than the average width of the standard diet of adults (0, 22). The overlap of the diet of adults and juveniles was higher when considering the numerical values of the diet (0, 87) than when considering the volumetric values (0, 68). CapÃtulo 1 : A reproduÃÃo de Cnemidophorus ocellifer foi estudada com base em dados coletados de setembro de 2009 a agosto de 2010, em uma Ãrea de Tabuleiro litorÃneo do municÃpio de SÃo GonÃalo do Amarante, CearÃ, Brasil. Os lagartos foram capturados atravÃs de coletas manuais, com auxÃlio de carabina de pressÃo ou garrote e, apÃs mortos, os indivÃduos foram dissecados para a determinaÃÃo do sexo atravÃs de inspeÃÃo das gÃnadas. As fÃmeas foram consideradas reprodutivas quando da presenÃa de ovos nos ovidutos ou folÃculos vitelogÃnicos e/ou corpos lÃteos. O tamanho da ninhada foi estimado contando-se o nÃmero de folÃculos vitelogÃnicos ou de ovos nos ovidutos. Os ovos foram medidos em seu comprimento e largura e tiveram seus volumes estimados atravÃs do volume para um esferÃide prolato. Nos machos, os testÃculos esquerdos foram removidos e mensurados em seu comprimento e largura, para que fossem estimados os seus volumes segundo a fÃrmula de volume de um esferÃide prolato. Foram realizados cortes histolÃgicos dos testÃculos removidos, para que se verificasse a condiÃÃo reprodutiva dos machos, atravÃs da identificaÃÃo do estÃgio de maturaÃÃo celular em espermatogÃnese. Machos foram considerados reprodutivos quando se encontravam em estÃgio IV de maturaÃÃo celular, correspondente Ã produÃÃo de espermatozÃides. Em ambos os sexos os corpos de gordura foram pesados apÃs serem drenados em toalhas de papel. A reproduÃÃo de machos e fÃmeas foi contÃnua ao longo do perÃodo amostral, porÃm, com variaÃÃo na proporÃÃo de indivÃduos reprodutivos. O pico reprodutivo para ambos os sexos ocorreu em julho/ 2010. As fÃmeas atingem a maturidade sexual com 51, 46 mm de comprimento rostro-cloacal (CRC) e os machos com 43, 39 mm de CRC. O tamanho da ninhada variou de um a trÃs ovos, e foi positivamente associada ao tamanho corporal das fÃmeas (CorrelaÃÃo de Spearman, P < 0, 001; rs = 0, 43). O volume mÃdio dos ovos foi associado ao tamanho corporal das fÃmeas (F 1, 9 = 9, 48, P = 0, 01; R 2 = 0, 51), no entanto, nÃo houve associaÃÃo entre o tamanho da ninhada e o volume mÃdio dos ovos (CorrelaÃÃo de Spearman, P = 0, 11; rs = 0, 48). Somente uma fÃmea apresentou ovos nos ovidutos e folÃculos vitelogÃnicos simultaneamente. A frequÃncia de machos reprodutivos sofreu os efeitos de longo prazo da precipitaÃÃo e da temperatura, com efeito aditivo da precipitaÃÃo. Os valores de VT e das mÃdias de DTS e AEG dos machos variaram pouco ao longo do estudo, porÃm, os maiores valores ocorreram de maio a julho. A massa dos corpos de gordura de machos e fÃmeas foi baixa ao longo do perÃodo de estudo, sendo os maiores valores encontrados na estaÃÃo chuvosa e em agosto/ 2010. Cnemidophorus ocellifer reproduz-se continuamente em Ãrea de tabuleiro litorÃneo do nordeste do Brasil, sendo que o pico reprodutivo ocorre no final da estaÃÃo chuvosa. Assim como para outras espÃcies de lagartos, o CRC Ã um atributo de histÃria de vida importante moldando tanto o tamanho quanto a qualidade da prole. CapÃtulo 2 : Estudou-se a ecologia trÃfica do lagarto Cnemidophorus ocellifer em Ãrea de tabuleiro litorÃneo no Nordeste do Brasil, objetivando-se descrever a composiÃÃo da dieta, verificar a relaÃÃo entre a disponibilidade de itens no ambiente e aquilo que Ã consumido pelos lagartos, alÃm de analisar a ocorrÃncia de possÃveis variaÃÃes sexuais, ontogenÃticas e estacionais na dieta da espÃcie. Os lagartos foram capturados de setembro/ 2009 a agosto/ 2010. Os conteÃdos estomacais foram triados com auxÃlio de microscÃpio estereoscÃpico. Os itens alimentares foram mensurados em seu comprimento e largura e o volume estimado atravÃs da fÃrmula para o volume de um esferoide prolato. A dieta na populaÃÃo estudada Ã predominantemente insetÃvora, composta principalmente por larvas de insetos, cupins e besouros. Na estaÃÃo seca hÃ um aumento no consumo de partes vegetais. Partes de lagartos foram encontradas na dieta de alguns indivÃduos de C. ocellifer. A distribuiÃÃo numÃrica dos itens encontrados nos estÃmagos de C. ocellifer diferiu daquela disponÃvel no ambiente na estaÃÃo seca (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 59; p = 0, 0009), mas nÃo na estaÃÃo Ãmida (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 35; p = 0, 17). NÃo houve variaÃÃo na dieta de C. ocellifer entre as estaÃÃes seca e chuvosa considerando-se o nÃmero (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 17; p = 0, 76), o volume (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 25; p = 0, 34) e a frequÃncia de ocorrÃncia das presas na dieta (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 17; p = 0, 76). A largura padronizada do nicho alimentar (Bmp) de C. ocellifer foi maior na estaÃÃo chuvosa (Bmpec = 0, 29) do que na estaÃÃo seca (Bmpes = 0, 23). NÃo foram encontradas diferenÃas entre a dieta de machos e fÃmeas quanto ao nÃmero (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 15; p = 0, 92), volume (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 23; p = 0, 49) e freqÃÃncia de ocorrÃncia de presas (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 19; p = 0, 72), alÃm do comprimento mÃdio dos itens alimentares nÃo diferir significativamente entre os sexos (machos: 7, 36 Â 3, 61 mm, n = 171; fÃmeas: 8, 06 Â 4, 03 mm, n = 99; Teste t, t = 0, 99, gl = 160, 42, p = 0, 32). A Bmp dos machos (Bmpm) foi igual a das fÃmeas (Bmpf) (Bmpm = 0, 23; Bmpf = 0, 23). A sobreposiÃÃo da dieta de machos e fÃmeas (Omf) foi maior quando se considerou os valores volumÃtricos (Omfv = 0, 92) do que quando considerados os valores numÃricos (Omfn = 0, 58). A dieta de jovens e adultos nÃo diferiu significantemente quanto ao nÃmero (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 31; p = 0, 12) e freqÃÃncia de ocorrÃncia das presas ingeridas (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 27; p = 0, 22), entretanto, houve diferenÃa significativa entre o volume das presas consumidas por jovens e adultos (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Dmax = 0, 48; p = 0, 0002). Presas ingeridas por adultos tiveram comprimento mÃdio maior do que as ingeridas por jovens (adultos: 7, 62 Â 3, 78 mm, n = 270; jovens: 5, 14 Â 2, 34 mm, n = 97; Teste t, t = - 6, 00, gl = 147, 35, p = < 0, 001), no entanto, o tamanho das presas independente do tamanho corporal dos lagartos nÃo diferiu entre as classes etÃrias (Teste t, t = 0, gl = 146, 68, p = 1). A largura mÃdia padronizada da dieta dos jovens (Bmpj) foi maior do que a largura mÃdia padronizada da dieta dos adultos (Bmpa) (Bmpj = 0, 32; Bmpa = 0, 22). A sobreposiÃÃo da dieta de adultos e jovens (Oaj) foi maior quando considerados os valores numÃricos da dieta (Oajn = 0, 87) do que quando considerados os valores volumÃtricos (Oajv = 0, 68) ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- Defining {{adequate}} {{methods to}} assess seed germination {{is important to}} control the quality of commercial lots, especially for species that are not yet included in the Rules for Seed Testing. This study aimed to establish an adequate procedure for germination test in physic nut seeds (J. curcas L.). Three seed lots, in eight replications of 25 seeds each, were sown <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> rolls moistened with a water volume equivalent to 2. 7 {{the weight of the}} dry paper and in sterilized sand moistened up to 60 % of its water-holding capacity. The seeds of each treatment were maintained on germination chambers at temperatures of 20, 25, 30 and 20 - 30 oC. Daily counts were made to define the ideal date to perform the first and the last count test. Criteria for classifying seedlings as normal and abnormal were also established. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design in a split plot arrangement, and the means were compared by Tukey’s test (P< 0. 05). For maximum germination potential of physic nut seeds, the germination test should be conducted at 25 oC and 30 oC, using sand or <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> as a substrate, with the counts at 7 and 12 days after sowing.

40|$|A n image {{processing}} computer application to automatically assess the vigor of three-day-old soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merrill.) seedlings was developed. The software operates on acquired digital images of soybean seed lots placed <b>on</b> a <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> Soybean seedlings were extracted {{away from the}} <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> and converted into various digital representations. These representations were {{used to analyze the}} seedlings and segment them into normal and abnormal categories. The normal seedlings were further processed so that a one-pixel-wide summary structure of the shape of the seedling was produced. From this summary structure, the software classified the seedlings into six type categories based on their shape. Each normal seedling was processed to remove the cotyledon portion of the summary structure based on the type category it fell into. The remaining summary structure, with the cotyledon removed, was then used to compute the length of each seedling in pixels. From these length measurements, speed of growth and uniformity of growth values were computed. These two values were normalized and combined into a zero to 1, 000 vigor index for the seed lot. Combined with the post-processing corrective features, this computer software was able to achieve highly accurate and standardized measurements of each soybean seedling, providing an alternative to the current method of manually measuring soybean seedlings for speed and uniformity of growth when performing a vigor test...|$|R

This novel and inexpensive approach to microporous filter modification entails soaking filters in an aqueous solution of a cationic polymer such as polyethyleneimine (PEI) for 2 h at room temperature and then allowing the filters to air dry overnight <b>on</b> absorbent <b>paper</b> <b>towels.</b> PEI-treated filters were evaluated for coliphage (MS 2, T 2, and phi X 174) and enterovirus (poliovirus type 1 and coxsackievirus type B 5) adsorption from buffer at pH 3. 5 to 9. 0 and for indigenous coliphages from unchlorinated secondary effluent at ambient pH. Adsorbed viruses were recovered with 3 % beef extract (pH 9). Several other cationic polymers were used to modify epoxyfiberglass filters and were evaluated {{for their ability to}} concentrate viruses from water. Zeta potentials of disrupted filter material indicated that electronegative epoxyfiberglass filters were made more electropositive when treated with cationic polymers. In general, epoxyfiberglass filters treated with cationic polymers were found to adsorb a greater percentage of coliphages and enteroviruses than were untreated filters...|$|R
40|$|Vitelline {{membrane}} strength {{plays a role}} {{in preventing}} contamination of albumen by yolk during separation and is important to food safety. Two experiments were conducted to determine if a relationship exists between vitelline membrane protein banding patterns, interior egg quality, and vitelline membrane rupture strength. Eggs were gathered from commercial egg producers from pre-molt (26 wk or 72 wk) and post-molted (74 wk or 82 wk) hens. In each of two trials twenty-one eggs were gathered and stored (4 ?C) per experiment. Three eggs were evaluated on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 for eggs from pre-molted hens; and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 for eggs from molted hens for changes in SDS-PAGE protein banding patterns. The yolk from each egg was isolated and rolled <b>on</b> a wet <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> to remove adhering albumen. The yolk was emptied and washed. The whole membrane was placed into double deionized water and divided into two sections. The first section was the whole membrane sample and the other was separated by forceps into inner and outer membrane samples. The three sections were dissolved separately in 1 % SDS/ 70 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6. 8. Protein concentration was determined using the Lowry method and proteins separated on 4 - 20 % gradient gel by SDS-PAGE. Protein banding patterns were analyzed using the Bio-Rad Multi-Analyst Densitometer. Reductions of VMO I and GP II occurred along with reductions in the protein bands between 60 to 100 kDa. In each of two trials, an additional one hundred forty eggs were gathered at the same time from the same flock and stored at 4 ?C. Twenty eggs were evaluated for quality on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 for eggs from pre-molted hens; and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 for eggs from molted hens. Yolk index, albumen height, albumen pH, and yolk pH were determined. Vitelline membrane strength was determined using a compression anvil. Two different treatments were used on the yolk when evaluating rupture strength: 10 egg yolks with inner thin albumen layer, and 10 egg yolks rolled <b>on</b> wet <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> to remove inner thin albumen layer.
