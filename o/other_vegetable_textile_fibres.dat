40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{examines}} the Export competitiveness and Export performance of Indian textile {{with respect to}} rest of the world. The study focuses on Export performance and competitiveness of Indian textile industry dur-ing the period of 2009 - 2011. Export competitiveness is calculated {{with the help of}} Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) of ten dif-ferent commodities of Textiles like- silk, cotton etc. and results shows that some commodities are more competitive compared to other commodities. The commodities which are more competitive in the international market are cotton, <b>vegetable</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibres,</b> Manmade filaments, Manmade staple fibres and carpets and other textiles floor coverings. The commodities that are performing fairly well in international market are Manmade filament with the highest value of RCA for the year 2009 & 2010 and Manmade stable fibres for the year 2011.

Plants provide the main sources for renewable resources, the main distinction is made between energy crops and non-food crops. A large variety of lubricants, industrially used <b>vegetable</b> oils, <b>textiles</b> and <b>fibre</b> made e.g. of cotton, copra or hemp, paper derived from wood, rags or grasses, bioplastic are based on plant renewable resources. A large variety of chemical based products like latex, ethanol, resin, sugar and starch can be provided with plant renewables. Animal based renewables include fur, leather, technical fat and lubricants and further derived products, as e.g. animal glue, tendons, casings or in historical times ambra and baleen provided by whaling.|$|R

40|$|In the past, the {{presence}} of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> in the bullet track of gunshot injuries in body regions covered with clothes was used to differentiate between entrance and exit wounds; as with handguns, a displacement of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> was considered possible only {{in the direction of}} the shot. In the present study, the transfer of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> from the entrance and exit regions into the bullet path was systematically investigated with the help of a skin-gelatine composite model. For this purpose, the skin of the bullet entrance and exit region was covered with textile fabric (jeans or jersey material), before conducting four test series of ten test shots each firing a 9 -mm Parabellum full-jacketed projectile from a distance of 2 m. The length of the bullet track was 25 and 8 cm, respectively. Subsequently, the bullet tracks were microscopically investigated in sections for {{the presence}} of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres.</b> In all the investigated bullet tracks, <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> both from the entrance and exit regions could be demonstrated. The distribution pattern depended on the length of the bullet path and the extension of the temporary cavitation. The results are discussed in relation to the relevant literature...|$|R

40|$|Throughout antiquity, textile {{manufacture}} was practiced on {{all levels}} of society {{and was one of}} the most labour-intensive of all occupations. As such, it was an industry of great cultural and social importance, which should be factored into any balanced assessment of the ancient economy. Over the last two decades, textile research has demonstrated how much we can learn about the culture, society, technology and economy of the ancient world through archaeological textiles. Textile quality and appearance are dependent on the material of which the textile has been made, that is fibre. Fibre investigation, hence, is more than just identification of material source. By studying fibre on a microscopic level we can come closer to understanding issues of selective breeding/ cultivation, processing of fibres, and their wear. <b>Textile</b> <b>fibre</b> exploitation has had a great impact on subsistence strategies of past societies, which were transformed when plant fibre was largely replaced by animal fibre during Bronze Age. Investigation of <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> development is thus essential to the interpretation of much wider aspects of ancient societies, such as agriculture, animal husbandry, domestication and technology. This paper presents some preliminary results of the project <b>FIBRE</b> (<b>textile</b> <b>Fibre</b> in Italy Before Roman Empire, 2009 - 2011), which aims to deepen our understanding of the development of <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> in the Apennine peninsula (Italy) through a macroscopic, microscopic and molecular investigation of selected archaeological textiles from various Italian sites dated from prehistory to the Hellenistic period. The data collected will provide a much clearer and elaborate picture of the development of wool <b>fibre</b> used for <b>textiles</b> and its profound impact on technology, agriculture, animal husbandry and society in Italy from prehistory until Roman period...|$|R
