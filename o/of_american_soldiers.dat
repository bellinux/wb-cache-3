5|$|The provincial forces began {{landing at}} Gabarus Bay on 30 April, and laid siege to the {{fortress}} while the British ships blockaded the harbour. The Americans began suffering battle losses, while the British naval officers, {{who had a}} low opinion <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers,</b> grew increasingly critical of the American efforts. Warren tried to exert control over the provincial troops, but Pepperrell resisted him. Louisbourg surrendered on 17 June. The Americans lost 180 men in combat, to disease or at sea during the siege, while the Royal Navy ships did not fire on the fortress, and lost just one sailor. As the victors settled into occupation of Louisbourg, friction grew between the Americans and the British. The terms of surrender guaranteed the French in all of their possessions; there was no plunder for the American troops. On the other hand, the Royal Navy had captured several rich French prizes, and British sailors on shore leave bragged to the Americans about how rich {{they were going to}} be from their shares.|$|E

The number <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers</b> in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in Afghanistan throughout Obama's presidency. Republicans took control of the Senate after the 2014 elections, and Obama continued to grapple with Congressional Republicans over government spending, immigration, judicial nominations, and other issues.|$|E

25|$|Obama {{increased}} the number <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers</b> in Afghanistan during his first term before withdrawing most military personnel in his second term. On taking office, Obama announced that the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be bolstered by 17,000 new troops by Summer 2009, {{on top of the}} roughly 30,000 soldiers already in Afghanistan at the start of 2009. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Michael Mullen all argued for further troops, and Obama dispatched additional soldiers after a lengthy review process. The number <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers</b> in Afghanistan would peak at 100,000 in 2010. In 2012, the U.S. and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement in which the U.S. agreed to hand over major combat operation to Afghan forces. That same year, the Obama administration designated Afghanistan as a major non-NATO ally. In 2014, Obama announced that most troops would leave Afghanistan by late 2016, with a small force remaining at the US embassy. In September 2014, Ashraf Ghani succeeded Hamid Karzai as the President of Afghanistan after the U.S. helped negotiate a power-sharing agreement between Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah. On January 1, 2015, the U.S. military ended Operation Enduring Freedom and began Resolute Support Mission, in which the U.S. shifted to more of a training role, although some combat operations continued. In October 2015, Obama announced that U.S. soldiers would remain in Afghanistan indefinitely in order support the Afghan government in the civil war against the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and ISIL. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey framed the decision to keep soldiers in Afghanistan as part of a long-term counter-terrorism operation stretching across Central Asia. Obama left office with roughly 8,400 U.S. soldiers remaining in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Horn briefly {{entered the}} United States Army to serve during the Spanish–American War, {{as the chief}} packer of the Fifth Corps. He left Tampa for Cuba, where he led some of the pack trains to the front. Horn {{personally}} witnessed the bravery of the famous Rough Riders and colored regiments the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry during their assault on San Juan Hill, {{as well as the}} humiliating rout <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>soldiers</b> under Brig. Gen. Hamilton Hawkins. Although the packers were non-combatants, they were still prone to being attacked by Cuban rebels. Horn considered himself lucky to have lost no tracker during the war, although Horn recalled that he and his men were under constant fire as they deliver the rations and ammunition to the soldiers. Horn continued working as a packer during the war even though he and many of his men contracted yellow fever. At one point he was bedridden and was deemed unfit for combat. After recovering, he returned to Wyoming. Shortly after his return, in 1901 Horn began working for wealthy cattle baron John C. Coble, who belonged to the Wyoming Stock Men's Association.|$|E
