500|$|These {{and similar}} {{techniques}} {{became part of}} the vocabulary of the sound comedy film, though as special effects and [...] "color", not {{as the basis for the}} kind of comprehensive, non-naturalistic design achieved by Clair. Outside of the comedic field, the sort of bold play with sound exemplified by Melodie der Welt and Le Million would be pursued very rarely in commercial production. Hollywood, in particular, incorporated sound into a reliable system of genre-based moviemaking, in which the formal possibilities of the new medium were subordinated to the traditional goals of star affirmation and straightforward storytelling.

500|$|Nolan {{is also an}} {{advocate}} {{for the importance of}} films being shown in large screened cinema theaters as opposed to home video formats, as he believes that, [...] "The theatrical window is to the movie business what live concerts are to the music business—and no one goes to a concert to be played an MP3 on a bare stage." [...] In 2014, Christopher Nolan wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal where he expressed concern that as the film industry transitions away from photochemical film towards digital formats, the difference between seeing films in theaters versus on other formats will become trivialized, leaving audiences no incentive to seek out a theatrical experience. Nolan further expressed concern that with content digitized, theaters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be able to track best-selling films and adjust their programming accordingly; a process that favors large heavily marketed studio films, but will marginalize smaller innovative and unconventional pictures. In order to combat this, Nolan believes the industry needs to focus on improving the theatrical experience with bigger and more beautiful presentation formats that cannot be accessed or reproduced in the home, as well as embracing the new generation of aspiring young innovative filmmakers.|$|E

500|$|In the 1940s, {{radio was}} the {{electronic}} medium for family entertainment and information. In the 1950s, it was television {{that was the}} new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world. By the 1970s, games could be played electronically, then hand-held devices provided mobile entertainment, and by {{the last decade of}} the 20th century, via networked play. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The [...] "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" [...] together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films. One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid obsolescence of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded. One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a Wii console, [...] "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953". Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called [...] "digital revolution" [...] has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up. Even the sports stadium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> increasingly compete with television viewing [...] "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available." [...] Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as [...] "professional engagers" [...] shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.|$|E

2500|$|As the Chief of the Bureau of Naval Ordnance {{stated in}} his 1897 Small Arms {{report to the}} Secretary of the Navy, [...] "In making what may appear a radical {{departure}} in its selection of a caliber smaller than as yet adopted elsewhere...the Bureau is convinced it is {{looking to the future}} … it is surely wise to attempt to advance with one stride as far as existing conditions allow toward the goal to which the world is moving with slow steps." [...] The report went on to list the advantages of the smaller 6mm caliber: greatly increased velocity, flatness of bullet trajectory, reduced recoil, a 100% increase in penetration compared to the former [...]45-70 Government cartridge, and the ability to carry twice the number of cartridges per individual sailor or marine. The report acknowledged, however, that the 6mm round had two principal disadvantages: first, as a small-caliber round, the 6mm bullet would not sufficiently wound an enemy to put him out of action, and second, the [...] "shock" [...] or stopping power of the smaller bullet would not [...] "stop the onset of excited men at short range." [...] In answer to these objections, the report gave three responses: first, [...] "the battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be fought at long range, and men will not live to come to close quarters with an enemy who stands his ground"; second, [...] "99 percent of wounded enemy soldiers were unlikely to investigate the severity of their wound, but simply retire to the rear", and last, [...] "the explosive effect of a small-caliber, high-velocity bullet against the human body—the bullet tumbles or fragments to produce devastating wounds against bone or fluid-filled organs—would be more incapacitating at all ranges than wounds made by a slow-moving bullet of large caliber.|$|E
