The uncertainty ranges in calculated N 2 O and CH 4 global lifetimes computed using the SPARC estimated uncertainties are reduced by nearly {{a factor of}} two compared with uncertainties from Sander et al.

Uncertainty in the Cl + CH 4 reaction affects the amount of chlorine in radical vs. reservoir forms and has a modest impact on present day SH polar ozone (~± 6 %), and on the rate of past <b>ozone</b> <b>decline</b> and future recovery. Uncertainty in the total rate coefficient for the O(1 D) + N 2 O reaction results in a substantial range in present day stratospheric odd nitrogen (± 20 - 25 %) and global total ozone (± 1. 5 - 2. 5 %).

At midlatitudes, the abundances, latitudinal, and seasonal gradients of the observed ClO are similar to the results of a model with heterogeneous chemistry, but are in strong disagreement with the results from the model with only gas-phase chemistry.

The addition of relatively small amounts of ethane slowed down the rates of NO oxidation, O 3 formation, and TCE consumption in TCE- NOx irradiations. This is explained by chain reactions involving chlorine atoms. TCE had a positive effect on NO oxidation, O 3 formation, and radical levels in simulated photochemical smog systems, though the positive effect on <b>ozone</b> <b>declined</b> to zero in experiments with sufficiently low NOx/ROG ratios. TCE also enhanced the rate of alkane consumption, also indicating the role of chlorine atoms.

The short-term perturbation studies show similar patterns, but because of the short perturbation time, the chemical effect on ozone is almost negligible. Finally, this study shows that 10 % of the simulated long-term <b>ozone</b> <b>decline</b> in the transient model simulation {{can be explained by the}} water vapor increase, but the simulated tropical ozone decrease after volcanic eruptions is caused dynamically rather than chemically...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{increased}} stratospheric chlorine, averted by controls {{imposed by the}} Montreal Protocol, is studied using the UKCA chemistry-climate model. We contrast an atmosphere with 9 ppbv Cly, which could have occurred by ∼ 2030, with the present-day loading (3. 5 ppbv), and consider the response of climate to resulting ozone perturbations, disregarding the radiative impact of the additional CFCs. <b>Ozone</b> columns <b>decline</b> everywhere, with climate impacts in both polar regions. The additional chlorine leads to a strengthening of the Southern Annular Mode, versus the reference, and Antarctic surface temperature differences resemble observed changes. Over Eurasia, winter surface temperature changes project on the Northern Annular Mode. These high-latitude temperature perturbations (> 1 K) are larger than the global mean temperature rises projected {{over the next few}} decades, and perhaps comparable with projected regional changes. The Montreal Protocol has not only averted further damage to the ozone layq but has helped prevent significant regional climate change. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
40|$|In {{preparation}} of the TROPOMI/S 5 P launch in autumn 2016 a tropospheric ozone retrieval based on the convective cloud differential method was developed. For intensive tests we applied the algorithm to the total ozone columns and cloud data of the satellites GOME, SCIAMACHY, OMI, GOME- 2 A and GOME- 2 B. Thereby a time series of 20 years (1995 – 2015) of tropospheric ozone columns was retrieved. To have a consistent total ozone data set for all sensors one common retrieval algorithm, namely GODFITv 3, {{has been applied to}} all sensors and the L 1 reflectances have also been soft calibrated. These data were input into the tropospheric ozone retrieval. However, the Tropical Tropospheric Ozone Columns (TTOC) for the individual instruments still showed small differences and therefore we harmonised the data set. For this purpose a multi-variant function was fitted to the averaged difference between SCIAMACHY's TTOC and those from the other sensors. The original TTOC was corrected by the fitted offset. GOME- 2 B data were corrected relative to the harmonised data from OMI and GOME- 2 A. The harmonisation leads to a better agreement between the different instruments. Also a direct comparison of the TTOCs in the overlapping periods proves that GOME- 2 A agrees much better with SCIAMACHY after the harmonisation. The improvements for OMI were small. The GOME and SCIAMACHY data overlap for one year for the complete tropics, {{this turned out to be}} insufficient to extrapolate back until 1995. Based on the harmonised observations, we created a merged data product, containing the TTOC from July 1995 to Dec. 2015. A first application of this 20 years record is a trend analysis. The global tropical trend is 0. 75 ± 0. 12 DU/decade. Regionally the trends reaches up to 1. 8 DU/decade like on the African Atlantic coast, over the Western Pacific the tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>declined</b> over the last 20 years with up to 0. 8 DU/decade. The tropical tropospheric data record will be extended in the future with the TROPOMI/S 5 P data, where the TTOC is part of the operational products...|$|R
40|$|In the United States, {{the decline}} of summertime daytime peak ozone in the last 20 years has been clearly {{connected}} to reductions in anthropogenic emissions. Yet questions remain on how and through what mechanisms ozone at other times of day have changed over the recent decades. Here we analyze the interannual variability and trends of ozone at different hours of day, using observations from about 1000 US sites during 1990 – 2014. We find a clear diurnal cycle both in the magnitude of ozone trends and in {{the relative importance of}} climate variability versus anthropogenic emissions to ozone changes. Interannual climate variability has mainly been associated with the de-trended fluctuation in the US annual daytime ozone over 1990 – 2014, with a much smaller effect on the nighttime ozone. Reductions in anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides have led to substantial growth in the US annual average nighttime ozone due to reduced ozone titration, while the summertime daytime <b>ozone</b> has <b>declined.</b> Environmental policymaking might consider further improvements to reduce ozone levels at night and other non-peak hours...|$|R
