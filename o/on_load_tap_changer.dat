40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{monitoring}} and control of tap changer mechanism of a transformer implementation in an Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) is discussed. It has been a custom for decades to provide a separate panel for <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> control for monitoring the tap position. However, this facility cannot either record or transfer the information to remote control centers. As there is a technology shift towards the smart grid protection and control standards, the need for implementing remote control and monitoring has necessitated the implementation of this feature in numerical relays. This paper deals with the programming, settings and logic implementation which is applicable to both IEC 61850 compatible and non-compatible IEDs thereby {{eliminating the need for}} separate tap changer control equipment. The monitoring mechanism has been implemented in a 28 MVA, 110 / 6. 9 kV transformer with 16 tap position with GE make T 60 IED at Ultratech cement limited Gulbarga, Karnataka and is in successful service.

40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of active grid {{components}} for voltage regulation in distribution grids has increased significantly. Besides voltage regulators (VRs), such as transformers with <b>On</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Tap</b> <b>Changers</b> (OLTCs), distributed generators can provide a certain voltage support by means of reactive power control (RPC). The different control entities, OLTC and RPC by photovoltaic (PV) systems, usually operate based on local measurements and control characteristics. Hence, unintended interactions between the control entities cannot be excluded in general. This study analyses the parallel operation of OLTC transformers with a voltage based control and PV systems with different RPC strategies (e. g. watt/power factor control PF(P), volt/var control (Q(V)) in a distribution system environment. The focus is on unintended interactions, such as an increase of OLTC switching operations by PV RPC. The contribution and novelty {{of this paper is}} to raise awareness for the likelihood of these unintended interactions and to provide a first methodology to assess the parallel operation of OLTC control and PV RPC in detail.

30|$|Actually, the WPPC is the {{generation}} system of intermittent low-carbon energy, and its reactive power dispatch has some particularities. On the one hand, {{it is much}} more difficult for the wind turbine generators (WTG) to maintain the active power output constant during the control cycle of reactive power dispatch than the conventional generators. Therefore, the reactive power dispatch strategy based on the operation information at one time section cannot guarantee the control performance during the whole control cycle. On the other hand, the discrete devices, such as shunt capacitor bank (SCB) and <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> (OLTC), cannot smooth the rapid fluctuation of active power output due to the limit of their response time constant. Then, the frequent even irrational regulation of these discrete devices will induce the cascading trip-off of WTGs in the WPPC caused by the reactive power overcompensation or undercompensation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The on-load tap {{changing}} (OLTC) {{regulators have}} been widely used since the introduction of electrical energy. They ensure a good regulation of the output voltage in presence of large variations of the input voltage with typical response time from several mili-seconds to several seconds. Earlier mechanical type of <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> were into practice. But they had considerable limitations and drawbacks like arcing, high maintenance, service costs and slow reaction times. In order to overcome these limitations and drawbacks electronic (or solid-state) tap-changers were developed. The continuous growth of power semiconductor devices, such as the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), triac, thyristor, has allowed the development of quick operating OLTC regulators which is also helpful in fixing other problems in the ac mains, like flicker and sags. The major idea in the solid-state-assisted <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> is that solid-state switches with more controllability, operates during the tap-changing process instead of mechanical switches which helps in reducing the arcing phenomena during the tap-changing process. In this paper implementation of a fast OLTC regulator is presented. The control strategy is Microcontroller-based, ensuring flexibility in programming the control algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the fast OLTC is able to correct several disturbances of the ac mains besides, the long duration in variation in time is much lower than the one corresponding to the traditional regulators...|$|R

The worn contacts will cause hotspots in the OLTC tank and cause the insulating oil to degrade faster. Consequently, this will lead to the damage of complete transformer unit. Thus, the research work that has been carried out applied three different stages related to the diagnosis of OLTC.

40|$|Traditional {{voltage control}} in {{distribution}} networks typically aims at improving the voltage {{profile of a}} distribution feeder by controlling the voltage at the zone substation only.

This paper addresses two different types of volt/var control methods; localised and integrated volt/var control (IVVC). The traditional voltage control method, localised volt/var control and IVVC methods are tested on a modified IEEE 13 node test feeder over a 24 -hour period.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine up to what extent the {{so-called}} generic non-linear dynamic (GNLD) loadmodels can replace a more detailed representation of aggregate load, including induction motors, thermostatically controlled and static loads, in long-termvoltagestability simulations. In the first part of the paper the main characteristics of the GNLD models are compared with those of more detailed models considered as ‘reference’. It is concluded that the long-term instability phenomena are closely reproduced, in most cases, by using the GNLD model. The accuracy of the GNLD reproduction depends on the load characteristics, the type of phenomena that have to be reproduced and the position of the load in the network. Short-term instability phenomena solely due to induction motor dynamics might not be reproduced with adequate accuracy by GNLD models that are characterised by an inherent de-coupling of active and reactive power. Further, the possibility of including <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> transformer into GNLD models is investigated and accomplished.

40|$|Active {{management}} {{strategies such as}} coordinated <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> (OLTC) voltage control and reactive power compensation (RPC) are frequently suggested for voltage regulation in a distribution system {{with a high level}} of distributed generation (DG). This paper proposes a control and coordination algorithm for these two active {{management strategies}}. Voltage control through OLTC is achieved by using state estimation (SE) to determine the voltage in the network. To lower the implementation cost of the proposed control strategy, pseudo-measurements are used together with real-time measurement data in the SE. Moreover, the deadband of the automatic voltage control (AVC) relay is relaxed so that the AVC relay acts on the network's maximum or minimum voltage obtained through the SE. This is found to be simpler to realize than adjusting the set point of the AVC relay. Voltage control through RPC is actualized by using integral controllers implemented locally at the wind turbine site. Furthermore, RPC from the local wind turbine is also used to mitigate an overvoltage at a remote bus on the same feeder when the remote wind turbine reaches its regulation limit.
