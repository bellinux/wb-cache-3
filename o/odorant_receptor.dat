5000|$|Different people smell {{different}} odors, {{and most}} of these differences are caused by genetic differences. Although <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> genes make up one of the largest gene families in the human genome, only a handful of genes have been linked conclusively to particular smells. For instance, the <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> OR5A1 and its genetic variants (alleles) are responsible for our ability (or failure) to smell β-ionone, a key aroma in foods and beverages. Similarly, the <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> OR2J3 is associated with the ability to detect the [...] "grassy" [...] odor, cis-3-hexen-1-ol. The preference (or dislike) of cilantro (coriander) has been linked to the olfactory receptor OR6A2.|$|E

We have identified four genes encoding candidate <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> from A. gambiae that are selectively expressed in olfactory organs, contain approximately seven transmembrane domains, and show significant similarity to several putative <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> in Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, one of the putative A. gambiae <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> exhibits female-specific antennal expression and is down-regulated 12 h after blood feeding, a period during which substantial reduction in olfactory responses to human odorants has been observed. Taken together, these data suggest these genes encode a family of <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> in A. gambiae, whose further study may aid in the design of novel antimalarial programs...|$|R
40|$|During {{olfactory}} development axons {{from the}} sensory epithelium {{migrate to the}} olfactory bulb and gradually establish connections with targeted glomeruli (Key and St John, 2002). The spatial distri-bution of these connections {{form the basis of}} a topographical mapping of <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> onto the olfactory bulb (Vassar et al., 1994). The olfactory epithelium retains its capacity to undergo neurogenesis long after development and <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> continue to establish new connections in the adult olfactory bulb. Remark-ably, these newly rewired connections converge onto glomeruli in specific areas of the bulb maintaining a topographical mapping of <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors.</b> The preservation of this spatial mapping of <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> onto the olfactory bulb plays an essential role in the processing of olfactory information while disruption of odorant maps results in impaired or altered olfactory function (Yee and Costanzo, 1998) ...|$|R

40|$|Chemical senses Ã¢Â€Â“ {{especially}} smell Ã¢Â€Â“ {{are known}} to be important for the fundamental life events such as sensing predators, selecting mates, as well as finding food. The chemical senses are decoded in the olfactory system which is able to detect and differentiate thousands of odorous substances comprised of chemically divergent structures (i. e. odorants). The high selectivity of the olfactory system is heavily dependent on the <b>receptors</b> for each <b>odorants</b> (i. e. <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors).</b> Thus, studying <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> may not only facilitate our understanding the initial events of olfaction but provide crucial knowledge for developing a novel, odorant receptor-based biosensor for chemical screening.

5000|$|Another {{study by}} Keller et al. {{has found that}} people with the intact human <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> OR7D4 are more {{sensitive}} to androstenone and androstadienone and thus find them unpleasant (individuals with the semi-functional OR7D4 have two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the OR7D4 pseudogene, resulting in two amino acid substitutions). [...] There {{has not yet been}} extensive research into the genetic background of those with general hyperosmia, rather than for just a single odorant.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> subunit Or67d {{was shown}} to be {{necessary}} for detection of cVA. Males that are mutant for Or67d start courting other males, whereas females that lack Or67d become less receptive towards males courting them. [...] The sensory neurons expressing Or67d send projections to the glomerulus DA1. [...] DA1 {{is one of the}} three glomeruli that is bigger in males than in females. Moreover, the projection neurons that connect to DA1 have sexually dimorphic arborizations in the higher brain centers (esp. lateral horn).|$|E
5000|$|Another pathway {{that has}} been studied is that {{involving}} another <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> called Or47b, which {{is connected to the}} VA1v glomerulus. Its respective pathway conveys pheromones from odors in both sexes, and when the genetics of the involved neurons is changed, male courtship is delayed. As a simple model, one would view the integration of the Or67d/DA1 and Or47b/VA1v pathways as a way to describe the initiation of mating behavior in drosophila. The former will tend to inhibit male courtship, whereas the latter is thought to stimulate mating.|$|E

50|$|The {{hypothesis}} that IR40a {{is involved in}} DEET reception in mosquitoes has been tested in the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus. Reducing CquiIR40a transcript levels did not affect DEET-elicited behavior or electroantennographic (EAG) responses thus suggesting that IR40a {{is not involved in}} DEET reception in Culex mosquitoes. An antennae-specific <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor,</b> CquiOR136, was demonstrated to respond to DEET and other insect repellents. Similar knockout experiments showed that EAG responses to DEET recorded from mosquitoes with reduced CquiOR136 transcript levels were dramatically lower. Additionally, behavioral tests showed that this phenotype was not repelled by DEET. In conclusion, these results suggest that CquiOR136, not CquiIR40a, is involved in DEET reception in the southern house mosquito.|$|E
50|$|Olfactory {{receptor}} gene (OR) {{is normally}} expressed in human and mouse olfactory tissue with a main function as <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> {{for the detection}} of odorants. Individuals with a defect in this gene have disorders of taste and smell. It has been reported that ORs is also expressed on sperms and testis with special emphasis in a manner of ectopic expression. In a study, researchers identified ectopic expression of OR genes in non-olfactory tissues in the mouse model by measuring transcript levels. Here they found relatively low OR gene expression compared to the olfactory tissue, which result indicates that the OR gene in other tissue have no extra function, but they suggest that {{there is a possibility that}} small OR subsets can have functional roles in different tissue.|$|E
50|$|Drosophila flies exhibit {{specific}} {{relationships between}} neurons and behavior. Much of the courtship activity {{involved in the}} sexual mating process for this species of flies involves mapping neuronal circuitry. As for the neuronal content of the olfactory cues, in both vertebrates and insects, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) extend from the dendrites {{that are responsible for}} interacting with odors from the environment and are then recognized by distinct <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> (OR) proteins that are located in the dendritic membrane. Since there are two distinct forms of anatomical connections in the olfactory interneurons of the third order olfactory interneurons of the lateral horn of the Drosophila melanogaster, these neurons may be the first elements in the olfactory pathway that respond to sex-specific stimuli. Therefore, it is certain that there is a relationship between pheromones, olfaction and courtship.|$|E
40|$|In mammals, the {{perception}} of smell starts with the activation of <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> (ORs) by volatile molecules in the environment. Mammalian genomes typically encode large numbers of ORs, with approximately 400 intact ORs in human and more than 1000 in mouse. Central {{to the question of}} how olfactory stimuli are represented at the peripheral level is defining the ligand selectivity and activity regulation of ORs. Processing of chemosensory signals in the brain is dynamically regulated in part by an animal’s physiological state. The Matsunami lab previously reported that type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M 3 -Rs) physically interact with <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> (ORs) to promote odor-induced responses in a heterologous expression system. However, it is not known how M 3 -Rs affect the ability of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to respond to odors. In chapter 2, I demonstrate that the activation of M 3 -Rs inhibits the recruitment of β-arrestin- 2 to ORs, resulting in a potentiation of odor-induced response in OSNs. These results suggest a role for acetylcholine in modulating olfactory processing at the initial stages of signal transduction in the olfactory system. Understanding odor coding requires comprehensive mapping between <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> and corresponding <b>odorants.</b> In chapter 3, I present a high-throughput in vivo method to identify repertoires of <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> activated by <b>odorants,</b> using phosphorylated ribosome immunoprecipitation of mRNA from olfactory epithelium of odor-stimulated mice followed by RNA-Seq. This approach screens endogenously expressed <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> against an <b>odorant</b> in one set of experiments, using awake and freely behaving mice. In combination with validations in a heterologous system, we identify sets of <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> for two <b>odorants,</b> acetophenone and 2, 5 -dihydro- 2, 4, 5 -trimethylthiazoline (TMT), encompassing 69 receptor-odorant pairs. I also identified shared amino acid residues specific to the acetophenone or TMT receptors, and developed a model to predict receptor activation. This study provides a means to understand the combinatorial coding of odors in vivo. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|The lightbrown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana is an {{increasingly}} global pest of horticultural crops. Like other moths, E. postvittana relies on olfactory cues to locate mates and oviposition sites. To detect these cues, moths have evolved families of genes encoding {{elements of the}} peripheral olfactory reception system, including odor carriers, receptors and degrading enzymes. Here we undertake a transcriptomic approach to identify members of these families expressed in the adult antennae of E. postvittana, describing open reading frames encoding 34 odorant binding proteins, 13 chemosensory proteins, 70 <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors,</b> 19 ionotropic receptors, nine gustatory receptors, two sensory neuron membrane proteins, 27 carboxylesterases, 20 glutathione-S-transferases, 49 cytochrome p 450 s and 18 takeout proteins.

Of the eight <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> that group phylogenetically with pheromone receptors from other moths, two displayed significant male-biased expression patterns, one displayed significant female-biased expression pattern and five were expressed equally in the antennae of both sexes.

5000|$|The {{pathways}} {{that govern}} the mapping of pheromones to the brain of drosophila are beginning to be understood in detail. Pheromones are detected by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). A well-studied pheromone is cVA, which suppresses male courtship behavior when the male detects it from a female. cVA complexes with other proteins to form a ligand, which binds to the <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> Or67d present in OSNs, which is specific for cVA. In turn, the OSNs grow axons that will connect to the glomerulus DA1 in the antennal lobe, which {{is analogous to the}} olfactory bulb in mammals. This glomerulus then connects to DA1 projection neurons (PNs) which relay the pheromone signal further to higher brain centers in the protocerebrum (anterior part of an arthropod brain). It is noteworthy that there is significant neuronal convergence taking place between the OSNs and PNs—about 50 OSN inputs to 4 PNs.|$|E
50|$|Very {{little is}} known on the {{molecular}} mechanism of sperm chemotaxis in mammals. It is even not known whether it {{is similar to that}} of sea-urchin spermatozoa because, on the one hand, assuming universality — the molecular mechanisms may be similar. The finding in human spermatozoa that ANP, a known activator of particulate guanylyl cyclase, is chemotactically active and the consequent suggestion that ANP may directly affect guanylyl cyclase in a manner similar to that caused by the physiological attractant (Zamir et al., 1993) are in line with this possibility. On the other hand, the identification of the <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> hOR17-4 on human spermatozoa and the demonstration of sperm chemotaxis to its agonist bourgeonal (Spehr et al., 2003) suggest that mammalian sperm chemotaxis involves a signal transduction pathway similar to that of the olfactory system. This may seem a valid possibility in view of the finding that male germ cells appear to contain all the elements of the signaling cascade present in olfactory cells (Defer et al., 1998) and the observation that bourgeonal induces a transient Ca2+ influx in about one third of the cells of human spermatozoa, a response that is inhibited by an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (Spehr et al., 2003; Spehr et al., 2004). It is possible that mammalian spermatozoa possess both signal-transduction systems. The observation that intracellular photorelease of each cAMP and cGMP causes a similar behavioral response (Gakamsky et al., 2009) is consistent with this possibility.|$|E
5000|$|A 2015 Chemical & Engineering News {{article on}} the [...] "shape" [...] versus [...] "vibration" [...] debate notes that in the [...] "acrimonious, nearly two-decade-long controversy...on the one side are a {{majority}} of sensory scientists who argue that our odorant receptors detect specific scent molecules {{on the basis of}} their shapes and chemical properties. On the other side are a handful of scientists who posit that an <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> detects an odor molecule's vibrational frequencies". The article indicates that a new study, led by Block et al., takes aim at the vibrational theory of olfaction, finding no evidence that olfactory receptors distinguish vibrational states of molecules. Specifically, Block et al. report that the human musk-recognizing receptor, OR5AN1, identified using a heterologous olfactory receptor expression system and robustly responding to cyclopentadecanone and muscone, fails to distinguish isotopomers of these compounds in vitro. Furthermore, the mouse (methylthio)methanethiol-recognizing receptor, MOR244-3, as well as other selected human and mouse olfactory receptors, responded similarly to normal, deuterated, and carbon-13 isotopomers of their respective ligands, paralleling results found with the musk receptor OR5AN1. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the proposed vibration theory does not apply to the human musk receptor OR5AN1, mouse thiol receptor MOR244-3, or other olfactory receptors examined. Additionally, theoretical analysis by the authors shows that the proposed electron transfer mechanism of the vibrational frequencies of odorants could be easily suppressed by quantum effects of nonodorant molecular vibrational modes. The authors conclude: [...] "These and other concerns about electron transfer at olfactory receptors, together with our extensive experimental data, argue against the plausibility of the vibration theory." ...|$|E

40|$|SummaryOlfactory sensory neurons express {{just one}} out of a {{possible}} ∼ 1, 000 <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> genes, reflecting an exquisite mode of gene regulation.

The signal transduction mechanism subserving <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> gene silencing remains obscure, however. Here, we demonstrate in the zebrafish that <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> gene silencing is dependent on receptor activity. Moreover, we show that signaling through G protein βγ subunits is both necessary and sufficient to suppress the expression of <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> genes and likely acts through histone methylation to maintain the silenced <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> genes in transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.

40|$|Abstract The {{olfactory}} system meets niche- and species-specific demands by an accelerated evolution of its <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> repertoires. In this review, we describe evolutionary processes {{that have shaped}} olfactory and vomeronasal receptor gene families in vertebrate genomes. We emphasize three important periods {{in the evolution of}} the {{olfactory system}} evident by comparative genomics: the adaptation to land in amphibian ancestors, the decline of olfaction in primates, and the delineation of putative pheromone receptors concurrent with rodent speciation. The rapid evolution of <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> genes, the sheer size of the repertoire, as well as their wide distribution in the genome, presents a developmental challenge: how are these ever-changing <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> repertoires coordinated within the olfactory system? A central organizing principle in olfaction is the specialization of sensory neurons resulting from each sensory neuron expressing only ~one <b>odorant</b> <b>receptor</b> allele.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{isolated}} the “complete” repertoire of genes encoding the <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> in Drosophila and employ these genes {{to provide a}} molecular description {{of the organization of}} the peripheral olfactory system. The repertoire of Drosophila <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> is encoded by 57 genes. Individual sensory neurons are likely to express only a single receptor gene. Neurons expressing a given gene project axons to one or two spatially invariant glomeruli in the antennal lobe. The insect brain therefore retains a two-dimensional map of receptor activation such that the quality of an odor may be encoded by different spatial patterns of activity in the antennal lobe...|$|R
40|$|Zonal {{organization}} {{is one of}} the characteristic features observed in both main and accessory olfactory systems. In the main olfactory system, most of the <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> are classi¢ed into four groups according to their zonal expression patterns in the olfactory epithelium. Each group of <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> is expressed by sensory neurons distributed within one of four circumscribed zones. Olfactory sensory neurons in a given zone of the epithelium project their axons to the glomeruli in a corresponding zone of the main olfactory bulb. Glomeruli in the same zone tend to represent similar <b>odorant</b> <b>receptors</b> having similar tuning speci¢city to <b>odorants.</b> Vomeronasal <b>receptors</b> (or pheromone receptors) are classi¢ed into two groups in the accessory olfactory system. Each group of receptors is expressed by vomeronasal sensory neurons in either the apical or basal zone of the vomeronasal epithelium. Sensory neurons in the apical zone project their axons to the rostral zone of the accessory olfactory bulb and form synaptic connections with mitral^tufted cells belonging to the rostral zone. Signals originated from basal zone sensory neurons are sent to mitral^tufted cells in the caudal zone of the accessory olfactory bulb. We discuss functional implications of the zonal organization in both main and accessory olfactory systems...|$|R
50|$|The {{olfactory}} sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium are bipolar neurons.

The axons of the olfactory sensory neurons congregate to form the olfactory nerve (CN I). Once the axons pass through the cribriform plate, they terminate and synapse with the dendrites of mitral cells in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb.|$|R
