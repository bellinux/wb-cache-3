5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E

25|$|Two {{years after}} turning professional, Singh won the 1984 Malaysian PGA Championship. However, {{his career was}} plunged into crisis after he was {{suspended}} from the Asian Tour in 1985 over allegations he doctored his scorecard. It was alleged that he lowered his score from one <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> under {{in order to make}} the cut, but Singh denies this, saying that in any case, it should only have resulted in disqualification from the event rather than a ban. After investigation by the Tour of this and other alleged violations proved true, John Bender, Asian PGA Tour president, issued Singh a lifetime ban on Asian PGA Tour play.|$|E

25|$|Pirates often {{targeted}} slavers. For example, the 300 ton English frigate Concord {{launched in}} 1710 but {{was captured by}} the French one year later. She was modified to hold more cargo, including slaves, and renamed La Concorde de Nantes. Sailing as a slave ship, she was captured by the pirate Captain Benjamin Hornigold on November 28, 1717, near the island of Martinique. Hornigold turned her <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of his men, Edward Teach (later known as Blackbeard), and made him her captain. Teach then renamed her the Queen Anne's Revenge. By 1750, slavery was a legal institution {{in all of the}} 13 American colonies, and the profits of the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to 5% of the British economy {{at the time of the}} Industrial Revolution.|$|E

2500|$|On April 18, 2013, after Prospect Park had {{announced}} {{they would be}} reviving the series, Prospect Park {{filed a lawsuit against}} ABC, alleging ABC failed to honor its part of their licensing agreement. Among the issues named in the lawsuits included ABC's alleged attempts to sabotage Prospect Park's revival of the soap by killing off One Life to Live characters loaned to General Hospital (Cole and Hope Thornhart), failure on ABC's part to consult Prospect Park on storylines involving One Life to Live characters (breaking up popular One Life to Live couple, John and Natalie to pair Michael Easton's John McBain with former Port Charles love interest, Kelly Monaco's Sam Morgan, the death of Tea Delgado's baby and the subsequent switching of her baby with Sam Morgan's live baby, orchestrated by Howarth's Todd Manning), as well as claiming one One Life to Live character, Tomas Delgado, was actually General Hospital character, Lorenzo Alcazar. [...] Effective immediately, the three One Life to Live characters bound to contracts with ABC were to exit the show, and the three actors who played them, Kristen Alderson, Michael Easton and Roger Howarth were rewritten back onto the [...] General Hospital canvas playing new characters, while Howarth also crossed his character of Todd back <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>One</b> Life to Live for its inaugural season.|$|E

After {{reflecting}} on what Linus had said, he decides to take the tree home to decorate, to show the others it will work in the play. When he arrives, he stops at Snoopy's decorated doghouse, which now sports a first prize blue ribbon for winning the display contest. He puts an ornamental ball from the doghouse {{on the top of his}} tree. The branch, with the ball still on it, promptly flops <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side instead of remaining upright, prompting Charlie Brown to declare [...] "I've killed it" [...] and run off in disgust at his perpetual failure. Linus and the rest of the Peanuts gang (who have all become guilty for laughing at Charlie Brown) arrive outside Snoopy's doghouse. Linus gently props the drooping branch back in its upright position by wrapping his blanket around the tree. The group add the remaining decorations from Snoopy's doghouse to the tree, and Lucy admits that the tree does look nice. They start humming [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". Charlie Brown returns, surprised at the humming and the redecorated tree, as his peers greet him with a joyous [...] "Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!" [...] The entire group begins to sing the first verse of [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," [...] and Charlie Brown joins them as the special ends.|$|E
2500|$|Julio's airship gets {{damaged in}} a storm, and the Order {{stop in the}} steampunk-inspired gnome town of Tinkertown to repair it. Haley and the airship's captain deal with a golem made out of Haley's archenemy Crystal (who she killed during the Don't Split the Party storyline), and Roy and Durkon search for a cleric who can cure Durkon's vampirism. They {{encounter}} Veldrina and Wrecan, who are traveling to the Godsmoot, an interfaith council of clerics. The Order flies the pair to the Godsmoot {{with the goal of}} restoring Durkon to life. At the Godsmoot, they discover that due to the threat of the Snarl, the gods are casting votes (conveyed through their mortal representatives) on whether to destroy the world and start over. Durkon, revealed to be the High Priest of Hel, votes in favor of the destruction, causing a tie. With the swing votes of demigod priests potentially dooming the world, Roy tries to eliminate the High Priest of Hel to negate the vote. They fight to a stand still and the demigod priests vote and also cause a tie - with the priest of Dvalin needing to consult with the Dwarven Council before he can cast a vote. It is then revealed that Durkon has killed and vampirized {{all the members of the}} Creed of Stone, who walk into the room. Durkon abdicates his position as High Priest and hands it <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the newly formed vampires as he and a few other vampires teleport to the dwarven lands to dominate the dwarven council so they will vote in Hel's favor. Roy regroups with his team and they fly to dwarven city named Firmament,.|$|E

The third quarter descended into virtual madness however, with several minor fights and scuffles very nearly turning into genuine brawls. In total, five players were yellow carded (sent off for 10 minutes) in a spiteful third quarter.
