40|$|When {{spatially}} {{coherent radiation}} is diffracted by a crystalline object, {{the field is}} scattered in specific directions, giving rise to so-called von Laue patterns. We examine the role of spatial coherence in this process. Using the first-order Born approximation, a general analytic expression for the far-zone spectral density of the scattered field is obtained. This equation relates the coherence properties of the source to the angular distribution of the scattered intensity. We apply this result to two types of sources. Quasihomogeneous Gaussian Schell-model sources are found to produce von Laue spots whose size is governed by the effective source width. Delta-correlated ring sources produce von Laue rings and ellipses instead of point-like spots. In forward scattering, polychromatic ellipses are created, whereas in backscattering striking, <b>overlapping</b> <b>ring</b> patterns are formed. We show that both the directionality and the wavelength-selectivity of the scattering process can be controlled {{by the state of}} coherence of the illuminating source...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: A {{series of}} <b>overlapping</b> <b>ring</b> {{structures}} each contain varied, pre-caldera volcanic sequences, overlain by massive intra-caldera rhyolitic ignimbrites and enclosed within ring dykes of fayalite-hedenbergite granite-porphyry. Early basalts are hypersthene-normative but may originally have been alkaline or transitional to nepheline-normative. They are linked, {{through a series}} of andesine basalts, mugearites and trachyandesites, to aphyric trachytes. Pre-caldera rhyolitic rocks, interbedded with and overlying the basic and intermediate volcanics, are mainly ignimbrites which were perhaps originally peralkaline or near peralkaline, but are often recrystallized to subalkaline compositions. They formed mainly through partial melting with zone refining of crustal rocks, the mantle-derived basic to intermediate magmas providing the heat source. In the early stages of each caldera-forming cycle the ignimbrite eruptions were of small volume and the rocks have varied crystal contents. Later, large high level magma chambers must have developed, from which crystal-rich ignimbrites with volumes in the order of 100 km 3 were erupted, with accompanying caldera collapse. The form of the complex as a whole shows that this cycle occurred repeatedly, but with the location of magma generation migrating progressively westwards, resulting in a chain of rhyolitic cauldrons, into whic...|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of {{two sets of}} different orthogonally protected lanthionine ready for incorporation into solid phase peptide synthesis to form cyclised peptides is described in this thesis, along with the cyclisation of individual rings D and E and the <b>overlapping</b> <b>rings</b> D and E. Previously developed orthogonally protected lanthionine containing Aloc, allyl, Fmoc and tBu protecting groups was synthesised using published synthetic route developed by Tabor’s group. A novel orthogonally protected lanthionine containing Teoc, TMSE, Fmoc and Tce group derivative has also been synthesised, after carrying several synthetic pathways. Both lanthionine residues contain protecting groups which are orthogonal to each other, which are also orthogonal to the transient Fmoc and permanent Boc/tBu protecting groups which are used in Fmoc based solid phase peptide synthesis. Incorporation of the previously developed lanthionine with Aloc/allyl protecting groups was carried out to form an analogue of ring E of nisin for the first time. Deprotection of the Aloc/allyl protecting groups were carried out with Ph(PPh 3) 4 using N’,N-dimethyl-barbituric acid (NDMBA). The second orthogonally protected lanthionine was also incorporated into solid phase peptide synthesis to synthesise an analogue of ring D of nisin. This was also to see whether this {{can be used to}} synthesise lanthionine-containing thio-ether bridged cyclic peptide by solid phase peptide synthesis. Teoc and TMSE deprotection was carried out in the presence of TBAF without effecting the other side chain and Fmoc protecting groups. Full characterisation of individual rings D and E were obtained. Quadruply orthogonal protecting group strategy was used to synthesise bicyclic peptide with two <b>overlapping</b> lanthionine bridges <b>rings</b> D and E.

Proponents of this hypothesis suggest that a proto-rattle may have enhanced caudal luring, a behavior common to rattlesnakes and their closest relatives, because such a structure might have looked similar to an arthropod head.

30|$|Protection {{systems for}} the spectrographs have been {{specifically}} designed and created for this set of elements, as per the dimensions and needs of each device. The individual PVC protection consists of two concentric tubes whose dimensions fit the CCD and other elements that shape our device.

In Dictyostelium, the actin-binding protein Abp 1 and myosin IK are enriched in the closing cup and especially at an actin-dense constriction furrow formed {{around the neck of}} engulfed budded yeasts. This phagocytic furrow consists of concentric <b>overlapping</b> <b>rings</b> of MyoK, Abp 1, Arp 3, coronin, and myosin II, following an order strikingly reminiscent of the overall organization of the lamellipodium of migrating cells. Mutation analyses of MyoK revealed that both a C-terminal farnesylation membrane anchor and a Gly-Pro-Arg domain that interacts with profilin and Abp 1 were necessary for proper localization in the furrow and efficient phagocytosis. Consequently, we measured the binding affinities of these interactions and unraveled further interactions with profilins, dynamin A, and PakB. Due to the redundancy of the interaction network, we hypothesize that MyoK and Abp 1 are restricted to regulatory roles and might affect the dynamic of cup progression. Indeed, phagocytic uptake was regulated antagonistically by MyoK and Abp 1. MyoK is phosphorylated by PakB and positively regulates phagocytosis, whereas binding of Abp 1 negatively regulates PakB and MyoK. We conclude that a MyoK-Abp 1 -PakB circuit acts as a switch regulating phagocytosis efficiency of large particles...|$|R
5000|$|More recently, {{the term}} {{has come into}} much wider usage with the {{development}} and adoption of GPS. Neglecting ionospheric [...] and tropospheric effects, the signal from navigation satellites has a fixed precision. Therefore, the relative satellite-receiver geometry {{plays a major role}} in determining the precision of estimated positions and times. Due to the relative geometry of any given satellite to a receiver, the precision in the pseudorange of the satellite translates to a corresponding component in each of the four dimensions of position measured by the receiver (i.e., , , , and [...] ). The precision of multiple satellites in view of a receiver combine according to the relative position of the satellites to determine the level of precision in each dimension of the receiver measurement. When visible navigation satellites are close together in the sky, the geometry is said to be weak and the DOP value is high; when far apart, the geometry is strong and the DOP value is low. Consider two <b>overlapping</b> <b>rings,</b> or annuli, of different centres. If they overlap at right angles, the greatest extent of the overlap is much smaller than if they overlap in near parallel. Thus a low DOP value represents a better positional precision due to the wider angular separation between the satellites used to calculate a unit's position. Other factors that can increase the effective DOP are obstructions such as nearby mountains or buildings.|$|R
30|$|The viscous {{behavior}} {{of crude oil}} {{is due to the}} presence of hydrogen bonding and <b>overlapping</b> of aromatic <b>rings</b> present between different asphaltene molecules and asphaltene/resin (Soni et al. 2010). The greater the amount of asphaltenes and resins present in the oil is, the higher the viscosity of the crude oil is. To reduce the viscosity of the crude oil, the hydrogen bond between the resin and the asphaltene should be broken. Upon the addition of a surfactant to the crude oil, strong hydrogen bond formation occurs between the surfactant and resin, and the surfactant and asphaltene, reducing the <b>overlapping</b> of aromatic <b>rings</b> between asphaltene–asphaltene and asphaltene–resin molecules. The presence of polar groups in PAM helps to form strong hydrogen bonds between surfactant and resin, and asphaltene molecules, causing it to act as an effective flow improver.|$|R
