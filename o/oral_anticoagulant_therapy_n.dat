40|$|International audienceWhether to {{continue}} <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> indefinitely after completing 3 to 6 months of <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> for "unprovoked" venous thromboembolism (VTE), {{is one of}} the most important unanswered questions in VTE management. This long-term decision should be based on balancing the long-term mortality risk from recurrent VTE, largely preventable with <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy,</b> against the long-term mortality risk of major bleeding, the principle complication of <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy.</b> There exist important knowledge gaps in estimating the long-term mortality risk of recurrent VTE in patients with unprovoked VTE who discontinue therapy and the long-term mortality risk from major bleeding in those who continue <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy.</b> These knowledge gaps, reviewed herein, are the source of uncertainty for patients and health care providers wrestling with this important question. One promising solution is recurrent VTE risk stratification where unprovoked VTE patients are categorised as low or high risk for recurrent VTE and clinical decision making is less ambiguous and ultimately will likely lead to better outcomes...|$|R

Patients were split into two groups: those undergoing preventive Esophago-Gastro-Duode-noscopy (EGD) (Group A) and those who did not (Group B). All patients positive by EGD underwent medical treatment and subse-quent 30 -day endoscopic controls showed complete healing.

Improving the quality of the <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> could avoid drug related hospitalizations. Therefore, this study compared the patient outcomes between Dutch anticoagulant clinic (AC) regions taking the variation in chronic care management into account in order to explore whether chronic care management elements could improve the quality of <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy.</b> Methods Two data sources were combined. The first source was a questionnaire that was send to all ACs in the Netherlands in 2008 (response = 100 %) to identify the application of chronic care management elements in the AC regions.

40|$|The {{initiation}} and {{stabilization of}} <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> in hospitalized {{patients in a}} setting without specialized medical or pharmaceutical advice, was studied. In addition, potential risk factors for lack of stabilization were studied. All patients from three wards (orthopaedic surgery, general surgery and internal medicine) in two Dutch hospitals, who were started on <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> and who gave informed consent, were included in this three months prospective follow-up study. When a patient had two consecutive INR's within the range 2 - 3 during hospitalization (on day 6 or later), he was defined as stable. Stable and unstable patients were compared with respect to age, gender, quetelet index, length of hospital stay, indication for <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy,</b> induction dosing schedule of <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy,</b> prescribing physician, type of hospital (teaching or non-teaching), concurrently used drugs, concurrently used drugs known to potentially interact with <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> (drug-drug interactions that influence INR) and (co) morbidity. A total of 125 patients, who all used acenocoumarol as <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant,</b> were recruited in the study. The study population mainly comprised orthopaedic discharges on prophylactic <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants.</b> The mean length of hospital stay was 14. 5 days (median 11. 0, standard deviation (SD) 10. 2) for the patients {{included in the study}} (patients with a short length of stay < 6 days were excluded from the study, because of the definition of stability). 43 patients (34 %) became stable during hospitalization. The second INR within the range was reached after on average 11. 1 days (median 10. 0, SD 4. 5). 18 different induction dosing schedules were used. Differences in apparent risk of INR instability were statistically associated with length of hospital stay (odds ratio (OR) 0. 85, 95 % confidence interal (CI) 0. 78 - 0. 92), concurrent use of muscoloskeletal drugs, mainly NSAIDs, (OR 1. 68, 95 % CI 1. 04 - 2. 72) and two individual prescribing physicians (OR 6. 61, 95 % CI 1. 47 - 29. 82 for one physician and OR 0. 23, 95 % CI 0. 06 - 0. 99 for the other physician). This population has a high percentage of instability and reaches stability relatively late. The instability was associated with length of hospital stay, the concurrent use of musculoskeletal drugs (mostly NSAID's) and physician. Most of the unstable patients had INR's below therapeutic range, suggesting a conservative dosing habit. Part of the instability may also be due to the many different physicians who dose their own patients. Interventions to improve dosing may aid in better stabilization in hospitalized patients and thus in reduced length of hospital stay...|$|R
40|$|Long-term <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> is {{critical}} to the optimal management of various thromboembolic and vascular disorders. To determine whether age is related to the development of bleeding complications in patients who are receiving long-term <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy,</b> the records of 321 patients who were followed up in the university hospital outpatient anticoagulation clinic during an eight-year period were reviewed. During this period, 61 patients (19 %) developed minor bleeding complications, and 14 patients (4. 4 %) developed major bleeding complications. In utilizing a life-table approach to adjust for varying lengths of follow-up, the risk of initial minor bleeding complications was found to be greatest within the first three months (14 %). For major bleeding complications, risk increased throughout {{the first two years of}} anticoagulation clinic follow-up, with no particular period of greatest risk. No significant differences in the risk of initial minor or major bleeding complications were observed in the various age groups that were examined (less than 50, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and greater than or equal to 70 years). A multivariate regression approach, controlling for several potentially confounding factors, confirmed the lack of an association of age with the risk of minor or major bleeding complications. The results of this retrospective follow-up study suggest that patient age, in and of itself, should not be considered a primary factor in assessing the risk of long-term <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy...</b>|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{extensive}} research on <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> has focussed on its pharmacological- and biochemical action, prothrombin time calibration, optimal therapeutic intensity and hemorrhagic complications. However, whlle the risks of overanticoagulation are clear, its treatment and determinants have received little attention. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} thesis was to study aspects of overanticoagulation on coumarin anticoagulants among outpatients of an anticoagulation clinic. Overanticoagulation was defined as an INR:> 6. 0, since at this INR-value the risk of hemorrhage sharply increases (28, 41). Chapter 2 relates to the treatment of overanticoagulation and describes the course of the INR in response to oral vitamin K 1 in overanticoagulated patients. Chapter 3 concerns the incidence of and risk factors for overanticoagulation and includes five studies. Chapter 3. 1 focusses on characteristics of <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> and comorbidlty associated with overanticoagulation, chapters 3. 2 and 3. 3 on drug interactions as a cause of overanticoagulation, and chapters 3. 4 and 3. 5 on lifestyle and diet as risk factors for overanticoagulation. The levels of the vitamin K-dependent pro- and anticoagulant proteins in overanticoagulated patients are evaluated in chapter 4.

40|$|International audienceVitamin K antagonists are the {{mainstay}} {{for the treatment}} for venous thromboembolism.

The risk of recurrent VTE is low when the initial episode is provoked by a reversible major-risk factor (surgery), whereas this risk is high when VTE is not provoked or associated with a persistent-risk factor (cancer). Conversely, the influence of biochemical and morphological tests is uncertain. The optimum balance of the benefits and the risks of <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> is based on the frequency as well as the consequences of the risk of recurrent VTE and anticoagulant-related bleeding.

The main aim {{of this research was}} to determine the optimal intensity of long-term <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> in 3404 post-myocardial infarction patients. Chapter 1 gives a review of long-term clinical trials which assessed the mertts of <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> in the secondary prevention of morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction. This review includes the results of more than thirty trials reported in the literature in the past forty years, however, unpublished data or results of small trials, were not considered. Few of these trials were randomized, and the level of anticoagulation was properly maintained in only some of these studies. The results of most of these trials have failed to convincingly demonstrate the beneficial effects of long-term <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> as a secondary preventive measure and the use of such therapy has therefore remained controversial. Chapters 2 and 3 describe the design and execution of the ASPECT (Anticoagulants in the Secondary Prevention of Events in Coronary Thrombosis) trial. The main results of this trial are submitted in Appendix-A. ASPECT was designed to be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicentre trial which compared standard <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> with placebo with regards to mortality and cardiovascular events. Chapter 2 describes the design and procedures of the ASPECT trial in detail, in particular the methods for double-blind anticoagulant titration.

In Chapter 5, the optimal achieved intensity of <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> required to prevent recurrence of arterial thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications was quantitatively evaluated with regard to the international normalized ratio (INR) intensity preceding the event, enabling the calculation of INR-specific incidence rates. The INR expresses the level of <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> in an internationally agreed term. It is the common term for the prothrombin time as measured in a patient on <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy.</b> Chapter 6 gives {{a detailed description of the}} risk of stroke in the ASPECT population. Finally, a discussion of the findings is provided in Chapter 7, followed by recommendations for further researc...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} on the general adhesion of the patients to <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy,</b> and particularly on {{the quality of life of}} our patients, the doctor-patient relationship and the Centre-patient relationship. For this purpose we administered a questionnaire containing 17 main questions each with a maximum of 4 secondary questions. The questionnaire was administered to two groups of 127 and 137 oral anticoagulated patients (127 males and 137 females, mean age 55 +/- 19 years), followed at two Anticoagulation Clinics, in two Italian cities, Cagliari (Sardinia) and Padua (North East Italy). The cities differed in the number of patients monitored and the management modalities of anticoagulation. The results show that <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> does not limit the life-style of the patients. Only 11 % of the patients complain of limitations to their daily life. Fifty-two percent believe their health has improved, and 87 % are not afraid of negative consequences. The doctor-patient relationship is considered very important by 96 % of patients. Seventy-eight percent refer to the Anticoagulation Clinic also for other health problems, 93 % consider it important to be assessed by the doctor at the Anticoagulation Clinic, while 83 % believe the doctor should always hand out the results personally. We conclude that in general <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> is accepted by the majority of patients, in spite of the need for periodic monitoring. The doctor-patient relationship should be taken into account, even in the case of a monitored, computer-assisted method of dose-adjustment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the efficacy of antiplatelet <b>therapy</b> and <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants</b> in maintaining graft patency and preventing ischemic complications in patients after infrainguinal bypass surgery. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of aspirin with or without other antiplatelet <b>therapy</b> and <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants</b> after infrainguinal bypass surgery. Outcome measures studied were graft occlusion, stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular and total mortality, and the composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular mortality. Results: Five trials of antiplatelet therapy versus placebo were included. The relative risk (RR) for occlusion was 0. 78 (95 % CI, 0. 64 - 0. 95). For prevention of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death, and for the composite outcome, no significant effect was measured. Only one trial of <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants</b> versus control treatment was included. The RR for occlusion was 0. 55 (95 % CI, 0. 30 - 0. 99), and that for amputation was 0. 30 (95 % CI, 0. 10 - 0. 87). The mortality rate {{did not differ significantly}} between the groups. One trial of <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> plus aspirin versus aspirin alone in high-risk patients was included. The RR for occlusion was 0. 38 (95 % CI, 0. 15 - 0. 95). There were no significant differences for prevention of amputation, myocardial infarction, and death between the groups. Conclusion: Antiplatelet <b>therapy</b> and <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants</b> reduce the risk of graft occlusion. <b>Oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> appears to be the more effective treatment in high-risk patients. Data on the reduction of the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death are inconclusive. Evidence for the beneficial effects of antiplatelet and <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulant</b> <b>therapy</b> after infrainguinal bypass surgery is based on a small number of trials only. There is no proof as to which modality is the most effective in the prevention of graft occlusion and ischemic events in patients after infrainguinal bypass surgery, which is reason for a randomized comparison of aspirin with <b>oral</b> <b>anticoagulants.</b> (J Vasc Surg 1999; 30 : 701 - 9. ...|$|R
