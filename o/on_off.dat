Prior to the match, O'Neill was hounded by the media. The tourists decided to test him with short-pitched bowling, especially Fred Trueman. O'Neill decided to abstain from hooking, while attacking the spin of Jim Laker with a series of sweep shots. After four and a half hours of uncharacteristic restraint, he compiled 104 with an emphasis <b>on</b> <b>off</b> side play. He took a total of 2/67, removing Fred Trueman and Arthur Milton.|$|E

5|$|Loxton came in {{with the}} score at 265/5 and {{accompanied}} Morris for 39 further runs before he fell to the new ball. He appeared uncomfortable with the outswingers and leg cutters of Bedser, and was beaten several times, before Edrich had him caught behind for 15. Lindwall came in and attacked immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air, and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 332/7. Morris was then finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for its numerous hooks and off-drives. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run to third man after being called through from the non-striker's end by Tallon, but was too slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Ring, before both were out with Australia's score on 389, ending the tourists' innings. Both were caught by Crapp in slips from the bowling of Hollies and Bedser respectively. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin bowling; Young took 2/118 and of the 158.2 overs bowled, 107 were delivered by the two slow men. Hollies pitched the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into playing front-foot shots from balls that spun after pitching <b>on</b> <b>off</b> stump.|$|E

40|$|Subcellular {{difference}} in the reversal potential of Cl- (ECl) {{has been found in}} many types of neurons. As local ECl largely determines the action of nearby GABAergic/glycinergic synapses, subcellular ECl difference can effectively regulate neuronal computation. The ON-OFF retinal ganglion cell (RGC) processes both <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> visual signals via its <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> dendrites, respectively. It is thus interesting to investigate whether the <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> dendrites of single RGCs exhibit different local ECl. Here, using in vivo gramicidin-perforated patch recording in larval zebrafish ON-OFF RGCs, we examine local ECl at the <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> dendrites, and soma through measuring light-evoked <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> inhibitory responses, and GABA-induced response at the soma, respectively. We find there are subcellular ECl differences between the soma and dendrite, as well as between the <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> dendrites of single RGCs. These somato-dendritic and inter-dendritic ECl differences are dependent on the Cl- extruder, K+/Cl- co-transporter (KCC 2), because they are largely diminished by down-regulating kcc 2 expression with morpholino oligonucleotides or by blocking KCC 2 function with furosemide. Thus, our findings indicate that there exists KCC 2 -dependent ECl difference between the <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> dendrites of individual ON-OFF RGCs that may differentially affect visual processing in the <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> pathways...|$|R

500|$|Critical {{response}} to Off the Deep End was generally positive. Many critics praised not only Yankovic's parodies, {{but also his}} originals.

[...] Christopher Thelen, of the Daily Vault, wrote, [...] "In fact, it's strange to admit, but the originals <b>on</b> <b>Off</b> The Deep End actually are, at times, stronger than the parodies." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Off the Deep End was awarded 3.5 stars out of 5, denoting that the album averaged between good and excellent. Not all reviews were so positive, however. Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne noted that the video for Off the Deep End lead single [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] was [...] "an old-fashioned laugh riot", but that half of Yankovic's humor was merely visual, meaning that the songs without videos were not as funny.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{developing}} retina generates spontaneous glutamatergic (stage III) {{waves of}} activity that sequentially recruit neighboring ganglion cells with opposite light responses (<b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> RGCs).

The circuits that produce stage III waves and desynchronize <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> RGC firing remain obscure. Using dual patch-clamp recordings, we find that <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> RGCs receive sequential excitatory input from <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> cone bipolar cells (CBCs), respectively. This input sequence is generated by crossover circuits, in which ON CBCs control glutamate release from OFF CBCs via diffusely stratified inhibitory amacrine cells. In addition, neighboring ON CBCs communicate directly and indirectly through lateral glutamatergic transmission and gap junctions, {{both of which are}} required for wave initiation and propagation. Thus, intersecting lateral excitatory and vertical inhibitory circuits give rise to precisely patterned stage III retinal waves...|$|R
