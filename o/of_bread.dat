40|$|Three kinds <b>of</b> okara-containing <b>breads,</b> white bread, bagle, and nun, were produced, and the microstructure, {{physical}} property, and {{characteristic of}} taste were investigated. Twenty percentage of wheat flour <b>of</b> the <b>breads</b> was substituted with dry okara. The difference between microstructures <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> {{with and without}} okara was slightly observed in three kinds <b>of</b> <b>breads,</b> respectively. While the height or thickness <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> was decreased by the substitution of wheat flour, the hardness <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> was increased by the substitution. The significant difference in sensory evaluation of three kinds <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> was observed between breads substituted and not substituted with okara...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare textural (firmness) and sensory {{properties}} (surface colour, crumb colour, crumb texture, appearance, appearance and colour preferences) between whole breads made from conventional wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.) and whole breads made from unconventional wheat (Triticum aestivum, L., winter variety Skorpion, grains with blue aleuron). Wholemeal breads (control samples with marks C 1, C 2 and C 3) were prepared of 100, 90 and 80 % amount of conventional wholemeal wheat flour to 0, 10 and 20 % amount of smooth white flour made from conventional wheat using baker's experiment. Wholemeal breads (experimental samples with marks S 1, S 2 and S 3) were prepared of unconventional wholemeal wheat flour to smooth white wheat flour in same ratio as control samples <b>of</b> <b>breads.</b> Our results showed, that negative evaluation of some sensory attributes <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> made from unconventional wheat correlated with increasing addition of wholemeal flour of this wheat. It was found that breads made from conventional wheat (100, 90 and 80 % amount of conventional wholemeal flour) were more acceptable in surface colour, colour and appearance preferences than these sensory attributes <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> made from unconventional wheat (same amount of wholemeal flour). Appearance and crumb colour <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> made from conventional wheat (100 and 90 % amount of wholemeal flour) were evaluated better than these attributes <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> made from blue coloured wheat (same amount of wholemeal flour). Appearance and crumb colour of both groups <b>of</b> whole wheat <b>breads</b> (80 : 20) was similarly evaluated. Crumb texture <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> made from conventional wheat (90 % and 80 % amount of wholemeal flour) was worse than crumb texture <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> produced <b>of</b> same ratio of flour, but made from unconventional wheat. <b>Breads</b> with addition <b>of</b> 80 % of wholemeal flour milled of blue coloured wheat were most acceptable in all of sensory attributes for evaluators. Significant difference (p < 0. 05) of crumb fimness <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> were demonstrated between samples <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> (80 : 20) made from conventional or unconventional wheat. Crumbs <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> (100 : 0 and 80 : 20) made from blue coloured wheat had higher firmness than crumbs <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> (100 : 0 and 80 : 20) made from conventional wheat. But crumbs <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> (90 : 10) made from conventional wheat were firmer than crumbs <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> (90 : 10) made from unconventional wheat. <b>Breads</b> produced <b>of</b> blue coloured wheat were also more friable than breads made from conventional wheat. Although evaluation <b>of</b> wholemeal <b>breads</b> made from unconventional wheat had not better scores than evaluation <b>of</b> wholemeal <b>breads</b> made from conventioval wheat, but evalution <b>of</b> <b>breads</b> produced <b>of</b> unconventional wheat wholemeal flour were not below average and its market position could be very high in the future, due to the content of health benefit substances, which will be the subject of further research. <!

5|$|Urban {{populations and}} the {{military}} preferred to consume their grain in the form <b>of</b> <b>bread.</b> Mills and commercial ovens were usually combined in a bakery complex.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>breaded</b> fish (Engraulis anchoita) by public school students aged 5 – 18 (n= 830) from two cities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. First, by using multivariate analyses, the authors sought to assess the effect of the variables sex, city, and age on the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>breaded</b> fish. The second objective was to develop a predictive model that was applicable to different levels of acceptance. The results showed that the significant variable for the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>breaded</b> fish was age. According to the linear model and the descriptive statistics, an inverse relationship exists between the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>breaded</b> fish in school meals and the age of the children, possibly a consequence of the children being more critical in their food preference with the rising age, making the insertion of a new food that is not part of their eating behaviour more difficult...|$|R
