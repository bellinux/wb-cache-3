50|$|This circuit shows a {{push button}} that closes a door, and an <b>obstruction</b> <b>detector</b> that senses if {{something}} is {{in the way of}} the closing door. When the normally open push button contact closes and the normally closed <b>obstruction</b> <b>detector</b> is closed (no obstruction detected), electricity is able to flow to the motor which closes the door.|$|E
50|$|An {{example is}} an {{automobile}} detected by an <b>obstruction</b> <b>detector</b> (踏切障害物検知装置, fumikiri shōgaibutsu kenchi sōchi) stuck {{at a level}} crossing, activating the obstruction-warning device at the crossing. Another use is to guard against rockfalls; detection wires are installed {{at the bottom of}} cliffs, activating the signal when the wires are broken by rocks. On some platforms, emergency buttons or detection mats activate the obstruction-warning signal (mounted on the home signal) if a person falls on the track. Obstruction-warning signals are installed at the entrance of long tunnels or areas of dense traffic (such as quadruple-track sections); these activate if an accident is detected, preventing further damage.|$|E
