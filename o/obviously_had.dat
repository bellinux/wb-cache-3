25|$|The {{borders of}} Moravia cannot exactly be {{determined}} {{because of the}} lack of accurate contemporaneous sources. For instance, the monks writing the Annals of Fulda in the 9thcentury <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> limited knowledge of the geography of distant regions of Central Europe. Furthermore, Moravian monarchs adopted an expansionist policy in the 830s, thus the borders of their realm often changed.|$|E
25|$|United {{went into}} the second leg {{with a couple of}} injury {{concerns}} in the centre of their defence. Nemanja Vidić was still carrying an injury from the first leg, while Rio Ferdinand had a suspected foot injury that he picked up in the Reds' match against Middlesbrough at the weekend. Nevertheless, Ferdinand was deemed to be fit enough to start the match, and lined up alongside Gerard Piqué in the centre of defence. Mikaël Silvestre also found a place in the starting lineup, making his first start for nearly seven months, following a knee ligament injury, and Gary Neville also made a return to the first team squad, being selected on the bench. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes were left on the bench, as Alex Ferguson <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> an eye on the following weekend's match against Arsenal. Manchester United started the match brightly, creating numerous opportunities in the first few minutes. However, on the half-hour, the referee Tom Henning Øvrebø awarded the visiting side a penalty for a trip on Mancini by Wes Brown, which Daniele De Rossi stepped up to take. Live action replays however showed no contact between Brown and Mancini. Fortunately for United, the Italian midfielder blazed the ball over the crossbar, wasting what would end up being Roma's best chance of getting back into the tie.|$|E

500|$|Justice Souter wrote a {{separate}} dissent which {{was joined by}} the other three Justices who signed onto Stevens' dissent as listed above. He mainly attacked the method of the majority's statutory reading and its failure {{to look at the}} statute [...] "as a whole". He wrote, [...] "It is imputing something very odd to the working of the congressional brain to say that Congress took care to bar application of the Act to the class of employment contracts it most <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> authority to legislate about in 1925..." [...] With that understanding of the Act, he would have affirmed the decision and holding of the Ninth Circuit.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} further popularized and embellished in Journey Into Darkness: Ghosts and Vampires of New Orleans (1998) by Kalila Katherina Smith, the {{operator}} of a New Orleans ghost tour business. Smith's book added several more explicit details to the discoveries allegedly made by rescuers during the 1834 fire, including a [...] "victim [...] <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> her arms amputated {{and her skin}} peeled off in a circular pattern, making {{her look like a}} human caterpillar," [...] and another who had had her limbs broken and reset [...] "at odd angles so she resembled a human crab". [...] Many of the new details in Smith's book were unsourced, while others were not supported by the sources given.|$|E
500|$|Discounting his {{collaboration}} with Dukas in {{the completion of}} Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, {{two of which are}} opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns [...] "lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior." [...] In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: [...] "Saint-Saëns <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> no time for Massenet's histrionics". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan [...] "with a light French touch".|$|E

500|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{assertion}} that at least six of the suspected hijackers named {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks turned up alive, the so-called [...] "zombie hijackers" [...] claim. Der Spiegel offers an explanation for this apparent mystery: BBC News used as a source the Arab News, an English-language Saudi newspaper, which in turn had compiled reports from Arabic newspapers, of people who <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> nothing to do with the attacks but happened to share the same names with some of the suspected hijackers. No photographs of the suspected hijackers had been released at this point in time, and thus a few cases of mistaken identity occurred. In one instance, a man with the name of Said al-Ghamdi had given an interview to Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper in Tunis, outraged that he had been portrayed by CNN as one of the hijackers. CNN had broadcast his photograph after doing research on their own and finding a Saudi [...] "Said al-Ghamdi" [...] who had received flight training in the United States. CNN had found the wrong suspect, which only became clear once the FBI officially released the photographs of the suspected hijackers.|$|E

2500|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 2 February 1727. The extant autograph score and the parts {{show that he}} performed it at least three more times, in a version for soprano, BWV 82a, the first possibly in 1731 or even as early as 1730, another version for soprano in 1735; and again for bass, with {{minor changes to the}} original version, after 1745. Bach <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> a high regard for this work. The first recitative and most of the aria [...] were copied to the Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach in a version with continuo accompaniment, presumably entered by Anna Magdalena Bach for her own use.

2500|$|According to {{historian}} George C. Browder, [...] "SD men represented no pathological or psychically susceptible group. Few were wild or extreme Nazi fanatics. In those respects {{they were}} 'ordinary men'. Yet {{in most other}} respects, they were an extraordinary mix of men, drawn together by a unique mix of missions." [...] Along {{with members of the}} Gestapo, SD personnel were [...] "regarded with a mixture of fear and foreboding," [...] and people wanted as little to do with them as possible. Belonging to the security apparatus of the Third Reich <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> its advantages but it was also fraught with occupationally related social disadvantages as well, and if post-war descriptions of the SD by historians are any indication, membership therein implied being a part of a [...] "ubiquitous secret society" [...] which was [...] "sinister" [...] and a [...] "messenger of terror" [...] not just for the German population, but within the [...] "ranks of the Nazi Party itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lennon's {{inspiration}} for the song came when his son, Julian, showed him a nursery school drawing he called [...] "Lucy—in the Sky with Diamonds", depicting his classmate Lucy O'Donnell (later Lucy Vodden). Julian Lennon said, [...] "I don't know why I called it that or why it stood out from all my other drawings, but I <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> an affection for Lucy at that age. I used to show Dad everything I'd built or painted at school, and this one sparked off the idea..." [...] Vodden, in a BBC radio interview in 2007, said, [...] "I remember Julian and I both doing pictures on a double-sided easel, throwing paint at each other, much to {{the horror of the}} classroom attendant... Julian had painted a picture and on that particular day his father turned up with the chauffeur to pick him up from school." [...] O'Donnell died in 2009 at age 46 after suffering from lupus.|$|E
2500|$|However, an {{alternative}} version of Tuoba Gui's early life {{was presented in}} documents such as the Book of Jin and Book of Song -- the official histories of the rival Jin Dynasty (265-420) and Liu Song Dynasty, which <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> a motive to be biased, and yet presented interesting issues. [...] Under this version, Tuoba Gui was not Tuoba Shiyijian's grandson, but his son—and was born significantly earlier than the official 371 date, of Tuoba Shiyijian's wife Princess Murong. [...] When Former Qin attacked in 377, it was Tuoba Gui who restrained his father Tuoba Shiyijian and surrendered. [...] Fu Jiān, offended at this act of betrayal, exiled Tuoba Gui. [...] When Murong Chui, his uncle, declared Later Yan in 384, Tuoba Gui joined him, and was later {{put in charge of}} his father's tribes through a military campaign waged by Later Yan. [...] Then, later, in order to avoid having the people know Tuoba Gui's status as a traitor to his father, the official version of his personal history was manufactured.|$|E

2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Gamasutra, Twisted Pixel CEO Michael Wilford {{revealed}} that though the developers had plans for downloadable content from the beginning, decisions {{on what would}} be included in that content were not made until after the game was released. [...] " [...] didn't work on {{them in any way}} until after the main game was wrapped," [...] stated Wilford. [...] "Once the game was out of our hands, {{we went back to the}} drawing board to design everything from scratch, but we <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> a lot of half-finished pieces on the cutting room floor that we could leverage." [...] Wilford further explained that due to the way The Maw ends extending past the ending would not be possible. [...] Therefore, plans were made for the downloadable content to be dubbed [...] "Deleted Scenes"; levels that take place inside the story of the main game. Wilford was quick to note that these levels were not simply unlock codes that provided the player with access to things already in the game. [...] "I think some people took it to mean that we intentionally stripped out levels that were 100 percent complete only to sell them as DLC," [...] he said, adding that it was [...] "not the case." ...|$|E

[...] Dolenz was gratified by the public affection expressed for both Jones and the Monkees {{in the wake of his}} bandmate's death. [...] "He was a very well-known and well-loved character and person. There are a lot of people who are grieving pretty hard. The Monkees <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> a following, and so did (Jones) on his own. So I'm not surprised, but I was flattered and honored to be considered one of his friends and a cohort in Monkee business." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{since its}} release, has been {{positively}} received by film critics. Toni Kan of ThisDay praised its cinematography, story and casting, concluding that: [...] "October 1 provokes {{a lot of}} questions and provides few answers but what is unequivocal is {{that at the end of}} the movie when the picture of the Queen is taken down, Kunle Afolayan, son of Ade Love, is crowned King". Onyeka Nwelue of The Trent, praised the artistic nature of the film, its subtle messages, and concluded: [...] "Mr. Afolayan incorporates facts into fiction to create an everlasting joy in this work. He is not one who is scared of exploring, and he does so beautifully. He takes his time to create. He takes his time to understand the people he is making films for. No matter how intellectually stimulating October 1 is, it can be enjoyed by anybody. At the end, one can easily say, Mr. Afolayan’s October 1 is for everyone who loves great films". Sodas and Popcorn, praised its production design, the performances from the actors, use of costumes, and also described the cinematography as [...] "the best work of art in Nigerian cinematic history". It commended the film for its attention to detail and concluded: [...] "Afolayan <b>obviously</b> <b>had</b> clear vision of what he set out to achieve and pushed his cast to give the best possible performance you could expect from them. The glory of the film, however, is in the fact that the story is not afraid to go there: explore the timeless themes of religion, ethnic rifts, corruption, abuse, pain and privilege. The film plays for 2 hours but there is enough suspense and laugh-till-your-sides-hurt humour to keep you at the edge of your seat".|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he <b>obviously</b> <b>had.</b> I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
