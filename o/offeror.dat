25|$|In the United States, an {{exception}} is the merchant firm offer rule set out in Uniform Commercial Code - § 2-205, which states that an offer is firm and irrevocable if it is an offer {{to buy or sell}} goods made by a merchant and it is in writing and signed by the <b>offeror.</b> Such an offer is irrevocable {{even in the absence of}} consideration. If no time is stated, it is irrevocable for a reasonable time, but in no event may a period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the <b>offeror.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 26 January 2012, the Navy's Naval Sea Systems Command {{posted a}} notice of {{solicitation}} for the towing and complete dismantlement of multiple CV-59/CV-63 Class aircraft carriers in the United States, to include ex-Forrestal (CV 59), ex-, ex-, and ex-. These solicitations were posted in May 2012 and subsequently awarded to three successful offerors, pending their receipt {{of the facility}} security clearance required {{as part of the}} contract award. After the initial award of one carrier to each successful <b>offeror,</b> this contract provides the Navy with the capability to scrap other decommissioned conventionally-powered aircraft carriers over a five-year period.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{an offer}} is made, {{the general rule}} is the offeree must {{communicate}} her acceptance {{in order to have}} a binding agreement. Notification of acceptance must actually reach a point where the <b>offeror</b> could reasonably be expected to know, although if the recipient is at fault, for instance, by not putting enough ink in their fax machine for a message arriving in office hours to be printed, the recipient will still be bound. This goes for all methods of communication, whether oral, by phone, through telex, fax or email, except for the post. Acceptance by letter takes place when the letter is put in the postbox. The postal exception is a product of history, and does not exist in most countries. It only exists in English law so long as it is reasonable to use the post for a reply (e.g. not in response to an email), and its operation would not create manifest inconvenience and absurdity (e.g. the letter goes missing). In all cases it is possible for the negotiating parties to stipulate a prescribed mode of acceptance. It is not possible for an <b>offeror</b> to impose an obligation on the offeree to reject the offer without her consent. However, it is clear that people can accept through silence, firstly, by demonstrating through their conduct that they accept. In Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Company, although the Metropolitan Railway Company had never returned a letter from Mr Brogden formalising a long term supply arrangement for Mr Brogden's coal, they had conducted themselves for two years as if it were in effect, and Mr Brogden was bound. Secondly, the <b>offeror</b> may waive the need for communication of acceptance, either expressly, or implicitly, as in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. Here a quack medicine company advertised its [...] "smoke ball", stating that if a customer found it did not cure them of the flu after using it thrice daily for two weeks, they would get £100. After noting the advertisement was serious enough to be an offer, not mere puff or an invitation to treat, the Court of Appeal held the accepting party only needed to use the smokeball as prescribed to get the £100. Although the general rule was to require communication of acceptance, the advertisement had tacitly waived the need for Mrs Carlill, or anyone else, to report her acceptance first. In other cases, such as where a reward is advertised for information, the only requirement of the English courts appears to be knowledge of the offer. Where someone makes such a unilateral offer, they fall under a duty to not revoke it once someone has begun to act on the offer. Otherwise an offer may always be revoked before it is accepted. The general rule is that revocation must be communicated, even if by post, although if the offerree hears about the withdrawal from a third party, this is as good as a withdrawal from the <b>offeror</b> himself. Finally, an offer can be [...] "killed off" [...] if, rather than a mere inquiry for information, someone makes a counter offer. So in Hyde v Wrench, when Wrench offered to sell his farm for £1000, and Hyde replied that he would buy it for £950 and Wrench refused, Hyde could not then change his mind and accept the original £1000 offer.|$|E

2500|$|The British Museum has 51 thin gold plaques with incised designs, {{which are}} {{regarded}} as votive plaques left by devotees at a temple as an offering to the deity. They are mostly rectangular with the designs in a vertical format, and range from 2 to 20cm tall. Most show a single human figure facing left, many carrying a bunch of twigs called a barsom used in offerings; these probably represent the <b>offeror.</b> [...] The dress of the figures shows the types known as [...] "Median" [...] and [...] "Persian" [...] to modern historians, {{and the quality of}} the execution is mostly relatively low, but varies greatly, with some appearing to have been incised by amateurs. [...] Three show animals, a horse, a donkey and a camel; possibly it was their health that was the subject of the offering. [...] One large figure is in shallow relief within its incised outline (illustrated).|$|E
2500|$|Less common are {{unilateral}} {{contracts in}} which one party makes a promise, but the other side does not promise anything. In these cases, those accepting the offer {{are not required to}} communicate their acceptance to the <b>offeror.</b> In a reward contract, for example, a person who has lost a dog could promise a reward if the dog is found, through publication or orally. The payment could be additionally conditioned on the dog being returned alive. Those who learn of the reward are not required to search for the dog, but if someone finds the dog and delivers it, the promisor is required to pay. In the similar case of advertisements of deals or bargains, a general rule is that these are not contractual offers but merely an [...] "invitation to treat" [...] (or bargain), but the applicability of this rule is disputed and contains various exceptions. The High Court of Australia stated that the term unilateral contract is [...] "unscientific and misleading".|$|E
50|$|One {{rationale}} {{given for}} the rule is that the <b>offeror</b> nominates the post office as his or her implied agent, and thus receipt of the acceptance by the post office is regarded as receipt by the <b>offeror.</b> The main effect of the posting rule is {{that the risk of}} acceptance being delivered late or lost in the post is placed upon the <b>offeror.</b> If the <b>offeror</b> is reluctant to accept this risk, he can always expressly require actual receipt as a condition before being legally bound by his offer.|$|E

50|$|An {{acceptance}} of the offer resulting in a binding contract must take place {{with knowledge of the}} offer and an intention to accept the offer.

Rather, if after a reasonable period has lapsed, silence will be seen as a rejection to the offer, unless the offeree's actions objectively show otherwise. Where a purported acceptance proposes one or more additional or different terms it is ineffective as an acceptance, unless the variation is solely in favour of the <b>offeror.</b> A purported acceptance will also be ineffective if made {{at a time when the}} offer has lapsed by virtue of time; if it is made subject to a contingency and that contingency ceases to exist; if the <b>offeror</b> dies and the offeree has notice of this fact; by the revocation of the <b>offeror</b> or the rejection by the offeree.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedEarly in the procurement planning process, the acquisition team determines {{the method of}} proposal evaluations {{that will be used}} during source selections. The most frequently used methods are lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) and tradeoff. LPTA is typically used when requirements are well-defined and participants in the evaluation have sufficient knowledge to confidently choose a technically acceptable proposal. Conversely, tradeoff-based evaluations are employed when the evaluators are not as certain about the requirements and utilize non-cost factors to negotiate with <b>offerors.</b> For requiring offices, LPTA can be an easier method if the requirements are well-defined and commercially available, but they may find performance and deliverables after award to be acceptable rather than outstanding. Those using a tradeoff method may find that, by clearly defining expectations during negotiations, <b>offerors</b> are better able to deliver on the expectations of the acquisition team and the customer.
