5000|$|The total {{production}} from ANWR would be between 0.4 and 1.2 {{percent of total}} world oil consumption in 2030. Consequently, ANWR oil production is not projected to have any significant impact on world oil prices. Furthermore, the Energy Information Administration does not feel ANWR will affect the global price of oil when past behaviors of the oil market are considered. [...] "The opening of ANWR is projected to have its largest oil price reduction impacts as follows: a reduction in low-sulfur, light crude oil prices of $0.41 per barrel (2006 dollars) in 2026 for the low <b>oil</b> <b>resource</b> case, $0.75 per barrel in 2025 for the mean <b>oil</b> <b>resource</b> case, and $1.44 per barrel in 2027 for the high <b>oil</b> <b>resource</b> case, relative to the reference case."

40|$|This Paper {{assessed}} the "Impact of <b>Oil</b> and Gas <b>Resource</b> Exploration on the Environment" of Delta State oil producing communities of Nigeria. It examined {{the problems associated}} with Oil exploration and its mitigation. Primary and Secondary data were used to source data for the set objectives. The theoretical framework was based on the resource curse theory and the environmental externalities theory. It was established that various problems such as oil spillage, retardation of vegetation growth, soil infertility, ill-health to members of the community, displacement {{of the people of the}} area, constant protestation of host communities, socio-economic deprivation, and perceived marginalization of the people are associated with <b>oil</b> <b>resource</b> exploration. This research concludes that the oil bearing communities have not adequately been compensated for harm done them through degradation of the ecosystem caused by several years of oil exploration. Their <b>oil</b> <b>resource</b> wealth has been turned to <b>oil</b> <b>resource</b> curse as they are disempowered, and condemned to perpetual underdevelopment.

25|$|Oil became {{increasingly}} {{important to the}} United States, and, from the early 1940s, the U.S. government and oil industry entered into a mutually beneficial collaboration to control global <b>oil</b> <b>resources.</b> By 1950, oil consumption exceeded that of coal. The abundance of oil in California, Texas, Oklahoma, {{as well as in}} Canada and Mexico, coupled with its low cost, ease of transportation, high energy density, and use in internal combustion engines, lead to its increasing use.|$|E

25|$|Oil {{reserves}} {{denote the}} amount of crude oil that can be technically recovered at a cost that is financially feasible at the present price of oil. Hence reserves will change with the price, unlike <b>oil</b> <b>resources,</b> which include all oil that can be technically recovered at any price. Reserves may be for a well, for a reservoir, for a field, for a nation, or for the world. Different classifications of reserves are related to their degree of certainty.|$|E
40|$|While {{it remains}} largely undisputed that the {{abundance}} of the <b>oil</b> <b>resource</b> will influence economic growth, the perceived ambiguity {{of the nature of}} this impact has constituted, in recent times, a source of debate amongst economic theorists. In an attempt to facilitate clarity this investigation therefore sought to explore the economic trends in countries characterised by an over-dependence on oil exports via a cocktail of interpretive, discourse and synthesis analysis while simultaneously utilising graphical tools for comparing these established trends with economic behaviour of countries characterised by a reduced dependence on the oil rents. This analysis proceeded by exploring the theoretical framework for the determinants of economic growth as obtained from literature while establishing correlations that illustrated the relationships between the revenue flow from oil and these economic growth determinants. This investigation was subsequently able to demonstrate a relationship between oil rent dependence and stunted economic growth while establishing that the impact of the <b>oil</b> <b>resource</b> existed within a spectrum of possible outcomes with the actual outcome dependent on the prevailing peculiarities of the existing institutions. Indeed, the implied perverse effect of weak institutions on the eventual outcome of the <b>oil</b> <b>resource</b> impact was firmly established and subsequently associated with the resource curse, which remains a conspicuous theme in modern economic literature...|$|R
