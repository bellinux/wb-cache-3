[...] The system's main components are a sample vial, source and destination vials, a capillary, electrodes, [...] a high voltage power supply, a detector, and a data output and handling device. The source vial, destination vial and capillary are filled with an electrolyte such as an aqueous buffer solution. [...] To introduce the sample, the capillary inlet is placed into a vial containing the sample. [...] Sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action, pressure, siphoning, or electrokinetically, and the capillary is then returned to the source vial. [...] The migration of the analytes is initiated by an electric field that is applied between the source and destination vials and is supplied to the electrodes by the high-voltage power supply. [...] In the most common mode of CE, all ions, positive or negative, are pulled through the capillary in the same direction by electroosmotic flow. [...] The analytes separate as they migrate due to their electrophoretic mobility, and are detected near the <b>outlet</b> <b>end</b> of the capillary. The output of the detector is sent to a data output and handling device such as an integrator or computer. The data is then displayed as an electropherogram, which reports detector response as a function of time. Separated chemical compounds appear as peaks with different retention times in an electropherogram. [...] Capillary electrophoresis was first combined with mass spectrometry by Richard D. Smith and coworkers, and provides extremely high sensitivity for the analysis of very small sample sizes. [...] Despite the very small sample sizes (typically only a few nanoliters of liquid are introduced into the capillary), high sensitivity and sharp peaks are achieved in part due to injection strategies that result in concentration of analytes into a narrow zone near the inlet of the capillary. [...] This is achieved in either pressure or electrokinetic injections simply by suspending the sample in a buffer of lower conductivity (e.g. lower salt concentration) than the running buffer. [...] A process called field-amplified sample stacking (a form of isotachophoresis) results in concentration of analyte in a narrow zone at the boundary between the low-conductivity sample and the higher-conductivity running buffer.|$|E
5000|$|Back {{siphonage}} is a plumbing term {{applied to}} the reversal of normal water flow in a plumbing system due to sharply reduced or negative pressure on the water supply side, such as high demand on water supply by fire-fighting; {{it is not an}} actual siphon as it is suction.

50|$|The ballmill allows {{grinding}} of {{the harder}} limestones {{that are more}} common than chalk. A ballmill consists of a horizontal cylinder that rotates on its axis. It holds spherical, cylindrical or rod-like grinding media of size 15-100 mm that may be steel or a variety of ceramic materials, and occupy 20-30% of the mill volume. The shell of the mill is lined with steel or rubber plates. Grinding is effected by impact and attrition between the grinding media. The various mineral components of the rawmix are fed to the mill at a constant rate along with water, and the slurry runs from the <b>outlet</b> <b>end.</b> The washdrum has a similar concept, but contains little or no grinding media, grinding being autogenous, by the cascading action of the larger raw material pieces. It is suitable for soft materials, and particularly for flinty chalk, where the unground flint acts as grinding media.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze {{competition}} between two ideological media outlets that want to influence their viewers so as to boot the number of votes for their preferred political party. We consider two ways of influencing viewers, which correspond to two prominent theories borrowed from the literature on Sociology: the “Reinforcement Approach” and the “Attitudinal Orientations Approach”. Our findings show that the aim of influencing viewers generally pushes media outlets to differentiate their opinions, and that the extend of this differentiation deeply depends on the viewers’ behavior. More precisely, we observe that if the viewers channel hop, media <b>outlets</b> <b>end</b> up differentiating their opinions more than if the viewers receive all their information from just one media.

50|$|The initial pipe {{was made}} of wrought iron, a total length of over 7 mi, with an {{interior}} diameter of 12 in and a capacity of 92,000 gallons per hour. The pipe traversed the Washoe Valley {{in the form of}} an inverted siphon, and at the lowest point having a pressure of 1720 ft of water, or 800 pounds per square inch. The inlet being 465 ft above the outlet, the water is forced through the pipe at tremendous pressure. Water was brought to the inlet in the Sierra Nevada range from sources of supply in two large covered flumes, and at the <b>outlet</b> <b>end</b> of the pipe was delivered in two large flumes a distance of 12 mi to Virginia City. The pipe was constructed of sheets of wrought iron riveted together, each section fastened with three rows of rivets. Lead was used to secure the joints between each pipe section. The first flow of water reached Gold Hill and Virginia City on August 1, 1873 with great fanfare. This accomplishment was the greatest pressurized water system in operation in the world, having superseded the water system at Cherokee Flat also designed by Schussler.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the sealed}} {{nature of the}} bag all this waste begins to {{decompose}} anaerobically releasing methane gas, water and sludge waste whilst also killing harmful pathogens such as E-Coli. The methane gas is released and captured using the valve {{at the top of}} the <b>outlet</b> <b>end</b> of the bag, this gas can be used for cooking, lighting and heating (although CART currently intend to use the gas solely for cooking.) The water is released through the outlet pipe, this water is known as ‘High nutrient’ or ‘Black’ water. Less than 10% of the products are solids and therefore only need removing from the bag every few years, these solids can be used as a high nutrient fertiliser for fruit trees or for plants where the fertiliser does not come into direct contact with the crop. The black water is mixed with grey waters, such as shower or washing water (N.B CART only uses organic, bio-degradable washing products to ensure no toxins are introduced to the cycle.) This water is filtered through sand and charcoal and used to irrigate the food gardens. Excess water, together with runoff from the gardens is collected in the Dam, from which it can be used to water gardens in the dry season or filtered further making it safe for drinking (see water cycle).|$|E

50|$|The lake, {{situated}} to {{the north}} of Jaipur city lies between Amer, the historic city and Jaipur, the provincial headquarters of Rajasthan state. It has a water spread area of 300 acre and is enclosed by the Aravalli hills on the north, west and eastern sides, while the southern side consists of plains that are intensely inhabited. There is the Nahargarh Fort (Nahargarh meaning home of tigers) in the hills that provides a commanding view of the Man Sagar Lake and the Jal Mahal palace, in addition to a beautiful view of the city of Jaipur. The lake was created by constructing a dam across the Darbhawati River, between Khilagarh hills and the hilly areas of Nahargarh, in the 16th century. The drainage area of the lake is 23.5 km2contributed by an urban area accounting for 50% and hilly terrain accounting for the balance, being degraded Aravalli hills, which have added to the siltation problem in the lake. A rain fall average of 657.4 mm per year (90% of this rainfall occurs during the months of June to September) in the catchment contributes to the storage in the reservoir. At the <b>outlet</b> <b>end</b> of the dam there is an irrigation system that is supplied with water stored in the reservoir (obligatory water demand for this is reported to be 2,410,000 cubic metres during the five months from November to March). Two large nalas (streams) that also drain the surrounding Nahargarh hills and Jaipur are the Brahmpuri and Nagtalai, which bring in large amounts of untreated sewage, in addition to solid wastes. The hills surrounding the lake area, towards the north east of Jaipur, have quartzite rock formations (with a thin layer of soil cover), which is part of Aravalli hills range. Rock exposures on the surface {{in some parts of the}} project area have also been utilised for constructing buildings. From the north east, the Kanak Vrindavan valley, where a temple complex is situated, the hills slope gently towards the lake edge. Within the lake area, the ground area is made up of a thick mantle of soil, blown sand and alluvium. Forest denudation, particularly in the hilly areas, has caused soil erosion, compounded by wind and water action. Due to this, silt built up in the lake resulting in a raising of the bed level of the lake.|$|E

Slurry-packing techniques were applied to a series of interconnected short columns, with the columns situated intermediate between the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>ends</b> of the series being used for separations. The fast separation and determination of inorganic anions was achieved using short (4 mm ID, 30 mm long) columns packed with Dionex AS 20 high-capacity anion-exchange stationary phase. Seven inorganic anions (bromate, chloride, chlorate, nitrate, sulfate, chromate and perchlorate) are separated in 2. 6 min using a hydroxide gradient and a flow-rate of 1. 8 mL/min (total analysis time including re-equilibration was 3. 5 min). Under isocratic conditions, the home-packed columns exhibited efficiency values of 43, 000 N/m for chloride at a flow-rate of 0. 3 mL/min, compared to 54, 000 N/m for a commercial 250 mm AS 20 column at the same flow-rate. However, the short columns gave approximately a threefold higher sample throughput. The short, home-packed columns could be produced reproducibly and gave consistent performance over extended periods of usage...|$|R

40|$|On-line leak {{detection}} is a main {{concern for the}} safe operation of pipelines. Acoustic and mass balance {{are the most important}} and extensively applied technologies in field problems. The objective of this work is to compare these {{leak detection}} methods with respect to a given reference situation, i. e., the same pipeline and monitoring signals acquired at the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>ends.</b> Experimental tests were conducted in a 749 m long laboratory pipeline transporting water as the working fluid. The instrumentation included pressure transducers and electromagnetic flowmeters. Leaks were simulated by opening solenoid valves placed at known positions and previously calibrated to produce known average leak flow rates. Results have clearly shown the limitations and advantages of each method. It is also quite clear that acoustics and mass balance technologies are, in fact, complementary. In general, an acoustic leak detection system sends out an alarm more rapidly and locates the leak more precisely, provided that the rupture of the pipeline occurs abruptly enough. On the other hand, a mass balance leak detection method is capable of quantifying the leak flow rate very accurately and of detecting progressive leaks.
