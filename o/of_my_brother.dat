I will not say <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>brother</b> {{that he may be}} a traitor," [...] but I will say, [...] "Produce what you have. I will judge it fairly, and if he is, he shall pay the penalties; but I will not take it on rumor. I will not take it on hearsay. I will remember that what has brought us up from savagery is a loyalty to truth, and truth cannot emerge unless it is subjected to the utmost scrutiny"—will you not agree that a society which has lost sight of that, cannot survive? ...|$|E

[...] 52 Takes of the Same Thing, Then Boobs was featured in AFI FEST 2010, where Lane Kneedler associate director of programming called it [...] "the most outrageously 'out there' film that we have scheduled".

Cottam said he had a great experience working with the actors on the film Carbuncle, and stated he let improvisation be the tool by which the actors could show emotions and create their characters. In September 2010, 52 Takes of the Same Thing, Then Boobs was shown at the Black Rock City Film Festival located at the Burning Man site in the Nevada desert.|$|E
