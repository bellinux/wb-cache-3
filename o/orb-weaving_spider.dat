2500|$|The risk of {{cannibalism}} becomes {{greatly reduced}} when opportunistic mating is practiced. [...] Opportunistic mating {{has been characterized}} in numerous <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spider</b> species, such as Nephila fenestrata, where the male spider waits until the female is feeding or distracted, and then proceeds with copulation; this greatly reduces the chances of cannibalization. This distraction can be facilitated by the male's presentation of nuptial gifts, where they provide a distracting meal for the female in order to prolong copulation and increase paternity.|$|E
2500|$|Some males, {{as in the}} <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spider,</b> Argiope arantia, [...] {{have been}} found to spontaneously die within fifteen minutes of their second {{copulation}} with a female. The male dies while his pedipalps are still intact within the female, as well as still swollen from copulation. In this [...] "programmed death", the male is able to utilize his entire body as a genital plug for the female, causing it to be much more difficult for her to remove him from her copulatory ducts.|$|E

2500|$|Sexual {{cannibalism}} has impaired {{the ability}} of the <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spider,</b> N. fenestrata, to perform mate guarding. If a male successfully mates with a female, he then exhibits mate guarding, inhibiting the female from re-mating, thus ensuring his paternity and eliminating sperm competition. Guarding can refer to the blockage of female genital openings to prevent further insertion of a competing male pedipalps, or physical guarding from potential mates. Guarding can decrease female re-mating by fifty percent. [...] Males who experience genital mutilation can sometimes exhibit the [...] "gloves off" [...] hypothesis which states that a male's body weight and his endurance are inversely proportional. Thus when a male's body weight decreases substantially, his endurance increases as a result, allowing him to guard his female mate with increased efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|The {{physiological}} {{impacts of}} cannibalism on male fitness include {{his inability to}} father any offspring if {{he is unable to}} mate with a female. [...] There are males in species of arachnids, such as N. plumipes, that sire more offspring if the male is cannibalized after or during mating; copulation is prolonged and sperm transfer is increased. In the species of <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spider,</b> Argiope arantia, males prefer short copulation duration upon the first palp insertion in order to avoid cannibalism. Upon the second insertion, however, the male remains inserted in the female. The male exhibits a [...] "programmed death" [...] to function as a full-body genital plug. This causes it to become increasingly difficult for the female to remove him from her genital openings, discouraging her from mating with other males. An additional benefit to cannibalization is the idea that a well-fed female is less likely to mate again. If the female has no desire to mate again, the male who has already mated with her has his paternity ensured.|$|E
2500|$|Mate binding {{refers to}} a pre-copulatory {{courtship}} behavior where the male deposits silk onto the abdomen of the female while simultaneously massaging her {{in order to reduce}} her aggressive behavior. This action allows for initial and subsequent copulatory bouts. While both chemical and tactile cues are important factors for reducing cannibalistic behaviors, the latter functions as a resource to calm the female, exhibited [...] in the orb-weaver spider species, Nephila pilipes. Additional hypotheses suggest that male silk contains pheromones which seduce the female into submission. However, silk deposits are not necessary for successful copulation. The primary factor in successful subsequent copulation lies in the tactile communication between the male and female spider that results in female acceptance of the male. [...] The male mounts the posterior portion of the female's abdomen, while rubbing his spinnerets on her abdomen during his attempt at copulation. [...] Mate binding was not necessary for the initiation of copulation in the golden <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spider,</b> except when the female was resistant to mating. Subsequent copulatory bouts are imperative for the male's ability to copulate due to prolonged sperm transfer, therefore increasing his probability of paternity.|$|E

50|$|Conspicuous spider web: There are <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spiders</b> that spin webs with zigzag {{patterns}} that are clear, and visible to their prey.

40|$|Recent studies {{demonstrated}} that <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spiders</b> may alter web architectures, {{the amount of}} silk in webs, or the protein composition of silks in response to variation in amount or type of prey. In this study, we conducted food manipulations to examine three mechanisms by which <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spiders</b> may adjust the performance of webs to variation in prey by altering the architectures of webs, making structural changes to the diameters of silk threads, and manipulating the material properties or amino acid composition of silk fibers. We fed Nephila pilipes {{two different types of}} prey, crickets or flies, and then compared orb structure and the chemical and physical properties of major ampullate (MA) silk between groups. Prey type did not affect orb structures in N. pilipes, except for mesh size. However, MA silk diameter and the stiffness of orbs constructed by spiders fed crickets were significantly greater than for the fly group. MA fibers forcibly silked from N. pilipes fed crickets was significantly thicker, but less stiff, than silk from spiders fed flies. Spiders in the cricket treatment also produced MA silk with slightly, but statistically significantly, more serine than silk from spiders in the fly treatment. Percentages of other major amino acids (proline, glycine, and glutamine) did not differ between treatments. This study {{demonstrated that}} <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spiders</b> can simultaneously alter some structural and material properties of MA silk, as well as the physical characteristics of webs, in response to different types of prey...|$|R

50|$|These <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spiders</b> usually build {{a spiral}} {{vertical}} web {{close to the}} ground between herbaceous plants or on bushes at about 0.5-1.5 meters above ground level. They remain motionless for a long time with head down, waiting for prey. They inject venom in their victims with chelicerae. This venom paralyzes the preys and causes the external digestion with the incorporated gastric juices.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{diversification of}} spiders {{is attributed to}} spectacular innovations in silk. Spiders are unique in synthesizing {{many different kinds of}} silk, and using silk for a variety of ecological functions throughout their lives, particularly to make prey-catching webs. Here, we construct a broad higher-level phylogeny of spiders combining molecular data with traditional morphological and behavioral characters. We use this phylogeny to test the hypothesis that the spider orb web evolved only once. We then examine spider diversification in relation to different web architectures and silk use. We find strong support for a single origin of orb webs, implying a major shift in the spinning of capture silk and repeated loss or transformation of orb webs. We show that abandonment of costly cribellate capture silk correlates with the 2 major diversification events in spiders (1). Replacement of cribellate silk by aqueous silk glue may explain the greater diversity of modern <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spiders</b> (Araneoidea) compared with cribellate <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spiders</b> (Deinopoidea) (2). Within the “RTA clade,” which is the sister group to <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spiders</b> and contains half of all spider diversity, > 90 % of species richness is associated with repeated loss of cribellate silk and abandonment of prey capture webs. Accompanying cribellum loss in both groups is a release from substrate-constrained webs, whether by aerially suspended webs, or by abandoning webs altogether. These behavioral shifts in silk and web production by spiders thus likely {{played a key role in}} the dramatic evolutionary success and ecological dominance of spiders as predators of insects...|$|R
5000|$|Generally, <b>orb-weaving</b> <b>spiders</b> are three-clawed {{builders}} of flat webs with sticky spiral capture silk. The {{building of a}} web is an engineering feat, begun when the spider floats a line on the wind to another surface. The spider secures the line and then drops another line from the center, making a [...] "Y". The rest of the scaffolding follows with many radii of nonsticky silk being constructed before a final spiral of sticky capture silk.|$|R
