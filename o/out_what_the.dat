5|$|The {{historian}} David C. Large wrote that, {{like any}} public pronouncements, these bylaws {{did not tell}} the full story about HIAG's real goals. By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice, he was able to tease <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> organisation stood for. For example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, surviving and fallen, as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held it until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones {{and not have to}} deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

25|$|In {{the initial}} questioning, {{it comes to}} light that the {{previous}} owner of the house, Sellon, {{was found dead in}} his shop, supposedly from a fall down the stairs, but it might have been more nefarious than that.

25|$|In {{almost all}} areas of the law (even those where there is a {{statutory}} framework, such as contracts for the sale of goods, or the criminal law), legislature-enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle, and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the interstitial common law. To find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts, one has to locate precedential decisions on the topic, and reason from those decisions by analogy.|$|E
25|$|Until we find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{relevant}} psychological predictors are {{for which}} racial classification per se {{is merely a}} 'stand-in' variable, {{we have no choice}} but to include race (or other group membership) as a predictive variable along with the test scores or other predictive measures. On the other hand, if the overprediction of the minority group's criterion performance is not too extreme, it may seem reasonable to many to leave it uncorrected, thereby giving the benefit of the slight predictive bias to the presumably disadvantaged group.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the central}} tenets in Easterly’s {{approach}} is a more bottom up philosophy of aid. This applies {{not only to the}} identification of problems, but to the actual distribution of capital to the areas in need. In effect, Easterly would have countries go to the area which needed aid, collect information about the problem, find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> population wanted, and then work from there. In keeping with this, funds would also be distributed from the bottom up, rather than being given to a specific government.|$|E

25|$|Villagers are {{sensitive}} to the power and {{to the needs of the}} spirit world. According to observations by an American missionary in the early 1970s, villagers consulted the local guardian spirit to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> coming year would bring, a new province chief held a ceremony to ask the protection of the spirits over the province, and soldiers obtained magic cloths and amulets from mediums and shamans to protect them from the bullets of the enemy. Before embarking on a mission against enemy forces, a province chief might burn incense and call on a spirit for aid in defeating the enemy. Examples of Brahman influences were various rituals concerned with the well-being of the nation carried out by the ruler and the baku (a Brahman priestly group attached to the royal court). These rituals were reportedly stopped after Sihanouk's ouster in 1970 (see The March 1970 Coup d'État, ch. 1).|$|E

They also heard from Jacques Allier of the French Deuxieme Bureau, who {{had been involved in}} the removal of the entire stock of heavy water from Norway. He told them of the interest the Germans had shown in the heavy water, and in the activity of the French researchers in Paris. Immediate action was taken: the Ministry of Economic Warfare was asked to secure stocks of uranium oxide in danger of being captured by the Germans; British intelligence agencies were asked to investigate the activities of German nuclear scientists; and A. V. Hill, the British Scientific Attaché in Washington, was asked to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Americans were up to. Hill reported that the Americans had scientists investigating the matter, but they did not think that any military applications were in prospect.|$|E
25|$|Aguirre {{is helping}} Senator Grassley's staff examine 21,000 Federal Reserve (the Fed) {{transactions}} involving taxpayer funds distributed to {{banks and other}} financial institutions. The Fed was forced to reveal the information by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by Bloomberg News and Fox News, as well as provisions contained in Wall Street reform legislation. Despite pronouncements by the Fed about its transparency, the information released has been incomplete. The lack of details {{make it impossible to}} tell just how much profit the recipients of the funds are making and only the recipients' names and amount of funds are known. Aguirre says that between $3 and $4 trillion in cash transfers were made and another $9 to $11 trillion in commitments that taxpayer funds would cover the cost of failed investments. “It looks like they are borrowing the money from the Fed, say, at 70 cents on the dollar and selling it back to the Fed for 90 cents. We can’t tell for certain because the Fed won’t tell us. The Fed publishes information but not enough for you to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hell happened,” Aguirre said.|$|E

In the story mode, her ship is found by Black Adam on Earth and initially join the other Regime remnants to help her cousin Superman escape {{in order to get}} help in stopping Brainiac's invasion. Until after Batman initially released Superman and his other imprisoned Regime members during Brainiac's invasion, she found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Regime had been doing for 5 years and was appalled by her cousin's actions. As of the final chapters against Brainiac when Superman and Batman's conflict about to start again over Brainiac to save entire planets and cities Brainiac took, she sided with Batman to save her cousin from his tyrannical self. In Batman's ending after he wins , she is offered a place in the Justice League for her efforts in stopping the invasion, In Superman's ending if he wins she is locked up by her cousin and is forcefully requested to join the Regime to which she refuses and Superman then shows a mind-controlled Batman under his service, horrifying her. In her single player ending, she spots Krypton among Brainiac's collection of stolen worlds, and hoped to find a safe way of freeing her home. As she grows closer to reversing Brainiac's collection, she hopes to find the right star system and save Argo City and Kandor, though she regrets failing to save Superman.|$|E
