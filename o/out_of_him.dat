5|$|A running joke {{throughout}} the film series is Moneypenny's unrequited love for Bond and his playful flirting with her. She flirts back, jokes and sometimes pouts, hoping to wrangle a proposal and {{a wedding ring}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> A fantasy sequence in Die Another Day marks the only occasion in the Eon film series in which Moneypenny was actually shown in a romantic embrace with Bond, although this is only in Q-branch's virtual reality machine.|$|E
5|$|Ala can “sneak” into humans, {{gaining a}} human form while {{retaining}} their own properties. A tradition {{has it that}} an ala sneaked into St. Simeon, which made him voracious, but St. Sava took her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> In a tale recorded in eastern Serbia and Bulgaria, a farmer killed an ala who possessed a skinny man living in a distant village, because the ala destroyed his vineyard. In another story, an ala gets into a deceased princess and devours the soldiers on watch.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives late to {{the crime}} scene and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) tells her that the man's blood all drained {{abruptly}} in the hotel. A child’s bloody print is found, but Scully doesn’t believe that a child did this. Meanwhile, the beggar, somehow disguised as an ordinary-looking Caucasian man, applies for a janitorial job at a Cheverly, Maryland elementary school. In the morgue, Scully describes the massive stomach damage done to the body which leads Doggett to the idea of drugs being forcibly cut <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> However, the man showed no sign of drugs in the blood tests and Scully tells Doggett that his time of death was 24 to 36 hours prior, long before he left India. Due to a discrepancy in weight, she begins to believe that there was a passenger in the corpse.|$|E

He went 13-of-19 for 132yards with one interception thrown to Ravens safety Bernard Pollard in the game. In {{the second week of}} the preseason on August 18 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kafka entered the game in the fourth quarter and led the Eagles to two scoring drives in a 24–14 loss. With less than four minutes remaining in the game, he threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Gerald Jones, and with only 19 seconds left on the following drive, threw a second touchdown pass to Jones for sevenyards. He finished the game going 14-for-19 for 160yards along with the two scores. Kafka played in garbage time in the next preseason game against the Cleveland Browns, handing the ball off twice and kneeling down twice. Against the New York Jets {{in the preseason}} finale, he filled in for the injured Young, who started the game, to start the third quarter. Kafka had the wind knocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> on a sack, but was able to play the rest of the game despite a rib contusion. He finished the game 7-for-11 for 76yards and one interception. He went 34-for-49 for 369yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the preseason overall.|$|E

25|$|Knox {{attended}} Dulwich College. He {{played two}} matches for Surrey in 1904 without achieving a great deal, but the following year, aided by some fiery pitches at The Oval, advanced {{so much that}} he was an excellent backup to Walter Lees in a major Surrey revival. Although he was expensive on true pitches Knox took 129 wickets for less than 22 runs each, and his promise was clearly noted, though even then the length (over 20 metres – very long for the time) of his run-up was seen as taking a great deal of energy <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and it was thought Knox would have trouble coping with arduous seasons.|$|E

25|$|Under Graham Taylor, many speculated his old {{mentor and}} manager at Watford {{would be able}} to get the best <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> but his form was to become even less consistent; {{although}} this may have partly been down to the decline of English football as a whole during this period. In Graham Taylor's first match as England Manager (against Hungary), Barnes had appeared to be attacking positively and beating players and using the ball well. This was a false dawn however and throughout a difficult time for the England squad, Barnes had few other highlights with the exception of scoring a stunning free kick against the Netherlands in a 1994 World Cup qualifying match.|$|E
25|$|Angie {{returns to}} Walford, with her plans still secret, {{and tries to}} show {{interest}} in Den's plan to move the location of The Queen Vic, but it is plain to see that her mind is elsewhere.

Angie decides to leave in May of that year, still under a cloak of secrecy and only divulging her plan to leave on the night of her departure. Unfortunately for Angie, Den cruelly informs her that he has arranged things so that she won't {{be able to get a}} penny <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> After their final showdown Angie gets into her taxicab and leaves Walford. This is Angie's last appearance.|$|E
25|$|On Apokolips, Darkseid and Desaad {{discuss the}} coming of a time with {{existence}} being recreated with Darkseid as the architect. Darkseid has {{what appears to be}} a chess-board with pieces representing the Joker, Donna Troy, Green Arrow, the Flash, Holly Robinson, Batman, Jason Todd, Hawkman, Killer Croc, Martian Manhunter, Superman, Wonder Woman, OMAC, Jimmy Olsen, Nightwing, Duela Dent, and Black Adam. Later, as the New Gods Lightray and Sleez are killed by an unknown, mysterious figure, Darkseid converses with a concubine and Desaad. When the concubine comments on Darkseid showing a moment of weakness, Darkseid kills her and tells Desaad to remove the vocal cords from the next concubine. The conversation is witnessed by Forager of New Genesis, who is spying on them to see if Darkseid is responsible for the recent murders of the New Gods. Forager is attacked by a guard and escapes. The Deep Six are killed soon afterwards by the same mysterious figure. Darkseid shows knowledge of the New Gods dying across the galaxy and the mystery figure killing them, and decides to use the New Gods as pawns in a complex scheme intended to result in his rule of the entire Multiverse. Mary Marvel is brought before Darkseid, who tells her that he wants a sorcerer and that she is it. When she refuses his offer, they briefly fight before Desaad arrives and distracts Darkseid long enough for Mary to escape. Eclipso assures Darkseid that she will bring Mary back. Darkseid later restores Mary's powers and orders her to capture Jimmy Olsen. Later, Darkseid is about to siphon Jimmy's superpowers <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> before his son Orion emerges from a boom tube and apparently kills him after ripping his heart out. The Monitor Solomon places a chess piece of Darkseid onto the Source Wall as a memento of his victory.|$|E

25|$|Tabari writes, “God created Adam {{with his}} own hands so that God could say to Iblis (Satan) that he was exalting himself over that which God formed {{with his own}} hands. So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach he was hungry, so before the spirit reached his feet {{he tried to get}} up in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This is the meaning of God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They asked him why he was crying and he said, “I am crying for you because you will die and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them and whispered saying, “Adam, may I lead you to the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm and wrap him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E
500|$|Beyond this, Jack Warner {{was shaken}} by the 1936 murder of studio {{salesman}} Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in Berlin. Warner later described the incident in the following terms: [...] "Like many an outnumbered Jew he was trapped in an alley. They [...] hit him with fists and clubs and then kicked the life <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> with their boots and left him dying there." [...] Hence, while other Hollywood studios sidestepped the issue, fearing domestic criticism {{and the loss of}} European markets, Warner Brothers produced films that were openly critical of Nazi Germany.|$|E
