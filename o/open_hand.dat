5|$|In his will, Sylvester had {{declared}} that royalties {{from the future}} sale of this music be devoted to two HIV/AIDS charities, Project <b>Open</b> <b>Hand</b> and the AIDS Emergency Fund. Although Sylvester died deeply in debt {{as a result of}} taking advances on his royalties, by the early 1990s this debt had been paid off, and a balance had begun to build up. Roger Gross, the attorney to Sylvester's manager and the openly gay lawyer who helped him draw up his will, petitioned the probate court to designate the charities as the beneficiaries of Sylvester's will. The proceeds of $140,000 in accrued royalties were split between the two groups, and they will continue to be paid the royalties in the future.|$|E

25|$|Signifer: Each {{century had}} a signifer (thus, there were 59 in a legion) and within each cohort the 1st century's signifer {{would be the}} senior. He was standard-bearer for the centurial signum, a spear shaft {{decorated}} with medallions and topped with an <b>open</b> <b>hand</b> to signify loyalty, which was a rallying point for the soldiers. In addition to carrying the signum, the signifer also assumed responsibility for the financial administration of the unit and functioned as the legionaries' banker. He was paid twice the basic wage.|$|E

25|$|Still, Talavera was waiting. On 16 May he was {{alternating}} {{there with}} Joselito when the bull Bailaor gave his brother-in-law a tremendous, unexpected goring. While Joselito {{was taken to}} the infirmary, Sánchez killed the bull. Afterwards {{when he went to the}} infirmary to see his friend, he was already dead. He watched over the corpse that night, in tears. The photograph of Sánchez overwhelmed by grief supporting his head with an <b>open</b> <b>hand</b> and with the other caressing the face of the reclining Joselito, tranquil in his glory, is perhaps the most emotional in the history of tauromaquia.|$|E
25|$|He faced Shawn Jordan on June 15, 2013 at UFC 161, losing by TKO {{in round}} one. However, later reports came that the {{stoppage}} {{might have been}} caused by an eye poke from Jordan. The report showed that the uppercut Jordan landed (which seemed to daze Barry) wasn't an uppercut but an <b>open</b> <b>hand</b> blow. The report also showed that Jordan's fingers found their way into Barry's eyes. Following the uppercut, Barry was trying to protect the eye from the next of Jordan's punches. Barry did not mention that he had been poked in the eye, but pictures from the day after the fight show that he tapped to strikes three times.|$|E
25|$|On February 21, Griffin {{received}} a concussion {{in a loss}} to the Texas Longhorns, when he caught an inadvertent shot to the face from the <b>open</b> <b>hand</b> of Texas center Dexter Pittman. He sat out the second half during the Sooners loss with a bloody nose. It was the Sooners' first loss of their conference schedule for the season. After sitting out the next game, a loss to Kansas Jayhawks, he was cleared by the medical staff and returned a week later to get 20 points and 19 rebounds in a victory over Texas Tech. Oklahoma {{finished second in the}} conference with a 13–3 record but fell short in {{the first game of the}} Big 12 Tournament to Oklahoma State. In the NCAA tournament, Oklahoma was seeded No. 2 in the South Region with a 27–5 record. In a second-round win over the Michigan Wolverines, Griffin scored 33 points and grabbed 17 rebounds and became just the second player in the 2000s (decade) with at least 30 points and 15 rebounds in an NCAA tournament game. The Sooners ended up losing to the North Carolina Tar Heels in the South Regional final.|$|E

No charges were filed against Schenecker but, {{according to the police}} report, Schenecker acknowledged that she had hit her daughter. Calyx told a counselor in her once-a-week therapy appointment that her mother had hit her in the face when they were heading home from cross-country practice November 2, 2010, according to the police report. Investigators that visited the home said there were no visible injuries on Calyx when the report was filed four days later.

500|$|Zvi Hecker {{architecture}} {{has continued}} to emphasize geometry and modularity, but with increasing asymmetry. Ramot Polin (1972–75) is a rare prefabricated apartment complex with 720 non-rectangular components. The apartments were expanded later, incorporating more cubic rather than pentagonal components. The design idea of this neighborhood {{may seem to be}} the more purely geometrical, however it is likened to a chemical structure, and in plan view to an <b>open</b> <b>hand,</b> and a leaf- therefore imparting it with metaphorical qualities. More examples of advanced geometry in Hecker's work are the Spiral Apartment House in Ramat Gan, (1981–1989), and the Heinz-Galinski-Schule (1992–1995) in Berlin, noted for their high degree of complexity. The Heinz-Galinski-Schule won Zvi Hecker the Deutscher Kritikerpreis in 1995- it was stated that the decision of the jury was based on their appreciation of the [...] "expressive geometry of his construction." [...] The Spiral Apartment House is located adjacent to his earlier Dubiner house, providing a juxtaposition of two important moments in his career. The work of Zvi Hecker has been compared to that of Antonio Gaudi, for expressiveness and expanding of architectural ideas.|$|E
