Pal, that's nice that you're not showing off but this is all wrong and despicable: it's like locking yourself and 10 friends into a loo on a commuter train, {{to see what it}} would be like on the train to Auschwitz. If you can make it stop whenever you like, you're learning nothing and kicking people in the face while you're at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} series, Last Broadcast held a poll for the top five most {{shocking}} death scenes in Spooks. Two of them were deaths from the seventh series. Adam Carter's death was voted the fourth most shocking, while Ben Kaplan's death was voted third. Connie's death however, was not listed. The featuring of an actual waterboarding scene drew criticism from Guardian columnist Zoe Williams, who wrote [...] "it's really unpleasant, [...] concurred.

500|$|In a {{flashback}} sequence {{in one of}} his early episodes, Lucas is subjected to waterboarding, a method of psychological torture. In order to ensure the authenticity of the sequence, Armitage was himself subjected to the actual torture while shooting. He agreed to perform the sequence after he was convinced by consultants for the FSB and CIA. Armitage was only subjected to it for a short time, and was filmed in slow motion to make it appear he was on for longer. The ambient temperature of the room was also raised to make him as comfortable as possible. However, after the sequence was shot, Armitage changed his opinion entirely, stating; [...] "I only lasted five to ten seconds, and the sound <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> crying out to stop isn't me acting." [...] Armitage shot more interrogation scenes during production of the eighth series, but only some were added into the episodes. He was [...] "less physical" [...] in the ninth series.|$|E

500|$|Possessing a {{mezzo-soprano}} vocal range, Madonna {{has always}} been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince, and Chaka Khan. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her [...] "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a [...] "heavyweight talent." [...] According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, [...] "Madonna's vocals {{are the key to}} her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs [...] "straight," [...] but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did." [...] Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium". During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, [...] "I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going {{to make the most of}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Sufjan Stevens {{released}} {{an album of}} extra material left over from Illinois (originally conceived as a double album), titled , {{as well as an}} album of Christmas music titled Songs for Christmas (produced in parts between 2001 and 2006). Following the release of The Avalanche, Stevens expressed a dissatisfaction with his music, stating in an interview with Pitchfork in 2006: [...] "I'm getting tired <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice.</b> I'm getting tired of ... the banjo. I'm getting tired of ... the trumpet". In 2009 Stevens admitted that his Fifty States Project—an attempt to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. States—had been a [...] "promotional gimmick" [...] and not something that he had seriously intended to complete. In the same year he released The BQE, an orchestral suite accompanying a home-made film dedicated to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. In an interview with BeatRoute Magazine in 2010, Stevens stated [...] " [...] kinda sabotaged the mechanical way of approaching my music, which was basically narrative long-form. It really opened things up for me. It also confused things as well. I don’t think I ever really fully recovered from that process". On August 20, 2010, without prior announcement, Stevens released the EP All Delighted People, and less than one week later, announced The Age of Adz to be released on October 12.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{allow the}} cast to perform {{many of their}} own stunts. In filming fight sequences, they were carefully choreographed beforehand so the actors could participate themselves. The guns featured on the series are real. In scenes where guns are included, an armourer is on hand throughout {{the entirety of the}} sequence to see if the actors are handling them properly and gives out the guns to the actors at the last possible second before filming. After the sequence is shot, the guns have to be returned and locked in a case to prevent anybody from playing with them, even if the guns are not loaded. Among other stunt work, Armitage was asked to be subjected to an actual waterboarding scene to ensure the authenticity of the sequence. The actor agreed after he was convinced by conultants from the FSB and CIA. Kudos film and television, the production company behind Spooks, had to follow several health and safety provisions from an advisor to ensure the sequence strictly adheres to the advice.

500|$|The {{trial began}} on May 9, 1951. Colonel Eric Pepler, a World War I veteran and British Columbia's deputy {{attorney}} general, led for the Crown while Diefenbaker led for the defence. To a CNR official on the stand, Diefenbaker said, [...] "I suppose {{the reason you}} put these soldiers in wooden cars with steel cars on either end was so {{that no matter what}} they might subsequently find in Korea, they'd always be able to say, 'Well we had worse than that in Canada'." [...] Colonel Pepler objected, stating that Diefenbaker had not asked a question. Diefenbaker responded, [...] "My Lord, it was made clear by the elevation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> {{at the end of the}} sentence that there was a great big question mark on it." [...] The judge, Justice A.D. McFarlane, began to rule, but Pepler interjected, [...] "I want to make it clear that in this case we are not concerned about the death of a few privates going to Korea." [...] Pepler intended to remind the judge that Atherton was charged in relation to the death of only the troop train fireman, but Diefenbaker pounced: [...] "Oh, you're not concerned about the killing of a few privates? Oh, Colonel!" [...] Diefenbaker recounted that a veteran, sitting on the jury, expressed shock at Pepler's comment, and Diefenbaker lost no opportunity during the rest of the trial to address Pepler as [...] "Colonel".|$|E
500|$|Initially, G-Dragon {{admitted}} to being self-conscious {{of his role}} as a musician, noting how he had [...] "changed many things including the tone <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> because I was conscious about my job when I was in front of others." [...] Aware that his public image is important when promoting his materials, G-Dragon notes that [...] "what the public perceives of [...] is my doing so it's my fault if I give off the wrong intention." [...] In recent years, he has become more relaxed, stating that now he doesn't [...] "do music or dress up in order to impress people around me. I don't try to be conscious ," [...] While promoting his EP Kwon Ji Yong, G-Dragon explained that he originally created the alter ego G-Dragon to keep his stage persona separate from who he really is. Seoul Beats have described G-Dragon as [...] "glamorous, cocky, [...] energetic," [...] compared to his real-life [...] "humble [...] understated" [...] personality. In a 2017 interview with Elle, he described G-Dragon as someone who is [...] "full of self-confidence" [...] and is [...] "a fancier and stronger person" [...] while Kwon Ji-yong is an [...] "introvert guy" [...] with [...] "many thoughts in his mind." [...] Despite his success as a solo artist and leader of Big Bang, G-Dragon has admitted that he didn't realize how famous he was until he went on Big Bang's first world tour.|$|E

500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge {{looking out at the}} ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I yelled at the top <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice,</b> 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred {{on the side of caution}} by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on six {{songs from}} Breakaway. [...] "Breakaway" [...] was {{included}} as the album's opening and title track. She {{described it as}} a simple song, and further explained, [...] "I think that it's simplicity is what's beautiful about it. Whenever writers or producers come to work with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice.</b> I've done country music, I've done pop, I've done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different. But this song was different from everything I've done; people didn't even know it was me!" [...] Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track [...] "Since U Been Gone", as [...] "not as [...] "smooth" [...] as pop or R Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, [...] "It's very emotional. Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live." [...] Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, [...] "I wrote 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' about my last boyfriend. It's the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn't make the deadline." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Because of You", was originally intended for Thankful. Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. [...] "Gone", the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, [...] "Addicted", was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album Fallen (2003). She remarked, [...] "I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. And then I heard that Evanescence record... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.|$|E

It had the duets with Aaron Neville, [...] "Don't Know Much" [...] (Billboard Hot 100 number 2 hit, Christmas 1989) and [...] "All My Life" [...] (Billboard Hot 100 number 11 hit), both of which were long-running number 1 Adult Contemporary hits. The duets earned several Grammy Award nominations. The duo won both the 1989 and 1990 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal awards. Ronstadt's last known live Grammy Award appearance was in 1990 when she and Neville performed [...] "Don't Know Much" [...] together on the telecast. ("Whenever I sing with a different artist, I can get things out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> that I can't do by myself", Ronstadt reflected in 2007.
