5|$|The {{primitive}} jetty {{was damaged}} {{in a storm}} of 1659, so that in 1708 leading local wool merchant Sir William Wyndham built a new harbour costing £1,000, with a stronger pier. The main export at this time was kelp, made by burning seaweed for use in glass making. In the 19th century trade increased with the export of iron ore from the Brendon Hills mainly to Newport for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> to the Ebbw Vale Steelworks, paper, flour and gypsum. In 1843 the esplanade was built by George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont, and in 1855 a new harbour was commissioned to cope with increased iron ore trade. The existing harbour was damaged and several vessels wrecked by the Royal Charter Storm on 26 October 1859. A new east pier and wharf was completed in 1861−62 by James Abernethy. This allowed shipping movement to reach a peak, with over 1,100 ship movements per annum. Harbour trade was aided by {{the coming of the}} railway, with two independent railways terminating at Watchet from the mid 1860s. The West Somerset Mineral Railway ran down from the iron mines on the Brendon Hills, and the West Somerset Railway came up from the Bristol and Exeter Railway at Norton Fitzwarren. At the peak in the trade during the late 19th century 40,000 tons of ore were exported annually.|$|E
500|$|The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal [...] was a {{canal and}} {{tramroad}} system in Carmarthenshire, Wales, built to carry anthracite coal {{to the coast}} for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> by coastal ships. It began life as Kymer's Canal in 1766, which linked pits at Pwll y Llygod to a dock near Kidwelly. Access to the dock gradually became more difficult as the estuary silted up, and an extension to Llanelli was authorised in 1812. Progress was slow, and the new canal was linked to a harbour at Pembury built by Thomas Gaunt in the 1820s, until the company's own harbour at Burry Port was completed in 1832. Tramways served a number of collieries {{to the east of}} Burry Port.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} settlement {{may have}} been at the Iron Age fort Daw's Castle. It then moved to the mouth of the river and a small harbour developed, named by the celts as [...] "Gwo Coed" [...] meaning Under the Wood. [...] After the Saxon conquest of the area the town developed and was known as Weced or Waeced [...] and was attacked by Vikings in the 10th century. Trade using the harbour gradually grew, despite damage during several severe storms, with import and exports of goods including those from Wansbrough Paper Mill until the 19th century when it increased with the export of iron ore, brought from the Brendon Hills via the West Somerset Mineral Railway, mainly to Newport for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> to the Ebbw Vale Steelworks. The West Somerset Railway also served the town and port bringing goods and people from the Bristol and Exeter Railway. The iron ore trade reduced and ceased in the early-20th century. The port continued a smaller commercial trade until 2000 when it was converted into a marina.|$|E
50|$|Mactan-Cebu International Airport {{was chosen}} as the most viable {{location}} for the world's largest aircraft, the Antonov An-225 Mriya, to safely land when considering the combination of <b>onward</b> land <b>transportation,</b> sea freight, and airport capacity. The arrival of the aircraft in the airport marked the very first time that the aircraft landed in the Philippines.|$|R
50|$|Public {{amenities}} {{have not}} {{kept up with}} the explosive pace of population growth in Huguenot and the surrounding neighborhoods {{that has taken place}} from the 1970s <b>onward,</b> as public <b>transportation</b> and sewer lines have not been upgraded fast enough to meet the increasing demand.Road problems include potholes, and there are few organized activities for adolescents, a fact often blamed for the considerable amount of vandalism that occurs there. However, the region {{is one of the most}} mainstream on Staten Island, and one of the borough's most well maintained neighborhoods.|$|R

50|$|When the Communist forces overran South Vietnam {{later in}} 1975, the base {{provided}} emergency relief and shelter {{for thousands of}} Vietnamese evacuees {{as a part of}} Operation New Life. After the fall of Saigon, Andersen received almost 40,000 refugees and processed another 109,000 for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> to the United States.|$|E
50|$|Both {{maritime}} and {{inland container}} terminals usually provide storage facilities for both loaded and empty containers. Loaded containers are stored for relatively short periods, whilst waiting for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation,</b> whilst unloaded containers may be stored {{for longer periods}} awaiting their next use. Containers are normally stacked for storage, and the resulting stores are known as container stacks.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} {{operated}} by Northern {{and is on}} the southern route of the Liverpool to Manchester Line. It is manned full-time (between 0610 and 2345 Mondays-Saturdays and 0825 and 2320 Sundays). It is across from the main Birchwood shopping complex and is well served by <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> to all parts of Birchwood and further afield.|$|E
50|$|The station {{closed to}} {{passengers}} on Monday 13 July 1925, though {{in all probability}} the last train ran on Saturday 11 July. It remained open for goods traffic until 1 October 1951, with local farmers objecting strongly to its closure, citing particularly the station's use for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> of their sugar beet to the Brigg sugar factory.|$|E
50|$|As a goods depot, Bishopsgate handled {{very large}} volumes of goods from the eastern ports and was {{arranged}} over three levels with turntables and hoists allowing railway wagons to be moved individually around the station for loading and unloading. Incoming goods could be stored in the warehouse on site or transferred directly to road vehicles for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> to their destinations.|$|E
50|$|Baton Rouge Transit is {{responsible}} for storing and loading the biomass at the Port of Baton Rouge and for ensuring their safe <b>onward</b> <b>transportation.</b> After being unloaded from truck or train, biomass pellets are stored in the two 40,000 tonne domes at the port. From there, they are loaded onto ships for transport to UK ports at Kingston upon Hull, Immingham, Port of Tyne and Liverpool.|$|E
50|$|A {{container}} terminal is a facility where cargo containers are transshipped between different transport vehicles, for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation.</b> The transshipment may be between container ships and land vehicles, for example trains or trucks, {{in which case}} the terminal is described as a maritime {{container terminal}}. Alternatively the transshipment may be between land vehicles, typically between train and truck, {{in which case the}} terminal is described as an inland container terminal.|$|E
50|$|The railway from Sydney to Windsor {{opened in}} 1864, {{which meant that}} farm produce could be shipped upriver for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> by train. However, by the 1880s the river had become silted up between Sackville and Windsor, and Sackville became the head of {{navigation}} for seagoing vessels. The SS Hawkesbury, operating from the 1880s, and the SS Narara, from 1900 until it sank in 1909, linked Sackville to Sydney.|$|E
50|$|The Monmouth Tramroad was a horse-drawn railway between Monmouth and Coleford in Gloucestershire. It {{opened in}} 1812 and {{closed in the}} late 19th century. The Redbrook Incline Bridge was {{constructed}} {{as part of a}} branch line from the main tramroad to serve the Redbrook Tinplate Works. Grace's Guide to British Industrial History suggests it was also used to transport coal out of the Forest of Dean to the River Wye for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Designed by Thomas Steers {{and being}} built from 1734, it was {{completed}} {{after his death}} by Henry Berry, opening in 1753. The dock was originally known as South Dock, the name changing because it was nearby to John Blackburne's saltworks. As is indicative of its name, the dock was an important transit terminal for the salt industry. Liverpool was a base for the refining of rock salt from Cheshire and its <b>onward</b> <b>transportation.</b> The dock also handled agricultural produce from Ireland and the Mediterranean. Around 1769, John Okill had a shipyard on the south side.|$|E
5000|$|Airports have a twofold hub function. First they {{concentrate}} {{passenger traffic}} into one place for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation.</b> This makes it important for airports {{to be connected}} to the surrounding transport infrastructure, including roads, bus services, railway and rapid transit systems. Secondly some airports function as intra-modular hubs for the airlines, or airline hubs. This is a common strategy among network airlines who fly only from limited number of airports and usually will make their customers change planes at one of their hubs if they want to get between two cities the airline doesn't fly directly between.|$|E
50|$|The Hawkesbury River {{was one of}} {{the major}} {{transportation}} routes for transporting food from the surrounding area to Sydney during the 1800s. Boats would wait in the protection of Broken Bay and Pittwater, until favourable weather allowed them to make the ocean journey to Sydney Heads. With the opening of the railway from Sydney to Windsor in 1864, farm produce could be shipped upriver for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> by train. However, by the 1880s the river had become silted up between Sackville and Windsor, and Sackville became the head of navigation for sea-going vessels. Until the end of the 19th century coastal steamers linked Sackville to Sydney.|$|E

50|$|Minakulu {{is mainly}} an {{agricultural}} based sub-county. It produces cotton, g-nuts, simsim, cassava, beans, pigeon peas, oranges, mangoes and pineapples. These crops were stored and traded using a government-aided subsidiary, the Lango Cooperative Union, {{created by the}} Obote government in the 1960s. However, the world bank liberalisation policy implemented in the 1990s by the new regime of president Yoweri Museveni led {{to the collapse of}} this organised commerce. Since then, the people of Minakulu are less commercial in the traditional sense. Rather, there is total concentration on food crops which are mainly for home use with negligible surplus sold to local businessmen for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> and sale to Kampala, Uganda's capital city, where some basic profit is made.|$|E
50|$|The only freight worth {{mentioning}} runs between Freilassing and Hammerau. The {{bulk of the}} volume of freight are semi-finished steel products from the Annahütte steel works in Hammerau and containers of household waste that are collected in the district and loaded on container wagons, bound for the Freilassing-Hofham waste transfer station and <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> for incineration in Burgkirchen an der Alz. At the stations in Bad Reichenhall and Berchtesgaden there are tracks serving loading and unloading ramps, which are used for the shipment by rail of military vehicles of the Bundeswehr to and from locations in Bad Reichenhall and Strub (in Bischofswiesen). The Neuen Saline siding in Bad Reichenhall is no longer used.|$|E
50|$|Templer was a Master in the Crown Office at London. He {{inherited}} the Stover estate in 1782, and began {{construction of a}} new church at Teigngrace, built in the local granite from quarries at Hay Tor. This was completed in 1787, and his brother Rev. John Templer (1751-1832) of Lindridge House was the first rector of the church. The mining of ball clay in the area had begun to rapidly expand, and from 1790 Templer built the Stover Canal at his own expense to transport clay to cellars {{on the banks of the}} River Teign, for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> by barge down the river estuary to the port of Teignmouth on the coast.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 310 Polish, seven German, six Czech, four Luxemburg, three Dutch and two Belgian priests were killed. Many {{of them were}} transported from the Priest's Block in Dachau {{concentration}} camp. The chaplain, Hermann Scheipers, was also moved to the Invalid's Block, {{in order to be}} taken to Hartheim. Scheiper's sister — who stayed in contact by letter — tracked down a certain Dr. Bernsdorf, employee of the RSHA Berlin-Oranienburg, who was responsible for the clergy imprisoned in the Priest's Block. She confronted him and stated that, in Münsterland, it was an open secret that imprisoned priests were sent to the gas chamber. Bernsdorf apparently became very nervous during the discussion and telephoned the Commandant's Office at Dachau. Scheipers reported that it was on that same day, the 13 August 1942, that there was a response: he and three other German clergymen were moved from the Invalid's Block (where the SS assembled prisoners for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation)</b> back to the Priest's Block.|$|E
5000|$|The State Department was {{concerned}} that some among the potential returnees were being coerced by their colleagues into saying they wished to return to Vietnam. State isolated the potential returnees and interviewed each of them individually. Those affirming they wished to return to Vietnam were escorted directly from the interview to the Tuong Tin for departure. Those declining to return, numbering 45, were escorted to the mostly-empty refugee camps for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> to the U.S. The total number of Vietnamese crowded onto the Tuong Tin was 1,546, of whom most were men whose families were in Vietnam. The Tuong Tin departed Guam on 16 October 1975. [...] The fate of the Tuong Tin was unknown {{for more than a}} decade. The ship's captain, Tran Dinh Tru, later told his story. On arrival in Vietnam, Tru and at least some of his shipmates were sent to reeducation camps in the rural areas of Vietnam. Tru was imprisoned for 12 years.|$|E
50|$|In 1840, the British {{created a}} teak {{plantation}} in Nilambur {{to ensure a}} steady supply of timber for their various needs. In 1923, the South Indian Railway Company, which operated the Madras-Shoranur-Mangalore line, was contracted by the Madras Presidency to build a railway from Nilambur to Shoranur to ensure easy transportation of timber from these forests to the plains and hence to ports and <b>onward</b> <b>transportation.</b> The company completed line in stages. The Shoranur-Angadippuram (Perinthalmanna) section was opened on 3 February 1927, Angadippuram-Vaniyambalam on 3 August 1927 and the entire stretch from Shoranur to Nilambur was opened on 26 October 1927. During World War II, the Shoranur line, along with other numerous railway lines across British India were dismantled and rolling stock diverted to the Middle East to help British war efforts. The line ceased to exist in 1941. After independence, following public pressure, the railway line was reconstructed by the Indian Railways along its original alignment. The line re-opened in 1953. The teak plantation still stands today as a major tourist attraction.|$|E
50|$|In 1789, the Viceroy of New Spain Manuel Antonio Flores, {{ordered the}} First Company of the First Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia, under Alberni, to prepare {{to move to}} San Blas for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> to Nootka Sound, on Vancouver Island, to {{reinforce}} the fortified post that had been established by Esteban José Martínez in May 1789. Martínez had sent a request for two hundred infantry, but before any reinforcements could be sent Martínez abandoned Nootka Sound, in October 1789, due to the crisis that arose after Martínez seized some British and American ships that were trading in the region and, some time later, killed Callicum, a close relative of the Nuu-chah-nulth chieftain Maquinna. Before the abandonment of Nootka was known, the King of Spain issued the Royal Order of April 14, 1789, requiring the establishment at Nootka to be maintained. In 1790, therefore, Nootka was reoccupied by an expedition {{under the command of}} Francisco de Eliza. Alberni's soldiers sailed with Eliza. At Nootka, they rebuilt and enlarged the artillery battery called Fort San Miguel.|$|E

5000|$|During the January 12, {{the strike}} {{continued}} in the main towns of the Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region, extending itself to the main border crossings with Argentina. More than two thousand cars remained isolated while trying to cross from the province of Tierra del Fuego to the province of Santa Cruz through Chilean territory. Another 1,500 tourists were left without movement in Torres del Paine National Park after routes to Puerto Natales and El Calafate were cut. [...] Actions by the protesters halted buses of people attempting to flee from Chile, leaving them at barricaded locations outside the cities, unable to move except by walking. This [...] "forced march" [...] situation adversely affected many elderly tourists, including those with disabilities, resulting in human rights complaints and well as violations of Chilean national law providing for free passage within the country. The Chilean national police, the Carabineros, refused to act {{on behalf of the}} foreign visitors by enforcing the national law, instead leaving these people without access to food or water, stranded without transportation outside the cities. Many elderly and handicapped people were thus forced to walk for up to 20 km. Before the regional protests and rebellion against the law were over, thousands of people had to be evacuated. Some chose to walk from Puerto Natales to the frontier with Argentina, where they were received as refugees, and given assistance to onward travel and other accommodation. Eventually the US Embassy quietly arranged for a cooperative effort involving the Chilean Air Force. Squadron Commander Vegas was credited with a successful airlift of several thousand visitors, with most being delivered to the Punta Arenas airport for <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> so that those people could flee from southern Chile. LAN airlines was able to evacuate many of these affected people with flights to Santiago.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in the ‘Methods’ section, the shell sphere chosen for this exercise was selected for logistical purposes—the inclusion of background activity was desired, but the source {{had to be able}} to be prepared at NPL and shipped to the participants. It was unfeasible to transport a 9 -l phantom filled with liquid activity, and shipping vials of activity to be added to the water in the phantom at each site would have contaminated the phantom, preventing <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> of the phantom to the next site. The shell source selected was commercially available, and it was possible to obtain transportation containers that made shipping them a viable option. If this comparison exercise were to be repeated with a similar set-up, it may be desirable to use a shell sphere with a thicker outer shell.|$|E

Emergency planners in the District of Columbia have recognized the desirability of developing a tool to assist planners in selecting CCPs within the affected area following a major incident. We develop a CCP optimization model (CCPOM) that provides planners and policymakers with strategic and operational insights into the complex problem of selecting optimal CCP locations to maximize casualty throughput {{for a range of}} incident parameters. Even more relevant, the CCPOM determines the utilization of personnel, decontamination units, and ambulances, providing planners with a general structure for resource allocation and signaling shortfalls that may lead to bottlenecks in casualty processing at the CCPs. District planners found many nonintuitive CCPOM results to be significant to their planning, programming, and budgeting efforts, and now consider the model’s categorized resource utilization to be an integral part in updating District plans for both national special security event planning and everyday events...|$|E
40|$|The {{concern about}} the welfare of {{livestock}} during transport is increasing as animal production and transport for slaugh- ter and breeding is increasing. The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the characteristics of animal supply and activities in slaughter chain in the Kumasi abattoir, Ghana. The main stakeholders were indentified and interviewed. Based on the data and information gathered (through interview, field measurements, observation and activity registra- tion), the main characteristics of the animal supply and activities in the abattoir chain were mapped out. The study indi- cated that the animals were sourced from inside and outside Ghana. The purchased animals were first sent to a local collection centre before <b>onward</b> <b>transportation</b> to the Cattle Market in the Kumasi city, where the animals should stay until sold and taken to abattoir to be slaughtered. The study indicated that inhuman way of animal handling, incidence of non-ambulation, sickness and death of animals were common during transport as well as inside Kumasi cattle market. The slaughtering procedures and meat distribution to the butcheries lacked good hygienic conditions compromising meat safety and quality. These issues of animal welfare and meat safety and quality should get attention and improve- ments must be planned...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Numerous studies {{discuss that}} Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{technology}} can provide better container handling efficiency; however, {{relative lack of}} research concerns the tracking and monitoring the movement of vehicle in the container terminal environment.

The possibility and accuracy of using RFID in such challenging environment is also investigated. These propositions are investigated by a case study. Findings: The experimental results indicate that the RFID communication is good at the containers area which occupies nearly all the area in the container terminal. However, in other area such as sea side and free area, the performance is not good and 100 % readability only achieved in 5 m and 10 m in free area and sea side respectively.
