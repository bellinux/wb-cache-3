5000|$|Cases of {{cryptosporidiosis}} {{can occur}} {{in a city with}} clean water; cases of cryptosporidiosis can have different origins. Like many fecal-oral pathogens, it can also be transmitted by contaminated food or poor hygiene. Testing of water, as well as epidemiological study, are necessary to determine the sources of specific infections. Cryptosporidium typically does not cause serious illness in healthy people. It may chronically sicken some children, as well as adults exposed and immunocompromised. A subset of the immunocompromised population is people with AIDS. Amongst MSM with AIDS, insertive anal sex is an increased risk factor. [...] Analingus and <b>oral-genital</b> <b>sex</b> after anal-genital sex are known transmission routes.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. This hospital-based case-case study {{compared}} {{the characteristics of}} sexual behavior in patients with cancer of the oropharynx to patients with cancers of other head and neck sites. Additionally, the prevalence of certain sexual behaviors of HPV- 16 seropositive head and neck cancer patients was {{compared to that of}} seronegative patients. ^ Methods. One hundred sixty five oropharyngeal cancer patients and 86 patients with cancers of other head and neck sites completed a sexual history questionnaire. ^ Results. Oropharyngeal cancer patients {{were significantly more likely to}} have had a greater number of lifetime sex partners, to have engaged in <b>oral-genital</b> <b>sex,</b> and to have had a greater number of <b>oral-genital</b> <b>sex</b> partners than non-oropharyngeal cancer patients. <b>Oral-genital</b> <b>sex</b> was significantly more common in the HPV- 16 seropositive group. ^ Conclusion. These findings add to the evidence that HPV- 16 is sexually transmitted to the upper aerodigestive tract and that certain sexual behaviors increase the risk for HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. ...|$|E
50|$|Oral <b>sex</b> (<b>oral-genital</b> contact) is {{considered}} {{as a part of}} foreplay by those who allow it, not as an alternative to vaginal intercourse. One group of Salafi scholars and Shafi`i school says that oral sex is halal (permissible) because of the hadith in which he encouraged foreplay between spouses, and that these are naturally gratifying activities that will help them have a better marriage.|$|R
40|$|In 2006 we {{conducted}} a cross-sectional study involving hospital clinical centres in five Italian cities to compare the sexual behaviour of HIV-positive MSM (men {{who have sex with}} men) before and after the diagnosis of HIV infection. Each centre was asked to enrol 30 HIV-positive persons aged > 18 years. The questionnaire was administered to 143 MSM on average 9 years after HIV diagnosis. After diagnosis there was a {{decrease in the number of}} sexual partners: the percentage of persons who reported having had more than 2 partners decreased from 95. 8 % before diagnosis to 76. 2 % after diagnosis. After diagnosis, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of persons who had never (or not always) used a condom with their stable partner for anal sex from 69. 2 % before diagnosis to 26. 6 % after diagnosis and for <b>oral-genital</b> <b>sex</b> from 74. 8 % before diagnosis to 51. 7 % after diagnosis. Though at-risk behaviour seems to decrease after diagnosis, seropositive MSM continue to engage in at-risk practices: one fourth of them did not use a condom during sexually transmitted infections (STI) episodes, 12. 5 % of the participants had had sex for money, and 8. 4 % had paid for sex. The study shows that our sample of Italian HIV-positive MSM, though aware of being infected, engage in sexual behaviours that could sustain transmission of HIV and other STIs. The results could constitute the first step in implementing national prevention programs for persons living with HIV...|$|E
40|$|An {{anonymous}} self-administered {{questionnaire was}} distributed to (1) male {{members of the}} Danish Gay and Lesbian Association (2) through a gay magazine and (3) to readers of a gay pornographic magazine. For {{the purpose of this}} study sexual practices were classified into three categories taking into account the HIV-status of the respondent and his partner(s) : safe sex (mutual masturbation, sex with condoms, sex without condoms between two HIV-positives), potentially safe sex (<b>oral-genital</b> <b>sex</b> without condoms irrespective of HIV-status, anal-genital sex without condoms between two HIV-negatives), unsafe sex (anal-genital sex without condoms between discordant partners or partners of unknown HIV status). Of the 2058 respondents 29. 7 % had had unsafe sex in the last 12 months. Multivariate analysis by recursive graphical models showed that sexual practice was directly related (that is conditionally dependent given the rest of the variables) to having a steady partner. Among men without a steady partner sexual practice was also directly related to age and number of partners showing an increase in unsafe sex with number of partners and a decrease with age. Thus of the men 16 - 19 years of age 43. 5 % had had unsafe sex irrespective of number of partners vs 5. 7 % of men older than 44 years and with one to two partners. Sexual practice was not directly related to any other demographic or psychosocial factor in the study. The adopted classification of sexual practice preclude that the high occurrence of unsafe sex could be explained by unsafe sex taking place among partners of concordant HIV status. The results emphasize the need for further preventive efforts to reduce transmission of HIV among homosexual men. human immunodeficiency virus homosexual males sexual practice psychosocial factors...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{relationship}} between religiosity and sexual behavior of college students by using a measure of religious orientation to define religiosity. Religious orientation refers to individuals' motivations for religious involvement and personal faith. Religious orientations are characterized as being extrinsic, intrinsic, indiscriminately proreligious or nonreligious. Four null hypotheses were formulated. It was hypothesized that there would be no significant difference in rates of premarital sexual intercourse or participation in oral-genital sexual activity between subjects of differing religious orientation. It was also hypothesized that the demographic variables of gender, grade point average, academic classification and ethnicity were not significantly related to religious orientation and virginity or religious orientation and participation in oral-genital sexual activity. The sample consisted of 235 never married, heterosexual college students aged 17 to 24, enrolled at a west coast independent university. Subjects completed three selfreport instruments: the Religious Orientation Scale, the Lifetime Sexual Behaviors Scale and a demographic survey. Data were analyzed using Pearson chi square, Fisher two-tail tests, t-tests and logistical regression. Results indicate that there are significant differences in the sexual behavior of students of differing religious orientations. Intrinsic students were significantly less likely to participate in premarital sexual intercourse or oral-genital sexual activity. For females, students with GPA's of 3. 0 or less, non-first year students, first year students and sophomores grouped together, seniors, nonseniors, Roman Catholics, non-Agnostics, non-Atheists, Caucasians, non-African-Americans, non-Latinos and non- Asian/Pacific Islanders, the relationship between intrinsic religious orientation and virginity is significant. The relationship between participation in <b>oral-genital</b> <b>sex</b> and intrinsic religious orientation is significant for non-first year students, non-Roman Catholics, non-Agnostics, Caucasians, non-African Americans and non-Latinos. Other findings indicate that students stating that religion was an important factor in their lives were less likely to engage in premarital sexual intercourse. Intrinsic students were significantly more likely to be virgins than nonvirgins. Scores on the Intrinsic Scale of the Religious Orientation Survey and acadeniic class were significant predictors of virginity when combined with intrinsicness...|$|E
