40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine two related propositions: the {{efficiency}} of pricing <b>of</b> Australian <b>shares</b> and the influences <b>of</b> <b>share</b> prices on business investment. In line with similar studies overseas, {{we find that the}} Australian share market may deviate from efficient pricing over short time horizons but that there is little evidence of inefficiency over longer time horizons. To investigate the influence <b>of</b> <b>share</b> prices on investment decisions we use a simple model <b>of</b> real <b>share</b> prices to identify estimates of the ‘fundamental’ and ‘speculative’ components <b>of</b> <b>share</b> prices. As expected, the estimated fundamental component <b>of</b> real <b>share</b> prices is found to have a stronger relationship with investment than the aggregate real share price series.
