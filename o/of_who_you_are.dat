Her awards have included an honorary Golden Lion at the 1993 Venice Film Festival, and an honorary Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival. The Los Angeles Times Magazine, in a February 2011 online feature, named Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history. Cardinale said of her acting, [...] "I never felt scandal and confession were necessary to be an actress. I've never revealed my self or even my body in films. Mystery is very important." [...] In a 2014 interview, she revealed her secret of success: [...] "If you want to practise this craft, {{you have to have}} inner strength. Otherwise, you’ll lose your idea <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Every film I make entails becoming a different woman. And in front of a camera, no less! But when I’m finished, I’m me again." ...|$|E

500|$|Frank was not {{originally}} envisioned with a beard, however at {{the time}} of his casting, Fahey himself had one. Lindelof and Cuse felt that the beard worked with Lapidus' character, and allowed Fahey to keep it for the role, with the requirement he shave it back to a more manageable length. The character remained bearded until his return in fifth season episode [...] "316", set three years on from his original introduction. Fahey praised the way the character was developed to suit him, explaining that upon meeting with Lindelof and Cuse, rather than discussing the show with him, they were more interested in him personally and his experiences, going on to incorporate elements of himself into Lapidus. He expanded: [...] "The beauty of this is they'll feed you a concept based on an idea <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> The actor and the characters are not suits off the rack, they tailor-make them to you. What's very exciting is it is a very positive give and take. It's a nice dance, as it were." [...] Fahey was not given an overarching overview of his character, nor were any of the other new freighter folk, which he found exciting, creating a level of intrigue amongst the cast and crew as well as fans. [...] Prior to arrival on the island, Lapidus was described by Naomi as a drunk. Entertainment Weeklys Kristin Dos Santos deemed Lapidus the most laid back of the four new characters, though Fahey commented that [...] "It might be because he's just rolled around a few more places a little longer than the others", agreeing with Dos Santos' assessment that Lapidus was [...] "a little nomadic". Lindelof and Cuse have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E
500|$|Quinn is {{described}} by Agron as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) enemy, and [...] "terrible, the meanest girl". Agron said that her favorite part of Quinn is that [...] "she's smart. But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost." [...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning it upside down. That's the great thing about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E

TLC general manager Amy Winter stated, [...] "After 10 {{incredible}} seasons, {{we felt that}} it was the right time to end the series." [...] Stacy London said, [...] "This show changed me and the trajectory of my life... I've learned so much from all of our contributors [...] over the years. I hope we touched them as much as they touched me. I hope we touched our viewers... I will always cherish the time I spent on 'WNTW' and be eternally grateful to TLC for a great co-host, amazing crew and an awesome program." [...] Clinton Kelly said, [...] "When I got the job, I told everyone I knew that we’d probably do 10 episodes, get canceled and I’d go crawling back to my old job in magazine publishing. So, I’m more surprised than anyone that we’ve lasted this long. At first I thought the essence of the show was making snarky remarks about people’s outfits, but as it turns out, 'WNTW' is about taking stock <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and communicating that non-verbally {{to the rest of the}} world. That’s incredibly empowering." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mike Diver of BBC Music gave a mixed review, {{writing that}} [...] "the songs <b>of</b> <b>Who</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> are expectedly split between slower, slushier affairs and punchy anthems for bolshy teens" [...] {{and called the}} album [...] "too patchy, too hurried, the powers behind it too eager to {{capitalise}} on the artist's current chart success", although he felt that [...] "there's ample room for improvement". Ailbhe Malone from NME described it as [...] "cheeky, relevant, and fresh [...] but unfortunately [...] a flash that's shortly over" [...] and noticed that [...] "no matter how much Jessie J sings about being herself, we don't really ever {{get a sense of}} who, or what, that is". Gary McGinley of No Ripcord called it [...] "an album of two halves as the stronger brat-pop moments soon give way to by insipid, dated ballads"; he noted that [...] "there are glimpses of promise scattered between the overwrought delivery and unnecessary vocal gymnastics", but concluded by saying that Who You Are [...] "promised much more than what has been delivered". Fiona Shepherd [...] of The Scotsman wrote that it [...] "covers all the tried and tested commercial territory: mainly a slick, generic imitation of American R divas [...] blended with the obligatory hip-pop stance" [...] and felt that Cornish [...] "is more interested in tiresome vocal showboating than communicating anything truthful". Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine agreed, saying that [...] "in the quest to find herself, she seems to have gotten sidetracked". Matthew Perpetua of Pitchfork Media was particularly critical; he felt that [...] "the music is scattered, covering all the bases in an over-eager attempt to prove vocal chops" [...] and noticed that Cornish [...] "comes across like a severely dumbed-down Lily Allen at best, and at worst she seems like someone you would want to root against in a televised singing competition".|$|E
2500|$|Jessie J {{released}} her debut single, [...] "Do It like a Dude", in the United Kingdom in November 2010, where it peaked at number {{two on the}} UK Singles Chart.

The single also reached number twenty-three on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States and peaked at number-one in France, Ireland, New Zealand, while reaching the top three in Australia, Germany and the Netherlands. Her debut album, Who You Are, was released in February 2011 and reached number two on the UK Albums Chart. It also reached the top ten in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand, and number eleven in the US. The album's third single, [...] "Nobody's Perfect", peaked at number nine in the UK, while its fourth single, [...] "Who's Laughing Now", peaked at sixteen. The fifth single from the album, [...] "Who You Are", earned Jessie a fourth top-ten hit in December 2011, when it peaked at number eight. A non-album single, [...] "Domino", was released in some territories, peaking at number three in New Zealand, number five in Australia and became her first top ten single on the Billboard Hot 100; peaking at number six. The track was later included on the repackaged edition <b>of</b> <b>Who</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> in the UK and was released as the sixth single and became her second number-one single in the UK in January 2012. A seventh single, [...] "LaserLight" [...] taken from the platinum edition of the album it was released in May 2012; reaching the top ten in the UK and Ireland.
