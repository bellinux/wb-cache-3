The Court argued that any permanent physical presence destroyed the property owner's right to exclude, long {{recognized as one of}} the key rights in the [...] "bundle of rights" [...] commonly characterized as property. The Court considered a New York statute which required landlords to install CATV cable facilities on the roof of their buildings; the facilities were part of a citywide cable network designed to bring cable services to the entire city. The landlords were required to provide a location for 6 ft of cable one-half inch in diameter and two 4" [...] x 4" [...] x 4" [...] metal boxes at a <b>one-time</b> <b>charge</b> determined by the Cable Commission at $1. The City argued that the Court should apply a balancing test—that the invasion of property was minimal in comparison to the community wide benefit.

In short, when the [...] "character of the governmental action," [...] is a permanent physical occupation of property, our cases uniformly have found a taking to the extent of the occupation, without regard to whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner.|$|E
40|$|Gorsuch Kirgis, LLCAs growth {{pressures}} increase, and {{the cost}} of infrastructure associated with new development also increases, local governments are considering various alternative sources of revenue to "pay for growth. " New development creates a need for new roads, schools, parks, fire and police protection, and sewer and water treatment facilities, to name the most common. In Colorado, this situation is particularly acute because various constitutional and statutory restrictions limit the flexibility of municipalities to increase revenue from taxes, and to spend revenue already collected. Also, levels of federal funding for infrastructure have been gradually reduced over time. Various methods of financing the costs of growth are available to municipalities, including various types oftaxes, exactions and dedication requirements, negotiated developer agreements, and annexation agreements. This publication deals only with impact fees. In considering how to finance needed infrastructure, a municipality should consider all the options available to it. II.

They are usually applied {{at the time a}} building permit is issued and are dedicated to provision of additional services, such as water and sewer systems, roads, schools, libraries, and parks and recreation facilities, made necessary by the presence of new residents in the area. The funds collected cannot be used for operation, maintenance, repair, alteration, or replacement of existing capital facilities and cannot just be added to general revenue. They are essentially user fees levied in anticipation of use, expanding the capacity of existing services to handle additional demand. The amount of the fee must be clearly linked to the added service cost, not some arbitrary amount. There are two basic approaches to setting impact fees — the average-cost pricing method that sets a flat connection fee an...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether the choice of {{accounting}} treatment of transition obligation under SFAS 106 affects the value of firms, and also whether the quality of earnings is improved after the implementation of SFAS 106. Design/methodology/approach – Different regression models were employed on a sample of 50 immediate recognition firms and 50 matched prospective recognition firms. Chow test is also used to investigate the quality of earnings before and after the implementation of SFAS 106. Findings – In spite of the significant difference in impact on earnings from the choice of treatment of transition obligation, the accounting choice has no significant impact on the total value relevance of earnings and book value. When immediate recognition method is applied, investors ignore the <b>one-time</b> <b>charge</b> of transition obligation, and rely more on book value in the valuation of a firm. However, when prospective recognition method is applied, both earnings and book value are value-relevant in the adoption year and also in the subsequent year. In addition, the paper finds that the implementation of SFAS 106 improves the value relevance of earnings. Research limitations/implications – Results are limited by the accuracy of the models used to measure value relevance of earnings and book value of equity. Practical implications – Results may have implications for managers' choice of accounting treatment, and the evidence seems to support accrual basis over cash basis on earnings measurement. Originality/value – The paper uses the value relevance approach to analyze the impact of SFAS 106 on the quality of earnings and book value of equity.

40|$|Impact {{fees are}} <b>one-time</b> <b>charges</b> applied to new development. Impact fees are {{a form of}} land-use {{regulation}} designed to assure that communities maintain adequate levels of public facilities {{in the face of}} growth. The resulting revenue generated for the construction or expansion of new facilities is coincidental to their land-use regulatory (i. e. police power) purpose. Were it not for growth many communities would have adequate public facilities and often if growth is at a manageable pace adequate public facilities can be provided concurrent with the impacts of growth. To assure adequate public facilities, impact fees are assessed and dedicated principally for the provision of additional water and sewer systems, schools, libraries, parks and recreation facilities, and other infrastructure made necessary by the presence of new residents in the area. The funds collected cannot be used for operation and maintenance, repair, alteration, or replacement of capital facilities. As will be noted, impact fees are not the best way in which to finance most public facilities from a variety of theoretical perspectives and instead taxes are. However, {{in the absence of the}} legal or political ability to raise taxes combined with a desire to maintain level-of-service quality in their communities, elected officials may see impact fees as a pragmatic solution...|$|R

This enables applications such as smart buildings and highways, environment monitoring, user interfaces, entertainment, factory automation, and robotics [1]. While the aggregate system processes large amounts of data, individual nodes participate in a small fraction only (typical data rates < 1 Kbit/sec).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic {{appendicectomy}} though widely practiced has not gained universal approval. Laparoscopic appendicectomy in India {{is relatively}} new and the literature is scant. This study was aimed to compare laparoscopic with open appendicectomy and ascertain the therapeutic benefit, if any, in the overall management of acute appendicitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of two hundred and seventy nine patients suffering from acute appendicitis. One hundred patients underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA) and one hundred seventy nine patients underwent open appendecectomy (OA). Comparison was based on length of hospital stay, operating time, postoperative morbidity, duration of convalescence and operative cost {{in terms of their}} medians. The Mann-Whitney statistics (T) were calculated and because of large samples, the normal deviate test (Z) was used. RESULTS: Of the hundred patients, six patients (6 &#x 0025;) had the procedure converted to open surgery. The rate of infections and overall complications (LA: 15 &#x 0025;, OA: 31. 8 &#x 0025;, P < 0. 001) were significantly lower in patients undergoing LA. The median length of stay was significantly shorter after LA (3 days after LA, 5 days after OA, P < 0. 0001) than after OA. The operating time was shorter {OA: 25 min (median), LA: 28 min (median), 0. 01 < P < 0. 05 } in patients undergoing open appendicectomy compared to laparoscopic appendicectomy.
