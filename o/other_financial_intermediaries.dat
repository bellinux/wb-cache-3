40|$|How do banks {{operate and}} where does the money supply come from? The {{financial}} crisis has heightened awareness that these questions have been unduly neglected by many researchers. During the past century, three different theories of banking were dominant at different times: (1) The currently prevalent financial intermediation theory of banking says that banks collect deposits and then lend these out, just like <b>other</b> non-bank <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> (2) The older fractional reserve theory of banking says that each individual bank is a <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> without the power to create money, but the banking system collectively is able to create money {{through the process of}} ‘multiple deposit expansion’ (the ‘money multiplier’). (3) The credit creation theory of banking, predominant a century ago, does not consider banks as <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> that gather deposits to lend out, but instead argues that each individual bank creates credit and money newly when granting a bank loan. The theories differ in their accounting treatment of bank lending as well as in their policy implications. Since according to the dominant financial intermediation theory banks are virtually identical with <b>other</b> non-bank <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> they are not usually included in the economic models used in economics or by central bankers. Moreover, the theory of banks as intermediaries provides the rationale for capital adequacy-based bank regulation. Should this theory not be correct, currently prevailing economics modelling and policy-making would be without empirical foundation. Despite the importance of this question, so far only one empirical test of the three theories has been reported in learned journals. This paper presents a second empirical test, using an alternative methodology, which allows control for all <b>other</b> factors. The <b>financial</b> intermediation and the fractional reserve theories of banking are rejected by the evidence. This finding throws doubt on the rationale for regulating bank capital adequacy to avoid banking crises, as the case study of Credit Suisse during the crisis illustrates. The finding indicates that advice to encourage developing countries to borrow from abroad is misguided. The question is considered why the economics profession has failed over most of the past century to make any progress concerning knowledge of the monetary system, and why it instead moved ever further away from the truth as already recognised by the credit creation theory well over a century ago. The role of conflicts of interest and interested parties in shaping the current bank-free academic consensus is discussed. A number of avenues for needed further research are indicate...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Reserve is {{responsible}} for the prudential supervision of bank holding companies (BHCs) on a consolidated basis.

50|$|The {{stock market}} crash on Black Tuesday and {{subsequent}} economic turmoil reified the formerly abstract risks endemic to the 1920s mortgage market: borrowers {{could no longer afford}} even moderate monthly payments and the recompense afforded by foreclosure on a lien did little to ameliorate many institutions' financial standing: between 1928 and 1933, home prices declined by nearly 30%, including an annual dip of 10.5% in 1932. As a result, many intermediaries failed, particularly S&Ls which had been operating their own Philadelphia Plans - issuing both the balloon and amortizing mortgages - the latter under a share accumulation loan plan whereby borrowers were required to buy shares in the S&L each period until their holdings were at par with the amortizing loan principal at which point the debt was canceled. Default increased effective loan balances for remaining borrowers by reducing the value of the sinking fund, further incentivizing default by other borrowers, and many S&Ls were forced to liquidate their holdings in whole - some 5,000 throughout the 1930s. While somewhat more muted because they were not subject to the woes of a share accumulation plan, <b>other</b> major <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> experienced a similar plight.|$|R

5000|$|The {{details of}} the LDF are {{outlined}} in a ‘’Memorandum of Understanding’’ between the Liechtenstein authorities and HMRC. Under the agreement, Liechtenstein banks and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> are required to identify ‘relevant persons’ (i.e. accounts with UK addresses which might have UK tax liability) and contact them about their tax affairs. These ‘relevant persons’ must then register with HMRC that they wish to use the LDF and provide their financial institution with a relevant certificate. But for those with assets already in Liechtenstein or who create a ‘footprint’ in the country, disclosure can be made voluntarily without prior contact from a financial institution. This means those who have undeclared assets in another offshore jurisdiction can bring that account within {{the terms of the}} LDF by opening a new account in Liechtenstein. [...] Once registered under the LDF, an individual has up to 10 months to complete their disclosure to HMRC. Tax liabilities declared under the LDF only need to cover the timeframe after 6 April 1999 rather than the standard 20 year assessment period. Furthermore, when under a tax investigation, an individual could be exposed to 20 years of back taxes plus interest, a potential 100 per cent penalty or criminal prosecution. However, under the LDF, there is normally only a 10 per cent penalty as well as assurance that no criminal investigation will be initiated.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model in}} which investors cannot remain in the market to trade at all times. As a result they {{have an incentive to}} set up trading firms (<b>financial</b> market <b>intermediaries)</b> to take over their portfolio while they engage in other activities. Previous research has assumed that such firms act like individuals endowed with a utility function. Here, as in reality, they are firms that simply take orders from their investors. From this setting emerges a theory of mutual funds. Many of the model’s results adhere to past empirical findings, while others are tested and verified here. Among the paper’s conclusions: (1) Mutual funds outnumber traded securities. (2) Mutual funds have a number of objective functions which lead to observably different trading styles. (3) Adding mutual funds to the economy makes stock prices more volatile. (4) Adding mutual funds does not impact the risk premium. (5) There are incentives for funds that trade on market fundamentals to “spread out ” in strategy space. This produces divergent trading styles that investors who are not currently active in the market can use to better hedge out the risks they face. Several empirical tests are shown to support the primary hypotheses.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} the design and experience of risk-based pension fund supervision in several countries that have been leaders in the development of these methods. The utilization of risk-based methods originates primarily in the supervision of banks. In recent years it has increasingly been extended to <b>other</b> types of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> including pension funds and insurers. The trend toward risk-based supervision of pensions is closely associated with movement toward the integration of pension supervision with that of banking and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> services into a single national authority. Although similar in concept to the techniques developed in banking, the application to pension funds has required modifications, particularly for defined contribution funds that transfer investment risk to fund members. The countries examined provide a range of experiences that illustrate both the diversity of pension systems and approaches to risk-based supervision, but also a commonality of the focus on sound risk management and effective supervisory outcomes.

When the conception of a financial system is based only on banks and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> institution (IFS, 2008), mobile banking has a negative incidence on traditional <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> dynamics of depth, activity and size.

They are committed to the continued implementation of its sound strategic programs. It focuses on creating a culture that places importance on profitability and success. Credit procedure of Mercantile Bank is a vast method where every parts of credit department is important but lending is the heart of credit procedure. Lending comprises a very large portion of bank’s total activities. Sound lending practice therefore, is very important for profitability and success of a bank. Like <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary,</b> commercial banks also intermediate between the savers and borrowers to mobilize the financial surplus of the savers and allocate these savings to the creditworthy borrowers of different sectors of the economy.
