5|$|When the helium is exhausted, the Sun {{will repeat}} the {{expansion}} it followed when the hydrogen {{in the core}} was exhausted, except that this time it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity {{to as much as}} 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU. According to a 2008 model, Earth's orbit is shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower chromosphere), so that it will be engulfed by the Sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase, 1 and 3.8 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate. Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars {{at the tip of the}} asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius. For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula. By the end of that phase – lasting approximately 500,000 years – the Sun will <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> half of its current mass.|$|E

50|$|The old town’s Net Shops - {{approximately}} 50 black wooden sheds {{standing in}} neat rows on a shingle beach are unique.

5000|$|T. lineata often {{occurs on}} rocks that are encrusted by coralline algae; presumably {{this is what}} their {{coloration}} is intended to camouflage against. If knocked from its substrate, T. lineata will contract into a ball {{in order to protect}} its vulnerable ventral side, similar to many isopods. Coralline algae are also the major food item of T. lineata. On the Oregon coast this species can be found living under purple urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). This species is predated on by the sea stars Pisaster ochraceus and Leptasterias haxactis. [...] Animals out of water <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> 73% the respiration of submerged animals, and likely incur an oxygen debt while out of water that must be repaid once resubmerged.

5000|$|As car {{technology}} improves, more features will {{be added}} to cars and these features will most likely distract a driver. Voice commands for cars, according to CNET, should allow a driver to issue commands and not be distracted.

[...] Most speech recognition software on the market today <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> 50 to 60 voice commands, but Ford Sync has 10,000. However, CNET suggest that even 10,000 voice commands is not sufficient given the complexity and the variety of tasks a user may want to do while driving. Voice command for cars is different from voice command for mobile phones and for computers because a driver may use the feature to look for nearby restaurants, look for gas, driving directions, road conditions, and the location of the nearest hotel. Currently, technology allows a driver to issue voice commands on both a portable GPS like a Garmin and a car manufacturer navigation system.|$|E
