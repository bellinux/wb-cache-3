40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze a proper strategy in developing the derivative product in Bank "XYZ". The derivative product sold to customer of Bank "XYZ" is basically aimed as the hedging tool against <b>outstanding</b> <b>transaction</b> of the customer. Therefore, the derivative product entered into by and between Bank "XYZ and the customer should have underlying transaction as the basis. The derivative product itself was develop and modified since 1973 by Fisher Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton. news paper on derivative product mainly highlight the business capability and activity of the derivative product which currently become a trend, lie currency forward and currency swap, including to analyze other derivative product such as currency option, interest rate swap and other matters. In addition, the strategic analysis against this derivative product is determined by each product by using matrix IFEEFE, matrix IE, and matrix GE. Data and questioner being adopted is taken from Treasury Bank "XYZ, data from several other bank, interviewing with related managers, interviewing with some customers, and exacting various sources for completing this thesis. The data and questioner is then processed {{in accordance with the}} interest and use of the matrix, namely matrix GE for analyzing portfolio strategy and matrix IFE/EFE and matrix IE for analyzing internal external environment. The result is through matrix GE, derivative product position at selective growth, and through IE, position of the company is in quadrant V (hold and maintain). Analysis of matrix GE for projection of 5 years ahead shall be at the position of selective growth aggressive investment and maximum investment. ...|$|R
50|$|The more {{important}} use of netting is close-out netting under Section 6(e) of the ISDA Master Agreement. Pursuant to this section, when an ISDA Master Agreement (or, more accurately the <b>outstanding</b> <b>Transactions</b> under it) is terminated (normally following a credit event of some kind), {{the value of}} each of the Terminated Transactions is assessed (there are several ways this can be done, but the most usual measure is to determine how much it would cost for a party to enter into a Transaction having commercial terms identical to the Terminated Transaction with an independent third party - this is called the Settlement Amount) and converted into the Termination Currency (which should have been specified in the schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement) and any outstanding Unpaid Amounts are taken into account. The Settlement Amounts (which may be positive or negative depending which party is 'in-the-money' with respect to a particular Terminated Transaction) and unpaid amounts (again positive or negative, depending on who owes them) are added up and a single figure in the Termination Currency is determined payable by one party or the other. The enforcability of the close-out netting provisions is absolutely vital to financial institutions active in the derivatives market since the ability to net allows them to allocate capital only against the net figure they would have to pay on close-out of an ISDA Master Agreement rather than the gross amount. ISDA has obtained legal opinions from all important jurisdictions confirming the effectiveness of the close-out netting provisions in those jurisdictions. Members of ISDA are entitled to rely on these opinions.|$|E
5000|$|However, since {{database}} systems schedule their transactions independently, it {{is possible}} that the transactions' precedence orders in two databases or more are not compatible (no global partial order exists that can embed the respective local partial orders together). With CO precedence orders are also the commitment orders. When participating databases in a same distributed transaction do not have compatible local precedence orders for that transaction (without [...] "knowing" [...] it; typically no coordination between database systems exists on conflicts, since the needed communication is massive and unacceptably degrades performance) it means that the transaction resides on a global cycle (involving two or more databases) in the global conflict graph. In this case the atomic commitment protocol will fail to collect all the votes needed to commit that transaction: By the vote ordering strategy above at least one database will delay its vote for that transaction indefinitely, to comply with its own commitment (precedence) order, since it will be waiting to the completion of another, preceding transaction on that global cycle, delayed indefinitely by another database with a different order. This means a voting-deadlock situation involving the databases on that cycle.As a result, the protocol will eventually abort some deadlocked transaction on this global cycle, since each such transaction is missing at least one participant's vote. Selection of the specific transaction on the cycle to be aborted depends on the atomic commitment protocol's abort policies (a timeout mechanism is common, but it may result in more than one needed abort per cycle; both preventing unnecessary aborts and abort time shortening can be achieved by a dedicated abort mechanism for CO). Such abort will break the global cycle involving that distributed transaction. Both deadlocked transactions and possibly other in conflict with the deadlocked (and thus blocked) will be free to be voted on. It is worthwhile noting that each database involved with the voting-deadlock continues to vote regularly on transactions that are not in conflict with its deadlocked transaction, typically almost all the <b>outstanding</b> <b>transactions.</b> Thus, in case of incompatible local (partial) commitment orders, no action is needed since the atomic commitment protocol resolves it automatically by aborting a transaction that is a cause of incompatibility. This means that the above vote ordering strategy is also a sufficient condition for guaranteeing Global CO.|$|E

50|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of the ISDA Master Agreement is that the Master Agreement and all the Confirmations entered into under it form a single agreement. This is very important (especially for regulated financial companies) as it allows the parties to an ISDA Master Agreement to aggregate the amounts owing by each of them under all of the <b>Transactions</b> <b>outstanding</b> under that ISDA Master Agreement and replace them with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. Netting, dealt with under section 2(c) of the ISDA Master Agreement, allows the parties to net out amounts payable on the same day and in the same currency.|$|R

Like database systems, it has to process transactions and guarantee database consistency using a concurrency control algorithm. Furthermore, it has to operate in real-time, satisfying time constraints on each transaction [1]. Mena [8] classified concurrency control algorithms into optimistic and pessimistic algorithms.

40|$|As {{multiprocessor}} sizes {{scale and}} computer architects turn to interconnection networks with non-uniform communication latencies, {{the lure of}} exploiting communication locality to increase performance becomes inevitable. Models that accurately quantify locality effects provide invaluable insight into the importance of exploiting locality as machine sizes and features change. This paper presents a framework for modeling the impact of communication locality on system performance. The framework provides a means for combining simple models of application, processor, and network behavior to obtain a combined model that accurately reflects feedback effects between processors and networks. We introduce a model that characterizes application behavior with three parameters that capture computation grain, sensitivity to communication latency, and amount of locality present at execution time. The combined model is validated with measurements taken from a detailed simulator for a complete multiprocessor system. Using the combined model, we show that exploiting communication locality provides gains which are at most linear in the factor by which average communication distance is reduced {{when the number of}} <b>outstanding</b> communication <b>transactions</b> per processor is bounded. The combined model is also used to obtain rough upper bounds on the performance improvement from exploiting locality to minimize communication distance. ...|$|R

3000|$|The {{continuous}} auction form is {{that used}} in stock exchanges. While {{the stock exchange}} is open for trading, participants may place their bids, that is [...] "orders," [...] for a certain stock. In the case, a newly arriving order matches existing <b>outstanding</b> orders, a <b>transaction</b> will immediately occur. In consequence, the newly formed price has to be announced to all market participants. And of course, each participant is allowed to place an arbitrary number of orders during a trading day and naturally on every day that specific stock is traded. For shares, these can be decades for which a company is listed. Comparing this {{to the situation in}} resource trading, we could identify transmission resources for a certain market level, market location, and transmission period as a different stock. However, we assume traffic estimations to be most accurate immediately before the actual transmission time. But only when demand can be reliably estimated, a possible price for bidding can be evaluated by the operators. Hence, it is not favorable to trade transmission rights lying far in the future for a long market opening continuously. This {{goes hand in hand with}} the signaling overhead. Buying and selling short-term local resources in a long-term open market causes an unacceptable high signaling effort that is not deterministic, as resources may repeatedly be bought and sold again and again even by the same operators. As stated before, it is desirable to have the auctions as short before actual transmission frames as possible. It does not make much sense to have an open market for the resources of certain, perhaps fine-granular, frame which is of longer duration than the transmission frame itself since accurate traffic estimations and thus reasonable bidding are only possible in the very short time before a frame starts. In our model, longer-term traffic estimations are addressed by the higher hierarchies of hierarchical spectrum trading concept.|$|R
