5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} I just stood up and I kind of walked into the <b>other</b> <b>room</b> as if I was in a tractor beam and stood {{there in front of}} the stereo.

The tattoo begins to talk again, convincing Ed to redial Scully's last call to see who she was {{speaking}} to. An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E

25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents in the <b>other</b> <b>room</b> that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of}} the bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the <b>other</b> <b>room.</b> I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E

25|$|The room number 217 {{has been}} changed to 237. Timberline Lodge, located on Mt. Hood in Oregon, {{was used for the}} {{exterior}} shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel. The Lodge requested that Kubrick not depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in The Shining, because future guests at the Lodge might be afraid to stay there, and a nonexistent room, 237, was substituted in the film. Contrary to the hotel's expectations, Room 217 is requested more often than any <b>other</b> <b>room</b> at Timberline.|$|E

The <b>other</b> <b>room</b> has scenes from the Parable of the Good Samaritan, Lucretia, Saint Jerome and Mary Magdalene. The original use of this suite of rooms is unknown.

500|$|Unanimously {{approved}} by music critics, [...] "Almost Blue" [...] was noted {{for being a}} highlight on Imperial Bedroom; Emerick's production on the track was also singled out by reviewers, who acclaimed his [...] "aftermath" [...] approach towards its composition.

[...] Red silk indicated a trained bird and blue silk indicated a partially trained bird. [...] Trained swallows were allowed to roam outside their cages, while the others remained caged at all times. [...] Untrained birds were sold as pets.|$|E

It was going to be John making a {{political}} statement, but a very commercial one as well ... I always thought that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem." [...] Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: [...] "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like thatâ€” and Phil will just sit in the <b>other</b> <b>room</b> and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'...

Both Krall and Tommy LiPuma produced the track, which is over a minute longer than Costello's original rendition. An accompanying music video to Krall's version was created and released in 2004, and eventually uploaded onto her official Vevo account on October 6, 2009. The visual was selected by the singer to appear on her greatest hits album, The Very Best of Diana Krall, in 2007. In her review of the video's inclusion on the aforementioned album, Shackleton mentioned the [...] "wintry outdoor scenes from Diana's native Vancouver Island" [...] as a highlight.|$|E
5000|$|Truman Capote {{began writing}} the {{manuscript}} for <b>Other</b> Voices, <b>Other</b> <b>Rooms</b> after being {{inspired by a}} walk in the woods while he was living in Monroeville, Alabama. He immediately cast aside his rough manuscript for Summer Crossing and took up writing <b>Other</b> Voices, <b>Other</b> <b>Rooms.</b> After leaving Alabama, he continued to work on the manuscript in New Orleans, Louisiana. His budding literary fame put him in touch with fellow southerner and writer Carson McCullers. Capote joined McCullers at the artists' community, Yaddo, in Saratoga Springs, New York to continue working on his novel. As friends, McCullers helped Capote locate an agent and a publisher (Marion Ives and Random House) for <b>Other</b> Voices, <b>Other</b> <b>Rooms.</b> Capote continued to work on the novel in North Carolina and eventually completed it in a rented cottage in Nantucket, Massachusetts.

500|$|In {{the centre}} of the first floor is the Oak Hall, {{so-called}} because of the oaks formerly growing {{on the site of the}} new hall. [...] It contains a mahogany four-flight staircase. [...] The staircase has triple ballusters, and was carved by Shillito. [...] Afain the plasterwork is by Oliver. [...] More family portraits hang on its walls and the hall's contents include a hobby horse, a man trap, and an 18th-century sedan chair. Also in the hall is a memorial display for Tabley House School. [...] The <b>other</b> <b>room</b> on the north side of the house is known as the Marble Hall.

500|$|Recording of {{the song}} started in September 1990 at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. The song was {{arranged}} {{in the studio with}} mandolin, electric bass, and drums. Bassist Mike Mills came up with a bassline inspired by the work of Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie; by his own admission he could not come up with one for the song that was not derivative. Buck said the arrangement {{of the song}} [...] "had a hollow feel to it. There's absolutely no midrange on it, just low end and high end, because Mike usually stayed pretty low on the bass." [...] The band decided to have touring guitarist Peter Holsapple play acoustic guitar on the recording. Buck reflected, [...] "It was really cool: Peter and I would be in our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there in the <b>other</b> <b>room</b> going at it. It just had a really magical feel." [...] Singer Michael Stipe's vocal was recorded in a single take. Orchestral strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were added to the song by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in October 1990.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the incident, Nicholson was out of town making a film, but his steady girlfriend, actress Anjelica Huston, had dropped by unannounced to pick up some items.

According to Lanois, [...] "I said, 'That sounded pretty cool,' so we listened back and I said, 'Jesus it's better than I thought.'" [...] The Edge immediately recorded an Infinite Guitar part in two takes. The band considers the song's recording {{to be one of the}} album sessions' breakthrough moments, as it was recorded amidst concerns that they had run out of ideas.|$|E
