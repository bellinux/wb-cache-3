5|$|When the {{requirement}} for the Apache had been formalised in the early 1990s, military doctrine assumed that a large conventional armoured assault from the Eastern Bloc was Britain's main threat. Following the collapse and break-up of the Soviet Union, the concepts <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> and rapid response took precedence. The UK's Strategic Defence Review called for Apaches to undertake amphibious attack missions, operating from the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, the Invincible class aircraft carriers and their successors, the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, and possibly the amphibious assault vessels HMS Bulwark and Albion. Each squadron equipped with the Apache should have eight operational aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of the jaw {{structure}} of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 2004, 2009) {{suggests that the}} animal was capable of quick bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites {{are more important than}} strong bites when capturing small prey, as shown by studies of modern-day crocodiles. These researchers also noted a high degree <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> (kinesis) within the skull and especially the lower jaw, somewhat similar to modern snakes. Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed Carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole. In addition, the front part of the lower jaw was hinged, and thus able to move up and down. When pressed downwards, the teeth would have projected forward, allowing Carnotaurus to spike small prey items; when the teeth were curved upwards, the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping. Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items. Carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey, but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Dispatch {{is notable}} {{for its use}} of, and the sole {{surviving}} remains of, Fell's Patent Knees. These were a patent innovation from 1839 by Jonathan Fell of Workington, Cumberland, and {{were part of the}} development of the iron and wood composite hull. Ships before this had been built from oak, where the strong curved brackets needed to join the deck into the hull side frames could be found as naturally grown 'knees' from the angles between major branches and the trunk. In the post-Nelsonic era there was a general shortage of shipbuilding timber, particularly oak, one of the few species with strong enough branch attachments to provide knees. Dispatch's hull is of pine, which has weak branches. A number of iron substitutes were developed, Fell's design being one of the later and more advanced forms. It had two advantages over earlier rigid-forged patterns: it provided a degree <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> in storms and, most significantly, could be stressed after the hull had been constructed and launched or even loaded, when the hull was under its working load. Together with the diagonal iron strapping, this rendered Dispatch's hull particularly strong and had allowed her to endure at least two collisions.|$|E

5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold on until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on the front edge but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} the concept <b>of</b> the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> design {{variables}} to Pareto-optimal solutions in Multi-Objective Optimization problems. In addition, we introduce {{a method for}} measurement <b>of</b> the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> design variables to Pareto-optimal solutions. Increases {{in the number of}} design variables usually result {{in a wide variety of}} optimum solutions. However, when the <b>flexibilities</b> <b>of</b> some design variables are small, the contributions of these design variables are also very small. This means that the same Pareto-optimal solutions can be derived without these parameters. Therefore, it is very important to find the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> the design variables to the Pareto-optimal solutions. To find the <b>flexibility,</b> the values <b>of</b> one of the design variables are changed, while those of the remaining parameters are fixed. In this procedure, it is very important to determine the fixed values. We describe these procedures to determine the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> the design variable to the Pareto-optimal solutions. Finally, we illustrate using the diesel engine fuel emission scheduling problem that the Paretooptimal solutions can be derived with only the design variables whose flexibilities are high. I...|$|R
40|$|Neuropsychological testing {{currently}} {{represents the}} gold standard in assessing cognitive flexibility. However, this format presents some challenges {{in terms of time}} and skills required for administration, scoring, and interpretation. Two self-report measures <b>of</b> cognitive <b>flexibility</b> have been developed to measure aspects <b>of</b> cognitive <b>flexibility</b> in everyday settings, although neither has been validated in an older sample. In this study, we investigated the psychometric properties of 2 self-report measures <b>of</b> cognitive <b>flexibility,</b> the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI; Dennis & Vander Wal, 2010) and the Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS; Martin & Rubin, 1995), against neuropsychological measures <b>of</b> cognitive <b>flexibility</b> in a clinical sample of 47 older adults with comorbid anxiety and depression and a nonclinical sample of 53 community-dwelling older adults. Internal consistency was good for the CFS and CFI in all samples. The clinical sample reported poorer cognitive flexibility than did the nonclinical sample on self-report measures and performed more poorly on some neuropsychological measures. There was evidence of convergent validity between the 2 self-report measures but little relationship between the self-report and neuropsychological measures <b>of</b> cognitive <b>flexibility,</b> suggesting that self-report measures assess a different aspect <b>of</b> cognitive <b>flexibility</b> than does neuropsychological testing. Divergent validity was weak from measures of anxiety and depression in the combined and nonclinical samples but acceptable in the clinical sample. Results suggest that these measures are suitable for use with an older adult sample but do not assess the same aspects <b>of</b> cognitive <b>flexibility</b> as are assessed by neuropsychological assessment. 7 page(s...|$|R
