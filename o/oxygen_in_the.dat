5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free <b>oxygen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|As a first {{approximation}} {{only the}} inert gasses {{are taken into}} account. For oxygen partial pressures above 2.4 bar, the quantity of oxygen dissolved in the arterial blood exceeds the amount that the body can use, and the hemoglobin is saturated with oxygen in both the veins and the arteries. If more oxygen is added, the partial pressure of <b>oxygen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> venous blood rises.|$|E
5|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon vapors and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. At {{the same time it}} decreases the upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. When the total concentration of <b>oxygen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.|$|E

5|$|Most {{computers}} {{require the}} diver {{to specify the}} mixture before the dive, but some allow the choice of mixture to be changed during the dive, which allows {{for the use of}} gas switching for accelerated decompression.

40|$|Sol-gel PZT {{thin-film}} capacitors with reactive sputtered RuOx electrodes were fabricated.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{emergence}} of these first multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in an event called the Cambrian explosion.

5|$|The blast {{furnaces}} {{used in the}} Imperial Smelting Process ("ISP") were developed from the standard lead blast furnace, but are fully sealed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{determine}} the effects of changes <b>in</b> posture on <b>oxygen</b> transfer at the mouth and pulmonary capillary membrane and to observe concomitant subtle changes in ventilation under specified assumptions. Breath-by-breath calculations are carried out with a box-balloon spirometer and mass spectrometer. Measurements are made before, during, and after passive tilt to 60 deg and on return to recumbency after 10 min erect. It is found that from supine to upright <b>oxygen</b> stores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lung increases rapidly and <b>oxygen</b> stores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood drops slowly, creating a net deficit <b>in</b> <b>oxygen</b> transfer at <b>the</b> mouth of 130 ml in 10 min. Changes <b>in</b> <b>oxygen</b> stores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood result from shifts in blood volume and flow more than from changes in cardiac output.

5|$|At night, {{the shallow}} reef {{platforms}} inhabited by the epaulette shark often become {{isolated from the}} ocean by the receding tide. The amount of dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pool can drop 80% or more overnight from the combined respiration of all the organisms within the pool. The epaulette shark has evolved to cope with these hypoxic conditions, being able to survive for over three hours in 5% of the atmospheric O2 level without losing behavioral responsiveness. In the laboratory, epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30°C (86°F), which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Free cobalt (the native metal) is {{not found}} on Earth because of <b>oxygen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{atmosphere}} and chlorine in the ocean.

5|$|Further {{problems}} with the environment arose when a vast algal bloom appeared in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee in 1986, the same year cattails were discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Scientists discovered that phosphorus, used as a fertilizer in the EAA, was flushed into canals and pumped back into the lake. When the lake drained, the phosphorus entered {{the water in the}} marshes, changing the nutrient levels. It kept periphyton from forming marl, one of two soils in the Everglades. The arrival of phosphorus allowed cattails to spread quickly. The cattails grew in dense mats—too thick for birds or alligators to nest in. It also dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> peat, promoted algae, and prohibited growth of native invertebrates {{on the bottom of the}} food chain.|$|E
5|$|In June 1933 Massey {{became an}} {{independent}} lecturer in Mathematical Physics at the Queen's University of Belfast. He {{was the only}} member of the department until R. A.

Frustrated with the tiresome and time-consuming process of calculation, he had his physics workshop superintendent, John Wylie, build him a small-scale differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations, for just £50.

5|$|In the {{indirect}} or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907°C (typically around 1000°C).
