5|$|The 1976 World Ice Hockey Championships in Katowice {{were the}} first to feature {{professionals}} although in the end <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> made use of the new rule, recalling eight pros from the Minnesota North Stars and Minnesota Fighting Saints. The first fully open World Championship was held in 1977 in Vienna, Austria, and saw the first participation of active Canadian NHL players, including two-time NHL MVP Phil Esposito. Sweden and Finland also augmented their rosters with a few NHL and WHA players. Many of the players on the Canadian team were not prepared for the tournament and were unfamiliar with the international game. The team finished fourth, losing both games to the Soviet Union by a combined score of 19–2. Czechoslovakia won gold, becoming the third team (after Canada and the Soviet Union) to win consecutive championships.|$|E
5|$|The battleships of {{the late}} 1880s, for {{instance}} the , were armoured with iron and steel compound armour. This was soon replaced with more effective case-hardened steel armour made using the Harvey process developed in the United States. First tested in 1891, Harvey armour was commonplace in ships laid down from 1893–1895. However, its reign was brief; in 1895, the German Kaiser Friedrich III pioneered the superior Krupp armour. Europe adopted Krupp plate within five years, and <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> persisted in using Harvey steel into the 20th century. The improving quality of armour plate meant that new ships could have better protection from a thinner and lighter armour belt; 12inches (305mm) of compound armour provided the same protection as just 7.5inches (190mm) of Harvey or 5.75inches (133mm) of Krupp.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Supreme Court can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E

25|$|During {{his tenure}} as Army Chief of Staff, Shinseki {{initiated}} an innovative but controversial plan to make the Army more strategically deployable and mobile in urban terrain by creating Stryker Interim-Force Brigade Combat Teams. He conceived a long term strategic plan for the Army dubbed Objective Force, which included a program he designed, Future Combat Systems. One other controversial plan that Shinseki implemented was the wearing of the black beret for all Army personnel. Prior to Shinseki implementing this policy, <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Army Rangers could wear the black beret. When the black beret was given to all soldiers and officers, the Rangers moved to the tan beret.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} first applied post World War II to the British Empire, the United States and the Soviet Union. However, {{after the end}} of World War II and the Suez Crisis in 1956, the United Kingdom's status as a superpower was greatly diminished, leaving just the United States and Soviet Union as superpowers. For the {{duration}} of the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union came to be generally regarded as the two remaining superpowers, dominating world affairs. At the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> appeared to fulfill the criteria of being a world superpower.|$|E

5000|$|According to Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, the UK had {{conducted}} a [...] "huge number of missions" [...] over Iraq by 13 December 2014, second <b>only</b> to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and {{five times as}} many as France. By 5 February 2015, the UK had contributed 6% of all coalition airstrikes in Iraq - a contribution second <b>only</b> to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> - which <b>the</b> Defence Select Committee described as [...] "modest".|$|R
25|$|The modest credit {{facilities}} of the IMF were clearly insufficient {{to deal with}} Western Europe's huge balance of payments deficits. The problem was further aggravated by the reaffirmation by the IMF Board of Governors in the provision in the Bretton Woods Articles of Agreement that the IMF could make loans only for current account deficits and not for capital and reconstruction purposes. <b>Only</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> contribution of $570 million was actually available for IBRD lending. In addition, because the only available market for IBRD bonds was the conservative Wall Street banking market, the IBRD was forced to adopt a conservative lending policy, granting loans only when repayment was assured. Given these problems, by 1947 the IMF and the IBRD themselves were admitting {{that they could not}} deal with the international monetary system's economic problems.|$|E
25|$|As for {{the reasons}} of Castillo in staying neutral, there are several {{interpretation}}s. One interpretation focuses on the Argentine tradition of neutrality. Others see Castillo as a nationalist, not being influenced by the power structure in Buenos Aires (since he was from Catamarca), so, {{with the support of}} the army, he could simply defy the pressure to join the Allies. A similar perspective considers instead that Castillo simply had no power to go against the wishes of the army, and if he declared war he would be deposed in a military coup. A third interpretation considers that <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> wanted Argentina to declare war, whereas the United Kingdom was benefited by Argentine neutrality because the country was able to supply the British with livestock. This interpretation, however, fails to acknowledge the constant requests to declare war from Anglophile factions. Most likely, it was a combination of the desires of the British diplomacy and the Argentine army, which prevailed over the pro-war factions.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani {{spoke in}} support of the removal of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The group was on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. They were placed on the list for killing six Americans in Iran during the 1970s and {{attempting}} to attack the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992. Giuliani, along with other former government officials and politicians Ed Rendell, R. James Woolsey, Porter Goss, Louis Freeh, Michael Mukasey, James L. Jones, Tom Ridge, and Howard Dean, were criticized for their involvement with the group. Some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals' speaking fees. Giuliani and others wrote an article for the conservative publication National Review stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization. They supported their position by pointing out that the United Kingdom and the European Union had already removed the group from their terrorism lists. They further assert that <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Iran still listed it as a terrorist group. However, Canada did not delist the group until December 2012.|$|E

[...] Although Asian players such as Matsui, Jeremy Lin, and Yuki Togashi had been the subject of racist comments in the past, Watanabe was yet to receive racial remarks in his first few years in the United States. Nevertheless, he stated, [...] "If they said something racist, I don't care." ...|$|E
