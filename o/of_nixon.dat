5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon <b>of</b> <b>Nixon</b> by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon <b>of</b> <b>Nixon.</b> In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{trust the}} American people had in him was rapidly and {{severely}} tarnished by his pardon <b>of</b> <b>Nixon.</b> Nonetheless, many grant in hindsight {{that he had}} respectably discharged with considerable dignity a great responsibility {{that he had not}} sought. His subsequent loss to Carter in 1976 has come to be seen as an honorable sacrifice he made for the nation.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the first}} wave of what would {{eventually}} be more than four million letters, telegrams, postcards, and phone calls had flooded into RNC headquarters and other political offices. While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any substantive issue, they still ran 75 to one in favor <b>of</b> <b>Nixon.</b> Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions {{to help pay for the}} cost of the broadcast; the RNC eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost. Newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from people seeking the RNC's address, while Western Union was caught off guard by Nixon's request that listeners wire the RNC, and had no extra help on hand. Checkers herself received enough dog food to last a year, and hundreds of collars, leashes, and toys.|$|E

50|$|A Richard Nixon mask is a mask {{with the}} {{likeness}} <b>of</b> Richard <b>Nixon.</b> These were commercially available and quite {{popular in the}} waning days <b>of</b> the <b>Nixon</b> Administration.

5|$|Post {{election}} {{polls showed}} that Humphrey lost the white vote with 38%, nine points behind Nixon, but won the nonwhite vote solidly, 85% to 12%, including 97% of African-Americans. African-Americans favored Humphrey {{because of his}} record on civil rights, and their desire to quickly end the war in Vietnam, where blacks were overrepresented. The racial divide in the election had widened since 1964, and was attributed to civil rights protests and race riots. Humphrey won 45% of the female vote, two points ahead <b>of</b> <b>Nixon,</b> but lost to the Republican among males, 41% to 43%. Voters with only a grade school education supported Humphrey 52% to 33% over Nixon, while Nixon won among both those with no higher education than high school (43% to 42%) and those who graduated from college (54% to 37%). Occupation demographics mirrored these numbers with manual-labor workers supporting Humphrey 50% to 37%, and with white-collar (47% to 41%) and professionals (56% to 34%) favoring Nixon. Humphrey won among young voters (under 30 years old) by 47% to 38%, and also edged Nixon among those between 30 and 49 years, with 44% to 41%. Nixon won among voters over 50 years, 47% to 41%. Catholics backed Humphrey with 59%, twelve points ahead <b>of</b> <b>Nixon,</b> but Protestants favored Nixon, 49% to 35%. Humphrey lost the Independent vote 31% to 44%, with 25% going to Wallace, and won a lower percentage among Democrats (74%) than Nixon won among Republicans (86%). This discrepancy {{was connected to the}} tough Democratic primary election that caused some former McCarthy, Kennedy or McGovern supporters to vote for Nixon or Wallace as a protest.|$|E
5|$|Through 1971, it was {{uncertain}} if Agnew would be retained {{on the ticket}} as Nixon sought a second term in 1972. Neither Nixon nor his aides were enamored of Agnew's independence and outspokenness, and were less than happy at Agnew's popularity among conservatives suspicious <b>of</b> <b>Nixon.</b> The President considered replacing him with Treasury Secretary John Connally, a Democrat and former Governor of Texas. For his part, Agnew was unhappy with many of Nixon's stances, especially in foreign policy, disliking Nixon's rapprochement with China (on which Agnew was not consulted) and believing that the Vietnam War could be won with sufficient force. Even after Nixon announced his re-election bid {{at the start of}} 1972, it was unclear if Agnew would be his running mate, and it was not until July 21 that Nixon asked Agnew and the vice president accepted. A public announcement was made the following day.|$|E

25|$|Nixon and top {{administration}} officials discussed using government agencies to “get” (or retaliate against) those they perceived as hostile media organizations. The discussions had precedent. At {{the request of}} Nixon's White House in 1969, the FBI tapped the phones of five reporters. In 1971, the White House requested an audit of the tax return of the editor of Newsday, after he wrote {{a series of articles}} about the financial dealings of Charles “Bebe” Rebozo, a friend <b>of</b> <b>Nixon.</b>|$|E
25|$|The IBT {{endorsed}} Richard Nixon, the Republican Party's candidate, in {{his presidential}} reelection bid in 1972; in prior elections, the IBT union had supported Democratic Party nominees but had also endorsed Nixon in 1960.

It was alleged that a large sum of money, estimated to {{be as high as}} $1 million, was paid secretly to Nixon. Evidence was also alleged of a secret bribe paid in 1960.|$|E

25|$|Al Gore {{was unable}} to attend the table reads of the script, so Maurice LaMarche read his lines. He notes in the DVD {{commentary}} that Gore's daughter Kristin, who wrote for Futurama, was also at the table read, and he jokes that {{this was one of}} the highlights of his career. Additional voice roles in the episode include Tress MacNeille as Joan Rivers' preserved head in a jar and LaMarche as the headless body of Spiro Agnew. Billy West, who voices Nixon's head, says that his impression <b>of</b> <b>Nixon</b> is not meant to be an accurate impression but it intentionally plays up certain quirks and flaws. West also voices the C-3PO-esque robot which appears early in the Professor's flashback. He accomplished the voice effect by speaking into a coffee cup during the recording of the lines.|$|E
25|$|When {{president}} Lyndon B. Johnson {{took office}} in 1963, he found he was too large for the desk, and instead commissioned a plainer replacement which was built for him by the Senate cabinet shop. Richard Nixon, who succeeded Johnson in 1969, used the Wilson desk, the desk from the Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol, which he had used as Eisenhower's Vice President and believed {{to be that of}} former president Woodrow Wilson. Gerald Ford, who succeeded to the presidency in 1974 following the resignation <b>of</b> <b>Nixon,</b> used the Wilson desk throughout his term. Jimmy Carter, Ford's successor, brought the Resolute desk back to the Oval Office, where it remained until George H. W. Bush returned the Wilson desk to the Senate, preferring the C desk that he used while serving as Vice President during the Reagan Administration. Bill Clinton subsequently brought the Resolute desk back again to the Oval Office, where it has remained since.|$|E
25|$|The {{editors of}} The Chicago Tribune, a {{newspaper}} that had supported Nixon, wrote, “He is humorless {{to the point of}} being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal.” The Providence Journal wrote, “Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean.” This newspaper continued that, while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to Time magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the Western U.S. felt that while there remained a significant number <b>of</b> <b>Nixon</b> loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon should step down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in the transcripts.|$|E
