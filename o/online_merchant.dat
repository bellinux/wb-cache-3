Based on this, this study reviewed literature on challenges associated with internet fraud and best practices that can be adopted by <b>online</b> <b>merchants.</b> It was shown that the challenges are related to the use of improper theft and security measures by <b>online</b> <b>merchants,</b> the increase of mobile devices and lack of customer awareness of security risks in online transactions.
