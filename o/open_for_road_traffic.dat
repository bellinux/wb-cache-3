25|$|In 1946, {{concern was}} {{expressed}} in Parliament over {{the closing of}} the bridge to road traffic at peak times. The following year, the Manchester Ship Canal Company agreed that the bridge would generally stay <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> during rush hour, though this could not be guaranteed. A cargo vessel struck the bridge on 28 December 1948, restricting the bridge to single-line working and a two-ton weight limit until repairs had been completed. In 1953, traffic was banned from turning right off the bridge into Barton Road.|$|E
50|$|Rohtang Tunnel is {{a tunnel}} being built under the Rohtang Pass {{in the eastern}} Pir Panjal range of the Himalayas on the Leh-Manali Highway. With 8.8 km length, the tunnel {{will be one of}} the longest road tunnel in India (the longest road tunnel in India is the Chenani-Nashri Tunnel or Patnitop tunnel north of Udhampur) and is {{expected}} to reduce the distance between Manali and Keylong by about 60 km The tunnel is at 3100 m elevation whereas the Rohtang pass is at 3978 m elevation 51 km away from Manali. The pass receives heavy snowfall and blizzards during winter months and is <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> for only four months in a year. Lying on the Manali-Leh axis, this is one of the two routes to Ladakh. The other route through the Zoji La pass on the Srinagar-Drass-Kargil-Leh highway also gets blocked by snow for nearly four months in a year. These two routes are vital to feed military supplies into the sub-sector west (facing Aksai Chin) and the Siachen Glacier.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, {{the bridge}} was {{originally}} intended {{to be just a}} railway bridge but later it was <b>opened</b> <b>for</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic,</b> too. Today, it has two lanes in both directions <b>for</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic,</b> and even though it was designed to have two rail tracks as well, at the moment there is only one rail track on the bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{causeway}} {{was designed}} by Pasquale Lucchini, a self-taught Ticinese civil engineer, who arranged for large quantities of rock to be dumped {{on top of the}} moraine to create the causeway. The causeway was built between 1841 and 1847, and <b>opened</b> <b>for</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> in 1848. The railway was added to the causeway in 1872, and the motorway in 1980.|$|R
50|$|A new {{bridge is}} {{built over the}} Bharathappuzha that connects Pallippuram and Trithala called Velliyamkallu {{regulator}}-cum-bridge. The regulator-cum-bridge was officially <b>opened</b> <b>for</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> on 2 September 2007, and is the largest such project over Bharathappuzha. A river-water regulator is also {{an integral part of}} the Velliamkallu project. When operational, this regulator is expected to help irrigate the region’s agricultural areas, which often lacks proper water supply.|$|R
50|$|Work {{started on}} a road rail bridge over the Waikato River, with three 120 ft spans late in 1874. Cylinders for the piers were {{delivered}} in 1875 and the first {{was put in place}} on 24 June 1875. The bridge was said to be near completion in April 1876, and a test train was run over it and it <b>opened</b> <b>for</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> in December 1876. However, it wasn't reported as finished until 1877, the year of a permanent way contract for the 30 miles from Mercer for £16,832. The bridge, like the station, <b>opened</b> <b>for</b> rail traffic on 13 August 1877.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1272 and was {{destroyed}} several times (1570, 1633, 1678). The current bridge was completed in 1700. Originally a road bridge, the bridge is now only <b>open</b> <b>for</b> pedestrians since the Fridolinsbrücke (Swiss: Rheinbrücke Stein) was <b>opened</b> in 1979 <b>for</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R

As trains became longer they needed longer platforms. This device allowed the platforms to be extended across the adjacent level crossing. The moveable platform sections could be swung to one side to <b>open</b> the <b>road</b> <b>for</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 25 September 2012, Capital Development Authority is {{targeting}} to <b>open</b> the <b>road</b> <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> by mid of 2013. A CDA {{official told}} ‘The New’ on Monday that {{the width of}} the Margalla Avenue has been squeezed to half from 600 feet owing to non-acquisition of land for the project. [...] "The project could have been delayed had we waited for acquisition of remaining land for the avenue," [...] the official said.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, the {{increased}} availability of high resolution remote sensing imagery has <b>opened</b> new opportunities <b>for</b> <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> monitoring applications. Vehicle detection from satellite images has a potential ability to cover large geographical areas and can provide valuable additional information to traditional ground based counting equipment. However, shadows cast from trees and other vegetation growing {{along the side of}} the road cause challenges since it can be confused with dark vehicles during classification. As the intensity properties of dark vehicles and vegetation shadow segments are visually inseparable in the panchromatic image, their separation must be exclusively based on shape and context. We first present a method for extraction of dark regions corresponding to potential shadows by the use of contextual information from a vegetation mask and road vector data. Then we propose an algorithm for separating vehicles from shadows by analyzing the curvature properties of the dark regions. The extracted segments are then carried on to the classification stage of the vehicle detection processing chain. The algorithm is evaluated on Quickbird panchromatic satellite images with 0. 6 m resolution. The results show that we are able to detected vehicles that are fully connected with the cast shadow, and at the same time ignore false detections from tree shadows. The performance evaluation shows that we are able to obtain a detection rate as high as 94. 5 %, and a false alarm rate as low as 6 %. ...|$|R
