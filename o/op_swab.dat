40|$|BackgroundMany acute {{respiratory}} illness surveillance systems collect and test nasopharyngeal (NP) and/or oropharyngeal (<b>OP)</b> <b>swab</b> specimens, yet there are few studies assessing the relative measures of performance for NP versus OP specimens. MethodsWe collected paired NP and OP swabs separately from pediatric and adult patients with influenza-like illness or severe acute {{respiratory illness}} at two respiratory surveillance sites in Kenya. The specimens were tested for eight respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} the CF pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae in OP cultures from healthy children. MethodsOropharyngeal (OP) swabs were collected from 100 healthy children ≤ 18 years of age undergoing a clinically indicated procedure. ResultsP. aeruginosa was isolated from the <b>OP</b> <b>swab</b> of one participant, S. aureus from 48 participants (including 4 methicillin-resistant) and H. influenzae from 47 participants. Cultures from 75 participants grew {{one or more of}} these organisms (55 grew one, 19 grew 2 and one grew 3 organisms). ConclusionP. aeruginosa is rarely recovered from the oropharynx of healthy children ≤ 18 years of age, while recovery of S. aureus and H. influenzae is common. It is important to understand what the “normal” prevalence of CF pathogens is in the oropharynx in order to aid interpretation of OP cultures in CF patients...|$|E
40|$|Background Despite recent {{advances}} in microbiological techniques, the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still not well described. We applied polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conventional methods to describe etiology of CAP in hospitalized adults and evaluated their respective diagnostic yields. Methods 267 CAP patients were enrolled consecutively over our 3 -year prospective study. Conventional methods (i. e., bacterial cultures, urinary antigen assays, serology) were combined with nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (<b>OP)</b> <b>swab</b> samples analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and by real-time PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and 12 types of respiratory viruses. Results Etiology was established in 167 (63 %) patients with 69 (26 %) patients having ≥ 1 copathogen. There were 75 (28 %) pure bacterial and 41 (15 %) pure viral infections, and 51 (19 %) viral–bacterial coinfections, resulting in 126 (47 %) patients with bacterial and 92 (34 %) patients with viral etiology. S. pneumoniae (30 %), influenza (15 %) and rhinovirus (12 %) were most commonly identified, typically with ≥ 1 copathogen. During winter and spring, viruses were detected more frequently (45 %, P=. 01) and usually in combination with bacteria (39 %). PCR improved diagnostic yield by 8 % in 64 cases with complete sampling (and by 15 % in all patients); 5 % for detection of bacteria; 19 % for viruses (P=. 04); and 16 % for detection of ≥ 1 copathogen. Etiology was established in 79 % of 43 antibiotic-naive patients with complete sampling. S. pneumoniae qPCR positive rate was significantly higher for <b>OP</b> <b>swab</b> compared to NP swab (P<. 001). Positive rates for serology {{were significantly higher than}} for real-time PCR in detecting B. pertussis (P=. 001) and influenza viruses (P<. 001). Conclusions Etiology could be established in 4 out of 5 CAP patients with the aid of PCR, particularly in diagnosing viral infections. S. pneumoniae and viruses were most frequently identified, usually with copathogens. Viral–bacterial coinfections were more common than pure infections during winter and spring; a finding we consider important in the proper management of CAP. When swabbing for qPCR detection of S. pneumoniae in adult CAP, OP appeared superior to NP, but this finding needs further confirmation.

40|$|Background Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the importance of DNA extraction methods for molecular detection of Staphylococcus, an important bacterial group in cystic fibrosis (CF). We sought to evaluate the effect of enzymatic digestion (EnzD) prior to DNA extraction on bacterial communities identified in sputum and oropharyngeal <b>swab</b> (<b>OP)</b> samples from patients with CF. Methods DNA from 81 samples (39 sputum and 42 OP) collected from 63 patients with CF was extracted in duplicate with and without EnzD. Bacterial communities were determined by rRNA gene sequencing, and measures of alpha and beta diversity were calculated. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) {{was used to assess}} differences at the community level and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were used to compare relative abundance (RA) of individual genera for paired samples with and without EnzD. Results Shannon Diversity Index (alpha-diversity) decreased in sputum and OP samples with the use of EnzD. Larger shifts in community composition were observed for OP samples (beta-diversity, measured by Morisita-Horn), whereas less change in communities was observed for sputum samples. The use of EnzD with <b>OP</b> <b>swabs</b> resulted in significant increase in RA for the genera Gemella (p <  0. 01), Streptococcus (p <  0. 01), and Rothia (p <  0. 01). Staphylococcus (p <  0. 01) was the only genus with a significant increase in RA from sputum, whereas the following genera decreased in RA with EnzD: Veillonella (p <  0. 01), Granulicatella (p <  0. 01), Prevotella (p <  0. 01), and Gemella (p =  0. 02). In OP samples, higher RA of Gram-positive taxa was associated with larger changes in microbial community composition. Discussion We show that the application of EnzD to CF airway samples, particularly <b>OP</b> <b>swabs,</b> results in differences in microbial communities detected by sequencing. Use of EnzD can result in large changes in bacterial community composition, and is particularly useful for detection of Staphylococcus in CF OP samples. The enhanced identification of Staphylococcus aureus is a strong indication to utilize EnzD in studies that use <b>OP</b> <b>swabs</b> to monitor CF airway communities...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is {{a common}} and {{significant}} pathogen in cystic fibrosis. We sought to determine if quantitative PCR (qPCR) and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing could provide a rapid, culture-independent approach to the identification of S. aureus airway infections. We examined the sensitivity and specificity of two qPCR assays, targeting the femA and 16 S rRNA gene, using culture as the gold standard. In addition, 16 S rRNA gene sequencing to identify S. aureus directly from airway samples was evaluated. DNA extraction was performed with and without prior enzymatic digestion. 87 samples [42 oropharyngeal (OP) and 45 expectorated sputum (ES) ] were analyzed. 59 samples (68 %) cultured positive for S. aureus. Using standard extraction techniques, sequencing had the highest sensitivity for S. aureus detection (85 %), followed by FemA qPCR (52 %) and 16 SrRNA qPCR (34 %). For all assays, sensitivity was higher from ES samples compared to <b>OP</b> <b>swabs.</b> Specificity of the qPCR assays was 100 %, but 21. 4 % for sequencing due to detection of S. aureus in low relative abundance from culture negative samples. Enzymatic digestion increased the sensitivity of qPCR assays, particularly for <b>OP</b> <b>swabs.</b> Sequencing had a high sensitivity for S. aureus, but low specificity. While femA qPCR had higher sensitivity than 16 S qPCR for detection of S. aureus, neither assay was as sensitive as sequencing. The significance of S. aureus detection with low relative abundance by sequencing in culture-negative specimens is not clear...|$|R

Positivity for a specific virus was defined as detection of viral nucleic acid in either swab. Results: Of 2, 331 paired NP/OP specimens, 1, 402 (60. 1 %) were positive {{for at least one}} virus, and 393 (16. 9 %) were positive for more than one virus. Overall, OP swabs were significantly more sensitive than NP swabs for adenovirus (72. 4 % vs. 57. 6 %, p, 0. 01) and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus (91. 2 % vs. 70. 4 %, p, 0. 01). NP specimens were more sensitive for influenza B virus (83. 3 % vs. 61. 5 %, p = 0. 02), parainfluenza virus 2 (85. 7 %, vs. 39. 3 %, p, 0. 01), and parainfluenza virus 3 (83. 9 % vs. 67. 4 %, p, 0. 01).

40|$|Chlamydia pneumoniae is an {{important}} respiratory pathogen recently associated with atherosclerosis and several other chronic diseases. Detection of C. pneumoniae is inconsistent, and standardized PCR assays are needed. Two real-time PCR assays specific for C. pneumoniae were developed by using the fluorescent dye-labeled TaqMan probe-based system. Oligonucleotide primers and probes were designed to target two variable domains of the ompA gene, VD 2 and VD 4. The limit of detection {{for each of the}} two PCR assays was 0. 001 inclusion-forming unit. Thirty-nine C. pneumoniae isolates obtained from widely distributed geographical areas were amplified by the VD 2 and VD 4 assays, producing the expected 108 - and 125 -bp amplification products, respectively. None of the C. trachomatis serovars, C. psittaci strains, other organisms, or human DNAs tested were amplified. The amplification results of the newly developed assays were compared to the results of culturing and two nested PCR assays, targeting the 16 S rRNA and ompA genes. The assays were compared by testing C. pneumoniae purified elementary bodies, animal tissues, 228 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) specimens, and 179 oropharyngeal (<b>OP)</b> <b>swab</b> specimens obtained from ischemic stroke patients or matched controls. The real-time VD 4 assay and one nested PCR each detected C. pneumoniae in a single, but different, PBMC specimen. Eleven of 179 OP specimens (6. 1 %) showed evidence of the presence of C. pneumoniae in one or more tests. The real-time VD 4 assay detected the most positive results of the five assays. We believe that this real-time PCR assay offers advantages over nested PCR assays and may improve the detection of C. pneumoniae in clinical specimens...|$|E

This poses substantial challenges to longitudinal study of paediatric airway microbiota. Non-invasive upper airway sampling is an alternative method for monitoring airway microbiota; however, there are limited data describing the relationship of such results with lung microbiota in young children. In this study, we compared {{the upper and lower}} airway microbiota in young children to determine whether non-invasive upper airway sampling procedures provide a reliable measure of either lung microbiota or clinically defined differences. Results The microbiota in oropharyngeal (<b>OP)</b> <b>swabs,</b> nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from 78 children (median age 2. 2 years) with and without lung disease were characterised using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.

40|$|Advances in {{the field}} of {{metagenomics}} using culture-independent methods of microbial identification have allowed characterization of rich and diverse communities of bacteria in the lungs of healthy humans, mice, dogs, sheep and pigs. These data challenge the long held belief that the lungs are sterile and microbial colonization is synonymous with pathology. Studies in humans and animals demonstrate differences in the composition of airway microbiota in health versus disease suggesting respiratory dysbiosis occurs. Using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing of DNA extracted from rectal and oropharyngeal (<b>OP)</b> <b>swabs,</b> bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and blood, our objective was to characterize the fecal, OP, blood, and lower airway microbiota over time in healthy cats. This work in healthy cats, a species in which a respiratory microbiota has not yet been characterized, sets the stage for future studies in feline asthma in which cats serve as a comparative and translational model for humans. Fecal, OP and BALF samples were collected from six healthy research cats at day 0, week 2, and week 10; blood was collected at week 10. DNA was extracted, amplified via PCR, and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Representative operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified and microbial richness and diversity were assessed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to visualize relatedness of samples and PERMANOVA was used to test for significant differences in microbial community composition. Fecal and <b>OP</b> <b>swabs</b> provided abundant DNA yielding a mean±SEM of 65, 653 ± 6, 145 and 20, 6323 ± 4, 360 sequences per sample, respectively while BALF and blood samples had lower coverage (1, 489 ± 430 and 269 ± 18 sequences per sample, respectively). Oropharyngeal and fecal swabs were significantly richer than BALF (mean number OTUs 93, 88 and 36, respectively; p < 0. 001) with no significant difference (p = 0. 180) in richness between time points. PCA revealed site-specific microbial communities in the feces, and upper and lower airways. In comparison, blood had an apparent compositional similarity with BALF with regard to a few dominant taxa, but shared more OTUs with feces. Samples clustered more by time than by individual, with <b>OP</b> <b>swabs</b> having subjectively greater variation than other samples. In summary, healthy cats have a rich and distinct lower airway microbiome with dynamic bacterial populations. The microbiome is likely to be altered by factors such as age, environmental influences, and disease states. Further data are necessary to determine how the distinct feline microbiomes from the upper and lower airways, feces and blood are established and evolve. These data are relevant for comparisons between healthy cats and cats with respiratory disease...|$|R

Despite this overall difference, paired BAL and upper airway (OP and NP) microbiota were > 50 % similar among 69 % of children. Furthermore, canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP analysis) detected significant differences between the microbiota from clinically defined groups when analysing either BAL (eigenvalues > 0. 8; misclassification rate 26. 5 %) or the combined OP and NP data (eigenvalues > 0. 8; misclassification rate 12. 2 %). Conclusions: Upper airway sampling provided an imperfect, but reliable, representation of the BAL microbiota for most children in this study.

40|$|Background: In recent years, the {{morbidity}} of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) {{has increased}} significantly in China. A {{growing number of}} studies indicate that imbalanced respiratory microbiota is associated with various respiratory diseases. Methods: We enrolled 119 children, including 60 pneumonia patients and 59 healthy children. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) sampling was performed for 16 S ribosomal RNA (16 S rRNA) gene analysis of all children. Sputum and <b>OP</b> <b>swabs</b> were obtained from patients for pathogen detection. Results: Both the NP and OP microbiota of patients differ significantly from that of healthy children. Diseased children harbor lower microbial diversity and a simpler co-occurrence network in NP and OP. In pneumonia patients, NP and OP microbiota showed greater similarities between each other, suggesting transmission of NP microbiota to the OP. Aside from clinically detected pathogens, NP and OP microbiota analysis has also identified possible pathogens in seven cases with unknown infections. Conclusion: NP and OP microbiota in MPP and non-MPP are definitely similar. Respiratory infection generates imbalanced NP microbiota, which {{has the potential to}} transmit to OP. Microbiota analysis also promises to compliment the present means of detecting respiratory pathogens...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to experimentally assess antibody responses and patterns of viral excretion in wild birds challenged with a low pathogenicity AIV. Ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres), silver gulls (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae), and wandering whistling ducks (Dendrocygna arcuata) were challenged with a H 6 N 2 virus, and blood, cloacal, and oropharyngeal (<b>OP)</b> <b>swabs</b> were analyzed from each bird over 28 days, with serology conducted on the ducks for a further 7 mo. Nineteen of 22 birds showed evidence of infection, with respiratory infection prevalent in the turnstones and gulls as mostly low titer viral excretion to 4 days postinoculation (DPI) with gastrointestinal replication detected in only one turnstone. In AIV naive ducks, there was gastrointestinal tropism with moderately high titer viral excretion via the cloaca to 6 DPI and low-grade OP viral excretion to 4 DPI. The hemagglutination inhibition antibody response was poor in the ducks, declining from 19 to 56 DPI, with higher titer responses in the gulls and turnstones. All infected birds responded with elevated nucleoprotein antibodies (in competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) by 7 - 10 DPI, and in the ducks these waned slowly after 42 DPI and were long-lived to at least 8 mo. The interspecies variability in response was consistent with a subtype that had adapted well in ducks, while the response of the turnstones may have been influenced by preexisting immunity to AIV. These findings provide insight into AIV infection dynamics in wild birds and highlight the need for further research...|$|R

Overall, 61 / 79 (77 %) of the cattle sera were positive for antibodies against FMDV by PrioCHECK FMDV NS ELISA and solid phase blocking ELISA detected titres ≥ 80 for serotypes O, SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 in 41, 45, 30 and 45 of these 61 seropositive samples, respectively. Virus neutralisation tests detected {{the highest levels of}} neutralising antibodies (titres ≥ 45) against serotype O in the herds from Kween and Rakai districts, against SAT 1 in the herd from Nwoya district and against SAT 2 in the herds from Kiruhura, Isingiro and Ntungamo districts. The isolation of a SAT 2 FMDV from Isingiro was consistent with the detection of high levels of neutralising antibodies against SAT 2; sequencing (for the VP 1 coding region) indicated that this virus belonged to lineage I within this serotype, like the currently used vaccine strain. From the Wakiso district 11 tissue/swab samples were collected; serotype A FMDV, genotype Africa (G-I), was isolated from the epithelial samples. This study shows that within a period of less than one year, FMD outbreaks in Uganda were caused by four different serotypes namely O, A, SAT 1 and SAT 2. Therefore, to enhance the control of FMD in Uganda, there is need for efficient and timely determination of outbreak virus strains/serotypes and vaccine matching.
