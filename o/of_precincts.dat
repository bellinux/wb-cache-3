2500|$|The Transit Police also handled both {{quality of}} life crimes and [...] violent crime in the subway system, with uniform officers, plain clothes anti-crime, {{as well as a}} detective squad in each district. While NYPD {{operated}} out <b>of</b> <b>precincts,</b> Transit Police operated out of districts with each district covering {{a different part of the}} system. Each district had at least 1 RMP patrol car on the surface to provide rapid response to stations requiring police action, and to transport officers with prisoners to central booking, or back to the district. The typical uniformed Transit Police officer worked alone. Plain clothes officers, such as anti-crime, worked in pairs. The Decoy Squad worked in a group, with each member playing a specific role. New hires known as probationary officers were most often assigned to the Tactical Patrol Force known as TPF The TPF was responsible strictly for train patrol. TPF officers were assigned various trains that they were responsible for during their tour. Patrol required the officers to ride the train for the entire route which meant the TPF crossed both borough lines as well as District lines. At times this caused conflict between the TPF supervisors and the local district supervisors as to who truly had jurisdiction over the TPF. [...] To combat fare evasion, Transit Police had the Summons Squad, whose officers worked in plain clothes in pairs, with the prime objective of issuing summonses systemwide for fare evasion, littering and smoking.|$|E
