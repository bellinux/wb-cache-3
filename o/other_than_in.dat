5|$|Horsefield founded {{one such}} society, the Prestwich Botanical Society, {{and was later}} {{president}} of a larger botanical society covering a wide area around north Manchester. He made several botanical discoveries and cultivated two new plants. A number of his writings about the working class and also some poetry were published, but nothing concerning botany <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> connection with {{the subject of the}} working class. He lived most of his life near Whitefield in Lancashire, in dire poverty. At {{the time of his death}} he had been married for 42 years and had fathered eleven children.|$|E

5|$|Until 1999, a draw in {{the final}} {{would result in the}} match being replayed at a later date; since then the final has always been decided on the day, with a penalty shootout as required. As of 2017 a penalty {{shoot-out}} has been required on only two occasions, in the 2005 and 2006 finals. The competition did not take place during the First and Second World Wars, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the 1914–15 season, when it was completed, and the 1939–40 season, when it was abandoned during the qualifying rounds.|$|E
5|$|At the Opéra-Comique, {{after its}} 1883 revival, Carmen was always {{presented}} in the dialogue version with minimal musical embellishments. By 1888, {{the year of the}} 50th anniversary of Bizet's birth, the opera had been performed there 330 times; by 1938, his centenary year, the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2,271. However, outside France the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years; the Carl Rosa Opera Company's 1947 London production, and Walter Felsenstein's 1949 staging at the Berlin Komische Oper, are among the first known instances in which the dialogue version was used <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> France. Neither of these innovations led to much change in practice; a similar experiment was tried at Covent Garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn, and the first American production with spoken dialogue, in Colorado in 1953, met with a similar fate.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Olivier {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The Dance of Death, the finest of all his performances <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.|$|E

5|$|Late glacial tool finds {{from the}} Upper Palaeolithic date to c.12,000BP: flint blades known as Cheddar points; smaller bladelets known as Cresswell points; scrapers; burins or lithic flakes; flint and bone awls; and a bone needle. Flint rarely occurs in Wales <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> drifts, or as small pebbles on beaches. Flint tools would {{therefore}} {{have to have}} been brought to Gower from other areas, such as those now known as southern or eastern England, or Antrim, either as finished tools or as incomplete, or unworked, nodules. Remains of red fox, Arctic fox, brown bear, tundra vole, and possibly reindeer, were found at the same level as the Upper Palaeolithic tools, providing evidence of the climate c.12,000BP. Other animal remains excavated during the 19th century, which may predate the Late glacial finds, include mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, red deer and giant deer.|$|E
5|$|The UK case of R. (Ghai) v. Newcastle City Council (2009) is {{therefore}} interesting {{for purposes of}} comparison. The claimant, an orthodox Hindu, applied to his local authority for land to be dedicated for traditional open air funeral pyres. The local authority refused the request, relying on subsidiary legislation that made it an offence to burn human remains <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> a crematorium. The claimant then applied for judicial review, submitting that the decision infringed his right to manifest his religion or belief which was protected by Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The High Court found that the statutory interference with the claimant's right was justified as {{it was necessary for}} the protection of public morals and of the rights and freedoms of others. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on grounds unrelated to Article 9, holding that open air pyres were permissible on a proper construction of the legislation.|$|E

Without treatment, this second stage of {{the natural history of}} HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20years (on average, about eight years). While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains.

5|$|The law {{governing}} aviation in the UK {{is defined}} by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which is updated periodically with amendments, the latest being the Civil Aviation Act 2006. The government department responsible for legislating changes in national policy and long term strategy relating to aviation is the Department for Transport (DfT). At the operational level the independently run Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulates economic, safety, and consumer protection aspects, as well as airspace policy, although these responsibilities are being increasingly ceded to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). International aspects of air transport are regulated by agreements made within the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as established by the Chicago Convention, whilst most new legislation is now made at the European level through the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). As a consequence, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> airport development, there are few aspects of the air transport industry in which the government can act in isolation.|$|E
5|$|The {{overseas}} Chinese {{have contributed}} {{to the development of the}} town since their immigration in the late 19th century. The immigrants to Sandakan were farmers and labourers while some of them worked as businessmen and entrepreneurs. In the modern days, Sandakan have been poised to become one of Sabah business hubs. The town itself is one of Sabah's major port, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> Kota Kinabalu, Sepanggar Bay, Tawau, Lahad Datu, Kudat, Semporna and Kunak. Sandakan district is known for its eco-tourism centres, such as the orangutan rehabilitation station in Sepilok Rehabilitation Centre, the Turtle Islands Park, the Kinabatangan River and the Gomantong Caves which are famous for their edible bird's nest. Due to Sandakan geographical proximity to Southern Philippines, there is also a barter trade connection and Sandakan is considered as a transit point for food entering the Southern Philippines. The state government has been assisting traders to improve their trading system and providing infrastructure facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} aplacental viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos sustained to term by histotroph ("uterine milk") {{produced by the}} mother. Females bear litters of up to four pups every other year, after a gestation period of at least six months. This species is closely related to, and may hybridize with, the yellowback stingaree (U.sufflavus). The venomous sting of the crossback stingaree is potentially injurious to humans. This common species is seldom caught by commercial fisheries <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the northernmost extent of its range. Thus, its population is largely secure and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|With {{the powers}} of the King's Clerk abolished, the bailiffs of Norwich set about {{regulating}} the operation of the market for what they felt was the greatest benefit to the city. To encourage fair competition among the market's traders, it was forbidden to sell foodstuffs before the Cathedral bell had tolled for Lady Mass (6.00am). The practice of forestalling (meeting merchants {{on their way to the}} market either to buy their goods for resale, or to prevent them from attending the market and thus make goods of the type they were selling scarce and hence more expensive) was forbidden. Trading anywhere <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the market was strongly discouraged and the right to re-sell goods at a profit was restricted to Freemen of the city. The prices of bread and beer were fixed, and a set of standardised weights and measures was introduced, against which measures used by merchants would regularly be checked. Shortly after the transfer of the market to the city a market cross was erected near the centre of the main market (opposite the present day entrance to Davey Place), the design of which is not recorded.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{considered}} it very unlikely that an attack would occur anywhere <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the northern sector and therefore {{was prepared to}} reduce the troops in Nos 1 and 2 Sectors to a minimum. He decided not to reinforce his four infantry brigades, but to increase the available fire-power at Romani by moving up the 160th and 161st Machine Gun Companies of the 53rd (Welsh) and the 54th (East Anglian) Divisions. He also ordered the concentration of a small mobile column {{made up of the}} 11th Light Horse, the City of London Yeomanry (less one squadron each) with the 4th, 6th and 9th Companies of the Imperial Camel Brigade in No. 2 Sector. He calculated that the whole of the defensive force, including the camel transport necessary to enable infantry in the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division to advance into the desert, would be fully equipped and the camels assembled by 3 August. Approximately 10,000 Egyptian Camel Transport Corps camels concentrated at Romani prior to the battle. British monitors in the Mediterranean Sea off Mahamdiyah got into position to shell the assembling Ottoman force, while an armoured train at Kantara was ready to assist the defence of the right flank, and all available aircraft were on standby at Ismailia, Kantara, Port Said and Romani.|$|E
5|$|The 1s1 {{electron}} configuration of hydrogen, while superficially {{similar to that}} of the alkali metals (ns1), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H+, or gain one to form the hydride ion H−. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity, but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual {{electron configuration}} and small size, the hydrogen ion is very small (radius around 150fm compared to the 50–220pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid-base chemistry. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are an effect of charge-transfer, electrostatic, and electron correlative contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium bonds are also known, they are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).|$|E
