5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty {{to chop up}} {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves {{to find a way}} back to town. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When he reaches for her necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner {{was trying}} to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about K-9. The robot dog was very popular among {{children}} but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{subsidies}} were allocated to local authorities faced with acute areas of severe poverty (or other social problems). The Housing Act 1969 provided local authorities with {{the duty of}} working <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about 'unsatisfactory areas'. Local authorities could declare 'general improvement areas' {{in which they would}} be able to buy up land and houses, and spend environmental improvement grants. On the same basis, taking geographical areas of need, a package was developed by the government which resembled a miniature poverty programme. In July 1967, the government decided to pour money into what the Plowden Committee defined as Educational Priority Areas, poverty-stricken areas where children were environmentally deprived. A number of poor inner-city areas were subsequently granted EPA status (despite concerns that Local Education Authorities would be unable to finance Educational Priority Areas). From 1968 to 1970, 150 new schools were built under the educational priority programme.|$|E

25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is {{the dilemma of}} what to do with Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is the focal point for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses this dilemma to cause emotions to rise. As his characters try to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about the Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection. In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E
25|$|During the journey, a phone begins ringing, but {{the group}} cannot work out whose it is. Ed {{believes}} the ringing {{is coming from the}} boot, so Chris pulls {{over to the side of}} the road. The group discover Sophie in the boot and try and work <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her. Summer suggests that Chris takes her home, while Ed offers to call a taxi and go back with her. Andrew, desperate not to miss the concert, asks Chris to take her in the car, despite knowing that there is not a spare seatbelt. Chris reluctantly agrees and Sophie sits on Summer's lap. Summer asks what time The Jezabels are on stage and Andrew mentions that he wrote it down on his ticket, which is in his wallet inside Summer's bag. As Summer searches for the ticket, she finds the two cheques inside and asks Andrew about them. He tries to get his wallet back, but Summer discovers the cheques are worth $25,000 and Natasha realises he has sold the app.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October 1557, Wang Zhi {{arrived at}} Zhoushan Island {{with a large}} trading fleet. There he laid down his terms for surrender: he sought an {{imperial}} pardon, a naval commission, and that ports be open for trade; in return he offered to patrol the coast and persuade the raiders {{to return to the}} islands through force if necessary. Hu Zongxian now faced a dilemma: he could not let Wang Zhi go, but if he accepted Wang Zhi's surrender he might be forced to execute him, turning appeasement efforts to naught. In December, confident in his prospects and his invulnerability, Wang Zhi made landing at Hangzhou. There he was accorded respectable treatment by the authorities, who feared antagonizing his followers, while they figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him. During this time Hu Zongxian asked Wang Zhi to help manufacture arquebuses for the Ming army, which led to the weapon being widely used in China. Finally in February next year, Wang Zhi was sent to prison, where he was given the luxuries of novelties, books, and healthy foods. Wang Zhi believed this was a temporary arrangement and remained hopeful for a pardon until 22 January 1560, when an imperial edict handed down the death sentence and he was summarily beheaded.|$|E

25|$|The Challengers, Ray Palmer, Firestorm, Una, Harley, Holly, and Mary Marvel {{attempt to}} figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about Karate Kid, who lays dying from the virus he's carrying. Solomon, the Monitor of Earth-8, arrives and sends {{everyone}} back to Earth. Jason leaves the group upon their arrival. Soon after, the group discovers {{that no one}} recognizes them, and that their homes and headquarters are not there. The group goes to see Dubbilex for help with Karate Kid, only to learn that he has already died. When Karate Kid's autopsy is performed, Morticoccus is accidentally released, grows and attacks the Challengers. The virus is captured by Rayner and explodes. However, it is discovered that the virus began spreading across the planet before the autopsy, causing infected humans to devolve into animalistic savages and infected animals to gain human-like traits. Una helps Buddy Blank reach his daughter's apartment and the two locate Buddy's daughter, who has been infected by the virus, and his grandson, who is immune. Una dies while protecting Buddy and his grandson from a swarm of rats, and gives Buddy her Legion Flight Ring, which he uses to take him and his grandson to Cadmus's Command D facility. The Challengers then leave the reconstituted Earth-51 and return home. After witnessing Darkseid's death, Jason returns to being a solo anti-hero while Donna, Kyle, Ray Palmer and Forager, along with the Monitor Nix Uotan, reform the Challengers and watch over the other Monitors.|$|E

They never tried to get their sister in trouble or outsmart their mother {{and get away with}} it." [...] Instead, he and his brother create things for the sheer enjoyment of it or to help out others ("and for the ladies"); for example, Ferb and Phineas carve Candace's face into Mount Rushmore for her birthday, set up a roller derby for a rematch race with his Grandmother Betty Jo's old rival, create a haunted house for their friend Isabella to cure her hiccups and make a super-computer to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for their mom after being so kind to them.|$|E

Andy arrives at Miranda's home only to discover that the instructions she received are vague. As she tries to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Andy begins to panic. Miranda's twins, Caroline and Cassidy, falsely tell her she can leave the book at the top of the stairs just as Emily has done on many occasions. At the top of the stairs, Andy interrupts Miranda and her husband having an argument. Mortified, Andy leaves the book and runs out of the home.|$|E

The claim on behalf of The Gap Band and Lonnie Simmons was entered into YouTube’s content management system preventing payments to the publisher. Later, on August 12, Serbian pop artist Viktorija has also argued that [...] "Uptown Funk" [...] infringed on her track [...] "Ulice mračne nisu za devojke".

500|$|While {{brainstorming}} {{for ideas}} to the game's plot, Sakamoto decided to create an original story instead of remaking a Metroid game because he [...] "always [...] to do something really unprecedented, something people have never played before". He continued, saying, [...] "Many of our designers and creators want to challenge something new rather than simply porting over an old title. That's something I hope we'll always do. If you can challenge something new, you {{can look forward to}} the public response, be it good or bad." [...] The game introduces gameplay mechanics that are new to the Metroid series. Metroid Fusion offers a more direct, almost mission-based structure that supports the player to explore areas. Objectives are also flexible in how they can be completed, acting [...] "more as a guide for what the player should do instead of giving a completely blank map and saying 'Here you go, figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and how to do it.|$|E

500|$|McIlrath {{wrote the}} video treatment, and remarked how the band at first {{had no idea}} {{what they wanted to do}} for the video due to the song's unique sound. McIlrath did know that since [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] has simple lyrics, he wanted the video to {{replicate}} the song's easygoing feel. The video was shot over a year after the release of Siren Song Of The Counter Culture, a rarity in the music industry, as most videos are shot only a few months after the song's parent album is released. Parts of the video were filmed at The Fireside Bowl, where Rise Against played some of their first concerts. Looking back on the video, McIlrath said: [...] "Parts of it are kind of cheesy...but it captured where I was at when that song was written - it was written when I was living in a house with four roommates in a bedroom and we were all just trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Two musical {{themes in}} Wicked run {{throughout}} the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works, the first– Elphaba's theme– came from The Survival of St. Joan, {{on which he}} worked as musical director. [...] "I always liked this tune a lot and I never could figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it," [...] he remarked {{in an interview in}} 2004. The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's brass section, with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, [...] "like a giant shadow terrorizing you". When played by the piano with some electric bass in [...] "As Long As You're Mine", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered bridge, the theme forms the core of the song [...] "No One Mourns the Wicked" [...] and its reprises.|$|E
500|$|SFX {{reviewer}} Ian Berriman gave [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] {{three and}} a half out of five stars. He commented that the ethical debate made it [...] "a surprisingly mature story", but otherwise the Western tropes made it [...] "occasionally feel a little over-familiar". He also felt it was missing [...] "another twist or two", as most of the episode was dedicated to figuring <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Jex rather than discovering more about him. Berriman also had two [...] "nitpicks" [...] that arose with the plot; the Gunslinger could just walk into the town and take Jex away, or the Doctor could take Jex away in the TARDIS. Dave Golder of the magazine labelled [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] as a [...] "disappointing" [...] science fiction Western episode, writing, [...] "There are some great things about this episode ... But in a show that usually has a lot of fun reinventing TV tropes, too much of [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] feels a bit been-there, done that." [...] Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more critical, writing that he did not [...] "believe" [...] or [...] "feel" [...] it. He felt that Westerns and Doctor Who were two things that [...] "never quite gelled" [...] and also criticised the [...] "languorous pace" [...] the fact that Rory had little to do. However, he did praise the [...] "gorgeous" [...] set and the [...] "cleverly constructed a morality play".|$|E
