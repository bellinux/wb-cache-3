40|$|Waste {{reduction}} algorithm - WAR {{is a tool}} helping {{process engineers}} for environmental impact assessment. WAR algorithm is a methodology for determining the potential environmental impact (PEI) of a chemical process. In particular, the bitumen production process was analyzed following three stages: a) atmospheric distillation unit, b) vacuum distillation unit, and c) bitumen production unit. Study was developed for the middle sized oil refinery with capacity of 5000000 tones of crude oil per year. Results highlight the most vulnerable aspects of the environmental pollution that arise during the manufacturing process of bitumen. The <b>overall</b> <b>rates</b> of PEI leaving the system (PEI/h) - Iout PEI/h are: a) 2. 14105, b) 7. 17104 and c) 2. 36103, respectively. The <b>overall</b> <b>rates</b> of PEI generated within the system - Igen PEI/h are: a) 7. 75104, b) - 4. 31104 and c) - 4. 32102, respectively. Atmospheric distillation unit have the highest <b>overall</b> <b>rate</b> of PEI while the bitumen production unit have the lowest <b>overall</b> <b>rate</b> of PEI. Comparison of Iout PEI/h and Igen PEI/h values for the atmospheric distillation unit, shows that the <b>overall</b> <b>rate</b> of PEI generated in the system is 36. 21 % of the <b>overall</b> <b>rate</b> of PEI leaving the system. In the cases of vacuum distillation and bitumen production units, the <b>overall</b> <b>rate</b> of PEI generated in system have negative values, i. e. the <b>overall</b> <b>rate</b> of PEI leaving the system is reduced at 60. 11 % (in the vacuum distillation unit) and at 18. 30 % (in the bitumen production unit). Analysis of the obtained results for the <b>overall</b> <b>rate</b> of PEI, expressed by weight of the product, confirms conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Five rats pressed levers {{for food}} {{reinforces}} delivered by several concurrent variable-interval variable-interval schedules. The rate of reinforcement available for responding on one component schedule was held constant at 60 reinforcers per hour. The rate of reinforcement available for responding {{on the other}} schedule varied from 30 to 240 reinforcers per hour. The behavior of the rats resembled the behavior of pigeons pecking keys for food reinforcers. The ratio of the <b>overall</b> <b>rates</b> of responding emitted under, and {{the ratio of the}} time spent responding under, the two components of each concurrent schedule were approximately equal to the ratio of the <b>overall</b> <b>rates</b> of reinforcement obtained from the components. The <b>overall</b> <b>rate</b> of responding emitted under, and the time spent responding under, the variable component schedule varied directly with the <b>overall</b> <b>rate</b> of reinforcement from that schedule. The <b>overall</b> <b>rate</b> of responding emitted under, and the time spent responding under, the constant component schedule varied inversely with the <b>overall</b> <b>rate</b> of reinforcement obtained from the variable component. The local rates of responding emitted under, and the local rates of reinforcement obtained from, the two components did not differ consistently across subjects. But they were not exactly equal either...|$|R

5|$|Backbreaker {{received}} mixed reviews.

The iOS and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade.

It has been criticized by reviewers because of the simplicity of the mini-games and voice actors who do not play the same characters on the series, with Jason Ocampo of IGN giving it a 6.0/10 <b>overall</b> <b>rating.</b> The Wii release received mixed reviews, and the Windows release received generally unfavorable reviews.|$|E
