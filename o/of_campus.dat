40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the Finnish campus {{universities}} and {{the analysis of the}} spatial structure <b>of</b> <b>campuses.</b> Campuses are observed smart cities of the future with blended functions and novel learning environments. The main objective is to analyse the existing spatial structure <b>of</b> <b>campuses</b> in different scales and present how the spaces can be developed. The study evaluates, how the Smart City concept could be used for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>campuses,</b> and how the qualities of smart spaces can be used to develop the existing spaces <b>of</b> <b>campuses.</b> As a conclusion the spaces are developed by bringing smart urban qualities to the campus environment. The qualities that are applicable to campuses are discovered through the literature sources and workshops. The spatial structure <b>of</b> <b>campuses</b> is examined through the two case studies: University of Oulu and Tampere University of Technology. This study is done {{as a part of a}} multidisciplinary research group: RYM-SHOK Work package 4 : Spaces for learning and creation of new knowledge.
