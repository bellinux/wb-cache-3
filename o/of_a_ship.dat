5|$|Flag of {{convenience}} (FOC) {{is a business}} practice whereby a merchant ship is registered in a country other {{than that of the}} ship's owners, and the ship flies that country's civil ensign.

The closely related term open registry, which describes a ship register that will register foreign-owned ships, also exists.|$|E

Rupert Gould, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855. Whatever the truth of these stories, it is the Mary Celeste that is remembered; the ship's name, or the misspelt Marie Celeste, has become fixed in people's minds as synonymous with inexplicable desertion.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the Navy uniforms were made in dark blue, but with the Southern style of rank {{insignia}} for the officers. The 1862 Confederate regulations ordered the uniform to be steel gray and lined with a dark black silk serge. They were also made in medium gray and cadet gray. They were made of wool, and these uniforms were not fit for {{the heat of the}} lower decks <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship.</b> Non-commissioned officers wore a variety of uniforms, or even regular clothing.|$|E

5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 14–15 April 1809, contact was {{maintained}} with the French squadron by Recruit, Captain Charles John Napier firing on the rearmost ship Hautpoult and coming under fire from the French stern-chasers, guns situated in the rear <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> to fire on pursuers. Shortly after 04:00, Pompee came within range and began to fire her bow-chasers, the chase continuing westwards into the Caribbean Sea. Frustrated by her inability to escape Recruit, Hautpoult eventually turned and fired a broadside at 10:45, causing severe damage but failing to dissuade Napier, who immediately counter-attacked. Hautpoults manoeuvre caused her to lose ground to her pursuers and throughout the day the squadrons exchanged shots, neither causing significant damage but the French being driven deeper into British held waters and unable to drive off their opponents.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} article that advocated that widening the beam <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> would reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.|$|E

5|$|In August 2001, an {{expedition}} {{headed by the}} marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found the remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only {{a few pieces of}} timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral. Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celestes 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of the Mary Celeste had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after the Mary Celestes demise.|$|E
5|$|In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath {{attributed}} {{the invention of}} the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb {{the invention of the}} whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E
