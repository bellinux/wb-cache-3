5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed the flight deck and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and {{out of the way of}} landing operations. After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform extending from the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck, a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E

5|$|Less than 35minutes {{into the}} flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit. They forced the {{passengers}}, crew, and pilots {{to the rear}} of the aircraft.

5|$|On all flights, {{passengers}} {{are provided with}} food and complimentary beverages on board, in both classes. The food service consists of hot meals, hot or cold snacks, or light refreshments, depending on the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> {{and the time of}} the day. The choice of acquiring complementary drinks at an extra cost is available too. The airline also offers assorted menus for passengers having special meal requirements.|$|E
5|$|Public {{communication}} from Malaysian officials regarding the loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> was initially beset with confusion. The Malaysian {{government and the}} airline released imprecise, incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate information, with civilian officials sometimes contradicting military leaders. Malaysian officials were criticised for such persistent release of contradictory information, most notably regarding the last location and time of contact with the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{engaged in}} a {{strategy}} of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones (also known as congregaciones). Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as mountains and forests.|$|E
5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised. The air sacs expand and contract due {{to changes in the}} volume in the thorax and abdomen. This volume change is caused by the movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> muscles.|$|E
5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{had been}} used since 25 seconds after take-off from Namsos and {{was used for the}} remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight.</b> From 20:29:21 all four engines showed increasing torque and immediately before the crash the aircraft had shifted its angle from −2.5degrees to 5degrees. At 20:29:29 the ground proximity warning system showed 'minimum'. The aircraft crashed into the western side Torghatten at 20:29:30 at 170meters (560ft) elevation.|$|E

50|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} <b>the</b> probable cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident was <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captain in descending below his en route minimum altitude without positive identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight's</b> position.|$|R

5|$|The {{flight was}} {{operated}} {{for the purpose}} of maintaining the currency of the instrument rating of two of the airline's pilots. Shortly after takeoff and only seconds after climbing through , the plane began banking to the right. It continued to roll through 90degrees; the nose then dropped suddenly and moments later it struck the ground. All three members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> crew were killed upon impact.|$|E
5|$|After {{commissioning}} {{too late}} {{to participate in the}} First World War, Argus was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from Furious. The first landing on the ship was made on 1 October 1918 by a Sopwith Ship Strutter. The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and Sopwith Pups. Argus was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush with the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. Argus joined the Atlantic Fleet in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four Sopwith Camel fighters, two Airco DH.9A bombers and two Fairey floatplanes. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown {{over the side of the}} carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.|$|E
5|$|Amagis keel {{was laid}} down by Mitsubishi in Nagasaki, on 1 October 1942. She was {{launched}} on 15 October 1943 and completed on 10 August 1944. The ship was transferred {{among a number of}} ports on the Inland Sea until she arrived in Kure in February 1945 and was ordered to be camouflaged. Her intended air group, Air Group 601, was committed to the Battle of Iwo Jima about that same time. Amagi was briefly refitted from 10 to 24 February. On 19 March, the ship was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and lightly damaged by one bomb that struck the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck. On 13 April, the ship was permanently moored at an island in Kure harbor and extensively camouflaged.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} that the accident was attributed to both pilots' misjudgement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flight's</b> altitude as well as failing to recognize the terrain surrounding them, which is considered as a typical CFIT.|$|R
