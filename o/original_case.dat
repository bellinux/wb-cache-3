5|$|Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ {{started in}} June 1984, {{and it was}} {{released}} in October the same year. This 48KB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button that was basically a switch that shorted across the CPU reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48KB model. It was possible {{to change the system}} boards between the <b>original</b> <b>case</b> and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5–6% for the older model.|$|E

5|$|According to polls, {{support for}} capital {{punishment}} had been steadily declining since the 1990s, {{but the majority}} of people in Utah still supported the death penalty in the period leading up to Gardner's scheduled execution. In 2010, Kay McIff of the Utah House of Representatives sponsored legislation to require condemned inmates to raise all appeal arguments in their first post-conviction petition, noting that Gardner's multiple appeals kept his case lingering on death row for nearly 25years. The bill, HB202, passed the Utah House by a margin of 67-to-5 on February 1, 2011, and unanimously passed the Utah State Senate on February 17. The legislation was signed into law by the Governor on 22 March 2011. The law denies any stay of execution after a first appeal, without a judicial review of new evidence (or a pregnant appellant), that a judge determines would have materially affected the <b>original</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze two {{phosphor}} plate systems (PSPs) (Dürr Dental, Digora Optime) according to their scanning delay and protective plastic case performances. Methods. Two PSPs using an aluminum step wedge were exposed. These plates were placed in three different protective plastic <b>cases</b> (manufacturers' <b>original</b> <b>cases,</b> black case, and white case) before obtaining the radiographs and were then processed immediately and 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 [*]min after exposure. Mean gray values (MGVs) of the 3 rd, 5 th, 7 th, and 9 th steps of the wedges were compared using ANOVA. Results. Statistically significant differences were found between the two PSPs (). ANOVA revealed that the MGVs of four steps of the wedges were significantly different from each other for all scan delays (). MGVs increased with increasing scanning delay, except the group with Dürr plates in their <b>original</b> <b>cases.</b> Reduction in image quality began 5 [*]min after exposure in the other Dürr plate groups. Conclusions. Within the limitations of the current study, it can be concluded that scanning delay causes a reduction in image quality, and using the manufacturer's <b>original</b> protective <b>case</b> will result in better performance of PSPs...|$|R

In 2015 a paper published in The BMJ that reanalysed the <b>original</b> <b>case</b> notes argued that in Study 329, assessing paroxetine and imipramine against placebo in adolescents with depression, the incidence of suicidal behavior had been under-reported and the efficacy exaggerated for paroxetine.|$|E

On April 30, 1954, Lafferty won a successful appeal to return $6 million in timber revenue to the O counties. However, Congress passed a further act that gave control of those lands to the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Lafferty's appeal that his case had precedence.

25|$|The mouse {{created for}} the Apple Lisa {{was among the first}} {{commercial}} mice sold in the marketplace. Included with the Lisa system in 1983, it was based on the mouse used in the 1970s on the Alto computer at Xerox PARC. Unique to this mouse was the use of a steel ball, instead of the usual rubber found in subsequent and modern mice. It connected to the computer by means of a standard DE-9 and unique squeeze-release connector. Though developed by Apple, it was actually designed by an outside firm, Hovey-Kelley (renamed IDEO in 1991), who built hundreds of prototypes and conducted exhaustive testing with focus groups in order to create the perfect device. Their perseverance paid off as not only did they bring the design in on time and on budget, but the resulting device remained virtually unchanged for almost 20 years. It was this mouse that established Apple's mouse as a one-button device for over 20 years. Every single aspect of the mouse was researched and developed, from how many buttons to include, to how loud the click should be. The <b>original</b> <b>case</b> design was Bill Dresselhaus's and took on an almost Art Deco flavor with its formal curving lines to coordinate with the Lisa.|$|E

500|$|In August 2011, [...] the CCAF won a case at {{a federal}} appeals court in California in which they objected to class action {{settlements}} and attorneys' fees in litigation regarding Bluetooth headsets. The <b>original</b> <b>case</b> over the headsets had been filed when lawyers had noticed news articles about potential hearing loss and headsets and filed suits on behalf of millions of Motorola and Plantronics customers. The prior settlement would have effectively paid consumers nothing but given the lawyers who negotiated the pact $850,000 in fees, amended by Frank and his firm. Frank regards the case as a milestone in his fight to prevent abuses. Frank also unsuccessfully filed an objection to a settlement in an antitrust case against Sirius XM Radio, which provided nothing for the plaintiffs, but a 100 percent payout of $13 million for the attorneys. Judge Harold Baer, Jr. ruled on 24 August that the settlement terms [...] "demonstrate sufficient fairness, adequacy and reasonableness" [...] and rejected Frank's claims. Frank vowed to appeal, saying [...] "you don't like to lose, but it's a good case to take to the appellate court." [...] In June 2010, the CCAF filed an objection on behalf of four class members to the Dewey v. Volkswagen, Water Ingress Settlement where attorneys were asking for over $23 million for recovering an $8 million reimbursement fund for a small subset of the class. The case is still pending.|$|E
