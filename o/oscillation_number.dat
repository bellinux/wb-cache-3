40|$|We {{construct}} cosmological spacetimes with null Kasner-like singularities as purely gravitational solutions with {{no other}} background fields turned on. These can be recast as anisotropic plane-wave spacetimes by coordinate transformations. We analyse string quantization to find the spectrum of string modes in these backgrounds. The classical string modes can be solved for exactly in these time-dependent backgrounds, which enables a detailed study of the near singularity string spectrum, (time-dependent) oscillator masses and wavefunctions. We find that for low lying string modes (finite <b>oscillation</b> <b>number),</b> the classical near-singularity string mode functions are non-divergent for various families of singularities. Furthermore, for any infinitesimal regularization of {{the vicinity of the}} singularity, we find a tower of string modes of ultra-high <b>oscillation</b> <b>number</b> which propagate essentially freely in the background.

The method approximates the coefficients of the differential equation by piecewise-constant functions, which enables an exact solution to be found on each mesh interval. In order to calculate M() for the approximate problem, certain <b>oscillation</b> <b>numbers</b> NL and NR must be computed. These consist of sums of nullities (or rank deficiencies) of 2 Θ 2 matrices obtained from the solutions of the approximate differential equation.

We have observed periodic oscillations in I−V characteris-tics of porous Si illuminated by visible light. The experiment is performed at room temperature using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM).

40|$|We {{consider}} circular strings rotating {{with equal}} spins S 1 = S 2 = S in two orthogonal planes in AdS 5 {{and suggest that}} they may be dual to “long ” gauge theory operators built out of self-dual components of gauge field strength. As was found in hep-th/ 0404187, the one-loop anomalous dimensions of the such gauge-theory operators are described by an anti-ferromagnetic XXX 1 spin chain and scale linearly with length L ≫ 1. We find {{that in the case of}} rigid rotating string both the classical energy E 0 and the 1 -loop string correction E 1 depend linearly on the spin S (within the stability region of the solution). This supports the identification of the rigid rotating string with the gauge-theory operator corresponding to the maximal-spin (ferromagnetic) state of the XXX 1 spin chain. The energy of more general rotating and pulsating strings also happens to scale linearly with both the spin and the <b>oscillation</b> <b>number.</b> Such solutions should be dual to other lower-spin states of the spin chain, with the anti-ferromagnetic ground state presumably corresponding to the string pulsating in two planes with no rotation...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} sizes {{of a black hole}} in the M theory pp-wave background, and how the {{transverse}} size can be reproduced in the matrix model. Dec. 2002 PP-wave backgrounds, as a limit of AdS and some inner spheres, have proven an interesting place to test ideas of holography and the correspondence between string/M theory in such a background and some supersymmetric gauge theory [1]. In a previous paper [2], we discussed possible correspondence between string states and black hole states in such a background, when the string coupling is fined tuned for a given total <b>oscillation</b> <b>number</b> of the strings. As we shall see, the estimate of the transverse gravitational size of a black hole in that paper is correct, but the longitudinal size given there is incorrect. In the original paper, the first paper in [1], a matrix model is given for the PP-wave background obtained from the M theory AdS backgrounds. This matrix model was further discussed in [3]. Here we are interested in the question of whether this matrix model can reproduce at least the transverse size of a black hole for a given energy. As we shall argue, indeed it can, provided this model can produce a certain form of interaction between two partons. This form, we will argue, shall come out naturally from a computation in th...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{investigated the}} S speed of earth structure under Indian Ocean using seismogram fitting, {{due to the}} C 081499 A earthquake, South Sumatra and recorded in the observation station RER at Reunion Island, France. The observed seismogram is compared to its synthetic in time domain and three cartension components simultaneously. Synthetic seismogram is calculated with the GEMINI program, the initial inputs are the global earth models of Ocean and PREMAN. Prior to seismogram comparison, a low-pass filter with corner frequency of 20 mHz is imposed. The result of analysis shows a very strong deviation at the arrival time, oscillation amount and amplitude height of Love and Rayleigh surface waves and S body wave. To overcome the found discrepancies a correction to the earth structure is needed covering the earth crust thickness, speed gradient of βh and zero-order coefficient for the βh and βv in upper mantle, and a little change in S speed in earth layers down {{to a depth of}} 400 km. Seismogram fitting is better obtained at waveform of the wave phase, either the travel time or <b>oscillation</b> <b>number</b> of S wave and Love surface wave.

However, the detected symmetry can also be observed, even if some particles of the basic electron / positron star are replaced with heavy mesons. These become an unavoidable byproduct of the gauge procedure.

40|$|The {{enhancement}} and hysteresis {{behavior of}} the burning rate of single droplet combustion {{in the presence of}} airstream oscillation observed in previously performed microgravity experiments at elevated pressure up to 1. 0 MPa were numerically investigated. Excellent agreement with the experimental results was obtained and the mechanisms of these phenomena were examined based on precise numerical data on instantaneous droplet diameter variations corresponding to the unsteady airstream velocity, flow fields around the droplet, and flame movement during combustion. Results show that, depending on the <b>oscillation</b> Reynolds <b>number,</b> which is a function of pressure, flow amplitude and droplet diameter, there are three mechanisms involved in the enhancement of burning rate. In the cases of low <b>oscillation</b> Reynolds <b>numbers,</b> a diffusion-time-delay has a significant effect on the flame front movement and thus, on heat from the flame to the droplet. In the cases of high <b>oscillation</b> Reynolds <b>numbers,</b> a vortex generated outside the droplet flame promotes the motion of the flame, especially in the wake region, and thus enhancing the droplet burning rate. In addition to these two mechanisms, the forced convection during the acceleration period of the flow oscillation causes overshooting of the droplet burning rate due to instantaneous imbalances of the airflow momentum with the Stefan flow. These three mechanisms explain the predominant role of the highest velocity of the oscillatory airstream in determination of the mean burning rate constant and droplet lifetime. Results also show that the hysteresis {{behavior of the}} burning rate is a consequence of the different responses of the flame to the deceleration period compared with the responses to the acceleration period under the existence of those three mechanisms...|$|R
