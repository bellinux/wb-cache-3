5|$|A non-tropical frontal low {{developed}} from a cold front <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 1 {{to the west}} of the Azores. It intensified while moving west-northwestward and gradually dissipated its frontal structure. It became a subtropical storm <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 4 about 775 nautical miles (1435km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Operationally, the storm was considered a non-tropical low, and the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until it became a tropical cyclone. It moved slowly northward as convection organized into a ring around the center. As a result of a ship reporting hurricane-force winds near the center, and due to the development of a weak mid-level warm core, the subtropical cyclone was reclassified as Hurricane Noel <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 5. Increasing westerly wind shear limited convection near the center, and Noel weakened to a tropical storm early <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 6. Progressively cooler water temperatures contributed to weakening, and Noel became extratropical later <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 6 about 330mi (530km) southeast of Newfoundland. The extratropical remnant continued to the northeast and was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm later that day.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave crossed Central America {{and entered}} the eastern Pacific Ocean <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 7.

Later that day, Dvorak classification began on the disturbance, and the convection continued to organize. Early <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 13, the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility of the system developing into a tropical depression. Thunderstorm activity briefly decreased, though late <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 13 the system acquired enough circulation and organized convection for it to be designated Tropical Depression Twenty-One-E while located about 460miles (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not upgraded until eleven hours later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved through}} the West Indies between November3 and November4. The wave reached the vicinity of Turks and Caicos Islands <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 5, where it developed into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC. The storm moved north-northwestward and then westward across the southern Bahamas. A ridge aloft blocked the storm's westward progress and caused it to re-curve west-southwestward <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 6. The system strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Around 1800 UTC <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 6, the storm made landfall on Cayo Romano in Camagüey Province with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The system quickly weakened while crossing the mountainous terrain of Cuba and fell to tropical storm intensity early <b>on</b> <b>November</b> 7, shortly before emerging into the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Later that day, the storm re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and continued on a southwestward path.|$|E
