25|$|The Dieppe Raid of 1942 {{had shown}} that the Allies could not rely {{on being able to}} {{penetrate}} the Atlantic Wall to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed sufficient depth of water under their keels, together with dockside cranes, to <b>off-load</b> their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain Operation Overlord and the Battle of Normandy.

40|$|On December 12, 2007, {{the second}} largest oil spill {{in the history of}} Norwegian oil {{exploration}} occurred on StatoilHydro's Statfjord Alpha platform. The spill was caused by a snapped 20 ″ oil <b>off-loading</b> hose. Thorough investigations by StatoilHydro [1] and by the Norwegian authorities [2] revealed the chain of events that led to this incident. One of the links in this chain was the unintended fast closure of the shuttle tanker's bow loading valve during <b>off-loading.</b> This closure initiated a pressure surge in the oil <b>off-loading</b> system. As part of the internal investigation by StatoilHydro, TNO carried out a water hammer analysis of the entire oil <b>off-loading</b> system, including the <b>off-loading</b> hoses to the seabed and further subsea piping up to the platform. These simulations revealed that high pressures could occur in the oil <b>off-loading</b> system due to fast closure of the bow loading valve followed by multiple reflections at diameter changes. The maximum pressures were more than 100 bar above the normal operating pressure of 10 bar. The diameter changes were introduced into the oil <b>off-loading</b> system to maximize the <b>off-loading</b> capacity. The results of the water hammer analysis provided the missing link between the fast closure of the valve and the damaged hose and also showed that this damage most likely occurred within 0. 5 second after the closure of the valve. Based on the results of this analysis, also other oil <b>off-loading</b> systems are being reinvestigated to prevent a similar incident to occur in the future. Copyright © 2009 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|Effective <b>off-loading</b> is {{considered}} to be {{an important part of the}} successful clinical management of diabetic foot ulcers. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of different <b>off-loading</b> devices for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. The medical literature was extensively searched from January 1966 to May 2012. Systematic reviews and controlled studies that compared the use of different <b>off-loading</b> devices formed the evidence base. Studies were critically appraised to determine their risk of methodological bias, and data were extracted. Results were pooled using random effects meta-analysis and tested for heterogeneity. When compared with removable devices, non-removable <b>off-loading</b> devices were found, on average, to be more effective at promoting the healing of diabetic foot ulcers (RRp [*]= 1. 43; 95 % CI 1. 11, 1. 84; I(2) [*]= 66. 9 %; p = 0. 001; k = 10). Analysis, stratified by type of removable device, did not detect a statistically significant difference between non-removable <b>off-loading</b> devices and removable cast walkers; however, on average non-removable <b>off-loading</b> devices performed better than therapeutic shoes at promoting the healing of diabetic foot ulcers (RRp [*]= 1. 68; 95 % CI 1. 09, 2. 58; I(2) [*]= 71. 5 %; p = 0. 004; k = 6). The two types of non-removable <b>off-loading</b> devices i. e. total contact casts and instant total contact casts (removable cast walker rendered irremovable by securing with bandage or lace), were found to be equally effective (RRp [*]= 1. 06; 95 % CI 0. 88, 1. 27; I(2) [*]= 3. 3 %; p = 0. 31; k = 2). In conclusion, non-removable <b>off-loading</b> devices regardless of type, are more likely to result in ulcer healing than removable <b>off-loading</b> devices, presumably because patient compliance with <b>off-loading</b> is facilitated.

25|$|On 29 June, club {{president}} Carson Yeung {{was arrested}} in Hong Kong on charges of money laundering, relating to a period before his involvement with the club. He was bailed to re-appear in August, his assets were frozen, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange suspended trading of shares in the club's holding company, Birmingham International Holdings (BIHL), in which Yeung was the single largest shareholder with around 26%. BIHL appointed acting chairman Peter Pannu and Yeung's 18-year-old son Ryan {{to the board of}} the football club, and Michael Wiseman stepped down from the board, ending an 83-year formal association between the club and the Wiseman family. Although it appeared that HSBC, the club's bankers, were unlikely to call in a loan secured on the St Andrew's site, as such a course of action would make it difficult for the club to continue, thus reducing the likelihood of HSBC recovering their money, Yeung's situation impeded the search for new investment. Such a combination of factors, added to the reduced income to be expected following relegation, left the club in financial difficulty and ready to <b>off-load</b> high-earning players, particularly in light of the Football League's adoption of UEFA's financial fair-play regulations relating to clubs not spending in excess of their revenue.|$|E
25|$|There were, however, reasons {{other than}} public indifference. Successive {{legislation}} involving national heritage, often formulated by the aristocracy themselves, had omitted any reference to private houses. The main reasons that so many British country houses were destroyed {{during the second half}} of the 20th century are politics and social conditions. During the Second World War many large houses were requisitioned, and subsequently for the duration of the war were used for the billeting of military personnel, government operations, hospitals, schools and a myriad of other uses far removed from the purpose for which they were designed. At the end of the war when handed back to the owners, many were in a poor or ruinous state of repair. During the next two decades, restrictions were applied to building works as Britain was rebuilt, priority being given to replacing what had been lost during the war rather than the oversized home of an elite family. In addition, death duties were raised to all-time highs by the new Labour Government that swept into power in 1945; this hit Britain's aristocracy hard. These factors, coupled with a decrease in people available or willing to work as servants, left the owners of country houses facing major problems of how to manage their estates. The most obvious solution was to <b>off-load</b> the cash-eating family mansion. Many were offered for sale as suitable for institutional use; those not readily purchased were speedily demolished. In the years immediately after the war, the law was powerless — even had it wished to — to stop the demolition of a private house no matter how architecturally important.|$|E

25|$|Occasionally an aristocrat of {{the first}} rank did find himself in dire {{financial}} troubles. The severely impoverished Duke of Marlborough saved Blenheim Palace by marrying an heiress, tempted from the USA by the lure of an old title in return for vast riches. Not all were so fortunate or seemingly eligible. When 2nd Duke of Buckingham found himself bankrupt in 1848, he sold the contents of Stowe House, one of Britain's grandest houses. It {{proved to be a}} temporary solution; his heirs, the 3rd and final Duke of Buckingham and his heirs, the Earls Temple, inherited huge financial problems until finally in 1922 anything left that was moveable, both internal and external, was auctioned off and the house sold, narrowly escaping demolition. It was saved by being transformed into a school. Less fortunate was Clumber Park, the principal home of the Dukes of Newcastle. Selling the Hope diamond and other properties failed to solve the family problems, leaving no alternative but demolition of the huge, expensive-to-maintain house, which was razed to the ground in 1938, leaving the Duke without a ducal seat. Plans to rebuild a smaller house on the site were never executed. Other high-ranking members of the peerage were also forced to <b>off-load</b> minor estates and seats; the Duke of Northumberland retained Alnwick Castle, but sold Stanwick Park to be demolished, leaving him with four other country seats remaining. Likewise the Duke of Bedford kept Woburn Abbey, considerably reduced in size, after World War II, while selling other family estates and houses. Whatever the personal choices and reasons for the sales and demolitions, the underlying and unifying factor was almost always financial. The root of the problem began long before the 20th century with the gradual introduction and increase of taxes on income and further tax on inherited wealth, death duties.|$|E
