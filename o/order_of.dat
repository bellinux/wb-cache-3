In 1990, India awarded him the Bharat Ratna, and in 1992 Pakistan gave him their Nishan-e-Pakistan. The same year, {{he was awarded}} the Atatürk Peace Award by Turkey; he at first refused the award, citing human rights {{violations}} committed by Turkey at the time, but later accepted the award in 1999. He was appointed to the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Isabella the Catholic and the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada, and was the first living person to be made an honorary Canadian citizen.

5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E

On June 23, 1903, he married Dorothy Brower (November 14, 1882 to March 10, 1947). They had three children—David Murrell Barkley (1906–1983), Marion Frances Barkley (1909–1996), and Laura Louise Barkley (1911–1987). Laura Louise married Douglas MacArthur II, a U.S. diplomat and nephew of General Douglas MacArthur.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, {{the arms}} were redrawn by Alan Beddoe {{so as to}} have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more {{resembling}} St. Edward's Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended {{the last vestiges of}} British authority over Canada, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the motto of the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national <b>order</b> <b>of</b> honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Garter), the Scottish royal arms the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Regime the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Spirit and <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada.|$|E
