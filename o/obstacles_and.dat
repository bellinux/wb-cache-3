5|$|Work by {{engineer}} Mieczysław G. Bekker {{implies that}} the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is log-normal; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to wheeled locomotion in natural terrains at all size scales. The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around <b>obstacles</b> <b>and</b> to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, Körös was based at Zemun, just {{upstream}} from Belgrade on the Danube. Her commander was Linienschiffsleutnant (LSL) Josef Meusburger, and she was accompanied by another three monitors and three patrol boats. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914, and that night the flotilla fired the first shots of the war against fortifications at the Zemun–Belgrade railway bridge over the river Sava and on the Topčider Hill, although Körös was not initially involved. The Serbs were outgunned by the monitors, and by August began to receive assistance from the Russians. This support included the supply and emplacement of naval guns {{and the establishment of}} river <b>obstacles</b> <b>and</b> mines.|$|E

As the game progresses, Walker's mental health deteriorates, {{as he begins}} to experience hallucinations and slowly realizes the horror of war. Players can hide behind cover, vault over <b>obstacles,</b> <b>and</b> shoot enemies while utilizing a variety of gadgets. Sand is a key gameplay mechanic that can be manipulated to defeat enemies. Included with the game is an online multiplayer mode, developed separately by Darkside Game Studios, allowing players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Kid Icarus is {{an action}} {{platformer}} with role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist Pit through two-dimensional levels, which contain monsters, <b>obstacles</b> <b>and</b> items. Pit's primary weapon is a bow with an unlimited supply of arrows {{that can be}} upgraded with three collectable power items: the guard crystal shields Pit from enemies, the flaming arrows hit multiple targets, and the holy bow increases {{the range of the}} arrows. These upgrades will work only if Pit's health is high enough. The game keeps track of the player's score, and increases Pit's health bar {{at the end of a}} level if enough points were collected.|$|E
5|$|Kościuszko's {{force was}} {{assigned}} to protect the front's southern flank, touching up to the Austrian border. At the Battle of Dubienka (July 18, 1792) Kościuszko repulsed a numerically superior enemy, skilfully using terrain <b>obstacles</b> <b>and</b> field fortifications, and came {{to be regarded as}} one of Poland's most brilliant military commanders of the age. With some 5,300 men, he defeated 25,000 Russians led by General Michail Kachovski. Despite the tactical victory, Kościuszko had to retreat from Dubienka, as the Russians crossed the nearby Austrian border and began flanking his positions.|$|E
40|$|Large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) of transitional separating-reattaching flow on {{a two-dimensional}} square surface mounted <b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> a forward facing step has been performed using a dynamic sub-grid scale model. The Reynolds number {{based on the}} uniform inlet velocity and the obstacle/step height is 4. 5 103. The mean LES results for both the <b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> step flow compare reasonably well with the available experimental and DNS data. The flow structures upstream of the surface-mounted obstacle (referred to hereafter as <b>obstacle)</b> <b>and</b> the forward-facing step (referred to hereafter as FFS) consist of unstable two-dimensional structures and coherent rib-shaped structures. These structures {{with the aid of}} 3 D streamline visualisation strongly indicate that the upstream separation bubble is a closed one rather than an open one in the sense that there is little evidence to suggest that there is fluid injection from the upstream separation region into the downstream separated region for the two geometries. The spectra and time history for the velocities and pressure fields at locations immediately upstream of the <b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> FFS (including the recirculation region) were analysed using both the Fourier and wavelet transforms and revealed the unsteady nature of the recirculation region upstream of the <b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> FFS. The transition process has been elucidated using both 2 D and 3 D flow visualisation of the flow. In both geometries (<b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> FFS), the separated boundary layer downstream of the leading edge shows 2 D nature and roll-up shortly downstream of the separation line leading to 2 D K-H rolls to be shed from the leading edge. Coherent structures such as the -shaped and rib-like vortices commonly associated with a flat plate boundary layer and also found in the separated-reattached flow of a blunt leading edge plate aligned horizontally to a flow are not common in the separated-reattached flow over the <b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> FFS...|$|R

5|$|Lara Croft Go is a 2015 turn-based puzzle {{video game}} in the Tomb Raider series. The player moves Lara Croft as a puzzle piece through a board game while {{avoiding}} <b>obstacles</b> <b>and</b> manipulating the environment. The developers distilled major series motifs, such as boulder chases and reaction-based gameplay, to suit Lara Croft Go time-independent gameplay. Square Enix Montreal developed the game as a spiritual successor to its 2014 Hitman Go, based on another Square Enix franchise. The company released Lara Croft Go in August 2015 for Android, iOS, Windows, and Windows Phone devices. A version for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita was unveiled in November 2016. In 4. December 2016. it's released on Steam.|$|E
5|$|Like {{in other}} {{games in the}} series, Sonic {{collects}} rings scattered throughout levels; contact with certain <b>obstacles</b> <b>and</b> enemies scatters them away, and Sonic dies if he touches an enemy without any rings. Unlike previous titles, Secret Rings does not feature a life counter or game over screen, but instead Sonic reappears at the last visited checkpoint after dying, although the player will have to restart a mission if they fail a specified objective. The game contains 100 missions (including boss battles) {{over the course of}} eight levels. New missions, cutscenes, and sometimes new levels are unlocked by completing missions. Successful missions earn Sonic experience points, which advance him levels.|$|E
5|$|Paraná invited several liberals to {{join the}} {{conservative}} ranks and {{went so far as}} to name some as ministers. The new cabinet, although highly successful, was plagued from the start by strong opposition from ultraconservative members of the Conservative Party who repudiated the new liberal recruits. They believed that the cabinet had become a political machine infested with converted liberals who did not genuinely share the party's ideals and were primarily interested in gaining public offices. Despite this mistrust, Paraná showed resilience in fending off threats and overcoming <b>obstacles</b> <b>and</b> setbacks. However, in September 1856, at the height of his career, he died unexpectedly, although the cabinet survived him until May 1857.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} heritabilities and to compare data transformation methods and models for Hungarian Sporthorse show jumping results. The analysis is based on data collected between 1996 and 2005. The linear animal model included fixed effects of gender, breeder, rider, age, and start (coded as year of competition, type of competition <b>and</b> height of <b>obstacle).</b> Square root, cubic and fourth roots, Blom score and cotangent transformed ranks were used as measurements of performance. Difference the height of the <b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> fault points, height of the <b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> height of the <b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> fault point were also used as performance traits. Variance and covariance components were estimated with VCE- 5 software package. Model fit was evaluated by log-likelihood values and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC).

40|$|The effects {{involved}} in the interaction between an <b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> a space plasma can be divided into: (1) effects on the obstacle itselt (i. e., its charging); and (2) effects on the environmental plasma due to {{the motion of the}} obstacle (i. e., the creation of shocks ahead of the <b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> complicated wakes behind the obstacle). In the wake (or antisolar direction), plasma oscillations are excited and instabilities, wave-particle interactions, turbulence, etc., are believed to take place. The effects on the <b>obstacle</b> <b>and</b> on the environmental space plasma are coupled. Hence, simultaneous solutions to the Vlasov (or Boltzmann) and Poisson equations are sought. To obtain realistic solutions of practical use, three-dimensional and time-dependent models of the interaction are needed. Achieving the latter is indeed not simple...|$|R
