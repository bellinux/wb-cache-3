40|$|Managed aquifer {{recharge}} {{and recovery}} (MAR) is {{a reliable and}} proven process, in which water quality can be improved by different physical, biological, and chemical reactions during soil passage. MAR can potentially {{be included in a}} multi-barrier treatment system for <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> (OMP) removal in drinking water treatment and wastewater reuse schemes. However, {{there is a need to}} develop assessment tools to help implement MAR as an effective barrier in attenuating different OMPs including pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors. In this study, guidelines were developed for different classes of organic micropollutants, in which removal efficiencies of these compounds are determined as a function of travel times and distances. Moreover, a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) based model was proposed to predict the removals of organic micropollutants by MAR. The QSAR approach is especially useful for compounds with little information about their fate during soil passage. Such an assessment framework for <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> removal is useful for adapting MAR as a multi-objective (-contaminant) barrier and understanding different classes of compounds during soil passage and the determination of post treatment requirements for MAR. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Drinking water {{utilities}} in Europe {{are faced}} with a growing presence of <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> in their water sources. The aim of this research was to assess the robustness of a drinking water treatment plant equipped with reverse osmosis and subsequent activated carbon filtration for the removal of these pollutants. The total removal efficiency of 47 <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> was investigated. Results indicated that removal of most <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> was high for all membranes tested. Some selected micropollutants were less efficiently removed (e. g. the small and polar NDMA and glyphosate, and the more hydrophobic ethylbenzene and napthalene). Very high removal efficiencies for almost all <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> by the subsequent activated carbon, fed with the permeate stream of the RO element were observed except for the very small and polar NDMA and 1, 4 -dioxane.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of some organic micropollutants in the abiotic compartments water, {{particulate matter}} and bottom sediments of the Scheldt estuary, S. W. Netherlands, was studied between 1986 and 1989. Special attention {{was given to}} two individual PolyChlorinated Biphenyl congeners (PCB 52 and PCB 153), two Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) fluoranthene and benzo(a) pyrene and y-HCH. Dissolved PCBs and y-HCH behave conservatively during estuarine mixing. The concentration of y-HCH in the freshwater is extremely high in spring {{compared to the other}} seasons. Dissolved fluoranthene does not behave conservatively. The concentration of dissolved fluoranthene in the freshwater endmember shows a seasonal dependence with highest concentrations in winter and lowest in summer. Benzo(a) pyrene could hardly be detected in the dissolved phase with the methods used. PCBs and PAHs in particulate matter and sediments behave essentially conservatively {{as a result of the}} mixing of riverine particulates with high, and marine particulates with low <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> contents. Particulate fluoranthene is removed at low salinities under (nearly) anoxic conditions probably by microbial degradation. The rivers Scheldt and Rupel appear to be the major sources for the compounds studied. However, in particular the <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> contents of the sediments indicate that important emissions along the estuary were or are still present. Measurements of individual PCBs and PAHs in the < 63 µm fraction of a dated sediment core from a salt marsh in the eastern part of the Scheldt estuary show that the recent input of PCBs and PAHs into the estuary is probably 2 - 3 times lower than the maximum input in the mid- 1960 s. The PCB profile shows post-depositional congener-selective mobilization caused by advective transport. The PAH assemblage is remarkably uniform in the sediment core. The PAH ratios indicate that combustion of coal is the main source of PAHs in the Scheldt estuary...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the context}} of the Water Framework Directive, the need to {{identify}} new monitoring tools in support of the traditional chemical monitoring process is emerging. Chemical characterization by itself does not provide specific biological information about potential hazards to organisms, in particular when facing cocktails of contaminants. Therefore, ecotoxicity tests can represent a useful tool supporting the chemical information. In the present work, the value of ecotoxicity tests as an effect-based tool for monitoring freshwater and sediment quality of the south-western basin of Lake Como (Northern Italy) was evaluated, assessing the potential risk of pollutants. Results obtained from D. magna toxicity tests showed a temporal variation of toxic response in relation to the variability of <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> load characteristics of urban rivers. Sediment ecotoxicity test data showed the spatial variability of the sediments’ contamination within the lake, confirmed by chemical analysis of two classes of pollutants (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorobiphenyls (PCB)).

BAC led to greater removal of dissolved organic carbon (43 %) than BAF (30 %) which in turn was greater than SF (24 %). All biological filtration systems could effectively remove most of the selected <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants,</b> {{and there was a}} greater removal of these micropollutants by BAC (76 - 98 %) than BAF (70 - 92 %) or SF (68 - 90 %). It was found that all treatment was effective for removal of the hydrophobic (log D> 3. 2) and readily biodegradable <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants.</b> The major mechanism for the removal of these molecules was biodegradation by the micro-organism and sorption by the biofilm. Compared to <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> removal, there was a lower removal of PFASs by all treatments, and BAF and SF had a considerably lower removal than BAC treatment. The better removal for all molecule types by BAC was due to additional adsorption capacity by the activated carbon.

One of the barriers to obtaining high quality water from wastewater arises from the presence of <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants,</b> which are biologically active at trace levels.

The role of aerosol deposition in the transport of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) and polybromodiphenyls ethers (PBDEs) to water and soil systems has been evaluated by measuring their concentrations in wet and dry depositions to the Venice Lagoon. The <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> flux data indicate that they contribute to the total deposition flux in different ways through wet and dry deposition, showing that the prevalent contribution derives from wet deposition.

40|$|The {{rejection}} of <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants,</b> including three {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) and three phthalic acid esters (PAEs), by clean and fouled nanofiltration membranes was investigated in the present study. The {{rejection of}} <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> by clean NF 90 membranes varied from 87. 9 to more than 99. 9 %, while that of NF 270 membranes ranged from 32. 1 to 92. 3 %. Clear time-dependence was observed for the rejection of hydrophobic micropollutants, which was attributed to the adsorption of micropollutants on the membrane. Fouling with humic acid had a negligible influence on the rejection of <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> by NF 90 membranes, while considerable effects were observed with NF 270 membranes, which are significantly looser than NF 90 membranes. The observed enhancement in the rejection of <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> by fouled NF 270 membranes was attributed to pore blocking, which was a dominating fouling mechanism for loose NF membranes. Changes in the ionic strength (from 10 to 20 [*]mM) reduced micropollutant rejection by both fouled NF membranes, especially for the rejection of dimethyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate by NF 270 membranes (from 65. 8 to 25. 0 % for dimethyl phthalate and 75. 6 to 33. 3 % for diethyl phthalate) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> in ground- and surface waters {{has become an}} important concern for the drinking water industry, mainly because of possible related health effects. Due to the polar nature {{of some of these}} pollutants, they are not completely removed by traditional water treatment barriers. This paper offers an overview of priority <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> and their occurrence in Flemish and Dutch water sources. Furthermore, rejection by nanofiltration is qualitatively predicted for the selected priority micropollutants. The qualitative prediction is based on the values of key solute and membrane parameters in nanofiltration. Predicted values are then compared with experimental values obtained from literature. Overall, the qualitative predictions are roughly in agreement with literature values. Prediction based on key parameters may thus prove to be a very quick and useful technique to assess the implementation of nanofiltration as a treatment step for <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> in drinking water plant design.

40|$|We {{present a}} process model that predicts {{the removal of}} the {{antibiotic}} micropollutants, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), tetracycline (TCY), and ciprofloxacin (CIP), in an activated sludge treatment system. A novel method was developed to solve the inverse problem of inferring process rate, sorption, and correction factor parameter values from batch experimental results obtained under aerobic and anoxic conditions. Instead of spiking the batch reactors with reference substances, measurements were made using the xenobiotic <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> content of preclarified municipal sewage. Parent compound formation and removal were observed, and the model developed using the simulation software West showed limited efficiency to describe the selected micropollutants profiles, when growth substrate removal occurs. The model structure was optimized by accounting for competitive inhibition by readily biodegradable substrates on the cometabolic micropollutant biotransformation processes. Our results suggest that, under anoxic conditions, hydrophobicity-independent mechanisms can significantly impact solid-liquid partitioning that our model takes into account by using the sorption coefficient as a lumped parameter. Forward dynamic simulations were carried out to evaluate the developed model and to confirm it for SMX using data obtained in a full-scale treatment plant. Evaluation of measured and simulation results suggest that, robust model prediction can be achieved by approximating the influent load of chemicals biodegrading via a given parent compound, e. g., human conjugates, as an antibiotic mass that is proportional to the parent compound load. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|High {{throughout}} {{screening method}} has gained attractive prospects {{because it offers}} a fast and effective approach to obtain a holistic picture of <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> (OM) pollution in a site specific environment. However, reliability and usefulness of the generated data sets for OM pollution profiles and occurrence levels have not been fully evaluated. In this paper, we screened 1030 OMs in surface water and sediments from the selected rivers of the Liaohe River watershed to (1) examine the usefulness of using qualitative data to gain insights into source identification and (2) further evaluate {{the reliability of the}} semi-quantification results in a filed study. The results showed that 81 and 89 OMs at concentrations up to 5670 ng/L and 6714 ng/g were identified in surface water and sediments, respectively. Qualitative data could be used to identify the similarity (or dissimilarity) of pollution sources at different locations for surface water, which could provide insights for source back tracking of water contamination. Accuracy tests showed that our semi-quantification results agree well with those from previously reported values and our target analysis. Though our results for the majority of newly quantified OMs need to be further confirmed, we have demonstrated that this method is suitable for understanding the pollution characteristics and occurrence levels of OMs in the environment for environmental scientists and managers.

40|$|Zeolites {{with a high}} Si/Al ratio {{can be used as}} {{selective}} adsorbents {{in water}} treatment, targeting organic micropollutants which are removed poorly with activated carbon. Due to size exclusion, many Natural Organic Matter (NOM) components cannot access the pores, thus limiting adsorption competition between <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> and NOM. Furthermore, zeolite channel diameters are close to molecule diameters, which results in strong van der Waals interaction. MOR 200 and ZSM 5, the two most hydrophobic zeolites, showed the highest removal of neutral nitrosamines in demineralised water, with higher efficacy than activated carbon. DAY and MOR 30, which were relatively hydrophilic zeolites, did not show appreciable removal of any of the nitrosamines. When nitrosamines were adsorbed from surface water, there was no influence of competition with, or pore blockage by, NOM components on nitrosamine removal for ZSM 5 zeolite, in contrast to activated carbon. Repulsion of negatively charged pharmaceuticals was significant for ZSM 5, which had a Si/Al ratio of 80. MOR 200 had a Si/Al ratio of 200, indicating a lower Al content than ZSM 5 and, as such, a lower negative surface charge. Charge effects were not observed for MOR 200. A relationship was found between the Stokes diameter of the pharmaceuticals and nitrosamines, and their removal by ZSM 5 and MOR 200, indicating that a "close fit" adsorption mechanism is more likely than hydrophobic interaction in these zeolites. Due to their selective nature, adsorption on zeolites should only be considered as an additional treatment step to existing processes, dedicated for the removal of specific organic micropollutants. Less specific treatment techniques, such as activated carbon filtration, are still required to ensure a broad barrier for organic micropollutants in water treatment. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

From the studied <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> a substantial removal of the following compounds has been found: - Substituted benzenes: p-dichlorobenzene (ca. 80 % decrease), o-dichlorobenzene 70 %, nitrobenzene (70 - 80 %) and p-chloronitrobenzene (60 - 80 %). - Pesticides: 2, 4 -D (r. b. d.), MCPA (r. b. d.), Mecoprop (r. b. d), Fenoprop (60 %) en TCA (50 %). - Complexing agents: NTA (75 - 85 %).

The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the changes in chemical composition occurring on the MnOx(s) surface after reaction with <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> using X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy and solution chemistry analyses. Laboratory batch experiments were conducted to assess the reactivity of MnOx(s) with aniline, triclosan, phenol and bisphenol A. Analyses of XPS high resolution scans through the determination of the shape and position of Mn 3 p spectra and Mn 3 s multiplet splitting suggest that Mn(III) and Mn(II) increase in the surface of MnOx(s) reacted with organics, indicating that organic oxidation causes the reduction of MnOx(s). Impurities on MnOx(s) surface (eg. other metal oxides) decrease the micropollutant removal efficiency. After the rapid initial oxidation of micropollutants, the availability of surface sites was found to be a major factor influencing the long-term reaction rates. Aniline and Bisphenol A were still detectable after reaction completion due to surface sites being irreversibly occupied by reaction products or impurities.

There is very little information on the reaction mechanism or reaction-path dynamics of atmospheric degradation of halogenated benzenes. Furthermore, the measured reaction rate constants are missing for the range of environmentally relevant temperatures, i. e. 230 - 330 K. A series of recent theoretical studies have provided those valuable missing information for fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene, hexafluorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene. Their comparative analysis has provided additional and more general insight into the mechanism of those important tropospheric degradation processes as well as into the mobility, transport and atmospheric fate of halogenated aromatic systems. It was demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the addition of hydroxyl radicals to monohalogenated as well as to perhalogenated benzenes proceeds indirectly, via a prereaction complex and its formation and dynamics have been characterized including the respective transition-state. However, in fluorobenzene and chlorobenzene reactions hydroxyl radical hydrogen is pointing approximately to the center of the aromatic ring while in the case of hexafluorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene, unexpectedly, the oxygen is directed towards the center of the aromatic ring. The reliable rate constants are now available for all environmentally relevant temperatures for the tropospheric oxidation of fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene, hexafluorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene while pentachlorophenol, a well-known <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant,</b> seems to be a major stable product of tropospheric oxidation of hexachlorobenzene.

Two possibilities concern the direct treatment of pretreated Rhine River water (C/S/F) by reverse osmosis, without soil passage. In scheme 1, the RO feedwater is pretreated by ozonation, biologically activated carbon filtration and slow sand filtration. In scheme 2 only slow sand filtration is applied as pretreatment of the RO feedwater. To avoid scaling problems with BaSO 4 and CaCO 3, the RO feedwater was acidified with HCl up to a LSI in the concentrate of 0. 0 and the RO units were operated with a recovery of 85 %. The use of an anti-scalant (Flocon 100) in combination with H 2 SO 4 dosage (LSI in the concentrate 2. 0) and a recovery of 90 % was also successful to control scaling, but this operation mode resulted in severe biofouling as the anti-scalant acted as a nutrient for microbial regrowth in the membrane elements. Both pretreatment schemes resulted in an excellent RO feedwater quality with respect to MFI, DOC, AOC and BFR (biofilm formation rate) with an accompanying very stable operation of the RO units. Over a period of 11 months the MTC of the RO units only showed a decrease of 16 % and 23 % for pretreatment schemes 1 and 2, respectively, while the differential pressure remained constant. Pretreatment scheme 1 is preferred above pretreatment scheme 2 as it results in additional capacity related to disinfection and <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> removal.

40|$|Hybrid {{processes}} combining {{activated carbon}} and nanofiltration {{have been studied}} to identify the optimum solution for advanced wastewater treatment in high quality water reclamation and reuse. With {{a focus on the}} removal of bulk and trace organic compounds the investigation identified three promising process combinations, namely powdered activated carbon followed by nanofiltration (PAC/NF), granular activated carbon followed by nanofiltration (GAC/NF) and nanofiltration followed by granular activated carbon (NF/GAC). The removal potential was examined in lab and pilot scale for a range of refractory pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals typically detected in effluent in trace concentrations ranging from ng/L to ìg/L. Fluorescence excitation emission spectroscopy was employed for the investigation of the fate of effluent organic matter. The optimum strategies for operation of the hybrid processes were determined in pilot scale. The experiments were conducted at the Wastewater Treatment Plant Aachen Soers providing an effluent of high quality with low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of about 5 mg/L. In comparison to a single stage NF or a single adsorption stage, all three hybrid processes provide a superior product quality with DOC concentrations clearly below 0. 5 mg/L and <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> concentrations close or below the limit of quantification. If a high degree of salinity removal is not required, nanofiltration-activated carbon hybrid processes can be regarded as a reliable and economic alternative to dual membrane processes (ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis). They are well suited for high-grade water reuse applications. Due to lower filtration pressures the hybrid processes feature lower energy consumption and produce less problematic concentrates mainly consisting of organics and multivalent ions which can be precipitated. They feature also some advantages in indirect potable reuse applications such as managed aquifer recharge since the salt content of the product water is closer to natural conditions. The optimum combination of nanofiltration and activated carbon depends on local boundary conditions such as size of plant, raw water characteristics and plant location. In the light of growing water scarcity and increasing concerns about organic micropollutants activated carbon treatment in combination with nanofiltration {{has the potential to be}} applied in an increasing number of cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> are usually low in wastewaters (order of magnitude of mg L− 1). However, their emission standards, {{especially in the}} case of carcinogenic and bioaccumulating substances, are often much lower (order of magnitude of μg L− 1). Since these substances, in some cases, can be adsorbable or volatile, their removal via volatilization, biodegradation or sludge adsorption in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) becomes a significant feature to include in the usual design process, in order to verify the emission standards in gas and sludge too. In this study a simple screening batch test for the evaluation of the fate of <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> in water, air and sludge is presented. The test is set up by means of simple laboratory instruments and simulates an activated sludge tank process. In this study the results obtained for four substances with different chemical properties (i. e. toluene, benz(a) anthracene, phenol and benzene) are presented. The screening test proposed can be a useful tool to assess in about one month the fate of <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutants</b> in an activated sludge tank of a WWTP. Moreover, the test can constitute a useful support in the use of mathematical models, since it allows the verification of model results and the calibration of the reactions involved in the removal process...|$|R

40|$|This poster {{describes}} {{a pilot study}} to develop the sampling methodology required to investigate the occurrence and distribution of “emerging organic contaminants” in groundwater {{in an area of}} anticipated contamination. The study site was the BGS Oxford Observatory on the Port Meadow, within a peri-urban setting, including an area of ancient grassland on the gravels of the flood plain of the River Thames to the northwest of Oxford. Groundwater levels suggest that the regional groundwater flow in the superficial deposits is from northeast to southwest under the main Thames. The site is periodically inundated and groundwater is predominantly reducing. The meadow is flanked on its eastern edge by a closed landfill which accepted all categories of waste from 1937 up to 1980. The leachate plume can be identified across the site by high conductivity, Cl, HCO 3, SO 4 and DOC. Part of the landfill is now used as allotments. A series of shallow piezometers were sampled in July 2011 for organic micropollutants from the plume, upgradient in the meadow and towards the urban area, across the river and from the river. Samples were collected using a small peristaltic pump equipped with new PTFE tubing. Great care was taken to flush the pumping system with sample and to avoid contamination of the pump or collection bottles. Samples were analysed by the Environment Agency NLS using the semi-quantitative GCMS screening method developed for their <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> monitoring programme. The results showed that organic micropollutants were present at all sites and included both priority pollutants and emerging contaminants. A total of 26 compounds were detected with N-butyl benzene sulphonamide (BBSA) being both the most frequently detected compound and with the highest maximum concentration. Four priority pollutants were detected, trichloroethene, octyl phenol, anthracene and fluoranthene, and one pesticide, metaldehyde. Some discrimination was evident with the Thames and urban areas showing a different fingerprint from the landfill plume: •	Urban sites upgradient of the landfill: phthalate and BBSA plasticisers, poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), triphenyl phosphate, anti-epileptic drugs •	Portmeadow site upgradient from the landfill: BBSA only •	Sites in the plume: trichloroethene, 1, 4 -dioxane, barbiturates, phthalate and BBSA plasticisers, metaldehyde, crotamitron •	Site across the river: 1, 4 -dioxane, phthalate and BBSA plasticisers, metaldehyde •	River Thames: phthalate and BBSA plasticisers, caffeine, anti-epileptic drugs, PAH The next phase of the project will investigate changes in the occurrence of organic micropollutants during the autumn and winter when groundwater levels are higher and there is floodplain inundation...|$|E
40|$|Human {{activities}} {{represent a}} significant {{burden on the}} global water cycle, with large and increasing demands placed on limited water resources by manufacturing, energy production and domestic water use. In addition to changing the quantity of available water resources, human activities lead to changes in water quality by introducing a large and often poorly-characterized array of chemical pollutants, which may negatively impact biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems, leading to impairment of valuable ecosystem functions and services. Domestic and industrial wastewaters represent {{a significant source of}} pollution to the aquatic environment due to inadequate or incomplete removal of chemicals introduced into waters by human activities. Currently, incomplete chemical characterization of treated wastewaters limits comprehensive risk assessment of this ubiquitous impact to water. In particular, a significant fraction of the organic chemical composition of treated industrial and domestic wastewaters remains uncharacterized at the molecular level. Efforts aimed at reducing the impacts of water pollution on aquatic ecosystems critically require knowledge of the composition of wastewaters to develop interventions capable of protecting our precious natural water resources. The goal of this dissertation was to develop a robust, extensible and high-throughput framework for the comprehensive characterization of organic micropollutants in wastewaters by high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometry. High-resolution mass spectrometry provides the most powerful analytical technique available for assessing the occurrence and fate of organic pollutants in the water cycle. However, significant limitations in data processing, analysis and interpretation have limited this technique in achieving comprehensive characterization of organic pollutants occurring in natural and built environments. My work aimed to address these challenges by development of automated workflows for the structural characterization of organic pollutants in wastewater and wastewater impacted environments by high-resolution mass spectrometry, and to apply these methods in combination with novel data handling routines to conduct detailed fate studies of wastewater-derived organic micropollutants in the aquatic environment. In Chapter 2, chemoinformatic tools were implemented along with novel non-targeted mass spectrometric analytical methods to characterize, map, and explore an environmentally-relevant “chemical space” in municipal wastewater. This was accomplished by characterizing the molecular composition of known wastewater-derived organic pollutants and substances that are prioritized as potential wastewater contaminants, using these databases to evaluate the pollutant-likeness of structures postulated for unknown organic compounds that I detected in wastewater extracts using high-resolution mass spectrometry approaches. Results showed that application of multiple computational mass spectrometric tools to structural elucidation of unknown organic pollutants arising in wastewaters improved the efficiency and veracity of screening approaches based on high-resolution mass spectrometry. Furthermore, structural similarity searching was essential for prioritizing substances sharing structural features with known organic pollutants or industrial and consumer chemicals that could enter the environment through use or disposal. I then applied this comprehensive methodological and computational non-targeted analysis workflow to micropollutant fate analysis in domestic wastewaters (Chapter 3), surface waters impacted by water reuse activities (Chapter 4) and effluents of wastewater treatment facilities receiving wastewater from oil and gas extraction activities (Chapter 5). In Chapter 3, I showed that application of chemometric tools aided in the prioritization of non-targeted compounds arising at various stages of conventional wastewater treatment by partitioning high dimensional data into rational chemical categories based on knowledge of organic chemical fate processes, resulting in the classification of organic micropollutants based on their occurrence and/or removal during treatment. Similarly, in Chapter 4, high-resolution sampling and broad-spectrum targeted and non-targeted chemical analysis were applied to assess the occurrence and fate of organic micropollutants in a water reuse application, wherein reclaimed wastewater was applied for irrigation of turf grass. Results showed that <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> composition of surface waters receiving runoff from wastewater irrigated areas appeared to be minimally impacted by wastewater-derived organic micropollutants. Finally, Chapter 5 presents results of the comprehensive organic chemical composition of oil and gas wastewaters treated for surface water discharge. Concurrent analysis of effluent samples by complementary, broad-spectrum analytical techniques, revealed that low-levels of hydrophobic organic contaminants, but elevated concentrations of polymeric surfactants, which may effect the fate and analysis of contaminants of concern in oil and gas wastewaters. Taken together, my work represents significant progress in the characterization of polar organic chemical pollutants associated with wastewater-impacted environments by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Application of these comprehensive methods to examine micropollutant fate processes in wastewater treatment systems, water reuse environments, and water applications in oil/gas exploration yielded new insights into the factors that influence transport, transformation, and persistence of organic micropollutants in these systems across an unprecedented breadth of chemical space.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the factors influencing the main removal mechanisms (adsorption and biodegradation) for <b>organic</b> <b>micropollutant</b> (OMP) removal during river bank filtration (RBF) {{and the possibility of}} developing a predictive model of this process for OMP removal during RBF. Chapter 2 analysed the sorption and biodegradation behaviour of 14 OMPs in soil columns filled with technical sand (representative of the first meter of oxic conditions in RBF systems. Breakthrough curves were modelled, based on the advection-dispersion equation, to differentiate between OMP sorption and biodegradation. Retardation factors (indicators for OMP sorption) for most compounds were close to 1, indicating little sorption of these compounds and thus the mobile behaviour of these compounds during passage in soils. The influence of active and inactive biomass (bio-sorption), sand grains and the water matrix on OMP sorption was found to be negligible under the conditions investigated in this chapter. Although trends were observed between charge or hydrophobicity of charged OMPs and their biodegradation rates, a statistically significant linear relationship for the complete OMP mixture could not be obtained using these physico-chemical properties. However, a statistically significant relationship was obtained between OMP biodegradation rates and the functional groups present in the molecular structure of the OMPs. The presence of ethers and carbonyl groups increased biodegradability, while the presence of amines, ring structures, aliphatic ethers and sulphur decreased biodegradability. Chapter 3 examined relationships between functional groups present in the molecular structure of a mixture of 29 OMPs (of which 11 were the same as in Chapter 2) and their biodegradation rates obtained from lab-scale soil columns and constructed a multi-linear regression model for biodegradation rate prediction based on this. This model was then validated with field data. In contrast to Chapter 2, where technical sand was used to fill the columns, lab-scale columns here were filled with soil from an operational RBF site. A statistically significant relationship was found between OMP biodegradation rate and the functional groups present in the molecular structures of the OMPs. OMP biodegradation rate increased in the presence of carboxylic acids, hydroxyl groups, and carbonyl groups, but decreased in the presence of ethers, halogens, aliphatic ethers, methyl groups and ring structures in the molecular structure of the OMPs. Differences between the predictive models obtained in Chapter 2 and 3 could be explained by the different soil types and water qualities used (Schie Canal water and technical sand in Chapter 2, Lek River water and soil from an operational RBF site in Chapter 3). The predictive model obtained from the lab-scale soil column experiment in Chapter 3 gave a good indication of biodegradability for approximately 70 % of the OMPs monitored in the field (80 % excluding the glymes). The model was found to be less reliable for the more persistent OMPs (OMPs with predicted biodegradation rates lower or around the standard error = 0. 77 d- 1) and OMPs containing amide or amine groups. These OMPs should be carefully monitored in the field, to determine their removal during RBF. Water quality was reported to be an important factor in OMP removal during soil passage, however it is unclear if this is the only important factor and therefore Chapter 4 explored the effect of soil type on OMP removal. Sorption and biodegradation behaviour of 20 OMPs was investigated in lab-scale columns filled with two different soil types and fed with the same water quality - the columns were simulating RBF under oxic conditions. Differences in retardation factors and OMP biodegradation rates were statistically not significant between the two soil types, although these soil types were characterized by a different cationic exchange capacity, organic matter and sand/silt/clay content. This result was supported by the microbial community composition (richness, evenness) of the two soils that became more similar {{during the course of the}} experiments as a result of feeding both columns with the same water quality. This indicates that microbial community composition and thereby OMP removal in soils is primarily determined by the aqueous phase (organic matter quantity and quality, nutrients) rather than the soil phase. These results imply that different RBF sites located along the same river may show similar OMP removal (in case of similar water quality and residence time). Chapter 5 investigated the effect of the water quality in more detail, and more precisely the effect of different organic carbon fractions (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, transphilic and the complete river water organic carbon) obtained from river water on the OMP biodegradation rate. Additionally, the effect of short-term OMP and DOC shock-loads (e. g. quadrupling the OMP concentrations and doubling the DOC concentration) on OMP biodegradation rates was investigated to assess the resilience of RBF systems to, for example, climate change. The results imply that – in contrast to what is observed for soil systems operating on wastewater effluent - OMP biodegradation rates during RBF are not affected by the type of organic carbon fraction (obtained from river water) fed to the soil column, in case of stable operation. No effect of a short-term DOC shock-load on OMP biodegradation rates was observed, for none of the different organic carbon fractions dosed. This means that the RBF site investigated in this chapter is resilient towards transient higher DOC concentrations in the river water (e. g. following a decrease in river discharge due to seasonal effects). However, a temporary OMP shock-load increased OMP biodegradation rates for the river water organic matter and hydrophilic organic carbon fractions. These increased biodegradation rates could not be explained by any of the parameters investigated in this chapter (ATP, DOC removal, SUVA, richness/evenness of the soil microbial population or OMP category (hydrophobicity/charge). The effect of redox condition on OMP biodegradation rate as well adaptive behaviour of a mixture of 15 OMPs (largely similar to the OMP mixtures used in Chapter 3, 4, and 5) in laboratory-scale soil columns fed with river water was analysed in Chapter 6. Dimethoate, diuron, and metoprolol showed redox dependent removal behaviour with degradation rates larger for the oxic zone compared to the suboxic/anoxic zone. OMPs that showed persistent behaviour in the oxic zone (atrazine, carbamazepine, hydrochlorothiazide and simazine) were also not removed under more reduced conditions. Adaptive behaviour was observed for five OMPs: dimethoate, chloridazon, lincomycin, sulfamethoxazole and phenazone. Newly developed, or existing, RBF sites exposed to these OMPs for the first time may require up to 9 months following start-up to reach full removal capacity. For some chemicals, such as dimethoate, even longer start-up times could be required since full removal capacity was not reached in our tests even after 15 months. The adaptation time observed for some OMPs could not be explained by their physico-chemcial properties (hydrophobicity, charge, molecular weight) or functional groups. Finally, adaptive behaviour of the biomass towards OMPs was found to be an important factor that should be incorporated in predictive models for OMP removal during RBF.
