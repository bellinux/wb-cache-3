5|$|At {{first light}} a {{clearing}} patrol from D Company, 3 RAR swept {{the area with}} tanks and APCs in support, killing and capturing a number of attackers that had been pinned down in old B-52 bomb craters {{to the north of}} Balmoral. The daylight revealed that the North Vietnamese had once again been soundly defeated leaving 42 dead and seven prisoners, while Australian losses were one killed and eight wounded. Quantities of weapons, clothing, ammunition and equipment were also recovered by the Australians. Phillips was subsequently awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during the battle. Many of the North Vietnamese dead were teenagers of 16 or 17 years, evidence that the PAVN had begun drafting 15-year-old boys into its combat units; as had happened after the earlier fighting, their bodies were collected by a bulldozer and buried in a mass grave. Later, a large number of shell scrapes were discovered to the north-east of Balmoral during an aerial reconnaissance by a Sioux light <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter,</b> and they were thought likely to have been used by the North Vietnamese as an assembly area before being engaged by artillery firing defensive fire tasks early in the battle. The successful defence of Balmoral and the high ratio of North Vietnamese killed had confirmed the judgement of MacDonald and Dunstan and validated the decision to adopt an aggressive defence with strong static positions and forceful patrolling. The failed assault proved to be the final attempt to remove 1 ATF from AO Surfers, and there were no further attacks by the North Vietnamese against either Coral or Balmoral.|$|E

50|$|By {{nature of}} the mission, the <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter's</b> primary weapons are its sensor suite and {{communications}} equipment. Early <b>observation</b> <b>helicopters</b> were effective at calling for artillery fire and airstrikes. With modern sensor suites, they are also able to provide terminal guidance to ATGWs, laser-guided bombs and other missiles and munitions fired by other armed aircraft. <b>Observation</b> <b>helicopters</b> may also be armed with combinations of gun and rocket pods and sometimes anti-tank guided missiles or air-to-air missiles, but in smaller quantities than larger attack helicopters. Primarily, these weapons were intended for the counter-reconnaissance fight—to eliminate an enemy's reconnaissance assets—but {{they can also be}} used to provide limited direct fire support or close air support.|$|R

25|$|On October 14, 1960, the United States Navy {{solicited}} {{response from}} 25 aircraft manufacturers {{to a request}} for proposals (RFP) {{on behalf of the}} Army for the Light <b>Observation</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (LOH). Bell entered the competition along with 12 other manufacturers, including Hiller Aircraft and Hughes Tool Co., Aircraft Division. Bell submitted the D-250 design, which would be designated as the YHO-4. On May 19, 1961, Bell and Hiller were announced as winners of the design competition.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, {{prior to}} {{full-time}} production, Hughes provided five preproduction Model 269 examples to the U.S. Army for evaluation {{as a light}} <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> to replace the aging OH-13 Sioux and OH-23 Raven. Designated as the YHO-2HU the helicopter was eventually turned down. 9 April 1959, the 269 received certification from the FAA and Hughes continued to concentrate on civil production.

25|$|The first Bell 206A flew on January 10, 1966, and the {{aircraft}} was revealed later that {{month at the}} Helicopter Association of America (HAA) convention. On October 20, 1966, the JetRanger received FAA certification. Delivery of the JetRanger to customers began on January 13, 1967, with the first aircraft being purchased by Harry Holly, CEO of the Hollymatic Corporation and previous owner of a Bell Ranger. In 1968, the United States Navy selected the 206A as its primary trainer, the TH-57 Sea Ranger. The Army also eventually selected the 206A for a light <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> as the OH-58 Kiowa.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its use an <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter,</b> {{it can also be}} armed with various munitions to directly participate in combat; such weapons include a limited quantity of anti-tank missiles or air-to-air missiles for self-defense purposes. Several variants of the OH-1 have been proposed, these have included derivatives of the type to serve as an attack helicopter as well as an aborted project to develop utility helicopter based on OH-1. As of March 2014, a total of 38 OH-1s have entered service with the JGSDF, so far these have complemented the existing OH-6Ds rather than replaced them.|$|E
500|$|Over the {{following}} days 1 ATF continued patrolling, although these operations resulted in only small-scale {{contact with the}} North Vietnamese. On 27 May an Australian Sioux light <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> was damaged by ground fire during a reconnaissance flight [...] outside AO Newport, and air strikes on the area exposed several bunkers which were {{likely to have been}} used by the North Vietnamese as a headquarters; they were subsequently destroyed by artillery fire.|$|E

500|$|On 24 December 1962, Katangese forces {{attacked}} Ethiopian peacekeepers {{from several}} roadblocks and fired upon a UN <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter,</b> forcing it to land. An Indian {{member of the}} crew was mortally wounded while the rest were captured and beaten. Several other peacekeepers were shot and killed. Although UN troops limited their responses to self-defence, the attacks continued. On 27 December, in response to the increasing Katangese hostility, the ONUC Air Division issued Fighter Operations Order 16, directing UN aircraft to retaliate against Katangese aircraft mounting any attack (including against non-UN targets) and to shoot down any others deemed to be carrying [...] "visible offensive weapons, such as bombs or rockets".|$|E
500|$|The Boeing–Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche was {{intended}} to be an advanced five-blade armed reconnaissance and attack helicopter. The Comanche was specifically tailored to the role of armed scout to replace the U.S. Army's OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, which is an upgraded version of a Vietnam War-era <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter.</b> It was both smaller and lighter than the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter that it had been intended to accompany. The RAH-66 was powered by a pair of LHTEC T800 turboshaft engines, each capable of generating up to 1,563 hp (1,165 kW) of power. The RAH-66's fuselage was [...] long and composed of composite materials; it was designed to be capable of fitting more readily onto transport ships, enabling the Comanche to be more rapidly deployed to flash points and other rapidly-developing situations. However, in the event of strategic transport assets not being available, the rotorcraft's ferry range of [...] would have allowed it to fly itself to battlefields overseas on its own.|$|E
2500|$|The Gazelle {{originated}} in a French Army requirement for a lightweight <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> intended {{to replace the}} Aérospatiale Alouette III; {{early on in the}} aircraft's development, the decision was taken to enlarge the helicopter to enable greater versatility and make it more attractive for the export market. [...] In 1966, Sud Aviation began working on a light <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> to replace its Alouette II with seating for five people. [...] The first prototype SA 340 flew {{for the first time on}} 7 April 1967, it initially flew with a conventional tail rotor taken from the Alouette II. [...] The tail was replaced in early 1968 with the distinctive fenestron tail on the second prototype. Four SA 341 prototypes were flown, including one for British firm Westland Helicopters. On 6 August 1971, the first production Gazelle conducted its first flight. [...] On 13 May 1967, a Gazelle demonstrated its speed capabilities when two separate world speed records were broken on a closed course, achieving speeds of 307km/h over 3 kilometres and 292km/h over 100 kilometres.|$|E
25|$|In comparison, allied {{losses were}} light. US forces lost 72 killed and 337 wounded while South Vietnamese {{casualties}} amounted to 11 killed and 8 wounded.

2500|$|The Bell 206 is {{a family}} of two-bladed, single- or twin-engined helicopters, {{manufactured}} by Bell Helicopter at its Mirabel, Quebec plant. Originally developed as the Bell YOH-4 for the United States Army's Light <b>Observation</b> <b>Helicopter</b> program, it was not selected by the Army. Bell redesigned the airframe and successfully marketed the aircraft commercially as the five-place Bell 206A JetRanger. The new design was eventually selected by the Army as the OH-58 Kiowa. Bell also developed a seven-place LongRanger, which was later offered with a twin-engined option as the TwinRanger, while Tridair Helicopters offers a similar conversion of the LongRanger called the Gemini ST. The ICAO-assigned model designation [...] "B06" [...] is used on flight plans for the JetRanger and LongRanger, and the designation [...] "B06T" [...] {{is used for the}} twin-engined TwinRangers.|$|E
2500|$|Wilkerson {{arrived as}} an Army officer {{piloting}} an OH-6A Cayuse <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> and logged about 1100 combat hours over a year. He flew low and slow through Vietnam, and {{was involved in}} one incident in which he says he prevented a war crime by purposely placing his helicopter between a position that was full of civilians, and another helicopter that wanted to launch {{an attack on the}} position. He also had many vocal disagreements with his superiors and his own gunner crew over free-fire zones, including an incident in which one of his crew shot a wagon that wound up having a little girl inside it. He went on to Airborne School and Ranger School before receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature and graduate degrees in international relations and national security. He attended the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and later returned there to teach. [...] He later served as deputy director of the Marine Corps War College at Quantico.|$|E
2500|$|The rest of 6 RAR {{continued}} the search, with A Company discovering {{a series of}} freshly built and recently abandoned hides along the Viet Cong withdrawal route which were {{believed to have been}} prepared as delay positions. An older defensive position of approximately 40 pits was also found, while C Company located a makeshift hospital close by containing 14 graves. Both had recently been occupied. Later an Australian light <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> reported the presence of scattered groups of civilians, with the largest numbering 30 to 40 people—mostly women with baskets and bags, while others had ox carts—who were believed to be carrying medical supplies. These reports were followed up by the 1st APC Squadron and a number of military age males were detained for questioning. The infantry companies completed their search by midday, moving {{to the edge of the}} rubber plantation, [...] north-east of Long Tan. Smithfield concluded at 17:00 with the Australians returning to Nui Dat by helicopter and APC by 17:30. They had hoped to catch the remnants of the Viet Cong force before they could reach their mountain sanctuaries, but the operation proved unsuccessful in preventing their withdrawal. A number of Australian officers later questioned the caution with which it was conducted. Yet Jackson had been unable to mount a pursuit due to the continued threat posed by the 274th Regiment, which was still believed to be in the area. With 1 ATF lacking the resources required for such an operation, the opportunity to trap and destroy the Viet Cong while they were still vulnerable was lost and they made good their escape.|$|E
