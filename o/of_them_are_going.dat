25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E
2500|$|Thomson later {{recognized}} {{those aspects}} as {{being part of}} Altman's style, beginning with MASH (1970): [...] "MASH began to develop the crucial Altman style of overlapping, blurred sound and images so slippery with zoom {{that there was no}} sense of composition.

[...] Altman explained that to him such overlapping dialogue in his films was closer to reality, especially with large groups: [...] "If you've got fourteen people at a dinner table, it seems to me it's pretty unlikely that only two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be talking." [...] Pauline Kael writes that Altman, [...] "the master of large ensembles, loose action, and overlapping voices, demonstrates that [...] [...] [...] he can make film fireworks out of next to nothing." ...|$|E

They lack English servility, it is true--but they could acquire it, with practice. My quality travels ahead of me in the most mysterious way. I write my family name without additions, on the register of this hotel, and imagine that I am going to pass for an obscure and unknown wanderer, but the clerk promptly calls out, 'Front! show his lordship to four-eighty-two!' and before I can get to the lift there is a reporter trying to interview me as they call it.

They went up to the Basin bank and got lots of salt out of the holes in the barrels lying there, and then they ate all the apples they could hold, and after that they cut limber sticks off the trees, and {{sharpened}} the points, and stuck apples on them and threw them.
