5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.|$|E
500|$|Nava praised Beyoncé's {{acting in}} the commercial, stating: [...] "She's so scorchingly hot that even when she touches the floor with her {{dangerous}} high-heels, she kind of sets her world on fire." [...] In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, Beyoncé described the sexual tone of the video stating: [...] "'It's called Heat, so we wanted the ads to be really steamy and dewy. My sexiest moments are when I'm just getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> or the shower and I'm clean, so I wanted to incorporate that in the ads. The dress was this liquid-y satin. The song Fever I did years ago and always loved it. [...] I got to sing it a bit more whispery, more natural." [...] "Fever" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé on two different occasions. Knowles first recorded her version of [...] "Fever" [...] on September 9, 2003 for her film The Fighting Temptations. Before the release of Heat, she recorded [...] "Fever" [...] again for the fragrance's television commercial. After the launch of Heat, the latter version of the song was officially released as a promotional single to the US iTunes Store through Columbia Records on February 8, 2010, to promote the fragrance. It was made available digitally in the United Kingdom the following day.|$|E
2500|$|The wider U.S. {{economy was}} soon {{hit by the}} effects of the Trent crisis. On December 16, the actions of the British cabinet reached New York: the stock {{exchange}} fell across the board, with government securities dropping by 2.5 per cent and the sterling exchange rising by two points, and an overall suspension seemed imminent. On December 20, Salmon P. Chase's broker refused to sell some of the secretary's holdings of railway stock because they were almost worthless, and informed him that the business community [...] "trust you will have allayed this excitement with England: one war at a time is enough". A run on New York banks followed the stock market troubles, with $17,000,000 being withdrawn in three weeks, and on December 30 the banks voted by 25-15 to suspend specie payments. Banks across the country soon followed them, with only those of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky continuing to redeem in coin. This suspension left the Treasury unable to pay its suppliers, contractors or soldiers. Though the crisis was resolved soon afterwards, these difficulties were not: on January 10, Lincoln asked Quartermaster General Meigs [...] "General, what shall I do? The people are impatient; Chase has no money, and he tells me he can raise no more; the General of the Armies has typhoid fever. The bottom is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub.</b> What shall I do?" [...] The Treasury was eventually forced to issue fiat money in the form of [...] "greenbacks" [...] to meet its obligations.|$|E

60|$|The door opened, and {{a couple}} of men came in; over their shoulders, ere the door closed again, Mr. Caryll had a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landlady's rosy face, alarm in her glance.

One of them wore a ragged bob-wig--the cast-off, no doubt, of some gentleman's gentleman, fished <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sixpenny <b>tub</b> in Rosemary Lane; it was ill-fitting, and wisps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fellow's own unkempt hair hung out in places. The other wore no wig at all; his yellow thatch fell in streaks from under his shabby hat, which he had the ill-manners to retain until Lord Ostermore knocked it from his head with a blow of his cane.

6000|$|We [...] "hove" [...] our deep-sea-line by night, and the {{operation}} was very interesting, at least to me. In the first place, the vessel's heading was stopt; then, coiled away in a tub, like a whale-rope, the line was placed toward the after part of the quarter-deck; {{and one of the}} sailors carried the lead outside of the ship, away along {{to the end of the}} jib-boom, and at the word of command, far ahead and overboard it went, with a plunge; scraping by the side, till it came to the stern, when the line ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> like light.|$|E

50|$|Martha is {{now being}} accused <b>of</b> being <b>the</b> incubus. Lana enters the barn {{the next day to}} look for {{something}} in the barn, inside a toolbox for the tractor but all the doors and windows suddenly close, trapping her inside. In a panic, she searches for a way out but encounters a figure dressed in black. When escaping out the now open barn door, William's corpse swoops down at her, hanging from a rope. The police clean up the mess as the sheriff (Kevin Cooney) advises the three friends to leave town, as someone may be after them. However, Martha decides to stay where she is and buys a gun for protection. Multiple events follow, such as a snake being put into Martha's bathroom while she's taking a bath by an unseen figure who creeps in her house.

By these and other extravagances the genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of those whom they formerly despised, but who, through industry and frugality, have maintained their standing; in which case it appears plainly that, A plowman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees, as Poor Richard says.

60|$|Quietly but {{steadily}} did Mrs Dashwood {{pursue her}} work.

The gentle noise of washing, and the soft breathing of the sleepers, and the tiny ticking of the clock over the chimney-piece, were the only audible sounds, for London had reached its deadest hour, four o'clock. Rioters had exhausted their spirits, natural and artificial, and early risers had not begun to move.|$|E
60|$|Harris, as usual, {{was for the}} sea. He said he knew a yacht, {{just the}} very thing--one that we could manage by ourselves; no skulking lot of lubbers loafing about, adding to the expense and taking away from the romance. Give him a handy boy, he would sail it himself. We knew that yacht, and we told him so; we had been on it with Harris before. It smells of bilge-water and greens to the {{exclusion}} of all other scents; no ordinary sea air can hope to head against it. So far as sense of smell is concerned, one might be spending a week in Limehouse Hole. There is no place {{to get out of the}} rain; the saloon is ten feet by four, and half of that is taken up by a stove, which falls to pieces when you go to light it. You have to take your bath on deck, and the towel blows overboard just as you step <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub.</b> Harris and the boy do all the interesting work--the lugging and the reefing, the letting her go and the heeling her over, and all that sort of thing,--leaving George and myself to do the peeling of the potatoes and the washing up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stern all!" [...] The men backed their oars {{with all}} their might, {{in order to avoid}} the flukes of the wounded monster of the deep, as it plunged down headlong into the sea, taking the line out perpendicularly like lightning. This was a moment of great danger. The {{friction}} of the line, as it passed the loggerhead, was so great that Parr had to keep constantly pouring water on it, to prevent its catching fire. A hitch in the line at that time, as it flew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub,</b> or any accidental entanglement, would have dragged the boat and crew right down. Many such fatal accidents occur to whalers, and many a poor fellow has had a foot or an arm torn off, or been dragged overboard and drowned, in consequence of getting entangled. One of the men stood ready with a small hatchet to cut the line in a moment, if necessary, for whales sometimes run out all that is in a boat at the first plunge, and should none of the other boats be at hand, to lend a second line to attach to the one nearly expended, there is nothing for it but to cut. On the present occasion, however, none of these accidents befel the men of the captain's boat. The line ran all clear, and long before it was exhausted the whale ceased to descend, and the slack was hauled rapidly in.|$|E
