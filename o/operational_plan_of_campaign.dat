However emphasis in these industrial units is placed on manufacturing (production) schedule while the aspect <b>of</b> <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> utility system is largely ignored. In this article an integrated approach is presented that simultaneously undertakes shortterm scheduling of a multipurpose batch plant and <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> utility system.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the interdependence between the <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> level <b>of</b> development {{and the effectiveness of}} the production process. The <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> level <b>of</b> development has been measured by the scale of six intensity levels (1 – 6) to evaluate each of the eight targeted tasks (planning raw and materials, work planning, planning tools and equipment, capacity <b>planning,</b> termination <b>of</b> production, scheduling by work centres, drafting and launching of work documentation and various records terms and performance), while the effectiveness of the production process has been measured by the following indicators: productivity, stock turnover rate, capacity utilisation rate, delivery time and fallout ratio. The results have shown that enterprises with higher <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> level <b>of</b> development present better effectiveness of the production process in comparison to enterprises with less <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> level <b>of</b> development...|$|R

30|$|The growing {{installation}} {{of natural gas}} fired power plants has increased the integration of natural gas and electricity sectors. This has driven the need investigate the interactions among them and to optimize energy resources management from a centralized planning perspective. Thus, a combined modeling of the reservoirs involved in electric power and gas systems and their locations on both networks are essential features {{to be considered in}} the <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> energy resources. This paper presents a modeling and optimization approach to the <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> electric power and natural gas systems, taking into account different energy storage facilities, such as water reservoirs, natural gas storages and line packs of pipelines. The proposed model takes advantage of captures both energy systems synergy and their associated networks. This approach identifies the interactions between the energy storage facilities and their economic impact over their optimal scheduling. The results show the benefits <b>of</b> an integrated <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> electric power and natural gas systems, the close interdependency between the energy resources stored in both systems, and the effects of a combined scheduling.|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of determinant functions of value forming chain is solved by the subsystem of operational control of manufacturing. It {{is based on}} an <b>operational</b> <b>plan,</b> which represents the com- plex control instrument formed by the closely tied <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> sales, manufacturing and purchase. The system <b>of</b> <b>operational</b> <b>plans</b> has to be supplemented by the operational recording of manufactu- ring process, the actual methods of production control and the management of changes so that the operational control of manufacturing may fulfil the function of the complex instrument of the management that is capable to use all managerial principles and instruments in the basic sphere of value creation. Viewed {{from the standpoint of the}} relation marketing – production, by analogy production – purchasing or production – technical preparation of manufacturing (design and technology), the conception of the operational control of production constitutes the system basis that leads to solving latent and actual discrepancies between these functional spheres. The decisive section is the sub-system <b>of</b> <b>planning.</b> That concerns the systematically up-dated planning that ranges within the given dispositional conditions of a relatively short period. That is to say, in such basic spheres which participate directly in the generation of a final product and its assurance by supplier chain in relation to the external environment and inside a company. That means the <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> marketing (sales), <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing and <b>operational</b> <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> purchasing. The standardization is the assumption of the integration and flexibility <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> and control, namely, the exertion of system of standards, normative specifications and restrictions. The system of operational control of production is linked up directly with the economic management of inter- plant departments. The operational control of production has also the own checking system...|$|R
