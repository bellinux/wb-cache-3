25|$|Economic decline {{began in}} the 1950s, when {{high-grade}} iron ore ran out on the Iron Range north of Duluth; <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city's economy. Low-grade <b>ore</b> (taconite) <b>shipments</b> continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> were lower overall.|$|R
50|$|The Little Cottonwood {{district}} {{came into}} {{prominence in the}} 1870s with large <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> from the Emma Silver Mine, the Flagstaff Mine, the Emily Mine, and others.|$|R

50|$|Transport {{of goods}} {{also had to}} compete with the {{ever-increasing}} competition from trucks. Furthermore, traditional services such as coal and iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> declined with the changes in the overall economy.|$|R
5000|$|MORGAN The MORGAN mine east of Wakefield was {{developed}} in 1918-23 and made its first <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> on January 30, 1923. It operated until 1925 and shipped over fifty-eight thousand tons.|$|R
5000|$|In 1911 {{the first}} <b>shipment</b> of <b>ore</b> by train transpired. Before completion, the {{steamship}} Chittyna carried ore to the Abercrombie landing by Miles Glacier. Initial <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> contained [...] "72 percent copper and 18 oz. of silver per ton." ...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the early}} announcement, in 2008, the group loaded its first iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> bound for China. Fortescue {{have at least}} 10 Chinese steel mill {{contracts}} lasting for around 10 years. Baosteel was the first company to receive their iron ore.|$|R
2500|$|Operations at Yandi {{commenced}} in 1991, {{with the}} first <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> taking place in 1992. The plant was upgraded from 1994 to 2003 to its current capacity of 41 million tonnes annually. The mine consists of [...] 3 processing plants and two train loading facilities.|$|R
50|$|The first {{mining claim}} in the Park City {{district}} was staked in 1868, {{and the first}} <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> made in 1871. Prominent mines included the Flagstaff mine, Ontario mine, and Silver King mine. Ore occurs in veins and replacement deposits in sedimentary and igneous rocks.|$|R
50|$|The port of Narvik, {{high above}} the Arctic Circle was open for iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> all year round. But the stormy Atlantic coast of Norway also {{provided}} another extremely useful geological feature for Germany in her attempts to continue shipping the ore and beating the allied blockade.|$|R
5000|$|Over 519 {{million tons}} of waste {{material}} and 690 {{million tons of}} iron ore {{have been removed from}} the mine area since <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> began in 1895. The mine was listed as a National Historic Landmark, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 13, 1966.|$|R
5000|$|With <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> declining, the Port was revived in 1926 {{with the}} {{discovery}} of alluvial diamonds along the coast to the north and south of the town. A rush of prospectors and investment re-established Port Nolloth as a substantial service centre, even as copper shipments ceased altogether in 1944.|$|R
5000|$|WAKEFIELD Drill {{exploration}} {{began on}} the WAKEFIELD property in July 1912, and two shafts were down by the following summer. The first <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> was made on October 15, 1913. The WAKEFIELD soon became an open pit mine, shipping a total of almost fourteen million gross tons from 1913 to 1954.|$|R
50|$|Units {{which were}} {{eliminated}} voluntarily or due to isolation (such units may {{now take a}} free offensive before removal) may be rebuilt in the same turn for double BRP cost. Specialised units (e.g. paratroops) may be rebuilt after a 1-turn delay. Germany loses 5 BRPs from her UCL if <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> from Sweden are cut off.|$|R
50|$|The museum also {{contains}} a large collection of photographs and artifacts {{from the time of}} copper <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> between 1854 and 1920. With the development of mining, the Port Nolloth harbour became a greater significance as one of two harbours used for the export of copper ore and more importantly, for the import of food and capital equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Correspondingly, {{harbours}} {{and other}} infrastructure that are [...] "Chinamax-compatible" [...] are those at which such ships can readily dock. Unlike Suezmax and Panamax, Chinamax is not determined by locks or channels, or bridges—the Chinamax standard {{is aimed at}} port provisions and the name {{is derived from the}} massive dry-bulk (<b>ore)</b> <b>shipments</b> that China receives from around the globe.|$|R
25|$|As of October 2011, Vale {{plans to}} set up a {{transhipment}} project off Subic bay. In addition to bringing in many more jobs for locals, this is expected to boost other industries in Subic bay, and put Philippines on the world map of Iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipments.</b> It is also expected to boost local industries like travel, hotels ship supplies and provisions.|$|R
5000|$|COMET Captain Pentecost Mitchell found ore {{here and}} an {{exploration}} called the ECLlPSE was developed from 1886 to 1890. The COMET began in 1890 making its first <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> in August. The COMET {{was shut down}} in 1893 reopening in 1900 and operating until 1902 {{as part of the}} METEOR mine. It is credited with shipments of eighty-nine thousand tons in 1890-93.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{continue}} iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> from Duluth, the DM&N played {{a big part in}} developing the St. Louis Bay harbor. The railroad built new ore docks there, including its Dock No. 4 at 2304 ft long with a capacity of [...] The DM&N further dredged the bay to allow larger ore ships to reach its docks from 1905 to 1907.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>shipment</b> of iron <b>ore</b> {{for use in}} Australian Iron and Steel's new {{blast furnace}} was {{received}} from Whyalla, South Australia in 1928. The <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> of 5,500 tonnes had been mined by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company at Iron Knob in the Middleback Ranges. In 1952 the first Yampi-class bulk carriers delivered iron ore to Port Kembla, carrying maximum loads of 11,000 tonnes.|$|R
50|$|The Hulett machine revolutionised iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> on the Great Lakes. Previous {{methods of}} {{unloading}} lake freighters, involving hoists and buckets and much hand labor, cost approximately 18¢/ton. Unloading with Huletts cost only 5¢/ton. Unloading only took 5-10 hours, {{as opposed to}} days for previous methods. Lake boats changed to accommodate the Hulett unloader, and became much larger, doubling in length and quadrupling in capacity.|$|R
25|$|The D {{was formed}} in 1874 by Charlemagne Tower to haul iron ore from the Minnesota Iron Co. in Tower, Minnesota, to the new Lake Superior port of Two Harbors, Minnesota. On July 31, 1884, the D carried its first <b>ore</b> <b>shipment</b> from the Soudan Mine. In 1887, the D was {{acquired}} by Illinois Steel Company, which itself {{became part of the}} new United States Steel Corporation (USS) in 1901.|$|R
5|$|From {{the start}} of the war, a British {{blockade}} on shipments to Germany affected the Reich economy. The Germans were particularly dependent on foreign supplies of oil, coal and grain. To safeguard Swedish iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> to Germany, Hitler ordered an attack on Norway, which took place on 9 April 1940. Much of the country was occupied by German troops by the end of April. Also on 9 April, the Germans invaded and occupied Denmark.|$|R
25|$|Nazi Germany's war industry's {{dependence}} on Swedish iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> {{was the primary}} reason for Great Britain and their allies to launch their Operation Wilfred and the Norwegian Campaign in early April 1940. By early June 1940 the Norwegian Campaign stood as a failure for the allies, and by securing access to Norwegian ports by force, Nazi Germany could obtain the Swedish iron ore supply it needed for war production despite the British naval blockade.|$|R

50|$|S11D {{will use}} truckless mining; shovels and mobile crushers will {{work at the}} mine face and feed {{directly}} onto conveyor belts, which take the ore to processing facilities. This lowers environmental impact and also mitigates the difficulty of finding many skilled staff in a remote area. Iron ore will be transported by rail to the Ponta da Madeira port terminal, which is being expanded to handle a very large increase in iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipments.</b> 504 km of new railway is being built, along with upgrades to 226 km of rail already serving the Carajas mines.

Churchill planned to penetrate the Baltic with a naval force. This was soon changed to a plan involving the mining of Norwegian waters to stop iron <b>ore</b> <b>shipments</b> from Narvik and provoke Germany into attacking Norway, where it could be defeated by the Royal Navy. However, Chamberlain and the rest of the War Cabinet disagreed, and the start of the mining plan, Operation Wilfred, was delayed until 8 April 1940, a day before the successful German invasion of Norway.|$|R
