40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} whether courts in the United States demonstrate a trend in application preference for the intent test when ascertaining the validity of a liquidated damages clause in a construction contract. Judicial opinions, dating from 1853 to 1991, formed the population of study. Retrieval of archived judicial opinions are from official and unofficial legal reporters for the United States. Of the 223 selected appellate court cases, 175 met the population parameters. Data derived from these judicial opinions were statistically tested by: (a) the chi-square test statistic for a binomial <b>one-way</b> dimensional <b>classification,</b> and (b) the Stuart-Cox sign test for trend analysis of discrete data. Results of the chi-square test reveal that courts demonstrate a preferred pattern of movement away from applying the intent test when construing the validity of a liquidated damages clause. Based on the Stuart-Cox sign test, however, the current pattern of judicial application preference does not display the presence of a statistical trend for future application preference. Although the current application preference of the courts is in the direction do not apply the intent test to determine the validity of a liquidated damages clause, there is no presence of a statistical trend that would allow one to conclude that this is the preferred application of the judiciary in the future...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{pharmaceutical}} industry it is common practice to transfer analytical methods from one laboratory to other laboratories. An experiment or interlaboratory study is performed to estimate the repeatability, the intermediate precision, and the reproducibility of the analytical method. These measures of precision are quantified by appropriate sums of variance components from {{an analysis of variance}} model describing the structure of the data. In the literature, several methods have been described for calculating approximate (closed-form) confidence intervals on sums of variance components, i. e., Welch, Satterthwaite, and modified large-sample (MLS).

40|$|Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of {{covariance}} matrices are important statistics for multivariate problems in many applications, including quantitative genetics. Estimates of these quantities {{are subject to}} different types of bias. This article reviews and extends the existing theory on these biases, considering a balanced <b>one-way</b> <b>classification</b> and restricted maximum-likelihood estimation. Biases are due {{to the spread of}} sample roots and arise from ignoring selected principal components when imposing constraints on the parameter space, to ensure positive semidefinite estimates or to estimate covariance matrices of chosen, reduced rank. In addition, it is shown that reduced-rank estimators that consider only the leading eigenvalues and -vectors of the “between-group” covariance matrix may be biased due to selecting the wrong subset of principal components. In a genetic context, with groups representing families, this bias is inverse proportional to the degree of genetic relationship among family members, but is independent of sample size. Theoretical results are supplemented by a simulation study, demonstrating close agreement between predicted and observed bias for large samples. It is emphasized that the rank of the genetic covariance matrix should be chosen sufficiently large to accommodate all important genetic principal components, even though, paradoxically, this may require including a number of components with negligible eigenvalues. A strategy for rank selection in practical analyses is outlined...|$|E

Microfiche. xvi, 187 leaves, bound 29 cmUnder a null {{hypothesis}} of no treatment differences, and assuming ties can occur, tables are computed for exact probabilities of the ranges in the Wilcoxon method of multiple comparisons in the <b>one-way</b> <b>classification.</b> A total of 1399 exact cumulative probability tables of larger ranges for i = 2 and k = 2 (1) 6, i = 3 and k = 2 (1) 4, and i = 4 (1) 6 and k = 2 where i = {{number of groups}} and k = number of replications in each group were computed for all tie cases where up to 50 % of observations were involved in ties. Analyses {{of the distribution of}} the range of rank sums and their deviations from no-tie cases revealed the following points. 1. The results of an experiment can be different when ties occur-irrespective of the fact that ties are in the same treatment group. 2. The pair of probability distribution tables are identical for tie cases symmetrical about the mid-point of the serially ordered ranks, suggesting that ranks can be assigned to raw data in ascending or descending order. 3. Except for the symmetrical tie case pairs, probability distributions of the range of rank sums are different for different tie cases. 4. For tie patterns with one group of ties, the greater the number of tied observations, the greater the deviations in cumulative probability of the ranges from that of no-tie case. But this is not apparent when there are more than one group of ties. 5. When the total number of observations involved in ties is the same, deviations in cumulative probability of a fixed range tend to become less for the larger number of tie groups involved. 6. Although deviations at the α =. 01 level are less than those at the α =. 05 level which in turn are less than those at the α =. 1 level for most of the parameters of i and k this fact is not necessarily true in general. 7. Depending on the particular tie case, we can use the critical range for the no-tie case even if 50 % of the observations are involved in ties, while in some tie cases, we cannot accurately use the no-tie critical range even if only one-sixth of the observations are involved in ties. 8.

40|$|Parity {{gives an}} {{indication}} of physical maturity of cows. Physical maturity state of primiparous was 82 – 90 % while that for pluriparous was 100 %. In postpartum period, cows have a negative energy balance. Cows experiencing this condition will use the deposit glycogen in their liver and lipids in adipose tissue to be metabolized by liver become glucose. This experiment aimed at studying blood glucose at different parities of post-partum Fries Holland dairy cows. <b>One-way</b> <b>classification</b> design was use to observe 90 heads of post-partum dairy cows (30 heads of cows each in the first, the second and the third parity state. Data were analyze with General Linear Model (GLM) and the significant difference data among blood glucoses of the cows further analyzed with Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The {{results of the study}} showed that there was a significant (P< 0. 05) difference between blood glucose of the first parity state of cows (51. 57 ± 5. 56 mg/dL) compared to that of the second (45. 57 ± 8. 01 mg/dL) and the third (46. 7 ± 8. 62 mg/dL) cows. This was due to cows in the first parity is in growing state than in producing milk and reproduction function. Cows in the second and the third parities are in opposite function. Blood glucose profile at different parities of post-partum Fries Holland dairy cows was in the normal range (35 - 55 mg/dL). Blood glucose of the first parity of cows was higher (51. 57 ± 5. 56 mg/dL) compared to that in the second (45. 57 ± 8. 01 mg/dL) and the third cows (46. 7 ± 8. 62 mg/dL) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of contrarian, or value strategies - those {{that invest in}} stocks that have low market value relative to a measure of their fundamentals - continues to attract attention from researchers and practitioners alike. While there is much extant evidence on the profitability of value strategies, however, most of this evidence pertains to the US. In this paper, we provide a detailed characterisation of value strategies using data on UK stocks for the period 1975 to 1998. We first undertake simple one-way and two-way classifications of stocks in which value is defined using both past performance and expected future performance. Using sales growth {{as a proxy for}} past performance and book-to-market, earnings yield and cash flow yield as measures of expected future performance, we find that that stocks that have both poor past performance and low expected future performance have significantly higher returns than those that have either good past performance or good expected future performance. Allowing for size effects in returns reduces the value premium but it nevertheless remains significant. We go on to explore whether the profitability of value strategies in the UK can be explained using the three factor model of Fama and French (1996). Broadly consistent with the results for the US, we find that using the <b>one-way</b> <b>classification</b> the excess returns to almost all value strategies can be explained by their loading on the market, book-to-market and size factors. However, in contrast with the US, using the two-way classification there are excess returns to value strategies based on book-to-market and sales growth, even after controlling for their loading on the market, book-to-market and size factors.

40|$|Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] {{is widely}} grown in {{semi-arid}} tropics where local farmers {{depend on the}} adaptability of their rainfed crops to unpredictable drought and other stress factors. To investigate the effects of heterozygosity and heterogeneity on the adaptability of grain sorghum, two sets of material, each containing 12 parent lines, six single-cross hybrids, six two-component blends of parent lines, and six two-component hybrid blends were grown in eight macro-environments in the semi-arid Makueni District of Kenya, during 1991 through 1993. Environmental means for grain yield ranged from 584 to 47 g m- 2. In all environments, hybrids outyielded their parent lines, with a mean relative hybrid superiority of 54 %. Blending effects were non-significant. Combined analyses of variance were computed with logarithmically transformed data. Entry x environment interaction effects were more important than genetic effects. Lines in pure stand contributed most to the total entry x environment interaction variance. Wide ranges were found within all four groups for stability parameters derived from regression analysis. On average, hybrids in pure stand had most favorable values. Pattern analysis (classification and ordination techniques) {{was applied to the}} environment-standardized matrix of entry means from the individual environments. A <b>one-way</b> <b>classification</b> clearly distinguished homozygous from heterozygous entries. Heterogeneous entries were not consistently grouped together. Performance plots for different entry groups showed various patterns of adaptation and illustrated the superiority of heterozygous entries. The biplot from ordination underlined the importance of entry x type-of-drought-stress interaction. Principal Components 1 and 2 were highly correlated with entries' mean yield and regression coefficient, respectively. Breeding heterozygous cultivars could contribute to increased grain yields and improved yielding stability of sorghum in the target area of Kenya...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to analyze the effect of organic deodorant supplemented fermented laying hens manure feeding {{on the performance of}} 7 - 12 weeks male ducks. One hundred 7 weeks old male ducks were used to study the effetct MODF supplementation on performance of male ducks. The ducks were divided into five groups with four replications consisting of five birds each. The treatment were PO = commercial feed without MODF supplementation (control), P 15 = commercial feed + 15 % MODF, P 30 = commercial feed + 30 % MODF, P 45 = commercial feed + 45 % MODF, P 60 = commercial feed + 60 % MODF. Data were analyzed with <b>One-Way</b> <b>Classification</b> of Completely Randomized Design and followed by Duncan’s New Multiple Range Test (DMRT) for significant results. Results showed that supplementation of fermented MOD gave negative effect (P< 0. 05) on male ducks performance. The highest consumption was in P 0 (5203. 50 g), followed by P 45 % (5130. 00 g), P 30 % (5002. 75 g), P 15 % (4967. 75 g), P 0 % (4856. 75 g). The highest weight gain showed in P 0 (649. 80 g), followed by P 15 (622. 10  g), P 30 (579. 45 g), P 45 (497. 50 g), P 60 (409. 60 g). The higest feed convertion was in P 60 (12. 71), followed by P 45 (10. 31), P 30 (8. 64), P 15 (7. 99), P 0 (7. 48). It could be concluded that it is useless to supplement commercial diet of with MODF even though supplementation of 30 % income over feed cost (IOFC) showed better IOFC of 7 - 12 weeks male ducks.
