5|$|Regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> of juries, no {{player that}} throws a ball game; no player that {{undertakes}} or promises {{to throw a}} ball game; no player that sits in a conference {{with a bunch of}} crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced.

25|$|The defendants' cases {{took two}} paths.

They were convicted again, but the state supreme court overturned <b>the</b> <b>verdicts,</b> saying that discrimination against black jurors (the juries were all-white) was contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act <b>of</b> 1875. Because <b>the</b> lower court had not acted upon their cases {{for more than two years}} by April 1923, under Arkansas law the defendants were entitled to be released.

25|$|In {{cases where}} the Hof did not have {{original}} jurisdiction (i.e. {{in the vast majority}} of cases), people had to apply for justice to all kinds of local jurisdictions like e.g. city schepenbanken or vierscharen, baljuw (a county official) courts, and Heerlijkheid courts (courts of feudal lords with the privilege of high or low justice). Indeed, first jurisdiction by a local court was felt as an important privilege: the Jus de non evocando. Originally, no appeal was possible from verdicts of such courts, even in ordinaris procedures. But this soon caused resistance from losing parties, especially in cases of severe misconduct of the court. The resistance took the form of protests to county officials, called valsschelden van vonnissen, or faussement de jugement (appeal to falsity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>verdict),</b> on the ground that the judges had been corrupt, the law had been misinterpreted, or there had been mistakes in the procedure. Such appeals were formally lodged by county officials (in the interest of the law) and could result in a quashing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> and a fine for the offending judge.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{provide insight}} into {{practice}} and policy regarding <b>the</b> publication <b>of</b> disciplinary <b>verdicts</b> in Dutch health care. DESIGN: Descriptive. METHOD: The study covered all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> issued by disciplinary boards and courts of justice that {{were published in the}} Dutch the Staats-courant (Government Gazette) during the period 1995 - 2002. The following attributes were recorded for each verdict: year <b>of</b> publication and <b>verdict,</b> <b>the</b> disciplinary board concerned, the accused professional, <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> complainant, <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complaint and <b>verdict,</b> and <b>the</b> journals that were offered the decision. <b>The</b> published <b>verdicts</b> were related to <b>the</b> total number <b>of</b> <b>verdicts</b> and cases during the study period. Questionnaires were used to investigate <b>the</b> publication policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disciplinary boards. RESULTS: A total of 4 % of all verdicts were published in the Dutch Government Gazette (323 / 8902). The central disciplinary board decided to publish more often than the regional disciplinary boards (8 % and 2 %, respectively). There were considerable differences between the various regional disciplinary boards (range: 1 - 5 %). Per professional group <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> <b>verdicts</b> in cases that were published ranged from 2 % to 23 %. The decisions were offered to over 20 journals, but mainly to the Tijdschrift voor Gezondheidsrecht [Dutch Journal of Health Law] (TvGR; 92 %) and Medisch Contact [Medical Contact] (MC; 88 %). The TvGR published almost two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>verdicts</b> offered (63 %), and the MC published almost three-quarters (74 %). In the decision to publish, the disciplinary boards differed in their interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> 'general importance'. CONCLUSION: If disciplinary proceedings are to achieve the desired quality-promoting effect on professional practice, then more attention will need to be paid to the publication policy, and the disciplinary boards will have to develop a joint code of practice. More verdicts could be published, also in professional journal...|$|R
25|$|After the {{announcement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> {{of the trial}} the lawyers from the defence said that justice had not been done on Quasem {{and he did not}} get proper judgment.

Quasem's political Party Jamaat-e-Islami called for a nationwide three days strike as a protest over the verdict. He filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. The supreme court rejected the review petition on 30 August 2016, and Ali refused to seek clemency.|$|E

25|$|The 1992 Los Angeles riots, {{also known}} as the Rodney King riots, the South Central riots, the 1992 Los Angeles civil disturbance, the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest, and the Los Angeles uprising, were a series of riots, lootings, arsons, and civil {{disturbances}} that occurred in Los Angeles County, California in April and May 1992. The unrest began in South Central Los Angeles on April 29, after a trial jury acquitted four officers of the Los Angeles Police Department for usage of excessive force in the videotaped arrest and beating of Rodney King. It then spread throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area as thousands of people rioted over a six-day period following the announcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>verdict.</b>|$|E

On October 31, 2007, WBC, Fred Phelps and his two daughters, Shirley Phelps-Roper and Rebekah Phelps-Davis, were found liable for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. A federal jury awarded Snyder's father $2.9 million in compensatory damages, then later added a decision to award $6 million in punitive damages for invasion of privacy and an additional $2 million for causing emotional distress (a total of $10.9 million).

25|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} poor compared {{to his first}} season; his role in Juventus' attack changed, as he became less of a goalscorer and moved more to the sidelines, taking much part in the build-up play, especially as a target player, and his assist numbers increased. In the 2005–06 season, Juventus fans often got frustrated with him due to his anonymous presence in certain important games such as the Champions League defeat to Arsenal. Juventus were stripped of their last two Scudetti as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> from the Calciopoli scandal, and were relegated to Serie B. The new staff tried to persuade Ibrahimović and other top players to stay with Juventus, but the player and his agent were adamant to move on, with Raiola threatening legal action in order to extricate Ibrahimović from his contract.|$|E
25|$|News <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> drew {{widespread}} {{comment and}} {{criticism in the}} Scottish press. Such was the level of public and media interest {{in the outcome of}} the case, on 13 September 2007 the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament took the unusual step of allowing the then Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini, to address parliament on the matter. The Lord Advocate read a prepared statement to the chamber setting out the narrative of the Crown case and explaining her reasoning for deciding to prosecute. She is recorded in the official transcript of her address as saying that she was 'disappointed' with the result, and that she 'was of the clear opinion that the evidence that was made available to the court was sufficient to put before the jury to allow it the opportunity to decide on the case against Sinclair'.|$|E
25|$|At any {{stage of}} a trial before the Court before the return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>verdict,</b> the {{prosecution}} may inform the Court {{that it will not}} further prosecute the accused upon the charge. All proceedings on the charge against the accused are then stayed, and he or she is discharged. The prosecution may act in this manner for various reasons; for example, if it no longer believes that the accused committed the offence, if it feels that the case against the accused is weak, or if it is of the view that further investigations are required to gather evidence for its case. Unless the judge expressly directs otherwise, such a discharge does not amount to an acquittal. This means that if the prosecution is able to obtain additional evidence to bolster its case, it may bring criminal proceedings against the accused again at a later stage.|$|E
