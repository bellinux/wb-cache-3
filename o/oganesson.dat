5|$|Following the {{periodic}} trend, <b>oganesson</b> {{would be expected}} to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, <b>oganesson</b> may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of <b>oganesson</b> relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s2 electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of <b>oganesson.</b> It has also been calculated that <b>oganesson,</b> unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p3/2 level.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, Polish {{physicist}} Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on {{the fusion}} of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including <b>oganesson.</b> His calculations suggested {{that it might be}} possible to make <b>oganesson</b> by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, the {{periodic}} table has 118 confirmed elements, from element 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (<b>oganesson).</b> Elements 113, 115, 117 and 118, the most recent discoveries, were officially confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in December 2015. Their proposed names, nihonium (Nh), moscovium (Mc), tennessine (Ts) and <b>oganesson</b> (Og) respectively, were announced by the IUPAC in June 2016 and made official in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oganesson</b> is {{expected}} to have by far the broadest polarizability of all elements before it in the periodic table, almost double that of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it {{is expected}} that <b>oganesson</b> has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This {{is very different from the}} previously estimated values of 263K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that <b>oganesson</b> would be a gas under standard conditions, and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at standard conditions. If <b>oganesson</b> forms a gas under standard conditions nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions, even if it is monatomic like the other noble gases.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} the period 7 {{congener}} of the noble gases, <b>oganesson</b> (Og), is not known—it {{may or may not}} be a noble gas. It was originally predicted to be a noble gas but may instead be a fairly reactive solid with an anomalously low first ionisation potential, due to relativistic effects. On the other hand, if relativistic effects peak in period 7 at element 112, copernicium (as is thought to be the case), <b>oganesson</b> may turn out to be a noble gas after all, albeit more reactive than either xenon or radon. Regardless, <b>oganesson</b> is predicted to be a nonmetal, and probably the only one in period 7.|$|E
5|$|Calculations using a quantum-tunneling model {{predict the}} {{existence}} of several neutron-rich isotopes of <b>oganesson</b> with alpha-decay half-lives close to 1ms.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, some expect <b>oganesson</b> to {{have similar}} {{physical}} and chemical properties to other members of its group, most closely resembling the noble gas above it in the periodic table, radon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oganesson</b> has {{the highest}} atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. The {{radioactive}} <b>oganesson</b> atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the isotope 294Og have been detected. Although this allowed very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible compounds, theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including some surprising ones. For example, although <b>oganesson</b> {{is a member of}} group18 – the first synthetic element to be so – it may be significantly reactive, unlike all the other elements of that group (the noble gases). It was formerly thought to be a gas under normal conditions but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects. On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element and the last one of the 7th period.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oganesson</b> is {{a member}} of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common {{chemical}} reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. It is thought that similarly, <b>oganesson</b> has a closed outer valence shell in which its valence electrons are arranged in a 7s27p6 configuration.|$|E
5|$|All {{elements}} from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (<b>oganesson)</b> {{have been discovered}} or synthesized, with the most recent additions (nihonium, moscovium, tennessine, and <b>oganesson)</b> being confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2015 and officially named in 2016: they complete the first seven rows of the periodic table. The first 94 elements exist naturally, although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature. Elements with atomic numbers from 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors. Synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is being pursued. Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, Polish {{physicist}} Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on {{the fusion}} of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including <b>oganesson</b> and livermorium. His calculations suggested {{that it might be}} possible to make these two elements by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|No {{compounds}} of <b>oganesson</b> {{have been}} synthesized yet, but calculations on theoretical compounds {{have been performed}} since 1964. It is expected that if the ionization energy of the element is high enough, {{it will be difficult}} to oxidize and therefore, the most common oxidation state would be 0 (as for other noble gases); nevertheless, this appears not to be the case.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} generally {{classified as}} nonmetals include one element in group 1 (hydrogen); one in group 14 (carbon); two in group 15 (nitrogen and phosphorus); three in group 16 (oxygen, sulfur and selenium); most of group 17 (fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine); {{and all of}} group 18 (with {{the possible exception of}} <b>oganesson).</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1974, a few {{atoms of}} {{seaborgium}} were produced in laboratories {{in the former}} Soviet Union and in the United States. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, {{and it was not}} until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established seaborgium as the official name for the element. It is one of only two elements named after a living person at the time of naming, the other being <b>oganesson,</b> element 118.|$|E
5|$|The first 94 {{elements}} occur naturally; {{the remaining}} 24, americium to <b>oganesson</b> (95–118) occur only when synthesized in laboratories. Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are primordial and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements. No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) {{has ever been}} observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine (element 85); francium (element 87) has been only photographed {{in the form of}} light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} (historically also the inert gases) {{make up a}} group of {{chemical}} elements with similar properties; under standard conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity. The six noble gases that occur naturally are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and the radioactive radon (Rn). <b>Oganesson</b> (Og) is variously predicted to be a noble gas as well or to break the trend due to relativistic effects; its chemistry {{has not yet been}} investigated.|$|E
5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to <b>oganesson</b> have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|The element {{seaborgium}} {{was named}} after Seaborg by Albert Ghiorso, E. Kenneth Hulet, and others, who also credited Seaborg as a co-discoverer. It was named while Seaborg was still alive, which proved controversial. He influenced the naming of so many elements that with the announcement of seaborgium, it was noted in Discover magazine's review {{of the year in}} science that he could receive a letter addressed in chemical elements: seaborgium, lawrencium (for the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory where he worked), berkelium, californium, americium. Seaborgium is the first element ever to have been officially named after a living person. The second element to be so named is <b>oganesson,</b> in 2016, after Yuri Oganessian.|$|E
5|$|The first {{decay of}} atoms of <b>oganesson</b> was {{observed}} in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. Headed by Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, the team included American scientists of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California. On 9 October 2006, the researchers announced that they had indirectly detected {{a total of three}} (possibly four) nuclei of oganesson-294 (one or two in 2002 and two more in 2005) produced via collisions of californium-249 atoms and calcium-48 ions.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium has not {{yet been}} synthesised. Nevertheless, because it is only three {{elements}} away from the heaviest known element, <b>oganesson</b> (element 118), its synthesis may come in the near future; it is expected {{to be one of the}} last few reachable elements with current technology, and the limit may be anywhere between element 120 and 124. It will also likely be far more difficult to synthesise than the elements known so far up to 118, and still more difficult than elements 119 and 120. The team at RIKEN in Japan has plans to attempt the synthesis of element 121 in the future after its attempts on elements 119 and 120.|$|E
5|$|Ununennium and unbinilium ({{elements}} 119 and 120) are {{the lightest}} elements {{that have not}} yet been synthesized: all the preceding elements have been synthesized, culminating in <b>oganesson</b> (element 118), the heaviest-known element, which completes the seventh row of the periodic table. Attempts to synthesize elements 119 and 120 push the limits of current technology, due to the decreasing cross sections of the production reactions and their probably short half-lives, expected to be on the order of microseconds. Heavier elements would likely be too short-lived to be detected with current technology: they would decay within a microsecond, before reaching the detectors.|$|E
5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and <b>oganesson</b> (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|By definition, any two atoms with an {{identical}} number of protons in their nuclei {{belong to the}} same chemical element. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons (hydrogen-1, by far the most common form, also called protium), one neutron (deuterium), two neutrons (tritium) and more than two neutrons. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element hydrogen up to the 118-proton element <b>oganesson.</b> All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 (bismuth) is so slight as to be practically negligible.|$|E

Preliminary chemistry experiments have indicated this element {{may be the first}} superheavy element to show abnormal noble-gas-like properties, even though it is a member of group 14 on the periodic table. In October 2006, scientists from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory successfully created synthetically <b>oganesson</b> (Og), the seventh element in group18, by bombarding californium (Cf) with calcium (Ca).|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, the Joint Working Party of {{international}} scientific bodies International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) recognized the element's discovery and assigned {{the priority of}} the discovery to the Dubna–Livermore collaboration. This was on account of two 2009 and 2010 confirmations of {{the properties of the}} granddaughter of 294Og, 286Fl, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as the observation of another consistent decay chain of 294Og by the Dubna group in 2012. The goal of that experiment had been the synthesis of 294Ts via the reaction 249Bk(48Ca,3n), but the short half-life of 249Bk resulted in a significant quantity of the target having decayed to 249Cf, resulting in the synthesis of <b>oganesson</b> instead of tennessine.|$|E
5|$|The Danish {{physicist}} Niels Bohr was {{the first}} to seriously consider the possibility of an element with atomic number as high as 118, noting in 1922 that such an element would take its place in the periodic table below radon as the seventh noble gas. Following this, Aristid von Grosse wrote an article in 1965 predicting the likely properties of element 118. These were remarkably early predictions, given that it was not yet known how to produce elements artificially in 1922, and that the existence of the island of stability had not yet been theorized in 1965. It was 80 years from Bohr's prediction before <b>oganesson</b> was successfully synthesised, although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as the heavier congener of radon.|$|E
5|$|The team at RIKEN has {{listed the}} {{synthesis}} of element 121 among their future plans after their attempts to synthesise element 120 in 2017–2018 and element 119 in 2019–2020. Their attempts at the latter two involve targets of 248Cm with projectiles of 54Cr and 51V respectively; the reaction of 248Cm with 55Mn would produce the same isotopes of element 121 as the JINR's suggested reaction of 249Bk with 54Cr in the 3n (300Ubu) and 4n (299Ubu) channels. Before this, the RIKEN team had successfully produced livermorium (element 116) in the fusion of 248Cm with 48Ca, and will next try to produce new isotopes of <b>oganesson</b> (element 118) in the fusion of 248Cm with 50Ti.|$|E
5|$|The {{team at the}} Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, is {{planning}} to begin new experiments on the synthesis of ununennium and unbinilium using the 249Bk+50Ti and 249Cf+50Ti reactions in 2019 and 2020 using a new experimental complex. The team at RIKEN in Japan also plans to make attempts on these elements in 2017 through 2020 with 248Cm targets using the 248Cm+51V and 248Cm+54Cr reactions: following this, RIKEN plans to attempt the synthesis of unbiunium (element 121). The ion sources for the 51V and 54Cr beams necessary for the RIKEN experiments are under development; those for 50Ti are ready and the RIKEN team intends to first study the differences that arise from changing from 48Ca to heavier projectiles by the 248Cm+50Ti reaction aimed at producing new isotopes of <b>oganesson.</b>|$|E

5|$|Theoretical {{calculations}} done on {{the synthetic}} pathways for, and the half-life of, other isotopes have shown that some could be slightly more stable than the synthesized isotope 294Og, most likely 293Og, 295Og, 296Og, 297Og, 298Og, 300Og and 302Og. Of these, 297Og might provide the best chances for obtaining longer-lived nuclei, and thus might {{become the focus of}} future work with this element. Some isotopes with many more neutrons, such as some located around 313Og, could also provide longer-lived nuclei. Since these heavier isotopes greatly facilitate future chemical studies of <b>oganesson,</b> due to their expected longer half-lives, the Dubna team plans to conduct an experiment through the second half of 2017 with a heavier target containing a mix of the isotopes 249Cf, 250Cf, and 251Cf with 48Ca projectiles, aimed at the synthesis of the new isotopes 295Og and 296Og; a repeat of this reaction in 2020 at the JINR is planned to produce 297Og. The production of 293Og and its daughter 289Lv in this reaction is also possible. The isotopes 295Og and 296Og may also be produced in the fusion of 248Cm with 50Ti projectiles, a reaction planned at the JINR and at RIKEN in 2017–2018.|$|E
5|$|Three group 3 {{elements}} occur naturally, scandium, yttrium, {{and either}} lanthanum or lutetium. Lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior, while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium. While {{the choice of}} lutetium would be {{in accordance with the}} trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors, the choice of lanthanum is in accordance with the trends in the s-block, which the group 3 elements are chemically more similar to. They all are silvery-white metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, either actinium or lawrencium, has only radioactive isotopes. Actinium, which occurs only in trace amounts, continues the trend in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and yttrium. So far, no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element. Unbiunium (Ubu), which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by lanthanum and actinium, might be synthesized in the near future, it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known, <b>oganesson.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{calculated}} that the isotope 295Ts would have a half-life of 18±7milliseconds and {{that it may be}} possible to produce this isotope via the same berkelium–calcium reaction used in the discoveries of the known isotopes, 293Ts and 294Ts. The chance of this reaction producing 295Ts is estimated to be, at most, one-seventh the chance of producing 294Ts. Calculations using a quantum tunneling model predict the existence of several isotopes of tennessine up to 303Ts. The most stable of these is expected to be 296Ts with an alpha-decay half-life of 40milliseconds. A liquid drop model study on the element's isotopes shows similar results; it suggests a general trend of increasing stability for isotopes heavier than 301Ts, with partial half-lives exceeding the age of the universe for the heaviest isotopes like 335Ts when beta decay is not considered.

5|$|Unhexquadium {{should be}} a soft metal like mercury, and {{metallic}} unhexquadium should have a high melting point as it is predicted to bond covalently. It {{is also expected to}} be a soft Lewis acid and have Ahrlands softness parameter close to 4eV. It should also have some similarities to <b>oganesson</b> {{as well as to the}} other group 12 elements. Unhexquadium {{should be a}}t most moderately reactive, having a first ionization energy that should be around 685kJ/mol, comparable to that of molybdenum. Due to the lanthanide, actinide, and superactinide contractions, unhexquadium should have a metallic radius of only 158pm, very close to that of the much lighter magnesium, despite its being expected to have an atomic weight of around 474u, about 19.5times as much as that of magnesium. This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46g·cm−3, over twice that of osmium, currently the most dense element known, at 22.61g·cm−3; unhexquadium should be the second most dense element in the first 9 periods of the periodic table, with only its neighbour unhextrium (element 163) being more dense (at 47g·cm−3). Metallic unhexquadium should be quite stable, as the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are very deeply buried in the electron core and only the 7d electrons are available for bonding. Metallic unhexquadium should have a very large cohesive energy due to its covalent bonds, most probably resulting in a high melting point.|$|E
25|$|An {{extended}} {{periodic table}} theorizes about elements beyond <b>oganesson</b> (beyond period 7, or row 7). Currently seven periods in {{the periodic table}} of chemical elements are known and proven, culminating with atomic number 118, which completes the seventh row.|$|E
25|$|Immediately after element 172 (unseptbium, {{the last}} period 8 element), the first noble gas after <b>oganesson</b> (the last period 7 element), it was {{originally}} expected that another long transition series like the superactinides should begin, filling the 6g, 7f, 8d, and perhaps 6h shells. These electrons would be very loosely bound, rendering extremely high oxidation states possibly easy to reach. Element 184 (unoctquadium) was significantly targeted in early predictions, as {{it was originally}} speculated that 184 would be a proton magic number.|$|E
25|$|Element 118, <b>oganesson,</b> is {{the last}} element that has been synthesized.

Complete and accurate CCSD calculations are not available for elements beyond 122 because of the extreme complexity of the situation: the 5g, 6f, and 7d orbitals should have about the same energy level, and {{in the region of}} element 160 the 9s, 8p3/2, and 9p1/2 orbitals should also be about equal in energy. This will cause the electron shells to mix so that the block concept no longer applies very well, and will also result in novel chemical properties that will make positioning these elements in a periodic table very difficult. For example, element 164 is expected to mix characteristics of the elements of group 10, 12, 14, and 18.|$|E
