40|$|Using {{the five}} {{therapeutic}} <b>oxicams</b> 1 - 5, {{we showed that}} isosteric replacements result in remarkable changes in the physicochemical and structural properties of congeners. Thus. the acidity of the phenolic OH group is relatively higher in the <b>oxicams</b> containing a pyridinyl moiety, i. e. in piroxicam (1), tenoxicam (2), and lornoxicam (3), due to their zwitterionic nature- This consequently influences their lipophilicity profile at different ionization states. Furthermore, partitioning behaviour in octan- 1 -ol/H 2 O and heptane/H 2 O systems suggests an internal H-bond between the enolic OH and the amide C=O group. The anionic <b>oxicams</b> readily partition into the octanol phase at pH 7. 4 {{and not at all}} into the heptane phase.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} influence of binding to plasma proteins and to serum on the brain extraction of four antiinflammatory <b>oxicams.</b> METHODS: The brain extraction of isoxicam, tenoxicam, meloxicam and piroxicam was investigated in rats using the carotid injection technique. Blood protein binding parameters were determined by equilibrium dialysis using human serum, human serum albumin (HSA) and alpha-l-acid glycoprotein (AAG) solutions at various concentrations. RESULTS: All <b>oxicams</b> had low values of brain extraction, between 19 % and 39 % when dissolved in serum, i. e. under physiological conditions. Brain efflux rate constants calculated from the wash-out curves were the same in the absence or presence of serum. Brain efflux was inversely related to the polarity of the <b>oxicams,</b> such that the higher their H-bonding capacity, the lower their brain efflux. The free dialyzable drug fraction was inversely related to protein concentration. However, rat brain extraction was always higher than expected from in vitro measurements of the dialyzable fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Except for piroxicam whose brain extraction was partially decreased in the presence of proteins, the serum unbound and initially bound fractions of <b>oxicams</b> both seem available for transfer into the brain. Modest affinities for AAG rule out any related effect. More surprising is the apparent lack of effect on brain transfer of the high-affinity binding to HSA and serum. The enhanced brain uptake of meloxicam in the presence of AAG could be a result of interactions between this globular protein and the endothelial wall...|$|R

The present study endeavored to establish this novel effect of meloxicam (MLX), an <b>oxicam</b> NSAID, in a mouse Parkinson's disease (PD) model using 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice, which received MPTP (30 mg/kg/day; s. c.) for 5 consecutive days (chronic model) with 10 -day follow-up saline administrations, showed significant motor dysfunction in the pole test due to reduced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein levels in the brain on day 16 after MPTP/saline treatment. Daily coadministrations of MLX (10 mg/kg/day; i. p.) and MPTP for the first 5 days and follow-up 10 days with MLX administrations alone (MPTP/MLX treatment) significantly ameliorated MPTP-induced behavioral abnormalities in mice. Concomitant decreases of TH protein levels in the striatum and midbrain of MPTP/MLX-treated mice were not only significantly (p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 05, respectively) ameliorated but phosphorylated Akt (pAkt 473) expression in the midbrain was also significantly (p< 0. 01) increased in the midbrain when compared with MPTP/saline-treated mice.

The experimental and computational results are in agreement with a pseudo-octahedral coordination where the two chlorido ligands are in trans positions (apical) and the two trans-N,O chelating <b>oxicam</b> ligands occupy the equatorial sites. Both compounds revealed an acceptable solubility and stability profile upon dissolution in a standard buffer at physiological pH.

Both drugs dose-dependently (1 - 25 - 20 mg kg -) caused acute gastric haemorrhagic erosions in the rat. These lesions were significantly greater with piroxicam treatment 6 h after dosing. Only the lower doses of droxicam and piroxicam (1. 25 mg kg-') induced a significant increase of mucus gel production at different times (3 and 6 h).

40|$|AuthorIn the {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease, potent disease-modifying drugs are still needed to halt progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration. We have previously shown that meloxicam, an <b>oxicam</b> non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), elicits a potent neuroprotective effect against 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl pyridinium (MPP(+)) -induced toxicity in human dopaminergic SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. This cyclooxygenase-independent neuroprotection of meloxicam is mediated via the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt pathway; however, the specific chemical structure involved in inducing neuroprotection remains unresolved. In this study, we therefore investigated the structure-specific for eliciting the neuroprotective effect by examining a series of NSAIDs against MPP(+) toxicity in SH-SY 5 Y cells. Three oxicam-bearing NSAIDs showed potent neuroprotective effects, although {{none of the other}} 10 oxicam-nonbearing NSAIDs (3 salicylates, 6 coxibs and 1 polyphenol) or 3 piroxicam analogs (including ampiroxicam, a precursor of piroxicam) exerted any neuroprotection. Tenoxicam and piroxicam prevented MPP(+) -induced reduction of phosphorylated Akt levels in cells: a protective mechanism similar to that of meloxicam. Therefore, the <b>oxicam</b> structure was likely to be responsible for exhibiting the neuroprotection by sustaining survival-signaling in dopaminergic cells.

The inhibition of the system was assessed by measurement of the taurine chlorination while the accumulation of compound II was used to investigate the mechanism of inhibition. The oxidation products of NSAIDs by the MPO/H(2) O(2) /Cl(-) system were identified and flufenamic acid and derivatives were also assessed in the inhibition of LDL oxidation in two models. Flufenamic acid (IC(50) = 1. 1 +/- 0. 3 microM) is the most efficient inhibitor of the MPO/H(2) O(2) /Cl(-) system and nimesulide (IC(50) = 2. 1 +/- 0. 3 microM) is more active than the other NSAIDs of the <b>oxicam</b> family (IC(50) = 8 - 12 microM). The accumulation of compound II revealed that flufenamic acid acts as an electron donor while the other NSAIDs are antagonists of chloride anions. The identification of the oxidation products confirms that flufenamic behaves like an electron donor and is directly oxidized in the 5 -hydroxy-derivative but gives also the 5 -chloro-derivative which similarly inhibits the MPO/H(2) O(2) /Cl(-) system. Flufenamic acid has the best inhibiting activity towards the MPO/H(2) O(2) /Cl(-) system.

A dose related efficacy of lornoxicam was shown by the numbers of patients in each treatment group who withdrew from the trial owing to inadequate symptom relief (12 / 40 (30 %) receiving placebo, 6 / 40 (15) receiving lornoxicam 6 mg daily, 4 / 40 (10 %) receiving lornoxicam 8 mg daily, and none receiving lornoxicam 12 mg daily). This effect was confirmed by pain relief scores, which were significantly better than placebo during treatment with lornoxicam 8 mg and 12 mg daily, the effect of 12 mg daily being significantly superior to that of 8 mg daily. Similar results were obtained from functional status scores. Mean functional index (Lequesne) scores were significantly greater than placebo only at a daily dose of 12 mg lornoxicam. Lornoxicam was generally well tolerated, though some gastrointestinal side effects were seen as has been reported with other NSAIDs. Laboratory investigations showed no evidence of drug toxicity...|$|R
