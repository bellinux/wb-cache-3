5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer ski flying hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Designed by former ski jumper turned architect Heini Klopfer, as well as then-active ski jumpers Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler, the hill had a K-point of 120m to match that of Bloudkova velikanka. The FIS, still wary of the rising popularity <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> flying and wanting to keep it in check, refused to sanction the construction of the hill, having previously denounced the 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} this time that the entire sport <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> jumping {{underwent}} a significant transition in technique. Until the early 1990s nearly all athletes used the parallel style (or Däscher technique), in which the skis are held close together and parallel to each other. This had been the norm since the 1950s, with Matti Nykänen creating {{a variation in the}} 1980s with the skis pointed diagonally off to the side in a crude attempt to increase surface area, which yielded more distance. However, this came largely at the expense of stability and balance, akin to 'walking a tightrope' in mid-air and leaving athletes {{at the mercy of the}} elements. Akimoto, Findeisen, Berg, and Goldberger's accidents were all caused by unpredictable gusts of wind that made them lose control at the highest and fastest stage of their jumps, exacerbated by an outdated technique ill-suited to the new extremes <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> flying, as well as the prevalence of older hills featuring very steep slopes.|$|E
5|$|Seeking to co-operate on hill {{design and}} event organisation, the venues at Kulm, Oberstdorf and Planica formed the KOP working group in 1962 (KOP being an {{abbreviation}} of Kulm/Oberstdorf/Planica). This group {{would go on}} to consult with the FIS in all aspects <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> flying, celebrating their 50th anniversary in 2012. In 1953, Kulm hosted the first International Ski Flying Week, which would be the premier event in ski flying until 1972.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{plan from}} 1995 {{involved}} two intermediate stations, at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The plans also suggested building {{the line in}} two phases, first between Ski and Kolbotn, and then from Kolbotn to Oslo. In 2008, the National Rail Administration announced two possible plans for the right-of-way—both predominantly in tunnel. The one proposal included Kolbotn, the other did not. Both excluded Vevelstad as a station on the new line, since the station could not develop as a hub, and would still keep services along the existing commuter line. A report from Det Norske Veritas published in 2008, and ordered by the Rail Administration, concluded that neither a station at Vevelstad or at Kolbotn could support the extra cost of construction. A direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion, while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13.5 billion. The report also argued that the intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south <b>of</b> <b>Ski</b> and traveling north. The exclusion of Kolbotn would also increase the importance <b>of</b> <b>Ski</b> as a regional public transport hub. In 2009, the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn, stating {{that it was more}} important to secure a fast connection to Ski. At the same time, they promised to upgrade the existing station at Kolbotn.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom he was talking, Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski jumpers. Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E
5|$|In Lillehammer's {{bids for}} the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> jumping.

The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million {{would have to be}} spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and sewer system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill would have to be built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have the ski stadium close to the ski jumping hills.|$|E

40|$|Flexural and {{torsional}} rigidity are important properties <b>of</b> <b>skis.</b> However, the flexural and {{torsional rigidity}} {{that lead to}} optimal performance remain to be established. In the present study, four pairs <b>of</b> slalom <b>skis</b> that differed in flexural and torsional rigidity were tested by advanced and expert skiers. Using a 10 -item questionnaire, {{different aspects of the}} skis’ performance were rated on a 9 -point scale. For each pair <b>of</b> <b>skis,</b> physical measurements were compared with the ratings of the two groups of skiers. Correlations (Spearman) were then determined between (i) different mechanical properties <b>of</b> the <b>skis</b> (static and dynamic), (ii) subjective assessments of the participants, and (iii) properties <b>of</b> the <b>skis</b> and the participants’ assessments. The latter showed that expert skiers rate the aspects <b>of</b> the <b>skis</b> more accurately than advanced skiers. Importantly, expert skiers are particularly sensitive to torsion <b>of</b> the <b>skis.</b> These results suggest that such highly rated elements should be addressed in future ski designs...|$|R

5|$|Nels Nelsen (3 June 1894 – 3 June 1943), born Nils Johan Nilsen and {{sometimes}} referred to as Nels Nelson, was a Norwegian-born Canadian ski jumper and later ski jumping organizer. He was among the world's best ski jumpers during the 1920s, and held the world record of 73 meters from 1925 to 1930. Born in Salangen, he moved with his family to Revelstoke, British Columbia, in 1912. Credited with bringing the sport <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> jumping to Canada, he made his debut on the nearby Big Hill in 1915. He competed throughout Canada and the United States, and became Canadian champion five times. Despite holding the world record at the time, he was not allowed to participate in the 1928 Winter Olympics because the officials did not find it suitable for him to have to work his way to Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|The dangers <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> flying {{were still}} on full display at the 1992 Ski Flying World Championships in Harrachov, where Andreas Goldberger {{suffered}} a similar crash to the ones which occurred in Kulm in 1986.

He was taken by helicopter to a hospital, having sustained a broken arm and collarbone. František Jež also crashed, but was able to walk away with some help.|$|E
40|$|We explore {{here the}} {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>skiing</b> locomotion {{in the last}} few thousand years by investigating how humans adapted to move effectively in lands where a cover of snow, for several months every year, prevented them from travelling as on dry ground. Following historical research, we identified the sets <b>of</b> <b>skis</b> corresponding to the 'milestones' <b>of</b> <b>skiing</b> evolution in terms of ingenuity and technology, built replicas of them and measured the metabolic energy associated to their use in a climate-controlled ski tunnel. Six sets <b>of</b> <b>skis</b> were tested, covering a span from 542 AD to date. Our results show that: (i) the history <b>of</b> <b>skiing</b> is associated with a progressive decrease in the metabolic cost of transport, (ii) it is possible today to travel at twice the speed of ancient times using the same amount of metabolic power and (iii) the cost of transport is speed-independent for each ski model, as during running. By combining this finding with the relationship between time of exhaustion and the sustainable fraction of metabolic power, a prediction <b>of</b> the maximum <b>skiing</b> speed according to the distance travelled is provided for all past epochs, including two legendary historical journeys (1206 and 1520 AD) on snow. Our research shows that the performances in races originating from them (Birkebeiner and Vasaloppet) and those of other modern competitions (skating versus classical techniques) are well predicted by the evolution <b>of</b> <b>skiing</b> economy. Mechanical determinants of the measured progression in economy are also discussed in the paper...|$|R

5|$|The {{project is}} a {{continuation}} of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's plan to build four tracks along the three main corridors out of Oslo; the Gardermoen Line was completed in 1998, and the Asker Line has been completed in 2011. Between 1989 and 1996, the Østfold Line south <b>of</b> <b>Ski</b> to Moss was upgraded to double track and higher speeds. To take full advantage of this and allow the rest of the Østfold Line to be upgraded for high speeds, it is necessary to increase capacity through the bottleneck from Oslo to Ski. The first plans for the Follo Line were launched in 1995, and also included an intermediate station at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The new line is predicted to increase rush hour rail ridership 63%, and increased freight on rail would remove 750 trucks daily from European Route E18.|$|E
5|$|All these {{increasingly}} {{long distances}} {{came at a}} price, as illustrated by filmmaker Werner Herzog in his 1974 documentary The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner. During both the aforementioned events in Oberstdorf and Planica, several athletes including Steiner had far exceeded {{the limits of the}} hill by 'out-jumping' it or simply 'running out of slope'. Jumps were much further than in the 1950s, during which the old Kongsberger technique was still in use. The results were now potentially fatal each time: athletes were coming only metres away from landing on completely flat ground, or the equivalent of falling from a multi-storey building. Furthermore, only a wool cap and goggles – or no headgear at all – were worn; an antiquated feature left unchanged from the very earliest days <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> jumping more than 150 years prior. In 1979, at their 32nd International Ski Congress in Nice, France, the FIS mandated helmets to be worn by athletes at all ski jumping and flying events.|$|E
5|$|At the {{greatest}} {{extent of the}} last glacial period around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the Alpine chough was found as far as south as southern Italy, well outside its current range. Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within {{the last couple of}} centuries. In the Polish Tatra Mountains, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, and the number of pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but are declining or have become locally extinct where intensive farming methods have been introduced, such as Brittany, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.|$|E
