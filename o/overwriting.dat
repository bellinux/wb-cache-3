5|$|The team used Unreal Engine 2.5 {{to build}} and test prototypes of the {{real-time}} strategy elements, allowing the designers and gameplay programmers to commence work while another team focused on creating a new game engine. Having completed the multiplayer stage battle portion of the game first, Double Fine found it easy to gradually introduce the player to its more advanced aspects during the single-player campaign. The game-world's large size and varied content necessitated a game engine with streaming capabilities, allowing the game to seamlessly load and unload content as needed — this was also something the team had no prior experience with. Double Fine developed several in-house tools to help streamline the content-creation process for the game's world: an automated testing bot, RoBert (so named {{after one of the}} test engineers), was created to put daily builds of the game through continuous and rigorous testing, automatically reporting any errors to developers, while the Multi-User-Editor allowed the game's artists to simultaneously work on the game-world without fear of <b>overwriting</b> each other's work. The team ran into content management issues late in the game's development as more of the game's assets neared completion. Within the span of a few months the combined asset size tripled, endangering the game's ability to fit on a DVD and causing performance problems throughout the company's development systems. With the help of the engineering team, they were eventually able to overcome the performance issues and re-optimize the content for space.|$|E

25|$|By modern {{standards}} CP/M was primitive, {{owing to}} the extreme constraints on program size. With version 1.0 there was no provision for detecting a changed disk. If a user changed disks without manually rereading the disk directory the system would write on the new disk using the old disk's directory information, ruining the data stored on the disk. Starting with 1.1 or 1.2 this danger was reduced: if one changed disks without reading the new disk's directory, and tried to write to it, the operating system would signal a fatal error, avoiding <b>overwriting</b> but requiring a reboot (which took {{no more than a}} few seconds, but entailed losing whatever data you were trying to save).|$|E

The attacker only needs to access the computer once more as Administrator to gain full access to all those subsequently EFS-encrypted files. Even using Syskey mode 2 or 3 does not protect against this attack, because the attacker could back up the encrypted files offline, restore them elsewhere and use the DRA's private key to decrypt the files. Of course, if such a malicious insider can gain physical access to the computer, you might consider all security features to be irrelevant, because they could also install rootkits, software or even hardware keyloggers etc. on the computer – which is potentially much more interesting and effective than <b>overwriting</b> DRA policy.|$|E

40|$|<b>Overwrite</b> {{characteristics}} of {{digital magnetic recording}} sometimes include resonant behavior. This behavior can be observed clearly if the write level in <b>overwrite</b> process is varied independent of that in writing old data. In this condition, the <b>overwrite</b> erasure rate a shows a sharp drop at a specific write wavelength λ_ 0 and a specific <b>overwrite</b> level K_ 0. In this paper, these values of λ_ 0 and K_ 0 are measured for various recording parameters such as the write level K_w in writing old data, write head gap length g_w, medium thickness δ, and the ratio of <b>overwrite</b> to <b>overwritten</b> wavelength λ_e/λ_w. The essential factors determining the resonant behavior are investigated by normalizing those observed data. In a normalized fashion, the value of λ_ 0 /δ can be given {{as a function of}} K_w, g_w/δ and λ_e/λ_w.

25|$|SQL Server also {{provides}} the optimistic concurrency control mechanism, {{which is similar}} to the multiversion concurrency control used in other databases. The mechanism allows a new version of a row to be created whenever the row is updated, as opposed to <b>overwriting</b> the row, i.e., a row is additionally identified by the ID of the transaction that created the version of the row. Both the old as well as the new versions of the row are stored and maintained, though the old versions are moved out of the database into a system database identified as Tempdb. When a row {{is in the process of}} being updated, any other requests are not blocked (unlike locking) but are executed on the older version of the row. If the other request is an update statement, it will result in two different versions of the rows—both of them will be stored by the database, identified by their respective transaction IDs.|$|E

40|$|Direct <b>overwrite</b> in {{magneto-optical}} recording {{is necessary to}} overcome the latency incurred by conventional erase before write recording on magneto-optical disks.

The model is directly compared with experiment for a GdTbFe direct <b>overwrite</b> sample, and is shown to produce results that are in agreement with experimental observations. We show that variations in the domain wall saturation velocity {{can mean the difference between}} writing or erasing a bit on the disk, and hence is a critical parameter in the recording process. We also show that direct <b>overwrite</b> by means of interior nucleation is highly unlikely. Rather, we show that the recording process involves a dynamic balance between those pressures which act to move the domain wall and those which act to freeze it into place. Finally we analyze the Nikon bilayer direct <b>overwrite</b> scheme, and then demonstrate an alternative bilayer <b>overwrite</b> scheme which avoids a major problem with the Nikon scheme...|$|R

500|$|Gotcha is a two-player maze game {{in which}} one player {{attempts}} to catch the other. The maze is composed of a repeating pattern of elements set in multiple columns on the screen. The [...] "Pursuer" [...] is represented by a square, while the [...] "Pursued" [...] is identified by a plus sign. As the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, an electronic beeping sound plays at an increasing rate until the Pursuer reaches the Pursued. Whenever the Pursued is caught, the Pursuer scores a point, the maze disappears for a brief moment, and the Pursuer is moved to a random position {{on the right side}} of the screen. There is no score for the Pursued, so determining who won is left to the players. The maze itself is continually changing, with two invisible lines half a screen apart scanning down the maze and <b>overwriting</b> maze elements. Above the maze is the Pursuer's score and the time elapsed in the game. Each game is for a set period of time. When time runs out, the game enters attract mode, where the score resets and the square and plus sign begin bouncing around the maze in a diagonal pattern as the maze continues to change. Each game costs a quarter. The time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{music was}} {{designed}} to encompass themes of [...] "friendship" [...] and [...] "filial bonds". Initially, due to {{its status as a}} spin-off, Shimomura did not feel the same amount of pressure to conform to the legacy of previous composers. By the time the game changed from Versus XIII to XV, she had a clear idea of what the score would be like and so felt minimal reservations despite the game now being part of the main series. At the same time, she felt the need to respect the work of earlier composers such as Nobuo Uematsu while staying true to the series' legacy of musical variety. Despite the ten year development, the musical concepts Shimomura worked from did not change much: she constantly aimed at creating a darker score than other Final Fantasy titles. New elements were added when the game became Final Fantasy XV, but that was to suit the new elements being introduced rather than <b>overwriting</b> previous work. The score combined multiple music genres: apart from Shimomura's typical classical style, she also incorporated other styles such as Bossa nova and American Blues for certain locations. For his work on the game, Suzuki drew on his work on the Metal Gear series, though he watched gameplay videos rather than cutscenes for his work on Final Fantasy XV. The music was performed and recorded in Boston by the Video Game Orchestra, a North American orchestra specializing in video game music whose first Final Fantasy project had been [...] in 2013.
