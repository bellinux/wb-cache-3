5|$|The Latin American Boom was {{a flourishing}} of literature, poetry and {{criticism}} in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s, when writers from this region explored {{new ideas and}} came to international renown {{in a way that}} had not happened previously. Major figures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> include Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indirect}} effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> was {{the growth of}} gambling and prostitution in many communities. These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before the boom, but the wealth brought by the oil industry, as well as difficulties in enhancing the laws and the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, flourished in the boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of gambling and bootlegging during this period.|$|E

5|$|In 1860, a {{much closer}} gold rush {{occurred}} in the San Bernardino Mountains when prospector William Holcomb discovered significant deposits, just over the northern drainage divide of the Santa Ana River. This discovery exploded into a full-scale gold mining operation in days. The Santa Ana River served as a conduit for miners traveling to the region {{and many of the}} forests in the upper basin experienced clearcutting {{as a result of the}} high resource demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> Gold was also discovered in Lytle Creek in that same year. Following the gold rush, the cultivation of citrus became the mainstay of the economy of the lower Santa Ana River area. Through the late 19th century, citrus fields covered much of the coastal plain and led to the naming of Orange County.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the few major operations, the first decade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> was {{dominated}} by numerous small producers. As production expanded and new companies were formed, consolidation occurred. By the late 1920s, ten companies produced {{more than half of}} the oil in the state: Gulf Production Company, Humble Oil and Refining Company, Southern Crude Oil Purchasing Company (later absorbed by Amoco which was later absorbed by BP), the Texas Company, Shell Petroleum Corporation, Yount-Lee Oil Company, Magnolia Petroleum Company, J.

Other universities in the state, especially the University of Houston, were also able to benefit from state-owned oil production and donations from wealthy oil investors, fueling substantial growth and development in their campuses.|$|E

5|$|The urban {{landscape}} of the cities changed dramatically during this period. The Praetorian Building in Dallas (1907) and the Amicable Life Insurance Company building in Waco (1911) {{were among the first}} skyscrapers in Texas. The Perlstein Building in Beaumont was the first skyscraper built as a direct result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> Beaumont's downtown grew rapidly during the first decade after the 1901 strike. After a second major strike at Spindletop in 1925, Beaumont had the largest skyline of any city between Houston and New Orleans {{by the end of the}} decade. The twenty–two story Edson Hotel, completed in 1929, was the tallest hotel building in Texas for several years.|$|E
5|$|While the Lowlands {{had seen}} {{widespread}} agricultural improvement, the Highlands remained very poor and traditional. A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. As late as 1878, 68 families owned {{nearly half the}} land in Scotland. Particularly after the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society.

5|$|By the 1940s, the Texas Railroad Commission, {{which had}} been given {{regulatory}} control of the Texas oil industry, managed to stabilize American oil production and eliminate most of the wild price swings that were common during the earlier years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boom.</b> Many small towns, such as Wortham, which had become boomtowns during the 1920s saw their booms end in the late 1920s and early 1930s as their local economies collapsed, resulting from their dependence on relatively limited petroleum reservoirs. As production peaked {{in some of these}} smaller fields and the Great Depression lowered demand, investors fled. In the major refining and manufacturing centers such as Beaumont, Houston, and Dallas, the boom continued to varying degrees until the end of World War II. By the end of the war, the economies of the major urban areas of the state had matured. Though Texas continued to prosper and grow, the extreme growth patterns and dramatic socioeconomic changes of the earlier years largely subsided as the cities settled into more sustainable patterns of growth. Localized booms in West Texas and other areas, however, continued to transform some small communities during the post-war period.|$|E
40|$|Booming" {{sand dunes}} {{are able to}} produce low-frequency sound that resembles a pure note from a music instrument. The sound has a {{dominant}} audible frequency (70 - 105 Hz) and several higher harmonics and may be heard from far distances away. A natural or induced avalanche from a slip face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> dune triggers <b>the</b> emission that may last for several minutes. There are various references in travel literature to the phenomenon, but to date no scientific explanation covered all field observations. This thesis introduces a new physical model that describes <b>the</b> phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>booming</b> dunes. <b>The</b> waveguide model explains <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> frequency and <b>the</b> amplification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sound in terms of constructive interference in a confined geometry. <b>The</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> is a direct function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dimensions and velocities in the waveguide. The higher harmonics are related to <b>the</b> higher modes <b>of</b> propagation in <b>the</b> waveguide. The experimental validation includes quantitative field research at <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> dunes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mojave Desert and Death Valley National Park. Microphone and geophone recordings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acoustic and seismic emission show a variation of booming frequency in space and time. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensor data quantifies wave propagation characteristics such as speed, dispersion, and nonlinear effects and allows the distinction between <b>the</b> source mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> and <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> itself. <b>The</b> migration <b>of</b> sand dunes results from a complicated interplay between dune building, wind regime, and precipitation. The morphological and morphodynamical characteristics of two field locations are analyzed with various geophysical techniques. Ground-penetrating radar images <b>the</b> subsurface structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dunes and reveal a natural, internal layering that {{is directly related to}} <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> dune migration. <b>The</b> seismic velocity increases abruptly with depth and gradually increases with downhill position due to compaction. Sand sampling shows local cementation of sand grains within the discrete layers that explains the increase in velocity and decrease in porosity. The subsurface layering may influence <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> dune migration and therefore have important consequences on desertification. The positive qualitative and quantitative correlation between the subsurface layering in the dune and <b>the</b> manifestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> sound implies a close relation between environmental factors and <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> emission. In this thesis, <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>booming</b> is correlated with <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waveguide and the seismic velocities. The variability on location and season suggests that the waveguide theory successfully unravels <b>the</b> phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>booming</b> sand dunes. </p...|$|R

It expected to reach final operating capability, with both boom and probe-and-drogue delivery systems, in 2014. On 14September that year, the Federal government committed to deploying one of the squadron's KC-30s to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, {{as part of a}} coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. The aircraft was only cleared for operations with the probe-and-drogue system, as by this stage the boom system was not ready. The KC-30 began flying missions in Iraq on 1October 2014. The first successful contact using the boom system (in concert with another RAAF KC-30) took place near Amberley on 13May 2015. In July, the Federal government announced the purchase of two more KC-30s for delivery in 2018, taking No.33 Squadron's fleet to seven aircraft; the airframes were to be ex-Qantas A330-200 passenger liners, converted by Airbus Defence and Space at Getafe, near Madrid.

5|$|The {{agricultural}} revolution {{changed the}} traditional system of agriculture which had existed in Lowland Scotland. Thousands of cottars and tenant farmers migrated from farms and smallholdings {{to the new}} industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh and northern England. Particularly after the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boom</b> created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), Highland landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. Whereas rents had often been paid in kind, the landlords turned to money rents. They displaced farmers to raise sheep and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after {{the repeal of the}} Corn Laws in the mid-nineteenth century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production. One result of these changes was the Highland Clearances, by which much {{of the population of the}} Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the United Kingdom, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, and further afield to England, Canada, America and Australia. The potato famine of the 1840s, caused by potato blight, which devastated the population of Ireland, reached the Highlands in 1846. Although 150,000 people faced disaster, because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, oatmeal and milk), they were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland and prevented a major demographic crisis.|$|E
