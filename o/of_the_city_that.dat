5|$|By 1241, the Gran Castello or Cittadella on Gozo was {{definitely}} fortified, although a settlement {{on the hill}} had existed since the Bronze Age.

5|$|In 1900 {{a massive}} {{hurricane}} struck Galveston, destroying much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>That</b> and another storm in 1915 shifted {{much of the}} focus from investors away from Galveston and toward nearby Houston, which {{was seen as a}} safer location for commercial operations. Because of these events, the coming oil boom became heavily centered on the city of Houston both as a port and a commercial center.|$|E
5|$|Nolan {{worked with}} {{production}} designer Nathan Crowley {{to create the}} look of Gotham City. Crowley built a model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> filled Nolan's garage. Crowley and Nolan designed it as a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through. Elements were drawn from New York City, Chicago, and Tokyo; the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails. The Narrows {{was based on the}} slummish nature of the (now demolished) walled city of Kowloon in Hong Kong.|$|E

In Homer's works, {{such as the}} Iliad, the chief stories have already taken shape and substance, and {{individual}} themes were elaborated later, especially in Greek drama. The Trojan War also elicited great interest in the Roman culture because {{of the story of}} Aeneas, a Trojan hero whose journey from Troy led to the founding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> would one day become Rome, as recounted in Virgil's Aeneid (Book II of Virgil's Aeneid contains the best-known account of the sack of Troy).

5|$|In April 634, Abu Bakr {{invaded the}} Byzantine Empire in the Levant and decisively {{defeated}} a Byzantine army at the Battle of Ajnadayn. The Muslim armies marched north and laid siege to Damascus. The city was taken after a monophysite bishop informed Khalid ibn al-Walid, the Muslim commander in chief, {{that it was}} possible to breach city walls by attacking a position only lightly defended at night. While Khalid entered the city by assault from the Eastern gate, Thomas, commander of the Byzantine garrison, negotiated a peaceful surrender at the Jabiyah gate with Abu Ubaidah, Khalid's second in command. After the surrender of the city, the commanders disputed the terms of the peace agreement. The commanders finally agreed that the peace terms given by Abu Ubaidah would be met. The peace terms included an assurance that no pursuit will be undertaken by Muslims against the departing Roman convoy for three days. Having acquiesced to the peace terms, it was three days after the surrender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> Khalid set out after the Damascan refugees towards Antioch and defeated them in battle six days later, near present day Al Jayyad.|$|E

5|$|The Arab {{army was}} well-provisioned, with Arab {{accounts}} reporting high mounds of supplies {{piled up in}} their camp, and had even brought along wheat to sow and harvest the next year. The failure of the Arab navy to blockade the city, however, meant that the Byzantines too could ferry in provisions. In addition, the Arab army had already devastated the Thracian countryside during its march and could not rely on it for foraging. The Arab fleet and the second Arab army, which operated in the Asian suburbs of Constantinople, were able to bring in limited supplies to Maslama's army. As the siege drew into winter, negotiations opened between the two sides, extensively reported by Arab sources but ignored by Byzantine historians. According to the Arab accounts, Leo continued to play a double game with the Arabs. One version claims that he tricked Maslama into handing over most of his grain supplies, while another claims that the Arab general was persuaded to burn them altogether, so as to show the inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> they faced an imminent assault and induce them to surrender. The winter of 718 was extremely harsh; snow covered the ground for over three months. As the supplies in the Arab camp ran out, a terrible famine broke out: the soldiers ate their horses, camels, and other livestock, and the bark, leaves and roots of trees. They swept the snow of the fields they had sown to eat the green shoots, and reportedly resorted to cannibalism and eating their own excrement. Consequently, the Arab army was ravaged by epidemics; with great exaggeration, the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon put the number of their dead of hunger and disease at 300,000.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} by noon on Thursday, November 4, 1333, a flood along the Arno River {{spread across the}} entire plain of San Salvi. He wrote that by nightfall the eastern wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>that</b> was damming the water became damaged and then washed away in the flood, {{allowing}} the flood waters to breach and fill the city streets. He claims that the water rose above the altar in the Florence Baptistry, reaching over half {{the height of the}} porphyry columns. Bartlett notes that these columns, presented to Florence by the Pisans more than two hundred years before, have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by the flood in 1333. Villani further claims that the height of the flood water in the courtyard of the commune's palace (residence of the podestà) reached 3m (10ft). The Carraia bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches, while the Trinità bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinità. The Ponte Vecchio—save the two central piers—was swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it, allowing the water to build and leap over the arches, states Villani. There was an old statue of Mars that stood on a pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio, but this too was taken by the flood along the Arno.|$|E
