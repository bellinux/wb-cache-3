50|$|Crankcase heat {{is common}} in air {{conditioning}} (cooling) systems where R-22 {{has been used for}} many years. The home owner often shuts off the disconnect to the outdoor condensing unit for the winter, leaving the compressor without crankcase heat. If the homeowner then starts the unit without some time for the heat to boil the refrigerant out the oil, damage likely occurs to the compressor. On start-up, the crankcase pressure reduces as soon as the compressor starts to turn. The refrigerant boils and turn the oil to foam. The oil and refrigerant (some of the refrigerant may be in liquid state) is pumped out of the compressor. Valve and bearing damage may occur and the compressor may be operated with a limited <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> until it returns to the crankcase from the evaporator.|$|E
40|$|The Middle Jurassic Toutunhe Formation at {{depths of}} {{approximately}} 4000 – 6000 [*]m has increasingly come into focus as a current deep reservoir {{target in the}} central Junggar Basin (NW China). Based on petrography, SEM, stable isotopes, and fluid inclusion analyses, the goals {{of this study were}} to investigate the effect of depositional lithofacies on sandstone diagenetic heterogeneity and {{to examine the relationship between}} diagenetic evolution and <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> within a heterogeneous reservoir. Grain size controls the overall abundance of cement and porosity and reservoir properties through its effect on ductile lithic sand grains and hence on mechanical compaction. Early diagenetic calcite cement is an exception to this trend. Ductile lithic-rich, very fine-grained sandstones featured compaction of easily deformed, clay-rich grains, resulting in a very rapid loss of porosity during burial. In contrast, dissolution and cementation occurred as well as ductile compaction in the fine-grained sandstones. Two episodes of <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> occurred in the relatively coarser-grained sandstone lithofacies. Diagenesis progressed alternately with oil emplacement, and some diagenetic alterations and <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> occurred simultaneously. Ductile lithic-rich, highly compacted sandstones and tightly calcite-cemented sandstones can create permeability barriers embedded in permeable reservoir sandstones, probably resulting in heterogeneous flow...|$|E

30|$|In {{exploration}} for tight oil, {{the content}} and saturation of hydrocarbon in the tight reservoir is a key factor for evaluating the reserve. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} study the geological history of hydrocarbon accumulation and the tight <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> process. However, kinetic models used for petroleum development are not applicable for petroleum exploration. In this study, a static resistance model is proposed after analyzing resistances in ultra-slow flow in porous media. Using this model, the discontinuous pattern of <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> is reproduced through incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, the phase field method and the finite element method. This study also explains macroscopic percolation behavior with microscopic flow mechanisms and discusses some issues in ultra-slow flow in a micro/nano pore-throat network. The resistance analysis reveals that capillary resistance and dissipation resistance are dominant factors in the mechanism of oil accumulation in tight reservoirs. Numerical simulations show that pressure thresholds exist and result in discontinuous <b>oil</b> <b>charging.</b> Generally, it is proven that the static model is more applicable than kinetic models in describing oil accumulation in tight reservoirs.|$|R

30|$|Geochemical {{analysis}} of 64 oils sampled from an Ordovician carbonate reservoir in the Tuoputai region was undertaken {{to study the}} composition of molecular markers. All the oils have similar geochemical characteristics and belong to a single oil family. They are presumed to derive from the same source kitchen and have similar <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> history. A histogram of homogenization temperatures (T h) of aqueous inclusions in reservoir rocks shows a bimodal distribution pattern, indicating that the Ordovician reservoir has been charged twice. Coupling the measured T h (°C) with the burial and geothermal histories reconstructed using 1 D basin modeling, we relate the homogenization temperature to the relevant geological ages: i.e., 425 – 412 and 9 – 4  Ma, corresponding to the Middle to Late Silurian and the Miocene to Pliocene, respectively. The oil filling orientation and pathways are traced using molecular indicators related to alkyldibenzothiophenes and benzo[b]naphthothiophenes. The <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> orientation is from south to north generally. It can be predicted that the Ordovician reservoirs were sourced from a kitchen located {{to the south of}} the Tuoputai region, most probably between the Awati and Manjiaer Depressions. Traps located in the southern side of the Tuoputai region, along the <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> pathways, should therefore be preferred oil exploration targets.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{indicate that}} hydrocarbon migration and entrapment in stacked fault-bounded reservoirs are mainly {{affected by the}} following factors: charge time, faults, pressure and geological structures. The charge time for commercial hydrocarbon accumulation is much longer in oil-water systems than in oil-gas-water systems. Faults are classified into charging faults and 'back doors' faults other than charging faults in stacked fault-bounded reservoirs. The lower the displacement pressure of a fault, the higher its updip oil transportation ability. The downdip oil transportation ability of a fault is usually low and cannot cause commercial downdip oil accumulation. Back doors affect both hydrocarbon percent charge and hydrocarbon migration pathways. Updip back doors improve updip <b>oil</b> <b>charge.</b> The lower the displacement pressure of an updip back door, the more efficient the updip <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> before 3, 000 years. Back doors whose displacement pressure is equal to or higher than 28. 76 psi are effective in sealing faults in oil-water systems. On the contrary, only sealing faults result in commercial gas accumulations in stacked fault-compartmentalized reservoirs. Otherwise gas is found over oil. Downdip back doors generally have few effects on downdip hydrocarbon charge. Geopressure enhances the updip oil transportation of a fault and improves {{the positive effects of}} updip back doors during updip <b>oil</b> <b>charge.</b> Geopressure and updip back doors result in more efficient updip <b>oil</b> <b>charge.</b> A physical barrier is not necessarily a barrier to oil migration with the aid of geopressure and updip back doors. The chance for hydrocarbon charge into reservoirs along growth faults is not equal. Any one of the above controlling factors can change the patterns of hydrocarbon charge and distribution in such complex geological structures. Generally, lower reservoirs and updip reservoirs are favored. Reservoirs along low-permeability charging faults may be bypassed. Gas can only charge the updip reservoirs. Both updip and downdip back doors can facilitate oil penetrating a barrier fault to charge reservoirs offset by the barrier fault. Interreservoir migration among stacked fault-compartmentalized reservoirs is an important mechanism for hydrocarbon accumulation and trap identification. The interreservoir migration is a very slow process, even though the displacement pressures of bounding faults may be very low...|$|E

40|$|Diagenetic {{minerals}} in a water-filled borehole {{from the}} Jurassic Fulmar Formation, United Kingdom central North Sea, record two phases of hydrocarbon filling and emptying. Initial <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> {{was during the}} Late Cretaceous, at shallow burial depths of about 1. 5 km (0. 9 mi). As we consider that hydrocarbon has preserved porosity during burial, this has implications for {{the understanding of the}} porosity evolution of the Fulmar Formation, which, in other locations, is an important hydrocarbon reservoir. The early <b>oil</b> <b>charge,</b> as recorded by illite K-Ar ages, progressively filled the structure from 84 to 59 Ma, and possibly precipitated bitumen because of biodegradation. The first oil predated many of the burial diagenetic reactions within the sandstone. After leak-off at ca. 60 Ma, diagenetic reactions continued in an open geochemical system, with possible import of CO 2. Products of these reactions include ankerite and quartz overgrowth cements. Hydrocarbon staining postdates these phases and provides evidence of a hydrocarbon charge, probably gas condensate. The second hydrocarbon charge also leaked off, and the sandstone is now water bearing. Previous work on the Fulmar Formation has incorrectly placed all the diagenetic reactions as predating the first arrival of hydrocarbon. The present-day pore fluids are high-salinity, high-{delta} 18 O fluids derived from the underlying Permian Zechstein evaporates. These fluids entered the reservoir during a phase of overpressure release that caused fracturing of the framework quartz grains, possibly coincident with the second phase of hydrocarbon leak-off at 2 – 5 Ma...|$|E

Using tricyclic terpanes/ 17 α(H)-hopanes ratios of 18 oil samples from the Tahe Oilfield, Huang (2003) traced oil migration orientations. The results showed that the general orientation of <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> is from east to west and from south to north, suggesting that the source kitchen may be located in the Manjiaer Depression (Huang 2003).

30|$|The {{results of}} oil family {{classification}} indicated {{that most of}} the oils in the Paleozoic reservoirs in the Halahatang region are genetically identical and should be grouped as one single oil family (Zhang et al. 2000; Zhang and Huang 2005; Chang et al. 2013 a; Xiao et al. 2016; Li et al. 2018).

40|$|Catalytic {{hydropyrolysis}} (hypy), {{which refers}} to pyrolysis assisted by high hydrogen gas pressures (15 MPa) {{in the presence of}} a dispersed sulphided Mo catalyst, has been developed as a method for liberating covalently bound biomarkers from macromolecules in coals, source rocks and crude oils. It possesses the unique ability to produce very high yields of aliphatic biomarkers compared to mild catalytic hydrogenation or traditional pyrolysis methods, whilst minimising alteration to their isomeric distributions (Love et al., 1995). The Clair Field, located 75 km to the west of Shetland is one of the largest oil accumulations on the UKCS. The co-occurrence of 25 -norphopanes and undegraded n-alkanes within oils from this field, together with their relatively low API gravity indicates that the field is a mixture of at least two oil charges separated by a major biodegradation event. While the source of the second charge has been attributed to the Upper Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay (KCF) (Scotchman et al., 1998), oil mixing and extensive biodegradation make identification of the first charge problematical.

Based on the T h of fluid inclusions and reconstructed burial and geothermal histories, Wang et al. (2008) proposed that the Tahe Ordovician oil reservoir has been charged twice. The early oil charging phase arose from the Middle to Late Silurian (429 – 415  Ma) and the later one from the Miocene to Pliocene (8 – 2  Ma). Shi et al.

40|$|When quartz-rich sands {{are buried}} and heated, pore space is {{gradually}} filled by precipitation of quartz cement from aqueous formation fluids. Here we examine whether {{the presence of}} oil in the pore space can retard or halt this loss of porosity by slowing or stopping quartz cementation. The effect of oil fill on quartz cementation is examined by using the distribution of quartz cement in the Brae Formation deep-water sandstone reservoir of the Miller oil field (North Sea). Petrographic data demonstrate that sandstones from the oil zone have much less quartz cement, and more porosity, than sandstones from the water zone. Sandstones in both oil and water zones are compositionally and texturally identical and have been affected by a similar burial history. Kinetic modeling of the cementation process suggests that progressive <b>oil</b> <b>charging</b> has slowed quartz-cement growth rates by at least two orders of magnitude, halting it completely in the most extreme cases.

40|$|Reliable geochemical {{information}} of similar quality to conventional analyses of crude oils and source rocks {{can be obtained}} from oil-bearing fluid inclusions (FI). Carefully controlled analytical procedures including sample clean-up, procedural blanks and attention to detail are essential for the successful analysis of inclusion oils. The procedures are technically challenging, but if they are carefully followed, successfully analysed samples can include not only those with high abundances of oil inclusions, such as in current or palaeo-oil reservoirs, but also samples with low amounts of oil inclusions, such as those from oil migration pathways or from Proterozoic or even older rocks. A full range of hydrocarbons can be measured from inclusions, including low molecular weight hydrocarbons, n-alkanes, aliphatic biomarkers such as isoprenoids, hopanes and steranes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. There are many geological applications of the analysis of FI oils, which contribute to reducing regional exploration risk. This paper uses Australian case histories to illustrate the main applications of FI oil analysis. These include better constraining <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> histories of reservoirs and identifying active source rocks previously unknown in a particular basin. The effects of oil-alteration by biodegradation and/or water-washing in the reservoir can be removed, mixing episodes in reservoirs can be deconvoluted, and the effects of drilling mud additives or other contaminants can be eliminated.

Fluid inclusion data are consistent with the presence of paleo-oil columns below the current accumulations in the Laminaria and Corallina fields. Evidence for other partially breached (current and paleo-oil column) as well as breached (dry with paleo-oil column) closures across the region implies that active and widespread seepage took place after the time of initial <b>oil</b> <b>charge.</b> The distribution of current and paleo-oil zones, and the location of inferred hydrocarbon leakage indicators defined on 3 D seismic data, correlates with the prediction of fault-seal effectiveness based on modeled strain distribution. Within the geologic framework of the Laminaria High area, this distribution suggests that when sufficient reactivation shear strain is accumulated by reservoir faults, ductile deformation might give way to brittle failure in the top seal, allowing active flow pathways to develop and upfault seepage to take place from the reservoir to thief zones or the seafloor. The observations emphasize that strain and upfault fluid-flow partitioning is constrained by prereactivation fault size, lateral fault-tip distributions, and the presence of fault jogs inherited from successive episodes of growth processes. These elements can explain the complex distribution of paleo- and preserved oil columns in the study area and further support Cenozoic tectonic activity as being the first-order control on trap breaching and hydrocarbon seepage in this region...|$|E

Vein and cement minerals host both aqueous and hydrocarbon two-phase (liquid and vapor-filled) fluid inclusions indicating that cementation occurred during <b>oil</b> <b>charging.</b> The location of hydrocarbon fluid inclusions in the paragenetic sequence of the reservoir rocks indicates that hydrocarbon migration during early-stage diagenesis occurred via intergranular pores as well as fractures, whereas towards the later stages of diagenesis, as porosities were occluded, hydrocarbon migration was predominantly fracture controlled.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{examination of the}} hydrocarbon charge and formation water history of the central Vulcan Sub-basin, Timor Sea has been completed and a model developed to describe {{the evolution of the}} region’s petroleum systems. Reservoir horizons within the Mesozoic pre-, syn- and post-rift megasequences have been evaluated for their ability to host and retain oil and gas through a period of tectonic upheaval, associated with oblique plate collision in the Neogene. A coupled hydrocarbon-formation water model has been developed that describes two discrete formation water phases (W 1 and W 2) and three hydrocarbon phases (H 1, H 2, H 3), with the timing of these events linked to important phases in the basin evolution. The Vulcan Sub-basin contains the components required to produce an effective petroleum system. The principal clastic reservoirs generally exhibit good porosity and permeability and are capped by effective, regionally extensive, seal rocks. A consistent paragenetic sequence can be recognised for Mesozoic reservoirs with early glauconite and pyrite phases preceding clay authigenesis. These early phases are in turn enclosed by quartz overgrowths that are subsequently enclosed by ankerite cement and in more deeply buried samples, filamentous illite. Source rocks are suitably located adjacent to these reservoirs, are organically rich and have experienced sufficient burial to promote thermal maturation and expulsion of generated hydrocarbons. The novel Grains with Oil Inclusions (GOI) fluid inclusion technique that allows the abundance of oil-filled fluid inclusions {{to be related to the}} maximum level of oil saturation experienced by a sandstone reservoir through time has been used to describe the charge history of a selection of wells from across the Vulcan Sub-basin. GOI data shows that the source rocks have been extremely productive, with three discernible hydrocarbon charge events recognised (H 1, H 2 and H 3). An early gas charge (H 1) appears to be widespread in the basin, but this may have been deleterious to regional prospectivity by reducing the volumetric capacity of traps that were well positioned to receive later <b>oil</b> <b>charge.</b> Stable isotope data from early formed clay and carbonate cements indicate connate waters extant during the first phase of hydrocarbon migration (H 1) had mixed with meteoric water (W 1) introduced into the reservoirs during periods of sub-aerial exposure associated with uplift related to rifting. A regionally extensive <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> (H 2), derived from Upper Jurassic mudstones, produced numerous, volumetrically significant, oil columns. GOI data shows that many of the current oil fields were once much larger and that many reservoirs that are now gas or water bearing also previously contained oil accumulations. Geochemical analysis of selected fluid inclusion oils (FIOs) show derivation from mixed marine and terrestrially derived source rocks of the Upper Jurassic Vulcan Formation. These oils form the first of two oil families that constitute the previously defined Jurassic Vulcan-Plover (!) petroleum system. In contrast the crude oils previously assigned to the second oil family and thought to have been derived from deltaic source rocks of the Middle Jurassic Plover Formation are not well represented in the FIOs. In addition a number of the FIOs are unlike either recognised oil family and show source rock characteristics that imply derivation from fully marine source rocks. These could represent either a previously unrecognised oil family or may reflect a true end member of the first family that has been mixed with the second family to produce an intermediate composition. The presence of the angiosperm marker Oleanane in some of the FIOs suggests a contribution from Cretaceous source rocks is also possible. The GOI data indicate high charge rates to structurally valid traps with at least one in three valid traps showing clear evidence of oil accumulation. Fluid inclusion palaeotemperature data, integrated with one dimensional (1 D) basin models, produce a similar prediction of the charge timing with <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> mostly from Eocene time. This agrees well with subsidence curves, which show a period of increased subsidence in the Paleocene that is likely to have promoted oil generation and expulsion into carrier beds used to facilitate oil migration into traps. Although an effective petroleum system can be demonstrated to have been present in the Tertiary, this has not been fully preserved due to events that post-dated hydrocarbon charge. The most significant of these has been the flexural bending of the lithospheric plate during oblique collision of the northwards moving Australian Plate with the eastwards moving S. E. Asian Plate. This collision produced a net extensional stress field throughout the Vulcan Sub-basin, resulting in widespread reactivation of deeper rift fault systems, and the formation of extensive arrays of shallow Miocene-Pliocene faults. Interaction between these fault populations has, in many cases, increased net-vertical structural permeability and led to breaching of hydrocarbon traps and the attendant leakage of oil and gas. Another major fluid-flow event that was controlled by the increase in structural permeability due to plate collision can also linked to the loss of hydrocarbons due to fault breach. A regionally extensive fluid-flow event, involving vertical, cross formation, migration of highly saline brine (W 2) is indicated by fluid inclusion palaeo-salinity data. These palaeo-pore waters, with maximum salinities above 200, 000 ppm NaCl equivalent, record the migration of high-salinity brines through Mesozoic and Tertiary sandstones. Fault controlled injection of brine from bedded salt at depths of up to 10 km is most likely the main source of this brine. Alternative salt sources in the drilled section are salt diapirs, but these are spatially restricted and their dissolution cannot reconcile the observed widespread distribution of these highly saline palaeo-fluids. In samples taken from intact hydrocarbon columns the absence of hyper-saline fluid inclusions suggests brine flow occurred after initial hydrocarbon charge. Further, high salinities seen in samples from recognised residual oil zones suggests that trap breach facilitated the ingress of high-salinity brines. Numerical simulations, utilised to test this hypothesis, produce outcomes that broadly match the observed distribution of samples with high salinity fluid inclusions. Brine flow from more deeply buried Palaeozoic strata also imparts a convective overprint on the conductive thermal background. Although not represented by the current geothermal conditions, thermal maturity data recording accumulated thermal stress, indicates localised heating of sediments immediately adjacent to faults bounding breached oil columns. The use of such anomalous maturity data when modelling hydrocarbon generation could lead to spurious conclusions if the restricted spatial extent of these convective effects is not considered. Aside from Neogene fault reactivation at least four additional processes have modified the preservation potential of the Jurassic Vulcan-Plover (!) petroleum system since the initial hydrocarbon charge. Although generally second order effects on a regional scale, these can be extremely important at the local scale. The first involves passive leak zones formed by reactivation of long-lived fault intersections that appear to control the trap capacity of the Skua oil field and likely play an important role more widely. Subsequent structural tilting during the Late Tertiary altered the spill-points of some hydrocarbon traps resulting in further redistribution of hydrocarbons. Demonstrable evidence of modification to spill-points after initial <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> is recorded in the Skua Field where the original OWC is inclined, and can be explained by the establishment of north-westerly tilting. The third process to affect the system was a late stage gas charge (H 3) that displaced oil from many of the traps that today contain gas. Considerable potential for downdip or displaced oil legs in the Swan and Oliver fields respectively is inferred. The final process to modify the petroleum system involved a significant increase in the magnitude of the horizontal stress component within the regional stress field, imparted by the jamming of the Banda Arc subduction zone by buoyant Australian Continental crust. The resultant reduction in observed extensional faulting likely led to an improvement in trap integrity such that heavily reactivated traps with access to charge could be successfully refilled. Data acquired by this study provides a base map of the charge history in the Vulcan Sub-basin with which to test the applicability of models proposed to predict the retention of hydrocarbons in yet to be drilled traps. These data already have been used to test models that utilise a variety of seepage detection methodologies including airborne and satellite based direct detection as well as indirect methods such as hydrocarbon related diagenesis. In the future, rigorous integration of these data into numerical models of fault reactivation that describe the complex interplay between stress, fluid-flow and regional tectonics will contribute to a better understand the mechanisms controlling fault breach in this region and in sedimentary basins elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Many Cretaceous-Cenozoic coaly source {{rocks in}} Australasian and {{southeast}} Asian basins were deposited in coastal plain environments, yet {{the effect of}} early diagenetic marine influence on their oil potential is not well understood. An integrated organic geochemical and petrographic study of humic coals from the Eocene Mangahewa Formation (Taranaki Basin, New Zealand) was undertaken with coals predominantly from raised mire petrofacies, with subordinate proportions from planar mires. The total S content of 0. 63 - 4. 4 % (dry, ash-free) indicated very slight to strong degrees of marine influence. Other than minor addition of inferred mangrove derived suberinite and associated liptodetrinite, the degree of marine influence had no obvious effect on maceral or plant tissue abundance. However, hydrogen index (HI) values were up to ca. 150 % (109 mgHC/gTOC) higher, and total (C₆₊) oil potential up to ca. 140 % (43 mg/gTOC) higher among the more strongly marine influenced coals. Correlation of organic S with solvent extract parameters pristane/phytane, C₂₇-C₂₉ diasteranes/steranes, C₂₉ steranes/hopanes, C₃₅/(C₃₅+C₃₄) homohopanes and oleanane index suggested that inundation of brackish water into the early diagenetic peat forming environment enhanced the bio-resistance of higher plant and other lipids through sulfurization, thereby helping to preserve more of the inherent H content and total oil potential of the original peat biomass. Conversely, marine influence had only a minor effect on the capacity of Mangahewa coals to generate paraffinic oil. Total (n-C₆₊) and non-volatile (n-C₁₅₊) paraffinic oil potentials were instead controlled primarily by the abundance of leaf derived cutinite and associated liptodetrinite. This, in turn, was dependent {{on the type of}} peat mire facies, with planar mire facies having better potential for preservation of leaf litter than raised mire facies because of their generally higher groundwater level. Marine influence is nonetheless beneficial for paraffinic <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> from coaly source rock sequences in that the associated higher HIs enhance the efficiency and quantum of paraffinic oil expulsion through increased saturation of the coal pore system. 24 page(s...|$|E

Special attention should be paid to the occurrence of metal particles in oil and the tendency in the change of their number. The signs that point to changes in viscosity, oxidation increase and additive wear are also considered. The state of impurities in oil was discussed, with a particular focus on the number of particles, water content and metal impurities. It is inevitable to use an oil analysis programme in the case of motor oils, which provides several advantages: reduction of unscheduled vehicle downtime, improvement of vehicle reliability, help in organizing effectiveness of maintenance schedules, extension of engine life, optimization of oil change intervals and reduction of cost of vehicle maintenance. The paper also gives the results of the experimental research of physical- chemical characteristics of the motor oils sampled from the engines of Mercedes OM 345 vehicles in operational use. It was shown that there is a change in physical-chemical properties of lubrication oils. These changes are in a direct correlation with the state of all the elements of the tribomechanical motor system, i. e. with their functional characteristics. The conclusion based on the realized testing comes {{at the end of the}} paper. Introduction As a contact element of the tribomechanical system, lubricant is a carrier of information about the state of the whole system, from the aspect of tribological as well as other ageing processes. Therefore, an analysis of oils, based on a properly defined program, represents a very effective method for monitoring the state of technical systems, which ensures early warning signals of potential problems that could lead to failure and break down of technical systems. Using Oil Analysis programs for engine oils has several benefits: reduction of unscheduled vehicle downtime, improvement of vehicle reliability, help in organizing effectiveness of maintenance schedules, extension of engine life, optimization of oil change intervals and reduction of vehicle maintenance costs. Physico-chemical characteristics of lubricating oils Basic physico-chemical characteristics which determine the quality of oil are: a) physical characteristics: viscosity, density, flash point, cloud Point, pour point, volatillity, emulsibillity, deemulsibillity, foaming, air release, viscosity index, etc. b) chemical characteristics: neutralization number (TAN-total acid number), total base number (TBN), oxidation stabillity, chemical and thermal stabillity, corrodibillity, ash content and carbon residue, water content, compatibility, toxicity, etc. Diagnostics of the tribomechanical system of an internal combustion engine The diagnostics is based on the prediction (recognition) of damage and/or failure through characteristic diagnostic parameters. This allows prevention of delays and increases reliability, cost-effectiveness, and usage life. The diagnostics of the tribomechanical system can provide verification of the system condition, working capacity and functionality, and can point out the place, form and cause of a failure. The diagnostics is carried out through the detection of symptoms, determining the value of the characteristic parameters and their comparison with the limit values. If the engine assemblies are considered from the aspect of tribomechanical systems (e. g. piston-piston ring-cylinder, cam-valve lifter, bearing journal bearing) defined by tribological processes, it can be shown that the determination of the content of wear products, content of contaminants, state of lubricants and lubrication conditions have a significant influence on the implementation of maintenance of these systems. We should emphasize the importance of monitoring oil for lubrication of tribomechanical engine assemblies, which provides identification of potential causes and phenomena leading to damage and failure in the early stages of the functioning of the system. Prediction, i. e. detection of potential and/or current damage and failures in the system, checking the functionality of oil and determination of usage life are the main factors of the implementation of oil monitoring. Since mobile components of tribomechanical system engines are necessarily exposed to wear and contaminants and wear products deposit in the lubrication oil, it is necessary to monitor changes in fluid properties during exploitation, because the monitoring of lubricants is the key monitoring technique for maintenance as well as for achieving certain techno-economic effects. The analysis of the contents of different metals in lubricants is very important. Metal particles are abrasive and act as catalysts in the oxidation of oils. In motor oils, the origin of the particles may be from additives, wear, fuel, air and cooling liquid. Metals from additives can be Zn, Ca, Ba, or Mg and that indicates the change in additives. Metals originating from wear are: Fe, Pb, Cu, Cr, Al, Mn, Ag, Sn, and they point to increased wear in these systems. Elements originating from cooling liquids are Na and B, and their increased content indicates the penetration of the cooling liquid into the lubricant. The increased content of Si or Ca, originating from the air, points to the air filter malfunctioning. Wear of the parts is the main cause of malfunctioning in the process of exploitation of mechanical components of vehicles. Wear is characterized by the change in shapes and dimensions of working parts. Friction leads to surface wear which causes the increase of clearance between moving joined parts and the change in their mutual relations, thus resulting further in deviations from required specifications of assemblies and vehicles in general. Diagnostic procedure for the condition of lubricants 1) Selection of a type of vehicles and vehicle parts from which oil samples will be taken. 2) Consideration of the mode of the system (vehicle assembly) operation, lubrication systems, exploitation conditions and its purpose, and an overview of the basic technical characteristics. 3) Analysis of the tribological processes in components of motor vehicles. 4) Analysis of the failure of functional components of vehicles (as tribomechanical systems) 5) Information about the condition of a vehicle assembly and oil during the analysis and monitoring Results of motor oil investigation during exploitation In this part of the paper, the results of the experimental testing of motor oils in the Laboratory for fuels and lubricants, VTI Belgrade, are presented. The physico-chemical characteristics of oils were examined in accordance with standard methods, shown in Table 3. The analysis was done on fresh (new) oils and oils used in vehicle engine assembles. Testing of used samples was carried out in accordance with common criteria defined by the quality of used oil. The values of allowable deviation limits of individual characteristics of oil depend on the type of oil, working conditions and internal recommendations of the manufacturer of lubricants and users. The limited values of oil characteristics which condition the change of the <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> from the engine are given in Table 4. They represent the criteria for the <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> change. Deviation of only one characteristic results in the change of the <b>oil</b> <b>charge,</b> regardless of the characteristic itself. The research was carried out on three vehicles (MERCEDES O 345 buses) with the Mercedes-Benz engine, OM 447 HLA type. This is a four-stroke engine with six in-line cylinders, turbo Diesel, liquid cooled and with combined lubrication, which meets Euro 2 emission standards related to exhaust gases. The research was conducted through periodic sampling of oil from the engines of the vehicles listed above. Apart from fresh oil ('zero' sample), samples were taken after 10. 000 km, 20. 000 km and 30. 000 km. After 30. 000 km oil charges were replaced in all three engines. During the oil sampling, the sampling sites were carefully chosen, taking care of actual oil usage, which enabled each sample to be a representative one. Each sample was taken from the living zone, i. e. zone closer to the elements in contact. The sampling of oil from the bottom of the motor housing (discharge outlet) was thus avoided, as the highest concentration of contaminants occurs there. This is achieved by simply modifying the outlet for oil, by extending it towards the active zone of oil within the housing with a tube of appropriate length. Special attention was also paid to the preservation of samples from contamination, both in the phase of sample taking and in the phase of manipulation, which is fully met by applying the prescribed procedures. A very high level of purity of all elements in the chain of the sampling systems was thus provided as well as the separation of samples in a way that does not perturb the integrity of their data on the state of the vehicle components from which the sampling was done. Conclusion On the basis of all the mentioned above, the following conclusions can be drawn: - motor oil VALVOLINE, API CF and ACEA E 4, of SAE 10 W- 40 gradation, analyzed during exploitation, achieves its primary function and meets the prescribed replacement interval of 30. 000 km in the EURO 2 engine category, which was found by the analysis of characteristic physico-chemical properties of oil and wear products (Fe and Cu) during exploitation; - the fall of viscosity is evident during the first 10. 000 km, and after this period, viscosity remains approximately constant until the end of the interval changes of the <b>oil</b> <b>charge.</b> Maximum viscosity fall during the exploitation of the oil from all three engines is significantly below the allowed limit of 20 %; - after 30. 000 km the TBN value has not exceeded the allowable limit for oil samples from all three engines; - the content of insoluble substances in the oil is negligible in comparison with the limit value, because there is no significant presence of oxidation products and mechanical impurities or insoluble substances such as coke, scale, dust, soot, particles originated from wear contact area of the engine tribomechanical systems and other mechanical impurities; - small decrease of the flash point values shows that there was no significant penetration of fuel into the system for lubrication; - content of iron and copper is significantly below the allowable limits for all three vehicles; - the appearance of water in the samples is not found, - after 30. 000 km, oil is replaced, following exactly the manufacturer's recommendation about the <b>oil</b> <b>charge</b> change...|$|E
