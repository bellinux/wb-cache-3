40|$|Background: Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) {{produces}} mycolactone toxin when infected Aims and objectives: The aim is {{to document}} the clinical and epidemiological features of Mycobacterium ulcerans disease in the Middle Belt of Ghana, and the outcome of treatment. Patients and Methods: Patients with lesions suspected to be MU disease were screened by community workers. Lesions were confirmed {{by any of the}} following: direct smear examination, culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or histopathology. Patients were treated with rifampicin (10 mg/kg orally) and streptomycin (15 mg/kg im) combination for 8 weeks. Patients selected for surgical treatment included cases where medical treatment had failed, cases presenting late with complications, and recurrent cases. Results: 258 patients were seen in the Ahafo Ano, Amansie Central, Amansie West, Asunafo, Asutifi, and Upper Denkyira districts of Ghana between 2005 and 2012. Their ages ranged from 1 year 3 months to 98 years, {{with a mean age of}} 29. 8 (SD 20. 4). The clinical forms of MU disease seen were: papule (0. 74 %), nodule (1. 48 %), chronic osteomyelitis (1. 48 %), contracture (1. 48 %), <b>oedematous</b> <b>lesion</b> (2. 69 %), and ulcer (91. 85 %). Uncommon complications include subluxation of knee joint, salivary gland fistula and Marjolin's ulcer. The lesions were distributed as follows: head and neck (6. 2 %), upper limb (23. 1 %), trunk (1. 5 %), and lower limb (69. 2 %).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMycobacterium ulcerans (MU) {{produces}} mycolactone toxin when {{infected with}} a plasmid. The toxin is cytotoxic and immunosuppressive, causing extensive destruction of tissues, leading to large ulcers on exposed {{parts of the}} body. Spontaneous healing by secondary intention leads to contractures, subluxation of joints, disuse atrophy, distal lymphedema and other complications. The objective {{of this study is}} to document the clinical and epidemiological features of MU disease in the Middle Belt of Ghana and the outcome of the treatment.

40|$|Background: Paradoxical {{reactions}} from antibiotic treatment of Mycobacterium ulcerans {{have recently been}} recognized. Data is lacking regarding their incidence, clinical and diagnostic features, treatment, outcomes and risk factors in an Australian population. Methods: Data was collected prospectively on all confirmed cases of M. ulcerans infection managed at Barwon Health Services, Australia, from 1 / 1 / 1998 - 31 / 12 / 2011. Paradoxical reactions were defined on clinical and histological criteria and cases were determined by retrospectively reviewing the clinical history and histology of excised lesions. A Poisson regression model {{was used to examine}} associations with paradoxical reactions. Results: Thirty-two of 156 (21 %) patients developed paradoxical reactions a median 39 days (IQR 20 - 73 days) from antibiotic initiation. Forty-two paradoxical episodes occurred with 26 (81 %) patients experiencing one and 6 (19 %) multiple episodes. Thirty-two (76 %) episodes occurred during antibiotic treatment and 10 (24 %) episodes occurred a median 37 days after antibiotic treatment. The reaction site involved the original lesion (wound) in 23 (55 %), was separate to but within 3 cm of the original lesion (local) in 11 (26 %) and was more than 3 cm from the original lesion (distant) in 8 (19 %) episodes. Mycobacterial cultures were negative in 33 / 33 (100 %) paradoxical episodes. Post-February 2009 treatment involved more cases with no antibiotic modifications (12 / 15 compared with 11 / 27, OR 5. 82, 95 % CI 1. 12 - 34. 07, p =  0. 02) and no further surgery (9 / 15 compared with 2 / 27, OR 18. 75, 95 % CI 2. 62 - 172. 73, p <  0. 001). Six severe cases received prednisone with marked clinical improvement. On multivariable analysis, age ≥ 60 years (RR 2. 84, 95 % CI 1. 12 - 7. 17, p =  0. 03), an <b>oedematous</b> <b>lesion</b> (RR 3. 44, 95 % CI 1. 11 - 10. 70, p= 0. 03) and use of amikacin in the initial antibiotic regimen (RR 6. 33, 95 % CI 2. 09 - 19. 18, p <  0. 01) were associated with an increased incidence of paradoxical reactions. Conclusions: Paradoxical reactions occur frequently during or after antibiotic treatment of M. ulcerans infections in an Australian population and may be increased in older adults, oedematous disease forms, and in those treated with amikacin. Recognition of paradoxical reactions led to changes in management with less surgery, fewer antibiotic modifications and use of prednisolone for severe reactions. <br /...|$|E

Methods Data on all confirmed Mycobacterium ulcerans cases managed at Barwon Health, Victoria, were collected from 1 / 1 / 1998 – 31 / 12 / 2012. A multivariate logistic regression model {{was used to assess}} associations with oedematous forms of Mycobacterium ulcerans disease. Results Seventeen of 238 (7 %) patients had <b>oedematous</b> Mycobacterium ulcerans <b>lesions.</b> Their median age was 70 years (IQR 17 – 82 years) and 71 % were male. Twenty-one percent of lesions were WHO category one, 35 % category two and 41 % category three. 16 (94 %) patients were initially diagnosed with cellulitis and received a median 14 days (IQR 9 – 17 days) of antibiotics and 65 % required hospitalization prior to Mycobacterium ulcerans diagnosis. Fever was present in 50 % and pain in 87 % of patients. The WCC, neutrophil count and CRP were elevated in 54 %, 62 % and 75 % of cases respectively. The median duration of antibiotic treatment was 84 days (IQR 67 – 96) and 94 % of cases required surgical intervention. On multivariable analysis, there was an increased likelihood of a <b>lesion</b> being <b>oedematous</b> if on the hand (OR 85. 62, 95 % CI 13. 69 – 535. 70; P< 0. 001), elbow (OR 7. 83, 95 % CI 1. 39 – 43. 96; p< 0. 001) or ankle (OR 7. 92, 95 % CI 1. 28 – 49. 16; p< 0. 001), or if the patient had diabetes mellitus (OR 9. 42, 95 % CI 1. 62 – 54. 74; p = 0. 02).

Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn usually appears {{days to weeks}} after a complicatedperinatal period and the most frequent risk factors are birthasphyxia, birth trauma and meconium aspiration. Clinically, the diseaseis characterized by <b>oedematous</b> <b>lesions</b> evolving into indurated,erythematous plaques and nodules. Skin lesions dissolve spontaneouslyin weeks/months. Objective. To present a rare case of subcutaneous fat necrosis of thenewborn. Case report. Monthly infant, born at time of caesarean due to fluctuationsin heart rate {{in a state of}} severe asphyxia. As a cause of respiratorydistress, meconium aspiration syndrome was confirmed. In the firstdays of life transient thrombocytopenia and elevated markers ofinflammation in the laboratory tests were observed. In addition, oedematouslesions evolving into indurated plaques and nodules on theback and upper limbs appeared. Based on a typical clinical picturediagnosis of subcutaneous fat necrosis of newborn was diagnosed. During the 3 -month follow-up a spontaneous regression of the skinlesions without scarring was observed. Conclusions.

40|$|Clinical {{pictures}} of laryngopharyngeal reflux, {{described in the}} literature, often differ considerably and are described with wide severity. Some classifications employ a total score i. e., addition of the assigned scores to single aspects of video-laryngoscopy. These classifications have the disadvantage of being complex, not reproducible and, in part, subjective. In this study, an original video-laryngoscopic classification is proposed, based on a topographic criterion with distinction of anterior, from posterior and lateral, lesions and an anatomo-pathological criterion that assigns a marked severity to the granulomatous and erosive lesions, {{in comparison with the}} erythematous and <b>oedematous</b> <b>lesions.</b> Four classes are proposed or grades of patients (A, B, C, D). The study was multicentric on 178 patients. Results were considered estimating the clinical parameters and the symptoms, correlating them at the stages of the classification proposed. The data obtained indicate that our classification presents an indicative distribution as far as concerns severity and it seems acceptable for efficacy and simplicity: no significant correlation emerged between the single manifestations and the severity of the objective picture; in the majority of cases, the most constant symptomatological triad was globus, cough and dysphonia...|$|R
40|$|Posterior {{leukoencephalopathy}} {{syndrome is}} a newly recognised brain disorder that predominantly affects the cerebral white matter. <b>Oedematous</b> <b>lesions</b> particularly involve the posterior parietal and occipital lobes, and may spread to basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum. This rapidly evolving neurological condition is clinically characterised by headache, nausea and vomiting, seizures, visual disturbances, altered sensorium, and occasionally focal neurological deficit. Posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is {{often associated with}} an abrupt increase in blood pressure and is usually seen in patients with eclampsia, renal disease, and hypertensive encephalopathy. It is also seen in the patients treated with cytotoxic and immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, and interferon alfa. The lesions of posterior leukoencephalopathy are best visualised with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. T 2 weighted MR images, at the height of symptoms, characteristically show diffuse hyperintensity selectively involving the parieto-occipital white matter. Occasionally the lesions also involve the grey matter. Computed tomography can also be used satisfactorily to detect hypodense lesions of posterior leukoencephalopathy. Early recognition of this condition is of paramount importance because prompt control of blood pressure or withdrawal of immunosuppressive agents will cause reversal of the syndrome. Delay in the diagnosis and treatment can result in permanent damage to affected brain tissues.    Keywords: leukoencephalopathy; eclampsia; hypertensive encephalopathy; occipital lobe seizure...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. A Case Report. Objective. We {{present a}} 15 -year-old girl with an acute {{atypical}} scoliosis secondary to chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). Summary of Background Data. CRMO {{is a rare}} nonpyogenic inflammatory bone condition with unclear aetiology. CRMO mainly affects the metaphyses of long bones, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and less commonly the spine. Methods. Our case presented with a 6 -month history of worsening thoracic back pain, asymmetry of her shoulders and abnormal posture. Whole spine radiographs revealed a right atypical thoracic scoliosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed abnormal signal on the short TI inversion recovery (STIR) sequences in multiple vertebrae. A bone biopsy demonstrated evidence of fibrosis and chronic inflammatory changes. Interval MRI scans revealed new <b>oedematous</b> <b>lesions</b> and disappearance of old lesions. Symptoms improved. Results. It {{is important to consider}} CRMO as an acute cause of atypical scoliosis. Malignancy, pyogenic infections and atypical presentations of juvenile arthritis need excluding. Conclusion. This 24 -month follow-up describes a rare cause of an atypical scoliosis and fortifies the small amount of the currently available literature. The case highlights the relapsing and remitting nature of CRMO with new lesions developing and older lesions burning out. We advise close radiological surveillance and symptomatic management...|$|R

40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Sarcoids are the commonest form of equine skin tumour. Several {{therapeutic}} {{measures have been}} described but none {{is considered to be}} universally effective. Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is a new anticancer therapy that utilises electrical field pulses to induce increased cell membrane permeability to antitumour hydrophilic drugs, such as cisplatin. The increased intracellular concentration of the drugs has a significant therapeutic benefit. The procedure has not been previously reported in a large number of horses. OBJECTIVE: To validate ECT as a novel alternative treatment for equine sarcoids. METHODS: A retrospective study evaluating the efficacy of cisplatin ECT in the treatment of equine sarcoids was performed. Electrochemotherapy treatments were applied under general anaesthesia at 2 week intervals with or without prior excision or debulking. Electric pulses were directly applied to the lesions following intra-tumoural injections of an aqueous solution of cisplatin. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-ninety-four sarcoids on 34 horses, 2 ponies, 11 donkeys and one mule were treated with ECT. The 4 year nonrecurrence rate was 97. 9 % for animals (47 / 48) and 99. 5 % (193 / 194) for tumours. When ECT was used as a single treatment, a significant influence of tumour size (ρ= 0. 55) on the number of treatments required for cure was shown. When prior surgery was performed, there was a significant influence (P< 0. 001) of the excision quality (complete or incomplete) and the healing mode (closed or open wound) on the number of treatments. The most common adverse effect was a slight <b>oedematous</b> reaction for <b>lesions</b> located on thin skin regions. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results demonstrate that ECT, with or without concurrent tumour debulking, is an effective alternative for treatment of equine sarcoidsPeer reviewe...|$|R
