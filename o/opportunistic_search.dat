Many research {{projects have been}} conducted for supporting collaborative search in information-seeking meetings, where searches are executed both intentionally and intensively. However, for most common meetings, Web searches may happen randomly with low-intensity. They neither serve as main tasks nor major activities. This kind of search {{can be referred to}} as <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search.</b> The area of <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> in meetings has not yet been studied. Our research is based upon this motivation. We propose an augmented tangible tabletop system with a semi-ambient conversation-context-aware surface as well as foldable paper browsers for supporting <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> in collocated meetings. In this paper, we present our design of the system and initial findings.

40|$|Effective <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> {{in visual}} {{interfaces}} for large information collections, such as documents, web pages, and annotated images, often requires domain {{knowledge that the}} information seeker does not have. Relevant semantic information, such as metadata and especially ontologies, are valuable resources for helping the user learn this domain knowledge. In this paper we describe an interactive "focus + context" visualization technique for integrating this semantic information into {{the representation of the}} information collection to support effective <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search.</b> We have implemented a prototype using these techniques that integrates WordNet, a general lexical ontology, and a large collection of professionally annotated images. As the user explores the collection, the prototype dynamically changes the visual emphasis and detail of the images and keywords to reflect the relevant semantic relationships. This interaction allows the user to rapidly learn and use the domain knowledge required for effective <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search...</b>|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} semantic fisheye views for <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> and sensemaking tasks over large collections of annotated images. Semantic fisheye views are interactive visualization techniques that reveal semantic detail and context related to a focus. These techniques reduce visual complexity by showing the most important information in detail, and de-emphasizing or filtering less important information. There are three significant contributions of this thesis. First, we have developed a framework {{for the design of}} semantic fisheye view techniques to support highly interactive tasks, such as <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> and sensemaking. Second, we have developed a prototype for exploring a large collection of annotated images based on this framework. The workspace integrates WordNet to support semantic queries and navigation over the unstructured image collection. Finally, we present the results of an experimental evaluation comparing the effectiveness of similarity and semantic-guided search for a complex search task. The results of this experiment strongly suggest that semantic-guided search is more effective for <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> and sensemaking tasks...|$|E

Most of the species were recorded at Upper Bahau (41) and at the Lalut Birai field station (33).

Consequently most of the species found were new records for the area. Approximately half of the species (51 %) were only found in relatively undisturbed areas of forest and 61 % appear to be restricted to lowland rainforest below 900 m elevation.

40|$|Search {{goals are}} often too complex or poorly defined {{to be solved}} in a single query. While {{refining}} their search goals, users are likely to apply a variety of strategies, such as searching for more general or more specific concepts {{in reaction to the}} information and structures they encounter in the results. This is called <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search.</b> In this paper we describe how semantic fisheye views (SFEV) can be designed to effectively support this search process by enabling rapid, interactive exploration of the multiple contexts that are useful for different <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> strategies. Similar to other focus + context techniques, SFEVs visually emphasize and increase the detail of information related to the focus and de-emphasize or filter less important information.

40|$|Abstract. Visual {{interfaces}} {{are potentially}} powerful tools for users {{to explore a}} representation of a collection and opportunistically discover information that will guide them towards relevant documents. Semantic fisheye views (SFEVs) are focus + context visualization techniques that manage visual complexity by selectively emphasizing and increasing the detail of information related to the user’s focus and de-emphasizing or filtering less important information. In this paper we describe a prototype for visualizing an annotated image collection and an experiment to compare the effectiveness of two distinctly different SFEVs for a complex <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> task. The first SFEV calculates relevance based on keyword-content similarity, and the second based on conceptual relationships between images derived using WordNet. The results of the experiment suggest that semantic-guided search is significantly more effective than similarity-guided search for discovering and using domain knowledge in a collection. ...|$|E

In the 1980 s and 1990 s Malaysia experienced levels of indirect tobacco advertising unprecedented in any other nation. The tobacco transnational companies referred to this form of advertising as trademark diversification (TMD) initiatives in which they set up companies for non-tobacco products naming each after a cigarette brand name. Despite cynicism from critics, the tobacco companies maintained advertising for these TMDs are not for marketing cigarettes and they are not used to circumvent a ban on direct cigarette advertising in the mass media.

Community structure and habitat associations of {{amphibians and reptiles}} on both rainy and dry seasons of six habitat types of three sites in Gunung Ciremai National Park, West Java were investigated in March and October 2008. The data of herpetofauna was obtained by <b>opportunistic</b> <b>searches.</b> Herpetofaunal diversity for each habitat was determined by using Shannon Wiener index, the species abundance per unit area was calculated by using Margalef’s index, and the homogeneity of distribution of species {{in relation to other}} species in a sampled per unit area was evaluated using Evenness index. The similarity in herpetofauna communities among habitat types was determined using Sorensen’s coefficient, meanwhile the Jaccard’s index was used to estimate similarities in habitat utilization. Thus, both of community similarities and habitat utilization displayed in cluster dendrogram. A total of 46 amphibian and reptile taxa were recorded, comprising 16 anurans, 22 lizards and 8 snakes.

40|$|We {{study the}} task of object part {{extraction}} and labeling, which seeks to understand objects beyond simply identifiying their bounding boxes. We start from bottom-up segmentation of images and search for correspondences between object parts in a few shape models and segments in images. Segments comprising different object parts in the image are usually not equally salient due to uneven contrast, illumination conditions, clutter, occlusion and pose changes. Moreover, object parts may have different scales and some parts are only distinctive and recognizable in a large scale. Therefore, we utilize a multi-scale shape representation of objects and their parts, figural contextual information of the whole object and semantic contextual information for parts. Instead of searching over a large segmentation space, we present a saliency based <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> framework to explore bottom-up segmentation by gradually expanding and bounding the search domain.

Aims To compare annual survival estimates for Dickcissel Spiza americana nests and determine if incorporating search method (structured, opportunistic, or behavioural searches) improved model fit. Methods Dickcissel nests were located using structured, opportunistic, or behavioural searches over three years (2011 – 2013) in Mississippi, USA. Models were used to estimate daily survival rates (DSRs) and to analyse factors influencing nest survival.

40|$|The {{foraging}} behaviour of {{fur seals}} and {{two species of}} surface feeding seabirds was observed over swarms of vertically migrating krill along the Antarctic Peninsula in July 1987. Fur Seal haul out patterns were correlated with krill in the upper 30 m of the water column. Krill moved to the surface at night; seals subsequently foraged from 1400 - 0700 hours before returning to floes. Foraging was continuous through the night. Dive duration decreased as krill moved up to the surface; shorter dives {{may have been more}} successful than longer ones. It is possible that very deep dives, which occur early in a foraging bout, represent more of an attempt to assess krill depth and distribution rather than being a genuine foraging effort. Seabirds responded to the presence of a surface krill swarm by circling over it and foraging; krill at depths greater than 30 m elicited directional flight and low frequencies of prey capture attempts. Both Snow Petrels and Antarctic Terns preyed on krill, but each species approached the swarms from different habitats. Snow Petrels primarily overflew areas covered by ice; terns preferred open water. This suggested that prey encounters are essentially <b>opportunistic,</b> although the <b>search</b> for prey is limited to rather specific marine habitats.

40|$|Strategic {{responses}} to complex and frequent environmental changes must balance {{the tension between}} innovative <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> and optimization of operating processes. The ability to survive and thrive depends on an ability to facilitate dispersed exploratory initiatives, test their commercial viability, and exploit the associated business opportunities. However, dispersion of authority requires coordination as well as empowerment calls for extended controls. Hence, there is a tension between the aim of avoiding diversion of corporate resources through tight control of plans and facilitation of decentralized autonomous initiatives searching for opportunities. This prescribes a strategy process that gives direction and forms structure while {{it at the same}} time enables innovative behaviors and entrepreneurial initiatives. To this end, the paper outlines an integrative model that combines centrally planned (induced) and decentralized (autonomous) strategy-making with interactive control processes. The strategy and management accounting literatures are synthesized to develop the theoretical underpinning for the model and its proposed outcome effects. It is argued that interaction control of central and dispersed strategy-making creates a dynamic system that drives organizational adaptation. The outmoded strategic control concept is revisited and updated for contemporary responsiveness needs under increasingly turbulent conditions. Finally, the paper lays out a method for an empirical survey-based study that can test the propositions from large-scale corporate sampling...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} {{in the size of}} mobile cloud as well as the volume of information necessitates efficient search mechanisms for find-ing the searched information or the target node. In this paper, we focus on search mechanisms to retrieve information from within a mobile cloud in which nodes have intermittent connectivity and hence operate on a store-carry-forward manner. We design an <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> scheme in which the searching node spreads a limited number of replicas of the query to the nodes it meets and these nodes, so called seekers, perform the search on behalf of the searching node. We assume that nodes are grouped into communities based on their interest profiles, and seekers use this community information to forward the data and the query to the right community — the community that is more likely to store the searched content. Since people store and search for similar infor-mation in the scope of their interest, the nodes in the same com-munity as the searching node have higher probability to store the searched content. We model this seeker-assisted search scheme as a continuous time Markov process and analyze its performance un-der various inter-community/intra-community meeting rate, num-ber of replicas, and network population. Our analysis shows that seeker-assisted search achieves a good balance between the search response time and search cost compared to the two extremes of epi-demic search and direct delivery search...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} compares U. S. {{responses to}} right-wing {{political parties and}} movements in West Germany, France, and Italy during {{the first decade of}} the Cold War (1945 – 1955). It demonstrates that in Western Europe both the Right and U. S. responses to it were more complex than has commonly been acknowledged. While generally preferring conservative figures over left-wing radical forces, Americans sought neither “order” nor “stability” as ends in themselves. Rather, they alternately “contained,” “cooperated” with, and “co-opted” rightists based on which groups helped or hindered the exercise of American power. This process reflected and intersected with techniques used by the dominant classes to maintain control of society and government within the United States itself. Understanding U. S. responses to the European Right illuminates American efforts to build postwar hegemony in Europe and the links between U. S. domestic and international history more broadly. ^ A case study of American responses to the West German Right during the Allied occupation comprises the heart of the study. Chapter 1 discusses major themes and defines the West German “Right. ” Chapter 2 examines the United States 2 ̆ 7 favored relationship with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and especially with the CDU leader and chancellor, Konrad Adenauer. Chapter 3 shows that the United States during the early 1950 s secretly co-opted German far rightists whose programs ostensibly undercut democratization, but who helped to contest Communism in Europe. Chapter 4 discusses U. S., U. K., and West German efforts to limit the influence of the ex-Nazi Otto Strasser, lest he rouse nationalist and neutralist sentiment harmful to American hegemony in Europe. Chapter 5 demonstrates that the United States similarly cooperated with, co-opted, and contained French and Italian Rightists based on their perceived utility or threat to the United States. The willingness of the United States to ally with overseas political figures based on expediency, rather than principle, demonstrates that an <b>opportunistic</b> <b>search</b> for power, defined largely in economic terms, but reflected materially and culturally as well, animated U.

40|$|Wireless {{communications}} are nowadays {{a dominant}} {{part of our}} lives: from domotics, through industrial applications and up to infomobility services. The key to the co-existence of wireless systems operating in closely located or even overlapping areas, is sharing of the spectral resource. The optimization of this resource is the main {{driving force behind the}} emerging changes in the policies for radio resources allocation. The current approach in spectrum usage specifies fixed frequency bands and transmission power limits for each radio transmitting system. This approach leads to a very low medium utilization factor for some frequency bands, caused by inefficient service allocation over vast geographical areas (radiomobile, radio and TV broadcasting, WiMAX) and also by the usage of large guard bands, obsolete now due to technological progress. A more flexible use of the spectral resource implies that the radio transceivers have the ability to monitor their radio environment and to adapt at specific transmission conditions. If this concept is supplemented with learning and decision capabilities, we refer to the Cognitive Radio (CR) paradigm. Some of the characteristics of a CR include localization, monitoring of the spectrum usage, frequency changing, transmission power control and, finally, the capacity of dynamically altering all these parameters (Haykin, 2005). This new cognitive approach is expected to have an important impact on the future regulations and spectrum policies. The dynamic access at the spectral resource is of extreme interest both for the scientific community as, considering the continuous request for wideband services, for the development of wireless technologies. From this point of view, a fundamental role is played by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) which in 2007 formed the Standards Coordinating Committee (SCC) 41 on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN) having as main objective a standard for dynamic access wireless networks. Still within the IEEE frame, the 802. 22 initiative defines a new WRAN (Wireless Regional Area Network) interface for wideband access based on cognitive radio techniques in the TV guard bands (the so-called “white spaces”). Coupled with the advantages and flexibility of CR systems and technologies, there is an ever-growing interest around the world in exploiting CR-enabled communications in vehicular and transportation environments. The integration of CR devices and cognitive radio networks into vehicles and associated infrastructures can lead to intelligent interactions with the transportation system, among vehicles, and even among radios within vehicles. Thus, improvements can be achieved in radio resource management and energy efficiency, road traffic management, network management, vehicular diagnostics, road traffic awareness for applications such as route planning, mobile commerce, and much more. Still open within the framework of dynamic and distributed access to the radio resource are the methods for monitoring the radio environment (the so-called “spectrum sensing”) and the transceiver technology to be used on the radio channels. A CR system works on a <b>opportunistic</b> basis <b>searching</b> for unused frequency bands called “white spaces” within the radio frequency spectrum with the intent to operate invisibly and without disturbing the primary users (PU) holding a license for one or more frequency bands. Spectrum sensing, that is, the fast and reliable detection of the PU’s even in the presence of in-band noise, is still a very complex problem with a decisive impact on the functionalities and capabilities of the CRs. The spectrum sensing techniques can be classified in two types: local and cooperative (distributed). The local techniques are performed by single devices exploiting the spectrum occupancy information in their spatial neighbourhood and can be divided into three categories (Budiarjo et al., 2008) : "matched filter" (detection of pilot signals, preambles, etc.), "energy detection” (signal strength analysis) and “feature detection" (classification of signals according to their characteristics). Also, a combination of local techniques in a multi-stage design can be used to improve the sensing accuracy (Maleki et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the above-mentioned techniques are mostly inefficient for signals with reduced power or affected by phenomena typical for vehicular technology applications, such as shadowing and multi-path fading. To overcome such problems, cooperatives techniques can be used. Cooperative sensing is based on the aggregation of the spectrum data detected by multiple nodes using cognitive convergence algorithms {{in order to avoid the}} channel impairment problems that can lead to false detections. (Sanna et al., 2009). Within the energy detection method, a particular attention needs to be paid to the properties of the packets wavelet transformation for subband analysis, which, according to the literature, seems to be a feasible alternative to the classical FFT-based energy detection. Vehicular applications are in most cases characterized by the need of coping with fast changes in the radio environment, which lead, in this specific case of cognitive communication, to constrains in terms of short execution time of the spectrum sensing operations. From this point of view, the computational complexity of the wavelet packets method is of the same order of the state-of-the-art FFT algorithms, but the number of mathematical operations is lower using IIR polyphase filters (Murroni et al., 2010). In our work we are investigating the use of the wavelet packets for energy detection spectrum sensing operations based on the consideration that they have a finite duration and are self- and mutually-orthogonal at integer multiples of dyadic intervals. Hence, they are suitable for subband division and analysis: a generic signal can be then decomposed on the wavelet packet basis and represented as a collection of coefficients belonging to orthogonal subbands. Therefore, the total power of the signal can be evaluated as sum of the contributions of each subband, which can be separately computed in the wavelet domain. Furthermore, the wavelet packets can be used also for the feature detection spectrum sensing, using statistical parameters such as moments and medians. We concentrate in our research on both applications of the wavelet packets to the spectrum sensing operations, investigating their efficiency in terms of reliability and execution time, applied specifically to the needs of vehicular technology and transportation environments. The other key issue for the development of the previously mentioned standard is the choice of an adaptive/multicarrier modulation as basic candidate for data transmission, having as the most known representative the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. OFDM-like schemes are mature enough to be chosen as a core technology for dynamic access wireless networks. At the same time, the potentialities in terms of optimization for this specific purpose are not yet thoroughly investigated. Particularly, the Wavelet Packet Division Multiplexing (WPDM) modulation method, already known for about ten years to the scientific community, is a suitable candidate to satisfy the requirements on physical level for a dynamic access network (Wong et al., 1997) : WPDM has already proven to be able to overcome some of the OFDM limits (limited spectral efficiency, problems with temporal synchronization especially in channels affected by fading) and is at the same time based on use of the same wavelet packets employed for subband analysis used for spectrum sensing operations. Our research investigates the use of the WPDM for cognitive radio purposes, combined with the wavelet approach for spectrum sensing, for offering a complete, wavelet-based solution for cognitive application focused on the problematic of vehicular communication (channel impairments, high relative velocity of the communication peers etc.). ...|$|R
