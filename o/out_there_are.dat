5|$|Increases in {{the number}} of CAT operations, and {{in the number}} of {{airports}} they operate from, has resulted in a corresponding increase in Class A controlled airspace. Between 1997 and 2006 this area grew in size from 13 per cent of all airspace to 22 per cent nationally, and from 24 per cent to 43 per cent in airspace above England and Wales, leading to a perception within the GA community of being squeezed <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> particular problems for GA around large airports, where Class A controlled airspace extends to ground level. The concentration of commercial operations and high demand for GA in the South East of England have also resulted in extensive areas of Class A controlled airspace there, which serve to channel uncontrolled GA operations through high-collision-risk hot spots.|$|E

25|$|Yield curves {{are usually}} upward sloping asymptotically: {{the longer the}} maturity, the higher the yield, with {{diminishing}} marginal increases (that is, as one moves to the right, the curve flattens <b>out).</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> two common explanations for upward sloping yield curves. First, {{it may be that}} the market is anticipating a rise in the risk-free rate. If investors hold off investing now, they may receive a better rate in the future. Therefore, under the arbitrage pricing theory, investors who are willing to lock their money in now need to be compensated for the anticipated rise in rates—thus the higher interest rate on long-term investments.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{tradition}} {{states that}} the Zamzam Well was revealed to Hajra, the second wife of Abraham and mother of Ishmael. By the instruction of God, Abraham left {{his wife and son}} at a spot in the desert and walked away. She was desperately seeking water for her infant son, but she could not find any, as Mecca is located in a hot dry valley with few sources of water. Hajra ran seven times {{back and forth in the}} scorching heat between the two hills of Safa and Marwah, looking for water. Getting thirstier by the second, the infant Ishmael scraped the land with his feet, where suddenly water sprang <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> other versions of the story involving God sending his angel, Gabriel (Jibra'il), who kicked the ground with his heel (or wing), and the water rose. A similar story about a well is also mentioned in the Bible.|$|E
25|$|The town of Peñamiller {{is a small}} {{community}} of less than 1,100 as of 2005, located in {{the west of the}} municipality at an altitude of 1330 meters. The town is wedged between mountains and the banks of the Extoraz River. It was founded and named by José de Escandón {{in the middle of the}} 18th century. He named it Peña Mellera as the mountain now known as Picacho just east of the town reminded him of a similar formation in the Peñamellera Bajo in Spain. Inside and just outside the town there are many walnut trees. Just further <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many tall cactus and buzzards can frequently be seen circling in the air riding on warm air currents. Many of the town’s roads are still dirt. The main church building dates from the 19th century and the municipal palace building is one of the oldest in the town. The municipal seat has one public library called the Biblioteca Pública Municipal Lic. Benito Juárez. It offers lending of books with home delivery, research help, guided tours, story hours for children and digital services.|$|E

500|$|At hatching, {{a typical}} {{salamander}} larva has eyes without lids, teeth in both {{upper and lower}} jaws, three pairs of feathery external gills, a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins. The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond-living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water. Pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers, rod-like structures {{on either side of}} the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment. Some members of the genera Ambystoma and Dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form, but this varies with species and with populations. The northwestern salamander (Ambystoma gracile) is one of these and, depending on environmental factors, either remains permanently in the larval state, a condition known as neoteny, or transforms into an adult. Both of these are able to breed. Neoteny occurs when the animal's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine. Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food, lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics. The tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process. The adult tiger salamander is terrestrial, but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state. When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land, larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> fifteen species of [...] neotenic salamanders, including species of Necturus, Proteus and Amphiuma, and many examples of [...] ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances.|$|E
