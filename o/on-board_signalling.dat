40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{connected}} objects {{have started}} to invade our daily lives. In terms of transport, connected cars have been studied through research projects {{for more than ten}} years. Car manufacturers are now in a pilot deployment phase of the cooperative systems technologies (C-ITS). The SCOOP@F project is the French national C-ITS pilot deployment project started in March 2014 and being financially supported but the European Commission. Five pilot sites have been identified, amongst them, the national road network of Ile-de-France. This project is lead by the general direction of infrastructure of the French Ministry in charge of Transport and involves car manufacturers, academic institutes and road operators (public or private). In {{the second part of the}} project (2016 - 2018), cross road tests should be undertaken with other countries, such as Spain, Portugal or Austria. A telecom operator will also join the project to test the hybridation of technologies between ITS-G 5 and cellular technologies. The SCOOP@IdF project will implement over 300 km of roads (out of 800 km), with about one road side unit every 3 km. A road side unit is the interface between the traffic management system and the vehicles to exchange information using ITS-G 5 technology. Given the need to develop specific applications for road operators, it was decided to develop a second-handed “road operators on-board unit”: about 150 operating vehicles will be equipped as well. Sirius, DiRIF's traffic management system will be adapted to accept the new information from road users and to provide them with in-vehicle information. Many use cases will be implemented in the project SCOOP@F, and consequently in the SCOOP@IdF project:–data collection: average speeds, automatically or manually declared events from user equipped vehicles;–road works warnings: operating vehicles will send their position to users around to alert them of their interventions (planned or unplanned);–road hazard signalling: slippery roads, end of queue, persons/animals/obstacles on the roads, etc. In a second phase of the project (2016 - 2018), other use cases will be implemented such as, <b>on-board</b> <b>signalling,</b> traffic information (such as travel time or POI information), multimodal information (park and ride availability for example). The first results of this study have underlined that the existing standards usually lack the point of view of the road operator. New versions of the standards need to be published soon for a proper implementation on sites. By spring 2016, prototypes of road side units and on-board units should have been tested and deployments should be imminent. The implementation of cooperative systems needs an important implication of road operators. RSU, as light or small as they can be, need to have energy and need to be connected to the network. There will be operators using the system, affecting their missions. This new technology will bring new information, more precise information, but also new systems and new procedures to deal with them. The article will focus on the impacts on DiRIF organisations and systems, and the implemented methods to deal with them, and evaluate them...|$|E
30|$|The area to {{be covered}} with a train-to-wayside {{connection}} is the rail corridor where the trains pass through. The GIS model described above is used to estimate the coverage rate of the rail corridor based on the legacy network of the mobile network operator. We use the GIS model to calculate if coverage by the legacy network is sufficient (minimum 95 %). If not, extra radio base stations are required. A genetic algorithm {{is used to calculate}} the amount of additional radio base stations that are needed to reach the minimum coverage rate. We assume that <b>on-board</b> <b>signal</b> repeaters are installed on the train to overcome attenuation losses. To provide the trains with a connection with the required bandwidth, the 3 G network of Proximus, a Belgian network operator was considered. Since the cellular network is a shared resource, a number of users will be active within the cell that are not on the train (we assume six extra users). On certain special occasions, the number of active users could be even higher. For example, when another train crosses or when an event is organized near a train line. For the case considered, bandwidth requirements are set at peak traffic demand of two crossing trains at peak capacity increased with six additional users who are not on the train. The output of the GIS model indicates, for the assumed parameters, that the available cellular network of Proximus can provide adequate bandwidth when <b>on-board</b> <b>signal</b> repeaters are deployed. As such, no extra radio base stations need to be deployed. Note that without <b>on-board</b> <b>signal</b> repeaters 109, 282 and 594 additional radio base stations have to be deployed to provide a data connection of respectively 1, 3.6 and 7.2 Mbps to the train.|$|R

The wide bandwidths available at EHF can be used for higher capacity systems to meet projected future service requirements and for spread spectrum modulation techniques for interference rejection and/or multiple access purposes. Evolution into these higher frequencies also offers the opportunity to develop systems and signalling structures which are functionally common across multiple user communities. Such techniques provide interoperability possibilities while allowing more efficient use of space assets and minimizing the number of unique terminal developments. Due to user-platform space and prime power limitations as well as to terminal production, installation, and maintenance costs for large user populations, it is also important that EHF system configurations accommodate small, low-power terminals. One such approach involves departing from traditional SATCOM designs by incorporating increased satellite sophistication for reduced terminal size and complexity requirements. The associated spacecraft would employ advanced technologies such as uplink antenna discrimination., <b>on-board</b> <b>signal</b> processing, and downlink beamhopping.
