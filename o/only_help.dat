5|$|In WWE's {{documentary}} CM Punk: Best in the World {{released in}} 2012, {{it was documented}} from the out-of-universe perspective that a disenchanted Punk rejected signing a new contract with WWE {{for more than a}} year leading up to Money in the Bank. After being persuaded by Joey Mercury and Lars Frederiksen that he could <b>only</b> <b>help</b> wrestlers underappreciated by WWE (like himself) if he stayed, Punk signed a new contract with WWE about an hour before capturing the WWE Championship from Cena, while the pay-per-view event was ongoing.|$|E

It {{involved}} the radical writing down of war debts, which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round, but at the same time thrown the entire cost of European reconstruction on the United States.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich {{was tried}} in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a {{trafficking}} offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain less serious charges. During the lengthy trial the accused had no legal representation. Although he had applied to the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria for assistance, {{they said that they}} would <b>only</b> <b>help</b> him if he pleaded guilty, an option which Dietrich did not want to take. He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for legal assistance, but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge—regarding the possession of a quantity of heroin separate to that which was involved in the first three charges—he was convicted of the principal charge in the County Court. Dietrich brought an appeal in the Supreme Court, but that court refused to hear his appeal. He then sought leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Fady can not <b>only</b> <b>help</b> protect lemurs {{and their}} forests under stable {{socioeconomic}} situations, {{but they can}} also lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town. In other ways, fady does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo, other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead. Fady can vary from village to village within the same region. If people move to a new village or region, their fady may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. Fady restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.|$|E
5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith. Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's scythe and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel {{to get to a}} dimension that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this in order to gain the piece of Giles's soul in the scythe, but will <b>only</b> <b>help</b> reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} of rural areas {{has been declining}} over time {{as more and more}} people migrate to cities for work and entertainment. The great exodus from the farms came in the 1940s; in recent years fewer than 2% of the population lives on farms (though many others live in the countryside and commute to work). Electricity and telephone, and sometimes cable and Internet services are available to all but the most remote regions. As in the cities, children attend school up to and including high school and <b>only</b> <b>help</b> with farming during the summer months or after school.|$|E
25|$|In 1791, the {{government}} passed the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791, which gave some concession. In 1792, {{a town meeting}} in Belfast, saw a declaration in favour of full Catholic emancipation, opposing suggestions for a gradual process. In an attempt to prevent a union of the Catholic Committee and radicalised Protestants, {{the government}} during 1792 passed yet more bills repealing laws against Catholics. Despite this, whilst they could appeal for further civil rights, Catholics were to be firmly refused political enfranchisement. This refusal <b>only</b> <b>help</b> cause the union that the establishment had been seeking to prevent.|$|E
25|$|The first {{efforts to}} tackle Dublin's {{extensive}} slum areas {{came on the}} foundation of the Iveagh Trust in 1891, and the Dublin Artisan Dwellings Company, but these could <b>only</b> <b>help</b> several thousand families. The main focus by government in 1900–1914 was in building 40,000 cottages for rural workers. Some public planning for the city was made {{in the first years of}} the Irish Free State and then effected after 1932, when Éamon de Valera came to power. With greater finances available, and lower wages due to the Great Depression, major changes began to take place. A scheme of replacing tenements with decent housing for Dublin's poor began. Some new suburbs such as Marino and Crumlin were built but Dublin's inner city slums remained.|$|E

25|$|P. dominula is {{a social}} insect that lives in colonies. They are haplodiploid insects, as are other Polistes species. The haploid males produce {{identical}} haploid sperm, and diploid females produce haploid eggs through meiosis. In most social insects, colonies are composed of related individuals, and social insects are assumed to help close relatives according to W. D. Hamilton's theory of kin selection. However, in P. dominula, 35% of the nest mates are unrelated. In many other species, unrelated individuals <b>only</b> <b>help</b> the queen when no other options are present. In this case, subordinates work for unrelated queens even when other options may be present. No other social insect submits to unrelated queens in this way. This seemingly unfavorable behavior parallels some vertebrate systems. This unrelated assistance may be evidence of altruism in P. dominula.|$|E
25|$|Freshwater {{streams and}} {{estuaries}} provide important habitat for many salmon species. They feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young, and primarily on other fish when older. Eggs are laid in deeper water with larger gravel, and need cool water and good water flow (to supply oxygen) {{to the developing}} embryos. Mortality of salmon in the early life stages is usually high due to natural predation and human-induced changes in habitat, such as siltation, high water temperatures, low oxygen concentration, loss of stream cover, and reductions in river flow. Estuaries and their associated wetlands provide vital nursery areas for the salmon prior to their departure to the open ocean. Wetlands not <b>only</b> <b>help</b> buffer the estuary from silt and pollutants, but also provide important feeding and hiding areas.|$|E
25|$|The popular idea {{seems to}} be that the Title is among the ranking factors and the {{description}} is more of an advertising for the searcher looking at the search results. In other words, while the Title tag is one of the factors determining if a page will rank for a certain keyword, the meta description will <b>only</b> <b>help</b> a search result stand out (or not, depending upon how well-written it is). If more people click on a result with a good description, it may reasonably be expected that Google will reward that same result with a higher ranking. This, of course, if visitors to the link do not immediately leave the page after visiting - that would indicate misleading or poor content. This, in fact, would be likely to demote the result on SERP (Search Engine Results Page).|$|E

25|$|After {{graduating from}} high school she turned {{professional}} and signed a contract with Nike Japan. In the 1983 season she won her first 400m title at the Japan Championships, but relinquished her 200m title to Emiko Konishi. She regained her 200m title in 1984 and was not defeated nationally in the event for another four years. Her win streak of five only came to an end in 1989 when Toshie Kitada took the crown. She was a prominent pick for the 1985 Asian Athletics Championships but was less successful that year. She placed last in eighth in the 200m final, could <b>only</b> <b>help</b> the Japanese women to sixth in the 4×100m relay, but did manage to come away with a silver in the 4×400m relay, behind a P. T. Usha-led Indian team. In November that year she helped set an Asian record in the infrequently competed 4×200 metres relay. The team of Konishi, Etsuko Hara, Isozaki and Koshimoto ran a time of 1:35.90 minutes in Hamamatsu. This record stood for nearly thirty years, with a Chinese team finally beating it at the 2015 IAAF World Relays.|$|E
25|$|Fluoxetine is a {{racemic mixture}} of (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where both enantiomers {{contribute}} to its biological activity. Since mono-substitution in the 4-para {{position of the}} phenoxy group (figure 4) results in selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake, a disubstitution i.e. 2,3- or 2,4- substitution therefore results {{in a loss of}} SERT selectivity. Fluoxetine has the widest spectrum of activity since it is the least SERT selective of all the SSRIs. Fluoxetine also has a 5-HT2C antagonist activity where it blocks the 5-HT activity of 5-HT2C receptors enhancing the release of both NE and DA. A 5-HT2C antagonist do not <b>only</b> <b>help</b> out with therapeutic effects of fluoxetine but also the tolerability of the drug. The advantage of being 5-HT2C antagonist is that it has a stimulatory effect and many patients have experienced an increase in energy, concentration and focus and a decrease in fatigue from the very first dose. The stimulant activity of 5-HT2C antagonist can however, be a disadvantage for patients with agitation, insomnia and anxiety. Another feature of fluoxetine is a weak NE re-uptake inhibition which can have clinical effect in higher doses. Fluoxetine also has a long half-life which can reduce withdrawal symptoms which are characteristic for some SSRIs after abrupt discontinuation, but it also means that {{it takes a long time}} to clear the drug and its active metabolite after discontinuing fluoxetine treatment.|$|E
25|$|Exactly when Edgar {{reformed}} the coinage is not certain: {{that it was}} {{towards the}} end of his reign is clear from the coins, and the <b>only</b> <b>help</b> provided by written sources is a reference in Roger of Wendover’s 13th-century chronicle, which implies the reform may have taken place in or after 973. Its impact, however, cannot be underestimated, and it formed the basis of the English coinage until the reign of Henry II. Old coins disappeared from circulation and a single standardised type was introduced at around forty mints across the country, bearing the royal portrait and title on the obverse and the names of moneyer and mint around a small central cross on the reverse. Initially, too, all new dies were distributed from a single die-cutting centre located at Winchester. Such centralisation was unusual, and occurred in {{only a few of the}} other types that came after: more commonly, the same type was used throughout the country but die production devolved to a number of regional die-cutting centres which distributed dies to nearby, smaller mints. Even within the nine-month reign of Harold II in 1066 coins were struck with a new design in his name at forty-eight mints. Around seventy places in England (and in Wales under the Normans) were active as mints during this period, ranging hugely in size and productivity: the largest was London, though York and Lincoln remained important throughout the period, and other major mints included Winchester, Norwich and Stamford. At the other end of the scale are places that were never important mints in the Anglo-Saxon period and are little more than villages, hillforts and market towns today, including Melton Mowbray, Milborne Port, Castle Gotha, Cadbury Castle and Dunwich. Mints of this kind were often only active during short periods, such as a number of 'emergency' mints set up during the reign of Æthelred II because of Viking depredations.|$|E
