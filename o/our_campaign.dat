500|$|In {{order to}} build support early in the campaign, Hunter participated in local straw polls. On March 1, at the Spartanburg, South Carolina poll, Hunter {{finished}} a close third in a statistical tie with McCain and Giuliani. The showing impressed Spartanburg Republican Gerald Emory who referred to Hunter as, [...] "a true Ronald Reagan conservative that we can support." [...] The following month he won the Anderson County, South Carolina straw poll and tied for second place in both the Greenwood County and Pickens County straw polls. Hunter thanked the counties for their support, which he claimed provided [...] "a huge boost." [...] He added, [...] "t is clear our message of maintaining a strong national defense, securing our border without amnesty, holding China accountable on trade, and protecting life are resonating with the voters. <b>Our</b> <b>campaign</b> is one of issues, not flash and expense. We don't have a jet or an army of consultants and paid staff. We do have the conservative message that is true. In the end, that will be what Americans want." ...|$|E
500|$|The Tom Cruise {{video is}} {{referred}} to specifically {{at the start of}} the Anonymous YouTube video posting, and is characterized as a [...] "propaganda video". The video utilizes a synthesized voice and shows floating cloud images using a time lapse method as the speaker addresses the leaders of Scientology directly: [...] "We shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form..." [...] The video goes on to state: [...] "We recognize you as serious opponents, and do not expect <b>our</b> <b>campaign</b> to be completed in a short time frame. However, you will not prevail forever against the angry masses of the body politic. Your choice of methods, your hypocrisy, and the general artlessness of your organization have sounded its death knell. You have nowhere to hide because we are everywhere... We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us." [...] By January 25, 2008, only four days after its release, the video had been viewed 800,000 times, and by February 8, 2008 had been viewed over 2million times. Author Warren Ellis called the video [...] "creepy in and of itself" [...] and a [...] "manifesto, declaration of war, sharp political film".|$|E

2500|$|Cronkite was a vocal {{advocate}} for free airtime for political candidates. He {{worked with the}} Alliance for Better Campaigns and Common Cause, for instance, on an unsuccessful lobbying effort to have an amendment added to the McCain-Feingold-Shays-Meehan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2001 that would have required TV broadcast companies to provide free airtime to candidates. Cronkite criticized the present system of campaign finance which allows elections to [...] "be purchased" [...] by special interests, and he noted that all the European democracies [...] "provide their candidates with extensive free airtime." [...] "In fact," [...] Cronkite pointed out, [...] "of all the major nations worldwide that profess to have democracies, only seven – just seven – do not offer free airtime" [...] This put the United States on a list with Ecuador, Honduras, Malaysia, Taiwan, Tanzania, and Trinidad and Tobago. Cronkite concluded that [...] "The failure to give free airtime for our political campaigns endangers our democracy." [...] During the elections held in 2000, the amount spent by candidates in the major TV markets approached $1 billion. [...] "What <b>our</b> <b>campaign</b> asks is that the television industry yield just a tiny percentage of that windfall, less than 1 percent, to fund free airtime." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was this}} period, that the Revolutionary Democratic Group were {{expelled}} and became in their words, [...] "an external faction". The SWP {{was involved in}} the relaunch the ANL in 1992 in response to the growth of the British National Party and campaigned against the Criminal Justice Bill. A demonstration for justice for murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence near the BNP headquarters in Welling in 1993 turned into a violent confrontation with the police, leading to criticism from Ken Livingstone, then a Labour MP and a supporter of the rival Anti-Racist Alliance (ARA), in which Socialist Action plaed a major role. Livingstone argued that this kind of action was playing {{into the hands of the}} BNP. He said at the time: [...] "'No one's discussing [...] policies. Now the question is the violence of the SWP, arguments between the police and the SWP about who is to blame." [...] Although Stephen's mother Doreen Lawrence attended the Welling demo, she came to realise that the ANL was a [...] "front for the Socialist Workers Party". She later wrote that [...] "the various groups that had taken an interest in Stephen's death were tearing each other apart and were in danger of destroying <b>our</b> <b>campaign</b> which we wanted to keep focused and dignified", and Doreen and Neville Lawrence wrote to both the ANL and ARA to demand that they [...] "stop using Stephen's name".|$|E
2500|$|Tsvangirai was {{detained}} near Lupane on 4 June, {{along with his}} security team and other top MDC officials, such as Thokozani Khupe and Lovemore Moyo. A lawyer for the MDC said that Tsvangirai was alleged to have addressed a rally near Lupane without permission. His vehicle was stopped by police at a roadblock and his motorcade was searched; after two hours, {{he was taken to}} a police station. The MDC described this as [...] "part of a determined and well-orchestrated effort to derail <b>our</b> <b>campaign</b> programme", while the US government called the incident [...] "deeply disturbing" [...] and the German government demanded his release; Amnesty International said that it was [...] "part of a sudden, sharp and dangerous crackdown on political opposition {{in the run-up to the}} elections". Tsvangirai was released later on the same day after nine hours. Bvudzijena, the police spokesman, rejected any suggestion that the police were trying to interfere in Tsvangirai's campaign; he explained the detention by saying that the police had wanted to determine whether a vehicle in Tsvangirai's motorcade had valid registration. According to Bvudzijena, the police had wanted to take only the driver of this vehicle to the police station to review the relevant documents, but that Tsvangirai and the rest of his entourage insisted on coming as well. Although the MDC said that Tsvangirai was released only after being charged with [...] "attracting a large number of people", Bvudzijena said that he had not been charged. In a statement on 5 June, Tsvangirai vowed to persevere, and the MDC said that he was continuing his campaign.|$|E
