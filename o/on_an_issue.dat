5|$|Python's {{development}} is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process. The PEP {{process is the}} primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community and by Van Rossum, the Python project's Benevolent Dictator For Life.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{doctrine}} {{has developed}} over the centuries, reflecting direct teachings of early Christians, formal definitions of heretical and orthodox beliefs by ecumenical councils and in papal bulls, and theological debate by scholars. The Church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit as it discerns new theological issues and is protected infallibly from falling into doctrinal error when a firm decision <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> is reached.|$|E
5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> and then referred the issue to the senators, who discussed the matter by order of seniority. Unimportant matters could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands, while important votes resulted in a physical division of the house, with senators voting by taking a place {{on either side of}} the chamber. Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E

5|$|Works by Daisy Jugadai {{are held}} by the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. They are also held in major private collections, such as Nangara (also known as the Ebes Collection), {{as well as by}} Edith Cowan University. First exhibiting in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards in 1993, she was a finalist on several {{occasions}} including 1995, 1998 and 2001, and a section winner in 2000. Her 1994 entry in the award, Karu kapingku pungu (Creek after rain), belongs to the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. Her work is also featured alongside other Indigenous artists such as Gloria Petyarre in the Melbourne international airport terminal, completed in 1996. Antiti, near Five Mile, a 1998 painting, has appeared as cover art <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of the Medical Journal of Australia.|$|E

Because Lebanon was governed by France as a League of Nations mandate 1919–1943, France has long taken a special interest in Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|The court {{looked at}} the {{language}} of section 32 {{and found that it}} does not limit to only positive acts. It is not only to protect against encroachment on rights or the excessive exercise of authority, as McClung suggested, rather it is a tool for citizens to challenge the law in all its forms. The legislature's silence <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> does not constitute neutrality with first assessing the application of section 15.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} ways a {{case can be}} heard in the Supreme Court: (1) filing {{directly}} in the Supreme Court; (2) filing in a lower federal court, such as a district court, and appealing {{all the way up to}} the Supreme Court; (3) filing in a state court, appealing all the way up through the state's highest courts, and then appealing to the Supreme Court <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of federal law. The first is an exercise of the Court's original jurisdiction; the second and third are exercises of the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction.|$|E

Marshall). A California bankruptcy court had awarded Smith part of the estate, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal said that a bankruptcy court could not make a decision <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> outside bankruptcy law.

25|$|Philosophy is a {{discipline}} or {{field of study}} involving the investigation, analysis, and development of ideas at a general, abstract, or fundamental level. It is the discipline searching for a general understanding of reality, reasoning and values. Major fields of philosophy include logic, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and axiology (which includes ethics and aesthetics). Philosophy covers a very wide range of approaches, and is {{used to refer to}} a worldview, to a perspective <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> or to the positions argued for by a particular philosopher or school of philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Critics object {{claiming}} that the ASEAN Way's emphasis on consultation, consensus, and non-interference, forces the organisation to adopt only those policies which satisfy the lowest common denominator. Decision making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b> Members {{may not have a}} common conception of the meaning of the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasise non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination. These differences hinder efforts to find common solutions to particular issues, but also make it difficult to determine when collective action is appropriate in a given situation.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the channel's {{commitment}} to community broadcasting, the channel produced the symbolic Open Space series, a strand developed in the early 1970s in which members of the public would be allotted half an hour of television time, and given a level of editorial and technical training in order to produce for themselves a film <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> most important to them. BBC2's Community Programme Unit kept this aspect of the channel's tradition alive into the 1990s in the form of Video Diaries and later Video Nation. The Community Programmes Unit was disbanded in 2004.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the liquor controversy growing in the province, there was another testing of citizens' sentiment <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b> The government decided to hold a plebiscite among egg producers {{on whether or not}} to establish a compulsory egg marketing board. That plebiscite was originally to be held in June 1957, but Leonard Halmrast, the Minister of Agriculture, decided to hold it in conjunction with the liquor plebiscite so that the sentiment of Egg producers could be tested {{at the same time as}} voters for the liquor plebiscite, to save costs. That decision later led to controversy when numerous producers were missed after the plan was defeated in a close vote.|$|E
25|$|Luther {{produced}} other works: sermons, {{which were}} read in Churches around the Empire; translations of the Bible, primarily the New Testament written in German; doctrine {{on how to}} conduct oneself within the church and society; and a multitude of letters and treatises. Often Luther wrote in response to others who had criticized his works or asked for clarification or justification <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b> Three of Luther’s major treatises, written in 1520, are To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, On the Freedom of a Christian, and On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church; these works were significant documents for the Reformation as a whole.|$|E
25|$|The first {{revision}} of the Belgian constitution came in 1893 under Leopold's reign. Universal male suffrage was introduced, though {{the effect of this}} was tempered by plural voting. The eligibility requirements for the senate were reduced, and elections would be based on a system of proportional representation, which continues to this day. Leopold pushed strongly to pass a royal referendum, whereby the king would have the power to consult the electorate directly <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> and use his veto according to the results of the referendum. The proposal was rejected, as it would have given the king the power to override the elected government; Leopold was so disappointed that he considered abdication.|$|E
