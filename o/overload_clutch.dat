Maintenance of operating conditions in engineering equipment which was produced earlier by the USSR enterprises is {{considered as a}} rather complicated task {{due to lack of}} spare parts because their production has been discontinued. One of the approaches used for maintenance of engineering equipment combat capabilities is modernization of operating drive systems that presupposes replacement of mechanical systems in working element drives by hydrostatic drives which are realized while using modern element base. Usage of hydraulic units in drive systems being in mass production for replacement of mechanical systems manufactured earlier in small batches makes it possible to reduce labour inputs for maintenance and repair of machines. The paper presents some possibilities for development of operating drive systems in engineering equipment. The proposed approach is given through an example of  engineering obstacle-clearing vehicle (IMR- 2 M) and excavation machines (MDK- 3 and MDK- 2 M). Application of a hydraulic drive in working elements of the excavation machines permits to withdraw from cardan  shafts, a gear box, a rotary gear and an <b>overload</b> <b>clutch.</b> A hydraulic motor of the cutter and thrower drive is mounted  on a working element gearbox. While executing modernization of hydraulic systems in excavation machines a pump unit has been proposed for the cutter and thrower drive which consists of a controlled pump and a system for automatic maintenance of the pump operational parameters. While developing the operating drive systems in engineering equipment in accordance with the proposed requirements it is possible to simplify drive systems of working elements and  ensure reliable machinery operation in the units of engineer troops.  </p...|$|E

Vid hög temperatur påverkas konstruktionsmaterialens egenskaper vilket kan skada maskinelementen. Problemet återfinns hos fiskerullars överlastkoppling. Syftet med arbetet var att minska risken för skador på fiskerullar orsakad av hög temperatur utan att förändra dimensionerna på fiskerullar.   En utredning av vilka parametrar som temperaturökningen beror av vid friktion ställdes upp. Parametrarna undersöktes i en litteraturstudie med avseende på hur de påverkar temperaturökningen. De parametrar som inte krävde dimensionsförändringar var de materialberoende. Dessa parametrar var värmekapacitet, värmeledningsförmåga, friktionstal och densitet.    Fiskerullen av modell Daiwa Saltiga användes som referensmodell. Konstruktionen hos fiskerullens överlastkoppling analyserades. Analysen användes för att utvärdera om det går att anpassa de materialberoende parametrarna med ett materialbyte i referensrullens överlastkoppling, för att optimera fiskerullar mot temperaturskador. Materialdatabasen CES EduPack användes för att jämföra materialen i referensmodellens överlastkoppling, som består av rostfritt stål, mot andra material. Analyser visade att vid ett materialbyte ansågs nickel teoretiskt kunna optimera referensmodellen ur arbetets syfte. Nickel har högre värmekapacitet per volymenhet samt högre värmeledningsförmåga än referensmaterialet rostfritt stål. Det skapade även ett likvärdigt friktionstal vid direkt byte av det befintliga materialet i referensmodellen. Arbetets vidare undersökningar fann att nickel och rostfritt stål erhåller olika hårdhet varpå nötningen kommer påverkas. Ett förslag för att lösa detta skulle kunna vara att belägga nicklet med samma sorts rostfritt stål som finns i referensmodellen. Vilket skulle göra nötningen opåverkad fram till beläggningen slitits ned. Hur nötningen påverkas vid materialbyte mot nickel eller om en beläggning är tillämpbart samt hur friktionstalet förändras vid olika temperaturer har inte undersökts utan anses vara ett vidare arbete. Heat energy {{generated}} by friction causes problem in machine {{elements such as}} breaks and clutches. This is an effect of the high temperatures which affect the material and {{increases the risk of}} damage to the components. This is for example a problem in overload clutches in fishing gear. This study aims to decrease the risk of damage to fishing gear which is caused by high temperature from the clutch, without changing the dimensions.   A research was used to determine which parameters affect the temperature change during friction. These parameters were analyzed using a literature study regarding how they affect temperature rise. The study finds that the parameters that weren’t depending on dimensions were dependent on materialdata. The parameters were heat capacity, heat conductivity, constant of friction and the density.    The fishing reel Daiwa Saltiga is used as a reference model and the <b>overload</b> <b>clutch</b> in this reel was analyzed. This was later used to examine if the parameters could be altered to improve the clutch´s resistance to damage caused by overheating. The material database CES EduPack was used to compare different material to the stainless steel disks in the reference model. One material was found that has both higher heat capacity per unit volume and higher thermal conductivity. The material also has an equal constant of friction.    The material is nickel and it was considered to be able to improve the performance of the <b>overload</b> <b>clutch.</b> Even though nickel is better out of some perspective it is softer then stainless steel. This could lead to different rates of wear. One suggestion to solve this is to laminate the nickel with the same stainless steel found in the reference model. Which would lead to the same wear until the laminate is worn off. If this is possible to retain the wear rate or how the constant of friction is affected by temperature has not been analyzed in this study, this is considered as a further study...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 46 - 47). The growing technology associated with petroleum equipment has lead to an increase in electrical components used to measure, adjust and control many aspects of the petroleum extraction process. This increase in electrical use has lead to the conversion of many components from hydraulic operation to electric. Therefore, it is the purpose of this report to detail and propose an engineering solution to the electrical conversion of a surface controlled subsea safety valve (SCSSV). Preliminary analysis has resulted in the following important functional requirements that the SCSSV should operate within: Temperatures up to 350 F. Estimated operational life of 20 years. Peak available power of 4300 W (actual value will be much lower than this due to other power system drains). The three conceptual designs presented in this report are the following: Electric motor actuator with a solenoid latching detent. Linear actuation with a fluid reservoir locking valve. Rotational engagement with an electric locking clutch. After reviewing and comparing these concepts, the last concept was chosen to be further developed. This concept will have the least temperature sensitive components and fewer leak path problem areas. Upon completion of the detailed design phase an electric SCSSV solution has been proposed. The following is a brief list of the performance claims: Power requirement to open: 0. 5 W. Time required to open valve: 10 minutes. Installable inline with 4 - 1 / 2 tubing. Operating temperature range: 20 - 350 F. H?S service certified. Hold open energy requirements 0 ~ 0. 2 W. There are however practical issues that must be addressed to ensure reliable and satisfactory performance of the SCSSV. The actual efficiency of the cylindrical cam mechanism and reliability of the torque <b>overload</b> <b>clutch</b> must be empirically determined due to the number of theoretical assumptions used. Thus these items should be thoroughly tested in order to produce a reliable and satisfactory SCSSV. It is with these claims and working issue that this electrically converted SCSSV be fully developed and installed for electrical petroleum production systems...|$|E
