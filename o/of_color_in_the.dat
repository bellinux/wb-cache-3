In 2009, Forbes confirmed that Woods was indeed the world's first athlete to earn over a billion dollars (before taxes) in his career, after accounting for the $10million bonus Woods received for the FedEx Cup title. The same year, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $600million, making him the second richest person <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, behind only Oprah Winfrey. In 2015, Woods ranked ninth in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, being the top among Asian Americans or the fourth among African Americans.|$|E

5|$|SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth {{arrives in}} Kraków to oversee {{construction}} of Płaszów concentration camp. When {{the camp is}} completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed {{in the process of}} emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat – one of the few splashes <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> black-and-white film – as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body (identifiable by the red coat) among those on a wagon load of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Göth brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp.|$|E

25|$|As a port New Orleans {{played a}} major role during the antebellum era in the Atlantic slave trade. The port handled {{commodities}} for export from the interior and imported goods from other countries, which were warehoused and transferred in New Orleans to smaller vessels and distributed along the Mississippi River watershed. The river was filled with steamboats, flatboats and sailing ships. Despite its role in the slave trade, New Orleans at the time had the largest and most prosperous community of free persons <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nation, who were often educated, middle-class property owners.|$|E
25|$|Besides slaves, {{there were}} a number of free people <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state. Most were descended from free African Americans who had {{migrated}} along with neighbors from Virginia during the 18th century. The majority were the descendants of unions in the working classes between white women, indentured servants or free, and African men, indentured, slave or free. After the Revolution, Quakers and Mennonites worked to persuade slaveholders to free their slaves. Some were inspired by their efforts and the language of the Revolution to arrange for manumission of their slaves. The number of free people of color rose markedly in the first couple of decades after the Revolution.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, {{the first}} Asian-African Conference - {{also known as}} the Bandung Conference - was hosted in Bandung by President Soekarno, and {{attended}} by the heads of states representing twenty-nine independent countries from Asia and Africa. The conference venue was at the Gedung Merdeka, the former Concordia Society building. The conference announced 10 points of declaration for the promotion of world peace promotion and for opposition against colonialism, and is known as the Declaration of Bandung. This was followed by a wave of nationalism movements around the globe which remapped world politics. The conference was also the first international conference of people <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of mankind. Richard Wright in his book, The Color Curtain, claims that there was epic meaning of the conference for people of color around the world.|$|E

25|$|Mother Katharine Drexel, {{who founded}} the American order of Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People, corresponded with Pius XI, as she had with his papal predecessors.

An emissary had shown him photos of Xavier University, New Orleans, LA, which Mother Drexel had established to educate African-Americans at the highest level in the USA. Pius XI replied promptly, sending his blessing and encouragement. Upon his return, the emissary told Mother Katharine that the Pope said he had read the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin as a boy, and it had ignited his lifelong concern for the American Negro.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{efficient}} watermarking scheme for images. The basic idea of our method is to alter the <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> given image <b>in</b> a suitable but imperceptible way. This is accomplished by moving <b>the</b> coordinates <b>of</b> each <b>color</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> opponency space. The scheme is shown to be robust against a large class of image manipulations. The robustness of the scheme is also theoretically analyzed and it is shown to depend on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> image being marked. ...|$|R

40|$|This work {{lies within}} the scope <b>of</b> <b>color</b> image {{segmentation}} by spatial-region classification. The spatial distribution of objects in each region of image is difficult to be identified when the region are non-connected clusters. A standard <b>of</b> <b>color</b> identification by conventional methods of segmentation remains weak for capturing the spatial dispersion of the various objects <b>of</b> the same <b>color</b> region. We propose to apply a spatial classification to characterize geographical connected sets that represent the same regions. The originality of this paper lies in our new min-connected algorithm which is derived from a spatial-color compactness model. Our work is a hybrid segmentation {{that takes into account}} <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> space and <b>the</b> spatial location <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> image plane. Experimental tests on synthetic and real images show that our technique leads to promising results for segmentation. </p...|$|R
