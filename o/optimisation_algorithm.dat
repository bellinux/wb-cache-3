As a result, <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithms</b> dealing with only single-objective are not sufficient to deal with many real-life problems. Meanwhile, scientific workflows {{have been shown to}} be an effective technology for automating and encapsulating scientific processes. While <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithms</b> have been integrated into workflow tools, they are generally single-objective.

5000|$|The multi-objective {{version of}} the C3 {{algorithm}} [...] is a Pareto-based algorithm which uses the same divide-and-conquer strategy as the single-objective C3 <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithm</b> [...] The algorithm again starts with the advanced constructive initial optimisations of the subpopulations, considering an increasing subset of subproblems. The subset increases until the entire set of all subproblems is included. During these initial optimisations, the subpopulation of the latest included subproblem is evolved by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. For the fitness calculations {{of the members of}} the subpopulation, they are combined with a collaborator solution from each of the previously optimised subpopulations. Once all subproblems' subpopulations have been initially optimised, the multi-objective C3 <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithm</b> continues to optimise each subproblem in a round-robin fashion, but now collaborator solutions from all other subproblems' subspopulations are combined with the member of the subpopulation that is being evaluated. The collaborator solution is selected randomly from the solutions that make up the Pareto-optimal front of the subpopulation. The fitness assignment to the collaborator solutions is done in an optimistic fahsion (i.e. an [...] "old" [...] fitness value is replaced when the new one is better).|$|E
50|$|First {{published}} in 1989 Stochastic diffusion search (SDS) {{was the first}} Swarm Intelligence metaheuristic. SDS is an agent-based probabilistic global search and optimization technique best suited to problems where the objective function can be decomposed into multiple independent partial-functions. Each agent maintains a hypothesis which is iteratively tested by evaluating a randomly selected partial objective function parameterised by the agent's current hypothesis. In the standard version of SDS such partial function evaluations are binary, resulting in each agent becoming active or inactive. Information on hypotheses is diffused across the population via inter-agent communication. Unlike the stigmergic communication used in ACO, in SDS agents communicate hypotheses via a one-to-one communication strategy analogous to the tandem running procedure observed in Leptothorax acervorum. A positive feedback mechanism ensures that, over time, a population of agents stabilise around the global-best solution. SDS is both an efficient and robust global search and <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithm,</b> which has been extensively mathematically described. Recent work has involved merging the global search properties of SDS with other swarm intelligence algorithms.|$|E

This algorithm optimises one objective using a swarm of particles where their movements are guided by the best solution found by another swarm.

40|$|A useful {{measure of}} quality of a global <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithm</b> such as {{simulated}} annealing is {{the length of time}} it must be run to reach a global optimum within a certain accuracy. Such a performance measure assists in choosing and tuning algorithms. This thesis proposes an approach to obtaining such a measure through successive approximation of a generic stochastic global <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithm</b> with a sequence of stochastic processes culminating in backtracking adaptive search. The overall approach is to approximate the progress of an <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithm</b> with that of a model process, backtracking adaptive search. The known convergence rate of the model then provides an estimator of the unknown convergence rate of the original algorithm. Parameters specifying this model are chosen based on observation of the <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithm.</b> The <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithm</b> may first be approximated with a time-inhomogeneous Markovian process defined on the problem range. The distribution of the number of iterations to convergence for this averaged range process is shown to be identical with that of the original process. This process is itself approximated by a time-homogeneous Markov process in the range, the asymptotic averaged range process. This approximation is defined for all Markovian optimisation algorithms and a weak condition under which its convergence time closely matches that of the original algorithm is developed. The asymptotic averaged range process is of the same form as backtracking adaptive search, the final stage of approximation. Backtracking adaptive search is an <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithm</b> which generalises pure adaptive search and hesitant adaptive search. In this thesis the distribution of the number of iterations for which the algorithm runs in order to reach a sufficiently extreme objective function level is derived. Several examples of backtracking adaptive search on finite problems are also presented, including special cases that have received attention in the literature. Computational results of the entire approximation framework are reported for several examples. The method can be applied to any <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithm</b> to obtain an estimate of the time required to obtain solutions of a certain quality. Directions for further work in order to improve the accuracy of such estimates are also indicated...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith full genome {{data from}} several {{closely related species}} now readily available, we have the {{ultimate}} data for demographic inference. Exploiting these full genomes, however, requires models that can explicitly model recombination along alignments of full chromosomal length. Over the last decade a class of models, based on the sequential Markov coalescence model combined with hidden Markov models, has been developed and used to make inference in simple demographic scenarios. To move forward to more complex demographic modelling we need better and more automated ways of specifying these models and efficient <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithms</b> for inferring the parameters in complex and often high-dimensional models. In this paper we present a framework for building such coalescence hidden Markov models for pairwise alignments and present results for using heuristic <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithms</b> for parameter estimation.

40|$|While {{various aspects}} of nature: evolution, clonal {{selection}} and annealing, have {{been the source of}} inspiration for <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithms,</b> it is not always clear how and why the algorithms work well on some problems and poorly on other problems. In this thesis we consider properties of exact models of <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithms</b> and relate these properties to specific operators. To facilitate this lower level of understanding of how <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithms</b> work, we perform a case study of modular modelling on an example of an Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithm, the B-Cell Algorithm (BCA). From a case study of modular modelling of the BCA, we derive a framework for modelling stochastic <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithms</b> with Markov chains. Based on a Markov chain model of the BCA we obtain a proof of convergence of the algorithm, bounds for the rate of convergence of the algorithm and a brief numerical analysis of the Markov chain model of the algorithm. The framework demonstrates that <b>optimisation</b> <b>algorithms</b> can conceptually be split into two parts: search operators and state operators. Search operators are represented by a “sample matrix”. State operators are represented by a “possible transit matrix”. These matrices can be combined by two equations to form the transition matrix of a Markov chain model of the algorithm. Equations (5. 11) and (5. 12) are the key to the framework, they allow the construction of the transition matrix from the sample matrix and possible transit matrix. We apply the framework to create a Markov chain model of a Hill Climber, re-write an existing model of Simulated Annealing in terms of the framework and produce a novel Markov chain model of the � 1 � � � Evolutionary Strategy with fitness proportional mutation. These models, along with the model of the BCA, demonstrate that the framework is not restricted to a particular field of optimisation. ...|$|R
