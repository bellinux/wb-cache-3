Significant variation in these models' abilities to reproduce observed precipitation extremes over the contiguous United States is found. Model performance metrics {{are introduced to}} characterize overall biases, seasonality, spatial extent and {{the shape of the}} precipitation distribution. Comparison of the models to <b>gridded</b> <b>observations</b> that include an elevation correction is found to be better than to <b>gridded</b> <b>observations</b> without this correction.

40|$|Regional {{climate models}} {{are prone to}} biases in {{precipitation}} that are problematic for use in impact models such as hydrology models. A large number of methods have already been proposed aimed at correcting various moments of the rainfall distribution. They all require that the model produce the same or a higher number of rain days than the observational data sets, which are usually gridded data sets. Models have traditionally met this condition because their spatial resolution was coarser than the observational grids. But recent climate simulations use higher resolution and the models are likely to systematically produce fewer rain days than the <b>gridded</b> <b>observations.</b> In this study, model outputs from a simulation at 2 km resolution are compared with gridded and in situ observational data sets {{to determine whether the}} new scenario calls for revised methodologies. The <b>gridded</b> <b>observations</b> are found to be inadequate to correct the high-resolution model at daily timescales, because they are subjected to too frequent low intensity precipitation due to spatial averaging. A histogram equalisation bias correction method was adapted to the use of station, alleviating the problems associated with relative low-resolution observational grids. The wet-day frequency condition might not be satisfied for extremely dry biases, but the proposed approach substantially increases the applicability of bias correction to high-resolution models. The method is efficient at bias correcting both seasonal and daily characteristic of precipitation, providing more accurate information that is crucial for impact assessment studies. © Author(s) 2013...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale general {{circulation}} models {{give us an}} idea of how the climate may possibly develop over the future century. These models generally simulate the large-scale and global mean climate well; however, when applied to localized regions their output does not provide sufficient detail to perform local and regional assessments needed for evaluating necessary mitigation steps. To overcome this weakness I here introduce a novel method of statistical downscaling, which bridges the gap between the low-resolution output provided by climate models and the high-resolution data needed to perform local or regional climate assessments. The statistical downscaling method developed here, which is based on quantile regression, can downscale any variable simulated by AOGCMs and observed on a daily basis that has, or can be transformed into, a Gaussian-like or symmetrical distribution. One of the aspects of the quantile regression technique, along with our enhancements, is a high accuracy in projection of extremes, which often is the sole focus of impact studies when applying the downscaled output. Furthermore, the technique is applicable to both station-based as well as high-resolution <b>gridded</b> <b>observations</b> and can be applied to different types of climate anywhere in the world. The method is here evaluated for minimum and maximum temperature as well as precipitation for 20 stations in North America as well as for high-resolution <b>gridded</b> <b>observations</b> over the continental United States and Alaska. Station-based downscaling is evaluated based on seven different versions of the temperature model and eight versions for the precipitation model, each successive version having one added change or improvement to the downscaling process.

Hence, there is an interest in resolution enhancement and image reconstruction. This paper discusses a general theory and techniques for image reconstruction and creating enhanced resolution images from irregularly sampled data. Using irregular sampling theory, we consider how the frequency content in aperture function-attenuated sidelobes can be recovered from oversampled data using reconstruction techniques, thus {{taking advantage of the}} high frequency content of measurements made with nonideal aperture filters. We show that with minor modification, the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) is functionally equivalent to Grochenig’s irregular sampling reconstruction algorithm. Using simple Monte Carlo simulations, we compare and contrast the performance of additive ART, multiplicative ART, and the scatterometer image reconstruction (SIR) (a derivative of multiplicative ART) algorithms with and without noise. The reconstruction theory and techniques have applications with a variety of sensors and can enable enhanced resolution image production from many nonimaging sensors. The technique is illustrated with ERS- 2 and SeaWinds scatterometer data. Index Terms—Irregular samples, reconstruction, resolution enhancement, sampling. I...|$|R
