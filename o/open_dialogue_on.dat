Second, focus discovery selects candidate dialogue foci, tables that have the most potential to address basic user goals. Third, a focus agent is instantiated for each dialogue focus with a default dialogue strategy governed by efficiency. We demonstrate the portability of <b>open</b> <b>dialogue</b> management <b>on</b> three very different databases. Evaluation of our system with simulated users shows that users with realistically limited domain knowledge have dialogues nearly as efficient as those of users with complete domain knowledge. ...|$|R
