5|$|In 1857, Cayley {{introduced}} matrix notation, {{which allows}} for a harmonization and simplification <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations. In his work, the concepts <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> independence and dimension, as well as scalar products, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work exceeds the framework of vector spaces, since his consideration of multiplication led him to what are today called algebras. Peano {{was the first to}} give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.|$|E
5|$|Later, von Neumann {{suggested}} a new method <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> programming, using the homogeneous linear system of Gordan (1873), which was later popularized by Karmarkar's algorithm. Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices, with the pivoting decision {{determined by a}} nonnegative least squares subproblem with a convexity constraint (projecting the zero-vector onto the convex hull of the active simplex). Von Neumann's algorithm was the first interior point method <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> programming.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the first}} ideas leading to vector spaces {{can be traced}} back as far as the 17th century's {{analytic}} geometry, matrices, systems <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> equations, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by Giuseppe Peano in 1888, encompasses more general objects than Euclidean space, but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like lines, planes and their higher-dimensional analogs.|$|E
