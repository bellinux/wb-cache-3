40|$|The {{principle}} of party autonomy, known {{not only in}} the common law legal system but also in the civil law system, provides parties contracting in civil and commercial matters with the right to establish their own rules, as long as these rules do not contradict mandatory law. This right is presumed to be protected by the force of law. It follows, that when a choice of court clause is included in the contract, disputes are supposed to be solved by the court chosen by the parties. This principle is not compromised by the Brussels I Regulation (or previously, the Brussels Convention). Moreover, it is repeated in its Articles 1 and 23. At the same time, the rule <b>of</b> <b>lis</b> <b>pendens,</b> provided for by its Article 27, aims to preclude subsequent actions in other Member States if a court is already seized and allows the appearance 'on the legal scene' of a court other than the court chosen by the parties.

50|$|The use of anchor {{defendants}} as a litigation strategy relies upon {{two basic}} principles common to most legal systems. The {{first is that}} where a cause of action involves claims against multiple parties, it is convenient {{for all of those}} claims to be tried together to avoid the risk of inconsistent results. The second is that courts in different jurisdictions should seek to avoid holding concurrent trials relating to the same claims (this is usually referred to as the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens),</b> both the avoid the risk of inconsistent results and to avoid defendants having to respond to the same claims in different courts.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time the Court of Justice {{explicitly}} states that point 3 of art. 5 Regulation N. 44 / 2001 must be in-terpreted as meaning that an action for a negative dec-laration, seeking to establish the absence of liability in tort, falls within the scope of that provision. The Author agrees with the solution endorsed by the Court and crit-ically addresses the objections raised by the Advocate general. The rule of special jurisdiction laid down in Art. 5. 3 is based on a particularly close connecting fac-tor between the dispute and the court of the “place where the harmful event occurred or may occur”. The role of the parties in the dispute has no bearing on the existence of this close connection, which is therefore solely dependent upon {{the facts of the case}} and upon the localization of the event in dispute. The Author con-siders the risk of excessive forum shopping, enhanced by the rule <b>of</b> <b>lis</b> <b>pendens,</b> and the well-known problems related to "torpedo" actions and concludes that, pro-vided that the court seized is sufficiently close to the facts of the case, there is no reason to deprive the party seeking to establish his non-liability of the special fo-rum. The A. argues, however, that in order to fulfill the objectives of legal certainty and of proximity, in the specific field of international competition litigation the connecting factor in art. 5. 3 should be construed nar-rowly as referring to the “affected market”, irrespective of the role of the partie...|$|R
40|$|The {{recasting}} of the Brussels I regulation {{has been}} {{announced by the}} European Commission in December 2010. The author argues that its impact will be felt in third countries, too. If the Commission proposal is adopted, defendants domiciled in non-EU countries will be amenable to suit in the courts of the Union in civil and commercial matters under the heads of special jurisdiction defined in the EU Regulation. National rules of jurisdiction will no more be applicable. Two new heads of general jurisdiction applicable in case there is no jurisdiction under the Regulation (i. e. when the defendant is domiciled outside the EU {{and there is no}} ground of special jurisdiction for EU courts) will be the forum of property and the forum necessitates. A court within the EU will have discretion to stay the proceedings in case <b>of</b> <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> before the court of a third country. Judgments from third countries will continue to be recognized pursuant to national rules, including the national rules on indirect jurisdiction. Finally, forum selection clauses in favor of third country courts will most likely be unenforceable in the EU unless the court within the EU would anyway lack jurisdiction (even without the forum selection clause). These rules are only a proposal and they may still be changed. The Commission could make a significant improvement by small interventions in the proposed text, e. g. by giving the rules on exclusive jurisdiction reflexive effect and introducing a specific provision affording effect to prorogation clauses in favor of third country courts...|$|R
5000|$|Already {{in prison}} since January 2007 {{for failure to}} pay federal taxes, for {{structuring}} various bank transactions to evade reporting requirements, and for attempting to obstruct administration of the U.S. internal revenue laws, Young Earth Creationist and Sovereign Citizen proponent Kent Hovind had a raft of new charges laid against him for the filing <b>of</b> <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> liens on property deemed forfeited to pay for earlier unpaid taxes. The government argued that the filing of these liens had been earlier forbidden by a court. During his incarceration, Hovind relied increasingly on Sovereign Citizen arguments, denying his U.S Citizenship and declaring [...] "Democracy is evil and contrary to God's law". Hovind's co-defendant was Paul J. Hansen, another Sovereign Citizen advocate. In filings before the court relating to the trial, both made lengthy submissions recycling typical Sovereign Citizen tropes, such as [...] "withdrawing consent for the proceedings", denial of jurisdiction, invocation of maritime law, the attempted convocation of unsanctioned citizen grand juries, and which threatened the judge personally. While the jury failed to reach a verdict on the other charges, on March 12, 2015, Hovind {{was found guilty of}} criminal contempt. The judge, however, rendered a judgment of acquittal in favor of Hovind on May 18, 2015, concluding that the relevant court order had lacked specific language prohibiting Hovind from doing what he did. Hansen, who claims he is neither a U.S. citizen nor resident because he lives on [...] "church land", was convicted on two counts of contempt and sentenced to 18 months in prison and three years probation of August 21, 2015.|$|R

40|$|Australia and New Zealand {{concluded}} the Agreement on Trans-Tasman Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement in 2008, and have now implemented the Agreement by passing the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Acts. The Acts aim, with some significant adjustments, to bring New Zealand into the scheme for sorting cross-border jurisdiction and the cross-border {{enforcement of judgments}} that is currently {{in place for the}} Australian federation. Accordingly, they provide that litigation in the trans-Tasman market area is to be heard in the court that is the forum conveniens (or ‘the more appropriate court’) or that the parties to a contract have designated as the exclusive forum for the proceedings. Any Australian or New Zealand judgment will be enforceable by registration anywhere in the market area unless contrary to the public policy of the enforcing country or State. As a result, when in force, the Trans Tasman Proceedings Acts should realise the worthy, longstanding objective of securing a ‘uniform writ stretching from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to the Chathams’. However, in their qualified reliance on the cross-border jurisdiction and judgments model used in the Australian federation, the Acts ignore some strengths of the Australian model and perpetuate some weaknesses. This article considers and critiques the new trans-Tasman scheme for jurisdiction and judgments. The scheme is overwhelming an improvement in trans-Tasman legal relations and cooperation. However, it has a number of flaws, including (1) removing Australian and New Zealand courts’ ability to deal with the possible problem of parallel and related litigation (‘lis pendens’) in trans-Tasman litigation, and the consequences <b>of</b> <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> (ie, possibly conflicting judgments); and (2) retaining public policy as a ground for refusing to enforce a judgment from the other country. ...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{business}} international {{transactions are}} multiparty and complicated. Such contracts are usually composed of several contracts which can contain bilateral dispute resolution arrangements. According {{to the principle}} of parties autonomy dispute arising between two persons bound by an arbitration agreement in connection with a multiparty project will be resolved by arbitration exclusively between these two parties. Other parties cannot participate in the resolution of the dispute through arbitration, even if they have played {{an active role in the}} actual project. Notwithstanding any legitimate interest, they might have the outcome of the dispute; these parties will remain alien both to the arbitration proceedings and an arbitral award. Their interests are not taken into consideration and left unprotected. Arbitration proceedings, unlike litigation, usually do not bear any intervention or joinder of parties, which is explained by the contractual nature of arbitration. Thus, the binding power of an arbitral award extends only over parties of an arbitration agreement. Meanwhile, an arbitral award can affect interests of third parties. How can these parties defend their interests in arbitration proceedings and during recognition and enforcement proceedings in national courts? There are two ways of resolving such problem in state court litigation. The first one is the compulsory participation of any third party with any legitimate interest in litigation through intervention, joinder of parties, and consolidation of cases. A court ex officio has to gather all parties that can have any legitimate interest in resolving the dispute. If judgment affects any interest of a party that was not involved in the proceedings judgment should be reversed in appellate court. The second way is also the solution against parallel proceedings. This way is to harmonize the outcome of parallel proceedings by the principle <b>of</b> <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> and res judicata. The paper examines the binding and res judicata effects of the arbitral award towards third parties through the Russian and international experience of defending of interests of third parties in international arbitration and litigation. </p...|$|R
50|$|In most jurisdictions, it is {{customary}} for the foreclosing lender {{to obtain}} a title search of the real property and to notify all other persons who may have liens on the property, whether by judgment, by contract, or by statute or other law, {{so that they may}} appear and assert their interest in the foreclosure litigation. This is accomplished through the filing <b>of</b> a <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> as part <b>of</b> the lawsuit and recordation of it in order to provide public notice of the pendency of the foreclosure action. In all U.S. jurisdictions a lender who conducts a foreclosure sale of real property which {{is the subject of a}} federal tax lien must give 25 days' notice of the sale to the Internal Revenue Service: failure to give notice to the IRS results in the lien remaining attached to the real property after the sale.

40|$|Appellants Edward R. Houston and Regina Houston paid David Boone $ 740, 000 for {{investment}} services, which Boone converted {{to his own}} use. In May 1998, Boone and his wife Donna divorced and Boone quitclaimed real property to Donna. Norwest Mortgage, Respondent Bank of America’s predecessor, held a deed of trust on the real property for $ 342, 000. That same month, the Houstons filed a complaint against Boone to recover their $ 740, 000. The Houstons filed a notice <b>of</b> <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> in the Clark County Recorder’s Office on June 1, 1998 and filed an ex parte motion with the district court directing the issuance of a prejudgment writ of attachment. The court granted the motion and a writ of attachment was filed in the Clark County Recorder’s Office in June 1998. The Houstons obtained a judgment against Boone, who had filed for bankruptcy. Boone stipulated that the debt he owed to the Houstons was nondischargeable. The district court granted a writ of execution on the real property and scheduled a sale of the real property. Respondent Bank of America intervened and the sale was enjoined. Bank of America had refinanced the real property in June 1998, after the Houstons’ writ of attachment had been recorded. In May 1998, pursuant to Bank of America’s direction, Nevada Title Company had conducted a title search of the property. Both Bank of America and the Houstons filed motions for summary judgment after the district court enjoined the sale. Bank of America {{argued that it was}} the priority lien holder on the real property because it was equitably subrogated to the rights of Norwest Mortgage when it refinanced the property. The Houstons argued that Bank of America was negligent in failing to discover their interest in the real property and that they would be injured if the district court allowed Bank of America to hold the priority lien position. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Bank of America and denied the Houston’s motion for summary judgment. The Houstons appealed. The Nevada Supreme Court adopted the approach of the Restatement (Third) of Property for equitable subrogation and found that because the Houstons failed to produce any evidence that equitable subrogation of Bank of America to Norwest’s priority lien position would materially prejudice them, Bank of America was entitled to equitable subrogation as to the full amount of the Norwest Mortgage deed of trust...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the provisions on arbitration of the European Commission’s December 2010 draft review of Reg. (EC) 44 / 2001 {{against the backdrop}} of the earlier proposals on the inclusion of arbitration within the scope of the Regulation. The analysis focuses principally on the functioning and implications <b>of</b> the <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> mechanism laid down by Article 29 (4) of the draft, pointing out the analogy between the role conferred on the law and forum of the seat of the arbitration and the mechanism of home country control that is at the heart of European Union law. The article also analyzes the reasons and positive consequences of the Commissions’ restraint in not extending the scope of the Regulation to other arbitration - related issues, especially the circulation of judgments dealing with the validity of arbitration agreements and awards. The article’s conclusion is that the Commission proposal is well balanced. Whilst it does not solve all problems relating to conflicts between court proceedings and arbitration within the EU, it addresses the most pressing one, that of concurrent court and arbitration proceedings. Moreover, it does so in terms which, in contrast to the use of anti-suit injunctions in aid of arbitration, are reconcilable with the basic tenets of European Union law. Its approach is indisputably favorable to the development of arbitration and does not jeopardize the acquis in terms of arbitration law of the more advanced member States...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> (Latin for [...] "dispute elsewhere pending") applies both {{in municipal}} law, public international law, and {{private international law}} {{to address the problem}} of potentially contradictory judgments. If two courts were to hear the same dispute, it is possible they would reach inconsistent decisions. To avoid the problem, there are two rules. Res judicata provides that once a case has been determined, it produces a judgment either inter partes or in rem depending on the subject matter of the dispute, i.e. although there can be an appeal on the merits, neither party can recommence proceedings on the same set of facts in another court. If this rule were not in place, litigation might never come to an end. The second rule is that proceedings on the same facts cannot be commenced in a second court if the lis i.e. action, is already pendens, i.e. pending, in another court. <b>Lis</b> alibi <b>pendens</b> arises from international comity and it permits a court to refuse to exercise jurisdiction when there is parallel litigation pending in another jurisdiction. Shany (2003) considers the problem within the public international law field where, for example, the Southern Bluefin Tuna dispute could have been determined either by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or by tribunals established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the Swordfish dispute, which was submitted simultaneously to both the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and a dispute settlement panel of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Kwak and Marceau (2002) consider the jurisdiction between the dispute settlement mechanisms of regional trade agreements (RTAs) and that of the WTO.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lis</b> <b>pendens</b> {{is taken}} as {{constructive}} notice of the pending lawsuit, and it serves to place a cloud on {{the title of the}} property in question until the suit is resolved and the notice released or the <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> is expunged. Careful buyers will be unwilling to purchase land subject to a <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> or will only purchase the land at a discount, prudent lenders will not lend money against the security of the land, and title insurance companies will not insure the title to such land: title is taken subject to the outcome of the lawsuit. Because so much real property is purchased with borrowed money, this usually keeps the owner from selling the property. It also may keep the owner from borrowing money secured by the property (such as to pay the costs of defending the suit).|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the applicability}} of two legal principles that originate in municipal legal systems, namely res judicata and <b>lis</b> <b>pendens,</b> in World Trade Organisation (&# 039;WTO&# 039;) disputes that involve a conflict of jurisdiction between dispute settlement mechanisms of the WTO and Regional Trade Agreements (&# 039;RTAs&# 039;). Ideally, {{the applicability of}} non-WTO norms in WTO disputes would be determined {{on the basis of}} explicit treaty language, as this would increase the legitimacy of the dispute settlement process. However, since there is no particular WTO provision that explicitly specifies the sources of applicable law in WTO disputes, {{it is virtually impossible to}} decisively verify whether WTO law allows the application of non-WTO norms like res judicata and <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> in WTO disputes. Thus, whether these norms can be enforced in WTO disputes largely depends on the discretion of WTO tribunals. On this basis, this article first develops a set of criteria against which the applicability of res judicata and <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> under WTO tribunals&# 039; inherent powers could be assessed. The article then uses this framework to evaluate whether res judicata and <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> can be applied in WTO disputes to resolve jurisdictional conflicts between WTO and RTA dispute settlement...|$|R

While Italy, the Commission and Misat contended that the <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> doctrine needed to take precedence, and that thus the court second seized should stay its proceedings until the first court had decided on its position, the UK and Gasser argued that {{the choice of the}} parties should take immediate precedence over the <b>lis</b> <b>pendens</b> rule.|$|R
