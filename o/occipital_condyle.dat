5|$|In 2002, Coria and Currie {{found that}} various {{features}} of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle)</b> indicate that Giganotosaurus {{would have had a}} good capability of moving the skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and length of the jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the jaw musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.|$|E
5|$|The {{species of}} Paraceratherium are mainly {{discernible}} through skull characteristics. P. bugtiense and P. orgosensis share {{features such as}} relatively slender maxillae and premaxillae, shallow skull roofs, mastoid-paroccipital processes that are relatively thin and placed back on the skull, a lambdoid crest, which extends less back, and an <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle</b> with a horizontal orientation. P. transouralicum has robust maxillae and premaxillae, upturned zygomata, domed frontal bones, thick mastoid-paroccipital processes, a lambdoid crest that extends back, and occipital condyles with a vertical orientation. P. orgosensis is distinguished from the other species by the larger size of its teeth, and distinct crochets of its molars.|$|E
5|$|The large orbit {{was shaped}} like an {{imperfect}} ellipse (with the longest axis {{from front to}} back), and faced {{to the side and}} slightly forward. The infratemporal fenestra (opening) behind the eye was narrow and sloped backwards, and the supratemporal fenestra on the top back of the skull was very reduced in size, due to the thickening of the frontoparietal. The basicranium (back part) of the skull was shortened and distanced from the regions below the orbits and around the palate. The occiput sloped backwards and down, and the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle</b> was deflected in the same direction. The lacrimal bone formed the lower front margin of the orbit, and its surface had rows of node-like ornamentation. The prefrontal and palpebral bones were fused and formed a thick ridge above the orbit. The relatively large jugal bone formed the lower margin of the orbit, extending far forwards and down towards the jaw joint. It was ornamented with ridges and nodes in a radiating arrangement.|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: The <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles</b> of {{the skull}} {{articulate}} with the superior articular facets of the atlas vertebra and form an important junction between the cranium and the vertebral column. The morphological features of <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles</b> are relevant in biomechanical, anatomical and clinical studies. OBJECTIVE: To describe the anatomical profile of unusual <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles</b> detected in a bone specimen. CASE REPORT: The present osteological study provides a detailed morphological description of unusual <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles</b> showing uneven and serrated surfaces and also displaying longitudinal and transverse grooves {{on the left and}} right sides respectively. The case study also discusses the clinical importance of such anomalies. Precise anatomical knowledge of the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles</b> is important for any craniovertebral operative procedures such as resection of the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{a number of}} {{definitions}} of Reptilia were offered. The traits listed by Lydekker in 1896, for example, include a single <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle,</b> a jaw joint formed by the quadrate and articular bones, and certain characteristics of the vertebrae. The animals singled out by these formulations, the amniotes other than the mammals and the birds, are still those considered reptiles today.|$|E
25|$|Birds have uncinate {{processes}} on the ribs. These are hooked {{extensions of}} bone which help {{to strengthen the}} rib cage by overlapping with the rib behind them. This feature {{is also found in}} the tuatara (Sphenodon). They also have a greatly elongate tetradiate pelvis, similar to some reptiles. The hind limb has an intra-tarsal joint found also in some reptiles. There is extensive fusion of the trunk vertebrae as well as fusion with the pectoral girdle. They have a diapsid skull, as in reptiles, with a pre-lachrymal fossa (present in some reptiles). The skull has a single <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The abelisaurids all possess distinct, vestigial, and {{immobile}} forelimbs, {{with highly}} reduced manual phalanges. Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus {{are closely related}} but distinguish by several skeletal features. Carnotaurus has eleven dorsal vertebrae but Majungasaurus has thirteen. Carnotaurus has short dentary bones and an almost vertical ramus, while that of Majungasaurus curved backward and had notable caudal projections. Majungasaurines also have low, wide antorbital fenestrae, a wide triangular plate posterior to the parietal, two holes for a cerebral vein by the sagittal crest, and a wide groove on the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle.</b> These differences are important because derived abelisaurids are classed as either majungasaurines or carnotaurines based on their synapomorphies.|$|E

25|$|The {{vertebral}} column in dinosaurs {{consists of the}} cervical (neck), dorsal (back), sacral (hips), and caudal (tail) vertebrae. Saurischian dinosaur vertebrae sometimes possess features known as pleurocoels, which are hollow depressions on the lateral portions of the vertebrae, perforated to create an entrance into the air chambers within the vertebrae, which served to decrease the weight of these bones without sacrificing strength. These pleurocoels were filled with air sacs, which would have further decreased weight. In sauropod dinosaurs, the largest known land vertebrates, pleurocoels and air sacs may have reduced the animal's weight by over a ton in some instances, a handy evolutionary adaption in animals that grew to over 30 metres in length. In many hadrosaur and theropod dinosaurs, the caudal vertebrae were reinforced by ossified tendons. The presence of three or more sacral vertebrae, {{in association with the}} hip bones, is one of the defining characteristics of dinosaurs. The <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle</b> is a structure on the posterior part of a dinosaur's skull which articulates with the first cervical vertebra.|$|E
25|$|One such feature {{available}} for paleontology, {{shared by all}} living mammals (including monotremes), but not present {{in any of the}} early Triassic therapsids, is shown in figure 1: mammals use two bones for hearing that all other amniotes use for eating. The earliest amniotes had a jaw joint composed of the articular (a small bone {{at the back of the}} lower jaw) and the quadrate (a small bone at the back of the upper jaw). All non-mammalian tetrapods use this system including amphibians, turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodilians, dinosaurs (and their descendants the birds), ichthyosaurs, pterosaurs and therapsids. But mammals have a different jaw joint, composed only of the dentary (the lower jaw bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (another small skull bone). In the Jurassic, their quadrate and articular bones evolved into the incus and malleus bones in the middle ear. Mammals also have a double occipital condyle; they have two knobs at the base of the skull that fit into the topmost neck vertebra, while other tetrapods have a single <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle.</b>|$|E
500|$|Two frontals are preserved. They {{are each}} [...] long and [...] wide. The upper surface of each frontal is not smooth. One crest {{runs along the}} each frontal, and the {{together}} the two crests make up the orbital roof. Both parietals have also been found. The connection between them {{is marked by a}} ω-shaped crest. Viewed from the side, the parietal has two extensions. These extensions are not fully preserved, but they would have been on the border of the upper temporal fenestrae in their middle. Each parietal was preserved as [...] wide. The basioccipital of the specimen from Lo Hueco is unique as it has an <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle</b> that is much wider than tall.

500|$|According to Sereno (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features, {{all of which are}} unknown in other herrerasaurids: a circular pit is present on the humeral ectepicondyle, a feature also present in Saturnalia; a saddle-shaped ulnar condyle of the humerus, and the articular surface for the ulnare on the ulna is convex; the articular surface of the ulnare is smaller than that of the ulna, a feature unknown in Staurikosaurus and Sanjuansaurus; the centrale is placed distal to the radiale; a broad subnarial process of the premaxilla, and a broad supratemporal depression (noted by Sereno and Novas, 1993); the basal tuber and the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle</b> are subequal in width (noted by Sereno and Novas, 1993) ...|$|E
500|$|The most basal {{group of}} temnospondyls is the {{superfamily}} Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features, including a single <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle</b> and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous [...] genus Edops {{and the family}} Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea, and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species, having been present over 330 million years ago during the Viséan stage of the Early Carboniferous. Recent analyses place Dendrerpetontidae outside Edopoidea in a more derived position. Other primitive temnospondyls include Capetus and Iberospondylus. Saharastega and Nigerpeton, both described in 2005 from Niger, are also primitive yet come from the Late Permian. They are almost 40 million years younger than other basal temnospondyls, implying a long ghost lineage of species that are not yet known in the fossil record.|$|E
50|$|Male skulls {{can have}} more {{prominent}} supraorbital ridges, a more prominent glabella, and more prominent temporal lines. Female skulls generally have rounder orbits, and narrower jaws. Male skulls on average have larger, broader palates, squarer orbits, larger mastoid processes, larger sinuses, and larger <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles</b> than those of females. Male mandibles typically have squarer chins and thicker, rougher muscle attachments than female mandibles.|$|R
5000|$|Boessenecker and Fordyce (2015) {{characterize}} the species as follows: [...] "Waharoa ruwhenua shares Tohoraata and Tokarahia dorsoventrally shallow and wide <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles,</b> a triangular anterior process and well-developed incisural flange of the periotic; with Tohoraata and Tokarahia a concave anterodorsal {{margin of the}} anterior process of the periotic and a smooth and transversely convex posterior bullar facet; with Tohoraata a distinct lateral tubercle on the anterior process; and with Eomysticetus and Micromysticetus a short posterior process".|$|R
30|$|The craniovertebral {{junction}} (CVJ) is embryologically {{unique and}} complex. Four occipital sclerotomes contribute to {{formation of the}} occipital bone, clivus and <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles,</b> anterior arch of the atlas and the apical, cruciate and alar ligaments. The posterior arch of the atlas is derived from both the first occipital and first cervical sclerotomes. The axis is derived from both the fourth occipital and first and second cervical sclerotomes. The ventral portion of the first cervical sclerotome forms most of the odontoid process [3, 5].|$|R
500|$|The {{vertebral}} column of Stegoceras is incompletely known. The articulation between the zygagophyses (articular processes) of successive dorsal (back) vertebrae {{appears to have}} prevented sideways movement of the {{vertebral column}}, which made it very rigid, and it was further strengthened by ossified tendons. Though the neck vertebrae are not known, the downturned <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle</b> (which articulates with the first neck vertebra) indicates that the neck was held in a curved posture, like the [...] "S"- or [...] "U"-shape of most dinosaur necks. Based on {{their position in the}} pachycephalosaur Homalocephale, the ossified tendons found with UALVP 2 would have formed an intricate [...] "caudal basket" [...] in the tail, consisting of parallel rows, with the extremities of each tendon contacting the next successively. Such structures are called myorhabdoi, and are otherwise only known in teleost fish; the feature is unique to pachycephalosaurs among tetrapod (four-limbed) animals, and may have functioned in stiffening the tail.|$|E
500|$|The skull roof (formed by {{the frontal}} and parietal bones) was broad {{and formed a}} [...] "shelf", which {{overhung}} the short supratemporal fenestrae at the top rear of the skull. The jaw articulated far behind the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle</b> (where the neck {{is attached to the}} skull) compared to other theropods. The condyle was broad and low, and had pneumatic cavities. Giganotosaurus did not have a sagittal crest {{on the top of the}} skull, and the jaw muscles did not extend onto the skull roof, unlike in most other theropods (due to the shelf over the supratemporal fenestrae). These muscles would instead have been attached to the lower side surfaces of the shelf. The neck muscles that elevated the head would have attached to the prominent supraoccipital bones on the top of the skull, which functioned like the nuchal crest of tyrannosaurs. A latex endocast of the brain cavity of Giganotosaurus showed that the brain was similar to that of the related genus Carcharodontosaurus, but larger. The endocast was [...] long, [...] wide, and had a volume of [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{only known}} skull, {{belonging}} to the largest specimen, measures [...] from the premaxilla at the front {{to the back of}} the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle.</b> The widest part of the skull behind the eyes is only [...] wide in comparison. The skull was similar to those of other ornithomimosaurs in being low and narrow, but differed in that the snout was more elongated. The skull bone walls were rather thin, about [...] It had a rounded, flattened beak, which would have been covered by keratin in life. The nostrils were turned upwards, and the nasal bone was a narrow strap that extended up above the eye sockets. The outer diameter of the sclerotic rings in the eyes was small, , compared to the size of the skull. The lower temporal fenestrae, openings behind the eyes, were partially closed off by the jugal bones, similar to Gallimimus. The jaws were toothless and down-turned, and the lower jaw was very massive and deep compared to the slender and low upper jaw. The relative size of the lower jaw was closer to that of tyrannosaurids than to other ornithomimosaurs. The snout was spatulate (flared outwards to the sides) and [...] wide, which is wider than the skull roof. This shape is similar to the snout of duck-billed hadrosaurids.|$|E
40|$|Aim: In the paracondylar region(lateral to the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles)</b> {{there might}} be {{morphological}} variation {{in the form of}} an anomalous foramina.

30|$|The {{occipital}} bone encompasses the foramen magnum and {{extends from the}} clivus anteriorly to the lambdoid suture posteriorly. The <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles</b> angle medially and inferiorly from the posterior to anterior: this angulation limits the mobility of the atlanto-occipital joints (i.e. C 0 -C 1 joints), particularly in axial rotation compared with the atlanto-axial joint (i.e. C 1 -C 2 joint) [12 – 14]. The predominant movements at the atlanto-occipital joint are flexion and extension. Lateral flexion at the atlanto-occipital joint is significantly limited by the contralateral alar ligament.|$|R
5|$|In 1888, von Zittel divided stegocephalians {{among three}} taxa: Lepospondyli, Temnospondyli, and Stereospondyli. He placed microsaurs in Lepospondyli, a group which he {{characterized}} as having simple, spool-shaped vertebral centra. Temnospondyli included forms with the centra divided into pleurocentra and intercentra. All members of Stereospondyli had amphicoelous centra composed {{only of the}} intercentra. Cope objected to von Zittel's classification, considering the vertebrae of lepospondyls and stereospondyls indistinguishable because each had a simple spool shape. He continued to use Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta (which he alternatively referred to as Rhachitomi) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles.</b>|$|R
500|$|The largest skulls of Paraceratherium {{are around}} [...] long, [...] {{at the back}} of the skull, and [...] wide across by the {{zygomatic}} arches. Paraceratherium had a long forehead, which was smooth and lacked the roughened area that serves as attachment point for the horns of other rhinoceroses. The bones above the nasal region are long and the nasal incision goes far into the skull. This indicates that Paraceratherium had a prehensile upper lip similar to that of the black rhinoceros and the Indian rhinoceros, or a short proboscis or trunk as in tapirs. The back of the skull was low and narrow, without the large lambdoid crests at the top and along the sagittal crest, which are otherwise found in horned and tusked animals that need strong muscles to push and fight. It also had a deep pit for the attachment of nuchal ligaments, which hold up the skull automatically. The <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle</b> was very wide and Paraceratherium appears to have had large, strong neck muscles, which allowed it to sweep its head strongly downwards while foraging from branches. One skull of P. transouralicum has a domed forehead, whereas others have flat foreheads, possibly because of sexual dimorphism. A brain endocast of P. transouralicum shows it was only 8 percent of the skull length, while the brain of the Indian rhinoceros is 17.7 percent of its skull length.|$|E
2500|$|The rear of {{the skull}} is {{dominated}} by a large eye socket, often covering the {{major part of the}} rear side surface. In the socket, a large scleral ring is present; this is a circular structure of small, overlapping bone segments protecting the eye against the water pressure. Both in the relative and absolute senses, ichthyosaurs have the largest eye sockets of all known vertebrates. The other rear skull elements are typically so compressed and fused that they are difficult to identify. The top rear element of the skull was usually assumed to be the supratemporal bone, while the squamosal and quadratojugal were sometimes fused. However, in 1968, Alfred Sherwood Romer stated that the presumed supratemporal was in fact the squamosal, which was in 1973 confirmed by McGowan. In 1990, though, John Steve Massare convinced most researchers that the original identification had been the correct one after all. The supratemporal forms the rear rim of the supratemporal opening; a lower temporal opening at the side is lacking. The front rim of the supratemporal opening is typically formed by the postfrontal; only with the very basal Utatsusaurus the postorbital and the squamosal still reach the edge. Between the paired supratemporal openings, the skull roof is narrow; some species have a longitudinal crest on it as an attachment for the jaw muscles. Basal Ichthyopterygia have a parietal eye opening between the paired parietal bones. With ichthyosaurs proper, this opening moves to the front, first to the border between the parietals and the frontals and ultimately between the frontals, a condition shown by derived species. [...] Postparietal and tabular bones are lacking. Often, the bones {{of the back of the}} skull and the palate are incompletely ossified, apparently having partly remained cartilage. The <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle</b> is typically very convex. The stapes, the bone transmitting sound waves from the eardrum to the middle ear, is elongated and not pierced by a foramen. Pterygoid teeth are typically lacking.|$|E
50|$|The {{condylar}} canal (or condyloid canal) is a canal in the condyloid fossa of {{the lateral}} parts of occipital bone behind the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle.</b> Resection of the rectus capitus posterior {{major and minor}} muscles reveals the bony recess leading to the condylar canal, which is situated posterior and lateral to the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle.</b> It is immediately superior to the extradural vertebral artery, which is making a loop above the posterior C1 ring to enter the foramen magnum. The anteriomedial wall of the condylar canal thickens to join the foramen magnum rim and connect to the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyle.</b>|$|E
50|$|As its {{specific}} name suggests, Antarctosuchus polyodon is distinguished by {{the possession of}} numerous, extremely small maxillary, palatine, and ectopterygoid teeth, a dental pattern that suggests specialization on small prey, possibly invertebrates. Other autapomorphic features of this taxon are a parachoanal tooth row that extends far posterior to the choana and <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles</b> which are set close to the midline. Antarctosuchus possesses a relatively flat skull, low occiput and well-developed sensory canals, suggesting an aquatic lifestyle. A phylogenetic analysis places Antarctosuchus within Capitosauroidea, a clade of derived Triassic stereospondyls as the sister taxon to Paracyclotosaurus crookshanki from the Triassic Denwai Formation of India.|$|R
40|$|The basiocciput of 265 Indian adult human skulls was {{examined}} for precondylar tubercles, which are single or paired osseous formations anterior to the <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles</b> and foramen magnum.

500|$|Other {{animals that}} would later be {{classified}} as temnospondyls were placed in a group called Ganocephala, which was characterized by plate-like skull bones, small limbs, fish-like scales, and branchial arches.

Archegosaurus, [...] Dendrerpeton, Eryops and Trimerorhachis were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of Reptilia. Their rhachitomous vertebrae, notochord, and lack of <b>occipital</b> <b>condyles</b> (which attached the head to the neck) were features that were also shared with fishes. Thus, they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as stegocephalians.|$|R
