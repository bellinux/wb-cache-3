5|$|The {{best thing}} <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> that the Greeks {{should not go}} to war with each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

25|$|Verbs whose stems end in i (bri- 'have', wi- 'tell', pi- 'eat', di- 'drink', swi- 'allow') {{vary from}} the above {{paradigm}} in a few minor points. Bal-aia 'come' and w-aia 'go', have an irregular Present I tense. The verb yabaia 'give' is anomalous {{in a different way}} by having irregularly derived non-third-person object-indexing forms. Finally, the most irregular verb <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> the defective and irregular kaia 'to be'.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} the railway had a {{dramatic}} impact on Sandvika. First <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> spurred the centralization of many commercial activities in Sandvika, with the subsequent increase to population. Secondly the line cut through the town. This creased a social divide, with workers and craftsmen settling north of the station, and the bourgeois settling on the south side, along the fjord. The railway also brought some tourism with people on day trips from Oslo.|$|E

25|$|At Burning Man, the {{community}} explores {{various forms of}} artistic self-expression, created in celebration {{for the pleasure of}} all participants. Participation is a key precept for {{the community}} – selfless giving of one's unique talents for the enjoyment <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> encouraged and actively reinforced. Some of these generous outpourings of creativity can include experimental and interactive sculpture, building, performance, and art cars among other media, often inspired by the yearly theme, chosen by organizers.|$|E
25|$|Partly due also to {{the variety}} of climates in Japan and the {{millennium}} encompassed between the first cultural import and the last, the result is extremely heterogeneous, but several practically universal features can nonetheless be found. First <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> the choice of materials, always wood in various forms (planks, straw, tree bark, etc.) for almost all structures. Unlike both Western and some Chinese architecture, the use of stone is avoided except for certain specific uses, for example temple podia and pagoda foundations.|$|E
25|$|Herring often move {{in large}} schools around fishing banks {{and near the}} coast. The most {{abundant}} and commercially important species belong to the genus Clupea, found particularly in shallow, temperate waters of the North Pacific and the North Atlantic Oceans, including the Baltic Sea, as well as off {{the west coast of}} South America. Three species of Clupea are recognised, and provide about 90% of all herrings captured in fisheries. Most abundant <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> the Atlantic herring, providing over half of all herring capture. Fishes called herring are also found in the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean, and Bay of Bengal.|$|E

25|$|Most of the climbs {{are located}} in a {{relatively}} small area, causing the roads to turn constantly and often abruptly, which explains the winding and irregular trajectory of the finale. The Oude Kwaremont is the longest climb at 2.2km: an atypical hill {{because it is not}} very steep, but {{considered one of the most}} arduous climbs in Flanders because of its length and cobbled surface. The steepest <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> the fully cobbled Koppenberg, 600meters in length with grueling stretches of 22% over a poorly paved narrow road.|$|E
25|$|Pollock is of Scottish ancestry {{through his}} father Andrew Pollock, {{who was born}} in Edinburgh to a {{minister}} and moved to present-day South Africa. Peter's brother, Graeme Pollock, an acclaimed left hand batsman, was a regular player for the South Africa cricket team {{at the same time as}} Peter, and two of his nephews also played first-class cricket, both for Transvaal and Leicestershire amongst other sides. Perhaps most famous <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> his son, Shaun Pollock, who played 108 Tests and over 300 ODIs for South Africa and is widely regarded as one of the finest all-rounders to ever play the game.|$|E
25|$|Eye damage. Though it is unlikely, {{high power}} visible or {{invisible}} (infrared, ultraviolet) laser light could cause permanent eye injury. The injury could be relatively minor, such as spots only detectable by medical exam {{or on the}} periphery of vision. At higher power levels, the spots may be in the central vision, in the same area where the original light was viewed. Most unlikely <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> injury causing a complete and permanent loss of vision. To do this requires very specialized equipment and a desire to deliberately target aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} novel's three female protagonists, {{and the three}} {{symbiotic}} storylines that they appear in, there are other examples in the novel where Cunningham patterns his story on groups of three. Most conspicuous <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> the threeway relationship that once existed between Clarissa, Richard and Louis when they were three students on holiday together. In the 'Mrs. Woolf' storyline there is another grouping of three (biographically factual) in Vanessa's three children, Quentin, Julian, and Angelica, who come with their mother to visit Virginia. Then there is the nuclear family of three we find in Laura Brown, her husband Dan, and their son Richie.|$|E
25|$|The age of {{the various}} {{elements}} in synagogal song may be traced from {{the order in which}} the passages of the text were first introduced into the liturgy and were in turn regarded as so important as to demand special vocalization. This order closely agrees with that in which the successive tones and styles still preserved for these elements came into use among the Gentile neighbors of the Jews who utilized them. Earliest <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> the cantillation of the Scriptures, in which the traditions of the various rites differ only as much and in the same manner from one another as their particular interpretations according to the text and occasion differ among themselves. This indeed was to be anticipated if the differentiation itself preserves a peculiarity of the music of the Temple (see Jew. Encyc. iii. 539a, s.v. Cantillation).|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{persons are}} known to have perished – some carried away by the waves of the lake, others crushed beneath their {{collapsing}} houses. Thus the beautiful town of Taal remains a deserted wilderness and reduced to the utmost misery, while once {{it was one of the}} richest and most flourishing places. In the villages to the west of the lake, which were the greater and better part, all the houses have either collapsed under the load of material which had been piled upon them or have disappeared completely, swept away by the waves which in these places were so violent that they dug three ditches or channels, too wide and deep to be forded, and thus rendered impassable the road which joins the town with Balayan. In other parts of the lake shore have likewise opened many cracks and occurred very extensive slides. The worst <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>is,</b> that, the mouth of the river Pansipit having been blocked, the lake is rising and invading the towns of Lipa and Tanauan, both being on the lowest level, and inundating their buildings. All the animals of whatever kind have perished, some by being buried, others by drowning, the rest by starving, as not a green blade remained anywhere.|$|E
