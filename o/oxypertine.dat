50|$|<b>Oxypertine</b> (Equipertine, Forit, Integrin, Lanturil, Lotawin, Opertil) is an {{antipsychotic}} used in {{the treatment}} of schizophrenia. It was also evaluated for the treatment of anxiety at a dosage of 20 mg per day. Chemically, it is an indole derivative similarly to molindone {{and a member of the}} phenylpiperazine class. Like reserpine and tetrabenazine, <b>oxypertine</b> depletes catecholamines, though not serotonin, possibly underlying its neuroleptic efficacy. The molecular structure is strongly similar to solypertine and milipertine.|$|E
40|$|Cerebrospinal fluid HVA, MHPG, 5 HIAA, cAMP and cGMP were {{measured}} in 12 chronic schizophrenic patients with tardive dyskinesia {{before and after}} the administration of <b>oxypertine,</b> hydroxyzine pamoate or placebo. Lumbar puncture was performed after probenecid administration. HVA levels significantly decreased and cAMP levels significantly increased after <b>oxypertine</b> treatment. Three of the four patients treated with <b>oxypertine</b> showed improvement in tardive dyskinesia. 5 HIAA levels significantly decreased during hydroxyzine administration. Two of the four patients improved in tardive dyskinesia showed decrease of HVA after hydroxyzine treatment. There were no significant alterations of amine metabolites and cyclic nucleotides in the patients with placebo. Decrease of HVA may indicate the normalization of hyperdopaminergic state. It has been recognized that <b>oxypertine</b> is a noradrenaline depleting agent and hydroxyzine has an antiserotonic and antihistaminic properties. Noradrenaline and/or serotonin may have an effect on dopaminergic function in the central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|This {{systematic}} review aimed to collate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of various interventions {{used to treat}} tardive dyskinesia (TD) and, where appropriate, to combine the data for mete-analysis, Clinical trials were identified by electronic searches, handsearches and contact with principal investigators. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, for outcomes related to improvement, deterioration, side-effects and drop out rates. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenzel Odds Ratio (fixed effect model). For treatments that had significant effects, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. From 296 controlled clinical trials, data were extracted from 47 trials. For most interventions, we could identify no RCT-derived evidence of efficacy. A meta-analysis showed that baclofen, deanol and diazepam were no more effective than a placebo. Single RCTs demonstrated a lack of evidence of any effect for bromocriptine, ceruletide, clonidine, estrogen, gamma linolenic acid, hydergine, lecithin, lithium, progabide, seligiline and tetrahydroisoxazolopyridinol. The meta-analysis found that five interventions were effective: L-dopa, <b>oxypertine,</b> sodium valproate, tiapride and vitamin E; neuroleptic reduction was marginally significant. Data from single RCTs revealed that insulin, alpha methyl dopa and reserpine were more effective than a placebo. There was a significantly increased risk of adverse events associated with baclofen, deanol, L-dopa, <b>oxypertine</b> and reserpine. Metaanalysis {{of the impact of}} placebo (n= 485) showed that 37. 3 % of participants showed an improvement. Interpretation of this {{systematic review}} requires caution as the individual trials identified tended to have small sample sizes. For many compounds, data from only one trial were available, and where meta-analyses were possible, these were based on a small number of trials. Despite these concerns, the review facilitated the interpretation of the large and diverse range of treatments used for TD. Clinical recommendations for the treatment of TD are made, based on the availability of RCT-derived evidence, the strength of that evidence and the presence of adverse effects.

40|$|The {{isolated}} field-stimulated {{vas deferens}} {{of the rat}} (0. 1 Hz, 3 ms, 30 - 40 V) was used to study {{the relationship between the}} in vivo inhibition of neuronal uptake of noradrenaline (NA) by cyclic antidepressant drugs and the subsequent activation/desensitization of presynaptic alpha 2 -adrenoceptors. Receptor activation was indirectly measured by quantifying the ability of each drug to inhibit basal twitch responses after their acute administration. Receptor desensitization was also indirectly measured by quantifying the ability of the drugs to reduce the inhibitory effects of selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists on the electrically-induced twitch responses after their long-term administration. The acute in vivo administration of desipramine and other antidepressants (0. 5 - 10 mg kg- 1; i. p.; 2 h) resulted in dose-dependent inhibitions of the basal twitch responses which were rapidly reversed to control values by idazoxan (10 - 5 M). In vitro, desipramine and other antidepressants also inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (10 (- 9) - 10 (- 5) M) the twitch responses. In rats pretreated 12 h earlier with reserpine (1 mg kg- 1; i. p.) or <b>oxypertine</b> (4 mg kg- 1; i. p.), desipramine (10 mg kg- 1; 2 h) did not induce inhibition of the basal twitch responses or it induced a smaller effect, respectively. For the various antidepressants the degree of inhibition of the basal twitch responses (desipramine greater than protriptyline greater than nortriptyline greater than maprotiline = imipramine greater than amitriptyline greater than viloxazine greater than iprindole much greater than zimelidine) was highly correlated (r = 0. 914) with the potency for blockade of [3 H]-NA uptake into rat brain synaptosomes. Clonidine and xylazine inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (10 (- 9) - 10 (- 6) M) the twitch responses. The long-term (7 - 14 days) administration of antidepressants or cocaine (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.) resulted in significant decreases in sensitivity to clonidine or xylazine. Short-term (3 days) treatment with desipramine did not reduce the sensitivity to clonidine. The results indicate that the acute in vivo inhibition of NA neuronal uptake by antidepressants leads to the activation (through endogenous NA) of presynaptic inhibitory alpha 2 -adrenoceptors which results in inhibition of the twitch responses. In contrast, prolonged in vivo inhibition of NA reuptake is followed by a slow desensitization process of the same receptors which results in a reduction of sensitivity to clonidine...|$|E
