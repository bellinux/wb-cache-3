5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little {{concern in the}} 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an <b>output</b> <b>gap</b> raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E
25|$|Governments {{implement}} {{fiscal policy}} that influence macroeconomic conditions by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand. When aggregate demand falls below the potential {{output of the}} economy, there is an <b>output</b> <b>gap</b> where some productive capacity is left unemployed. Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand. Resources that have been idled {{can be used by}} the government.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} fiscal policy can {{be limited by}} {{crowding}} out. When there is no <b>output</b> <b>gap,</b> the economy is producing at full capacity {{and there are no}} excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.|$|E

The "split time trend" method for estimating trend output that was previously used for calculating structural budget balances is compared with two alternative methods, smoothing real GDP using a Hodrick Prescott filter and estimating potential output using a production function approach. It is concluded that the production function approach for estimating potential output provides the best method for estimating <b>output</b> <b>gaps</b> and for calculating structural budget balances, with the results obtained by smoothing GDP providing a cross check.

2500|$|In {{order to}} ensure {{long-term}} compliance with the SGP deficit and debt criteria, the member states have since the SGP-reform in March 2005 striven towards achieving their country-specific Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO). The MTO is the set limit, that the structural balance relative to GDP needs to equal or be above for {{each year in the}} medium-term. Each state select its own MTO, but it needs to equal or be better than a calculated minimum requirement (Minimum MTO) ensuring sustainability of the government accounts throughout the long-term (calculated on basis of both future potential GDP growth, future cost of government debt, and future increases in age-related costs). The structural balance is calculated by the European Commission as the cyclically-adjusted balance minus [...] "one-off measures" [...] (i.e. one-off payments due to reforming a pension scheme). The cyclically-adjusted balance is calculated by adjusting the achieved general government balance (in % of GDP) compared to each years relative economic growth position in the business cycle (referred to as the [...] "output gap"), which is found by subtraction of the achieved GDP growth with the potential GDP growth. So if a year is recorded with average GDP growth in the business cycle (equal to the potential GDP growth rate), the <b>output</b> <b>gap</b> will then be zero, meaning that the [...] "cyclically-adjusted balance" [...] then will be equal to the [...] "government budget balance". In this way, because it is resistant to GDP growth changes, the structural balance is considered to be neutral and comparable across an entire business cycle (including both recession years and [...] "overheated years"), making it perfect to be used consistently as a medium-term budgetary objective.|$|E
50|$|Divine {{coincidence}} {{relies on}} the assumption specific to the New Keynesian model that {{the gap between the}} natural level of output and the efficient (first-best) level of output is constant and invariant to shocks. This further implies that stabilizing the <b>output</b> <b>gap</b> - the gap between actual and natural output — is equivalent to stabilizing the welfare-relevant <b>output</b> <b>gap</b> — the gap between actual and efficient output. If, however, non-trivial real imperfections are introduced into the model, the gap between natural and efficient output is not constant any more and is affected by shocks. Consequently, divine coincidence disappears, the <b>output</b> <b>gap</b> does not equal the welfare-relevant <b>output</b> <b>gap</b> any longer, and central banks are left with their trade-off between inflation and output stabilization.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{pair-wise}} approach to testing for output convergence that considers all N(N- 1) / 2 possible pairs of log per capita <b>output</b> <b>gaps</b> across N economies.

The test is applied to output series in the Penn World Tables (1950 - 2000), and to Maddison's historical series (1870 - 2000). Overall, the results do not support output convergence and suggest that the findings of convergence clubs in the literature might be spurious. However, significant evidence of growth convergence is found. Non-convergence of log per capita outputs combined with growth convergence suggests that there are important country-specific factors that render <b>output</b> <b>gaps</b> highly persistent.

40|$|Most EU {{member states}} will adopt fiscal rules that refer to cyclically-adjusted {{borrowing}} limits. Under the standard cyclical adjustment procedure, trend increases in public debt based on cyclical components are prevented if the real-time <b>output</b> <b>gaps</b> {{used to calculate}} cyclical components balance over time. We analyse real-time <b>output</b> <b>gaps</b> for EU- 15 countries over the 1996 - 2011 period as estimated by the EU, the IMF and the OECD. Compared to each institution's final estimate, we find that real-time <b>output</b> <b>gaps</b> in our sample period are negatively biased. This bias is observed (i) irrespective {{of the source of}} the data, (ii) in all real-time vintages, (iii) basically across the entire cross-section of countries. The magnitude of the bias is considerable: on average, real-time cyclical components as a percentage of GDP are biased downwards by about 0. 5 percentage point per year. Our results suggest that fiscal rules should incorporate ex-post checks of the unbiasedness of the cyclical components used within the rule. Potential biases would then decrease or increase future borrowing limits...|$|R

40|$|How can {{quantitative}} easing (QE) {{work in the}} Eurozone (EZ) ? We model the EZ as the aggregate of two countries characterised by New Keynesian output and inflation equations with a Tobinian money market equation that determines each country's interest rate as a spread above the common policy rate. High spreads determine negative <b>output</b> <b>gaps</b> and deflationary pressure. With the ECB policy rate at the zero lower bound, QE expands money supply throughout the EZ. We show that QE, if large enough, can indeed be effective by reducing country spreads and the ensuing <b>output</b> <b>gaps.</b> However, zero <b>output</b> and deflation <b>gaps</b> can be obtained for the EZ on average, but not for all single countries unless fully symmetric conditions are met. Therefore fiscal accommodation at the country level should also intervene, and we conclude that the coordination of fiscal and monetary policies is of paramount importance...|$|R

50|$|A {{major theme}} of Orphanides’ {{research}} on monetary economics {{has been the}} evaluation and design of monetary policy in real time. He argued that since the data available to policy makers at the time policy decisions are made are imperfect and subject to substantial revisions, the historical analysis of monetary policy decisions {{as well as the}} evaluation of alternative policy strategies must be based on the information available in real time (Orphanides, 2001, Orphanides, 2003). His work has documented significant problems arising from policy decisions drawing on unobservable concepts such as the <b>output</b> <b>gap.</b> Orphanides has argued against output-gap-based policy rules, such as the Taylor rule, and in favour of non-activist policy rules drawing on Milton Friedman and Knut Wicksell. He has stressed that overemphasizing the <b>output</b> <b>gap</b> as reflected, for example, in the Taylor rule or optimal control policy, is counterproductive for stabilizing the macroeconomy. He has also provided an explanation of the high inflation experience in the United States during the late 1960s and 1970s as resulting from policy focused too closely at stabilizing the real economy, by aiming to close the perceived output and unemployment gaps. According to this analysis, the high inflation resulted from the fact these gaps were badly mismeasured due to overoptimistic real time estimates of potential output and the natural rate of unemployment (Orphanides, 2003).In related work, Orphanides and Simon van Norden, have explained that the unreliability of <b>output</b> <b>gap</b> measures in real time is of a more general nature than previously thought. They documented the unreliability of various statistical techniques for measuring the <b>output</b> <b>gap</b> in real-time and also the lack of predictive power of real-time <b>output</b> <b>gap</b> estimates for forecasting inflation, thus calling into question policy approaches that rely on the output for stabilization policy (Orphanides and Norden, 2002).|$|E
