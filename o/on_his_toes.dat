5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1999 Don King and Oscar De la Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, agreed to co-promote a mega-fight for the Lineal, WBC and IBF welterweight championships on September 18, 1999, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. Early in the fight De la Hoya {{employed}} boxing to connect combinations while avoiding Trinidad's attacks. The second round began with both boxers trading punches but De la Hoya quickly returned to his previous tactic, which he employed in the third round. In the fourth round Trinidad pressured the offense while De la Hoya tried to avoid his punches by moving, both boxers eventually exchanged punches. In the fifth round Trinidad continued in the offensive while De la Hoya attempted {{to remain on the}} outside corners of the ring, Trinidad's eye was swollen following a trade of punches, and his nose was also bleeding. Trinidad was having a lot of problems finding De La Hoya and couldn't connect as flush as usual with his punches, although he scored at times, Oscar's movement was not letting him land in combination and it was proclaimed by many to have been a lackluster fight. In the eighth round the swelling on Trinidad's eye was worsening. Oscar was scoring on Trinidad but halfway through the tenth, De La Hoya stopped sticking and basically disengaged. De La Hoya gassed out and had remained <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> {{for the remainder of the}} bout, and Trinidad won all the final rounds.The judges gave Trinidad a very controversial majority decision, with scores of 115–113, 115–114 and 114–114.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 2008, at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California, De La Hoya fought Steve Forbes (33–5) in a tuneup for a {{possible}} rematch with Mayweather. De La Hoya showed a more relaxed style, throwing a constant jab and always staying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>toes.</b> He opened a cut near Forbes' eye in the sixth round.|$|E
25|$|Preston Burke is {{the former}} chief cardiothoracic surgeon at Seattle Grace Hospital. He {{completed}} his pre-medical studies at Tulane University where he pledged Kappa Alpha Psi, {{and went on to}} graduate first in his class from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. While in college, he met Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who graduated in second place after him, beginning a rivalry between them. He was once the interim chief of surgery while Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) was healing from his brain surgery. In season 1 it is revealed that Richard had promised him the position but instead enticed his former student, renowned neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), to Seattle as he felt Burke was becoming arrogant and needed competition to keep him <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>toes.</b> He began a relationship with intern Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) but broke it off because he feared it would ruin both of their reputations. Her miscarriage brought them back together. He and Cristina lived together in his perfectly kept apartment.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{performing}} tasks {{favorable to}} one of the four nations in the game and thus being promoted enough, the player may be given the chance to dance with a governor's daughter at a ball. Dancing is done by following the daughter's hand signals (left, right, back, forward, spin left, spin right) and moving appropriately. Successful dancing is rewarded with 'amour' from the governor's daughters, as well as gifts or valuable information. With the purchase of dancing shoes from the tavern merchant, the player is more nimble <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>toes.</b> When the daughter's 'amour' is high enough, she will request items such as a diamond necklace or ruby ring (purchased from the mysterious stranger at the tavern) or notify the hero that someone seeks to fight a duel over her. In the final step, the daughter is abducted, and the hero must track down the abductor aboard his ship and defeat him. Upon returning the daughter to her home city and the hero subsequently agreeing to marry her, the game will show a cutscene of the marriage, and the hero will gain bonus fame points. The more attractive the daughter (plain, attractive, beautiful), the more difficult the sequence of moves required during a dance, and the more fame points she is worth upon marriage. The difficulty level selected also affects the complexity of the steps and introduces new and more demanding musical scores.|$|E
500|$|Auden {{published}} {{about four}} hundred poems, including seven long poems (two of them book-length). His poetry was encyclopaedic {{in scope and}} method, ranging in style from obscure twentieth-century modernism to the lucid traditional forms such as ballads and limericks, from doggerel through haiku and villanelles to a [...] "Christmas Oratorio" [...] and a baroque eclogue in Anglo-Saxon meters. The tone and content of his poems ranged from pop-song clichés to complex philosophical meditations, from the corns <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> to atoms and stars, from contemporary crises {{to the evolution of}} society.|$|E
500|$|Jackson stated at {{the time}} that he was {{disappointed}} in his performance; he had wanted to remain <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> longer than he had. Jackson subsequently said that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] was one of his favorite songs to perform live, but only when he did not have to do it the way he had on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever. [...] "The audience wants a certain thing—I have to do the moonwalk in that spot," [...] he later said. [...] "I'd like to do a different version." ...|$|E

500|$|After he {{performs}} a quick spin, Jackson jumps and lands, freeze framed, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>toes.</b> Upon {{arrival at the}} hotel, Jackson climbs the staircase to Billie Jean's room. Each step lights up as he touches it and a burnt out [...] "Hotel" [...] sign illuminates as he passes. The paparazzo then arrives at the scene and watches as Jackson vanishes under the covers of Billie Jean's bed. Trailed by the police, the paparazzo is then arrested for spying on Billie Jean. Jackson sported a new look for the video; Jackson's clothes, a black leather suit with a pink shirt and a red bow tie, were copied by children around the US. Imitation became so severe that, despite pupil protests, Bound Brook High School banned students from wearing a single white glove like Jackson had on during the performance of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] at [...]|$|E
500|$|Bruegel based {{the work}} on the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from Matthew 15:14, in which Christ refers to the Pharisees. [...] According to art critic Margaret Sullivan, Bruegel's {{audience}} was likely as familiar with classical literature as with the Bible. Erasmus had published his Adagia two years before Bruegel's painting, and it contained the quotation [...] "" [...] ("the blind leader of the blind") by Roman poet Horace. [...] Bruegel expands the two blind men in the parable to six; they are well dressed, rather than wearing the peasant clothing that typifies his late work. [...] The first blind man's face is not visible; the second twists his head as he falls, perhaps to avoid landing face-first. The shinguard-clad third man, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> with knees bent and face to the sky, shares a staff with the second, by which he is being pulled down. The others have yet to stumble, but the same fate seems implied.|$|E
500|$|With {{the open}} game world, Rocksteady {{included}} more villains to create challenges for Batman. Hugo Strange {{was selected as}} a primary antagonist, as his power and controlling manner help maintain the lockdown on Arkham City once Batman enters. Strange is aware of Batman's true identity, making Batman [...] "vulnerable and exposed {{in a way that}} he has never been before", according to Hill. He noted that Strange is a character new to many players but that his backstory and character are detailed throughout the game. Catwoman was also included based on her long history with Batman, though she was given her own agenda running parallel to the events within Arkham City. Catwoman's missions initially ended with her coming to Batman's aide, but late in development, the developers decided to give the player an alternate choice, allowing them to have the morally grey Catwoman leave the city with her loot; the addition was implemented in two days. Batman's sidekick Robin also appears, featuring a shaved head and contemporary costume design that were intended to move away from his traditional [...] "Boy Wonder" [...] image. Senior concept artist Kan Muftic explained: [...] "Our vision of Robin is the one of a troubled young individual that is calm and introverted at times, but very dangerous and aggressive if provoked. The shaved head is inspired by cage fighters, because we thought that Robin might be doing that in his spare time to keep him <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>toes.</b> Still, we kept all the classic trademarks of Robin's appearance, such as the red and yellow colors of his outfit, the cape and the mask." [...] Rocksteady originally did not plan to include Robin in the main story but later decided to as an authentic means of delivering new gadgets to Batman, as well as to introduce their version of the character and his relationship with Batman.|$|E

2500|$|She and Mia don't {{see eye to}} eye: Clarisse is {{concerned}} with attracting publicity to Genovia and ensuring Mia does not embarrass her country while Mia prefers to focus on politics. Though she and Mia butt heads often, she does care for her granddaughter and gives her advice about love and relationships that Mia takes {{with a grain of}} salt due to her grandmother's cold nature. For example, when Clarisse was married to the king of Genovia, she led him to believe that she was only interested in his status and money and never once said [...] "I love you", in order to keep her husband <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>toes.</b> Mia also mentions that her father is terrified of his mother because she would lock him in the palace dungeons whenever he misbehaved (although when she informs him that he gives the appearance of being a little bit scared of Clarisse in , her father replies that he is not scared of his mother and that she really isn't as bad as Mia thinks; in his view, Clarisse [...] "just needs proper handling").|$|E
2500|$|Following John Byrne's revamp of Superman, a {{new version}} of Superboy was {{introduced}} as a means of patching the Legion of Super-Heroes' continuity, which was undermined by the removal of Kal-El's Superboy career. This Superboy {{is said to have been}} created by the Time Trapper, one of the Legion's greatest enemies, when he notices that the great youthful hero they take inspiration from does not start his career until he is an adult. Wishing to preserve this history due to his own history's connection to the Legion's past, the Trapper takes a sliver of time from the ancient universe and uses it to craft a [...] "pocket universe" [...] in which Earth and Krypton are the only inhabited planets. Whenever the Legionnaires travel back in time, they travel to the 20th century of the Pocket Universe, not the main DC Universe. From birth until the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Superboy's life is similar to the life of the original Superboy. When the universe-destroying Crisis strikes, Superboy lacks the power to save his Earth, but the Time Trapper can do so, provided Kal-El helps him capture the Legion. Superboy reluctantly agrees. After a battle with the post-Crisis Superman- during which Superman is drastically overpowered by Superboy's pre-Crisis strength while managing to keep Superboy <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> due to his superior experiences, Superboy realizes he can't turn on his friends and instead helps the Legionnaires defeat the Trapper. Using a device the Trapper employed to stave off Earth's destruction, Superboy saves his Earth, but only at the cost of his own life. His dying act is to return the Legion to their century (and Earth), where he is later buried. Later editorial mandates that removed Superboy from the history of the Legion led to a story where the Time Trapper is apparently erased from history, wiping the Pocket Universe and that universe's Superboy from existence.|$|E
