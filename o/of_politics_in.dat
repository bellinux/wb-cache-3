5|$|Hayes {{hoped to}} remain out <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> {{order to pay}} off the debts he had {{incurred}} during the Panic, but when the Republican state convention nominated him for governor in 1875, he accepted. The campaign against Democratic nominee William Allen focused primarily on Protestant fears of the possibility of state aid to Catholic schools. Hayes was against such funding and, while he was not known to be personally anti-Catholic, he allowed anti-Catholic fervor to contribute to the enthusiasm for his candidacy. The campaign was a success, and Hayes was returned to the governorship by a 5,544-vote majority. The first person to earn a third term as Governor of Ohio, Hayes reduced the state debt, re-established the Board of Charities, and repealed the Geghan Bill, which had allowed for the appointment of Catholic priests to schools and penitentiaries.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{scholars}} {{debate the}} influence <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> determining union {{strength in the}} US and other countries. One argument is that political parties play an expected role in determining union strength, with left-wing governments generally promoting greater union density, while others contest this finding by pointing out important counterexamples and explaining the reverse causality inherent in this relationship.|$|E

25|$|Statistical data {{proves that}} the {{majority}} of women work in the service and domestic sectors while men work in the production sector. According to data from the 1940s, gender equality existed neither in the domain of work nor in the area <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> the kibbutzim of the time. For instance, in 1948, in eight kibbutzim of the Ihud, a kibbutz federation with a pragmatic socialist orientation, 78.3 percent of the women worked in services (services for adults, child care, education) as compared with 16.7 percent of the men. That same year, 15.2 percent of the women worked in production as distinct from 58.2 percent of the men. The situation was the same in political life.|$|E
25|$|In {{his later}} years, Cokayne became closely allied to Sir Richard Vernon. The Vernon family were the wealthiest and most {{powerful}} of the Derbyshire gentry, with large and widely spread estates, more {{like those of the}} local nobility. Sir Richard Vernon was too powerful to be easily absorbed into one of the aristocratic affinities but not strong enough to stand entirely alone. Cokayne, in a similar position, negotiated the tricky waters <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> the king's minority alongside Vernon and often in close aliance with him. At the county's parliamentary election in 1432 he sealed the indenture returning Richard Vernon, Sir Richard's son, and {{at about the same time}} arranged the betrothal of his heir, John, to Vernon's daughter Anne.|$|E

25|$|During the Schröder administration, Schröder and Lafontaine disliked each other, because Lafontaine quit as Finance Minister in 1999. After his {{resignation}} {{there was a}} huge distrust of Lafontaine in the SPD which lasts to today. However, due to the rise of Angela Merkel and Guido Westerwelle on the national stage <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> 2005 and a belief in the German public of the failed social policies of the SPD on labour issues (Hartz IV), the SPD lost heavily in opinion polls and lost a couple of statewide elections. So there was the urgency to form new coalitions with the Left who have a similar political agenda than the weakened Green Party or the other conservative parties in Germany. However the leader of the Left was the lost child of the SPD - Oskar Lafontaine - who had fallen out with the SPD. There is a common oath in the SPD not to form coalitions with the Left, because of Lafontaine.|$|E
25|$|Being {{the capital}} of the Madras Province that covered a vast area of the Deccan region, Chennai {{remained}} the centre <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> the southern region of India during the British colonial era. After Independence, it remained the centre of political activities of the state of Tamil Nadu. Chennai is the birthplace of the idea of the Indian National Congress, commonly known as the Congress Party. Founded by Indian and British members of the Theosophical Society movement, most notably A.O. Hume, the idea was originally conceived in a private meeting of 17 men after a Theosophical Convention held in the city in December 1884. During the first 50 years of the Indian National Congress, the city played host to its conferences seven times in 1887, 1894, 1898, 1903, 1908, 1914 and 1927, becoming one of the strong bases for the Indian independence movement. After independence, the city hosted the Congress in 1955 in its suburb of Avadi.|$|E
25|$|The Independent Turkey Party, led by Haydar Baş, {{campaigned on}} {{its policy of}} raising the minimum wage to ₺5,000 and claimed {{continuously}} that private polling {{results showed that the}} BTP was trailing above the 10% threshold. The Anatolia Party (ANAPAR), led by Emine Ülker Tarhan, claimed that they would surpass the 10% threshold and criticised the opposition parties for their ineffectiveness. Tarhan also promised to give young citizens 5GB of free internet per month. The Centre Party (MEP), led by Abdurrahim Karslı, campaigned on the need for a fundamental reform <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> Turkey and portrayed themselves as a political alternative to the established parties, mainly using the slogan 'New politics' (Yeni siyaset). The Liberal Democrat Party (LDP), led by Cem Toker, formed a partnership with an election monitoring volunteer organisation named Votes and Beyond (Oy ve Ötesi). The LDP provided Oy ve Ötesi volunteers with partisan LDP observer passes that were necessary for them to monitor the voting and counting processes.|$|E

25|$|The {{demonstration}} {{also led}} to a conflict with the Queen, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, {{in the autumn of}} 1790. That autumn, the King chose to remain in the summer residence of Drottningholm Palace well in to the autumn because of the social boycott. Finally, the Queen returned to the capital without his consent, which made him accuse her of having been manipulated by the oppositional of the female courtiers to participate in the political demonstration and refusing him the company of her ladies-in-waiting by leaving: he suspected Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen to have persuaded the Queen to participate in the boycott. This is however not considered to have been true: though the Queen did oppose to the act of 1789, she is reported never to have allowed any one to speak <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> her presence, and the reason to why she wished to leave was reportedly for health reasons, as Drottningholm was quite cold by that time of the year and she had been afflicted by an ear infection.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} in Tennessee, Jackson won {{the appointment of}} judge advocate of the Tennessee militia. While serving on the Tennessee Supreme Court, he was appointed in 1801 as a colonel in the Tennessee militia. In 1802 he declared his candidacy for major general, or commander, of the Tennessee militia, a position voted on by the officers. Jackson, with strong support from western Tennessee, tied with John Sevier with seventeen votes. Sevier was a popular Revolutionary War veteran and former governor, the recognized leader <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> eastern Tennessee. On February 5, Governor Archibald Roane broke the tie in Jackson's favor. Jackson had also presented Roane with evidence against Sevier of land fraud. Subsequently, in 1803, when Sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship, Roane released the evidence. Sevier responded with hostility to Jackson, and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter. Despite the charges leveled against Sevier, he defeated Roane, and continued to serve as governor until 1809. Sevier took revenge on Jackson by dividing the militia into east and west districts, and giving Jackson control of only the west.|$|E
25|$|However, some {{observers}} claim the merger {{has not had}} positive results. Critics argue that local FEA unions are less effective in collective bargaining, local and state annual dues are too high, young teachers are reluctant to join their local affiliates, and neither the state association nor local unions have done much to protect under-performing teachers from being fired. These critics say the association is increasingly frozen out <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> a state where Republicans control both the executive and legislative branches of government, and has made little headway in convincing the public that the candidates it backs are worth electing or the policies it supports are worth enacting. FEA supporters counter that the federation has proven effective despite these odds, and remains a force in state politics. They point to the federation's king-making role in the state's 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary, where the union's candidate (Bill McBride) defeated a better-known and funded candidate (Janet Reno) and ran a strong campaign against a popular, wealthy incumbent (Gov. Jeb Bush).|$|E
