50|$|Olfactory {{problems}} {{can be divided into}} different types based on their malfunction. The olfactory dysfunction can be total (anosmia), incomplete (partial anosmia, hyposmia, or microsmia), distorted (dysosmia), or can be characterized by spontaneous sensations like phantosmia. An inability to recognize odors despite a normally functioning olfactory system is termed <b>olfactory</b> <b>agnosia.</b> Hyperosmia is a rare condition typified by an abnormally heightened sense of smell. Like vision and hearing, the olfactory {{problems can}} be bilateral or unilateral meaning if a person has anosmia {{on the right side of}} the nose but not the left, it is a unilateral right anosmia. On the other hand, if it is on both sides of the nose it is called bilateral anosmia or total anosmia.|$|E
40|$|In our studies, 50 {{percent of}} the male {{patients}} with schizophrenia have an <b>olfactory</b> <b>agnosia.</b> This finding is of interest because the olfactory neuroanatomical network involves brain regions found to be abnormal in patients with schizo-phrenia, and this olfactory deficit appears to be sex dependent. This article reviews conceptual models for assessing olfactory function, describes the neuroanatomical struc-tures involved, and reviews the findings of olfactory performance i...|$|E
