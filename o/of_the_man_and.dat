5|$|At a church, {{the killer}} is searching through files {{when he is}} interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied {{fingerprints}} at the scene. Black constructs a profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> deduces that his actions are attacks on faith, believing that the killer has suffered a devastating loss which has caused him to lose his own faith. As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the killer has returned to where his life fell apart. He and the police are {{able to identify the}} killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had been killed in a house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E
5|$|The cover also {{features}} a blue dragon eating a human, the design {{of which was a}} direct reference to the sea serpent image from Olaus Magnus's book History of the Northern Peoples. The use of a dragon eating a man is to symbolise former member Hester being consumed by depression, symbolised by the dragon being blue, and this brought his time on earth to an early end. The cover art is almost completely composed of newspaper cuttings collaged together, even the image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> the dragon are newspaper cuttings which Seymour painted onto. Only the tree on the right, and the title text are not composed of newspaper cuttings. The tree is to pose as a simile for the tree under which Hester took his life in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The emu has a {{prominent}} place in Australian Aboriginal mythology, including a creation myth of the Yuwaalaraay and other groups in New South Wales {{who say that the}} sun was made by throwing an emu's egg into the sky; the bird features in numerous aetiological stories told across a number of Aboriginal groups. One story from Western Australia holds that a man once annoyed a small bird, who responded by throwing a boomerang, severing the arms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> transforming him into a flightless emu. The Kurdaitcha man of Central Australia is said to wear sandals made of emu feathers to mask his footprints. Many Aboriginal language groups throughout Australia have a tradition that the dark dust lanes in the Milky Way represent a giant emu in the sky. Several of the Sydney rock engravings depict emus, and the birds are mimicked in indigenous dances.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the prevalence, social correlates, and clustering of cardiovascular disease risk factors in a predominantly Black, poor, urban community. METHODS: Associations of risk factor prevalences with sociodemographic variables were examined in a population-based sample of 695 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women aged 18 to 65 years living in Central Harlem. RESULTS: One third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women were hypertensive, 48 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 41 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women were smokers, 25 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 49 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women were overweight, <b>and</b> 23 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 35 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women reported no leisure-time physical activity over the past month. More than 80 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women had at least 1 of these risk factors, <b>and</b> 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 19 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women had 3 or more risk factors. Income and education {{were inversely related to}} hypertension, smoking, and physical inactivity. Having 3 or more risk factors was associated with low income and low education (extreme odds ratio [OR] = 10. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 3. 0, 34. 5 for education; OR = 3. 7, CI = 1. 6, 8. 9 for income) and with a history of unstable work or of homelessness. CONCLUSIONS: Disadvantaged, urban communities are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. These results highlight <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> socioenvironmental factors in shaping cardiovascular risk...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to intense {{public interest in}} Australia during the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Tamam Shud case also attracted international attention.

International circulation of a photograph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> details of his fingerprints yielded no positive identification. For example, in the United States, the FBI was unable to match the dead man's fingerprint with prints taken from files of domestic criminals.

500|$|Stalin's {{role was}} later {{questioned}} by fellow revolutionaries Boris Nicolaevsky and Leon Trotsky. The latter, Stalin's rival, was later assassinated on orders from Stalin.

Kun later discovered official archive documents however clearly showing that [...] "from late 1904 or early 1905 Stalin took part in drawing up plans for expropriations", adding, [...] "It is now certain that [...] controlled from the wings the initial plans of the group" [...] that carried out the Tiflis robbery.|$|E

500|$|Windows by Burges {{continue}} to be discovered. In 2009, a stained glass window found in the vaults of Bath Abbey was confirmed as a design by Burges. The window, which was commissioned by Mallet and Company, featured on the Antiques Roadshow in early 2010 and is currently {{on display at the}} Bath Aqua Theatre of Glass. In March 2011, two glass panels designed by Burges were purchased for £125,000 by Cadw. The panels were part of a set of twenty Burges designed for the chapel at Castell Coch but were removed when the unfinished chapel was demolished. Ten of the panels were put on display at Cardiff Castle, and eight were used in the model of the chapel in the attic room of the Well Tower at Castell Coch; the two purchased by Cadw were considered lost until they failed to sell at auction in Salisbury in 2010. The Inspector of Ancient Monuments for Cadw, speaking after their purchase, said, [...] "The panels show a variety of Welsh and British saints and key biblical figures and are of the highest quality Victorian stained glass. William Burges' work attracts enormous worldwide attention and the price reflects the artistic genius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> the rare quality of these glass panels." ...|$|E
500|$|Building on {{the latter}} of these two assessments, British historians of the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries, such as Trevelyan and Erskine May, {{promoted}} hostile interpretations of George III's life. However, in the mid-twentieth century the work of Lewis Namier, who thought George was [...] "much maligned", started a re-evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> his reign. Scholars of the later twentieth century, such as Butterfield and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter, are inclined to treat George sympathetically, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness. Butterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain: [...] "Erskine May must be {{a good example of the}} way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance. His capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence... carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth." [...] In pursuing war with the American colonists, George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes, rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives. In the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III the monarchy continued to lose its political power, and grew as the embodiment of national morality.|$|E
