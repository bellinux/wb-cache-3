50|$|Before the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Corps's primary {{strategy}} was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river.

50|$|Most boards on {{the market}} today contain one, two, or three rods (usually of carbon or graphite), {{referred}} to as stringers, to strengthen the board, reduce deformation, add stiffness and recoil to the core, thus providing greater speed <b>off</b> <b>bottom</b> turns and transitions on the wave.

50|$|Productivity of the Pacific oyster can be {{discussed}} {{as the amount}} of meat produced in relation to the amount of seed planted on cultch.

The main causes of mortality in the Pacific oystere are: natural mortality (age), predators, disease, environmental conditions (ice, freak winds), competition for space (crowding of cultch), silting (sediment runoff from land) and cluster separation (process of breaking up clusters of oysters to into as many individual oysters as possible).|$|E

5000|$|... 2002-03 saw Peter Daniel return, and {{improvements}} {{on the field}} were obvious from the very start. Ironically, despite bringing in a few key players to strengthen the squad, much of the side were graduates from the club’s youth policy, which seemingly had not matured quite quickly enough for previous managers. The season saw the club reach its best ever stage in national competitions, reaching the Second Round Proper of the FA Vase, and with another Cup Final appearance in the Wilkinson Sword Trophy, this time losing out to Mickleover Sports, 3-1 on aggregate. A strong run {{in the second half}} of the league season saw the Colls finish in fourth place in Division One.But optimism for the 2003-04 campaign soon evaporated, and after a poor start, Pete Daniel resigned.

50|$|The Cedars {{were in a}} {{pool with}} favourites New Zealand, Wales and Cook Islands. The team were well beaten against New Zealand in Gloucester, where there were ferocious winds and rain. Head coach John Elias said after the game that his team were simply out of their depth. However Lebanon did much better in the match against Wales. It wasn't until Wales had scored four tries that Lebanon had finally got on the score board with a Michael Coorey try in the 35th minute. In the second half Lebanon {{performed}} much better, but two late Hassan Saleh tries left Lebanon losing 24-22. By far the easiest game on paper was the match against the Cook Islands. With just five minutes remaining though, The Cedars found themselves 22-10 down, before Hazem El Masri scored a second try and centre Charles Baynie scored one too in last minute to seal a 22-22 draw for Lebanon. This point was enough to keep them <b>off</b> <b>bottom</b> place in the group, but they had not done enough to earn {{a place in the}} quarter-finals.|$|E

50|$|Weight on bit is {{provided}} by drill collars, which are thick-walled tubular pieces machined from solid bars of steel, usually plain carbon steel but sometimes of nonmagnetic nickel-copper alloy or other nonmagnetic premium alloys. Gravity acts on the large mass of the collars to provide the downward force needed for the bits to efficiently break rock. To accurately control the amount of force applied to the bit, the driller carefully monitors the surface weight measured while the bit is just off {{the bottom of the}} wellbore. Next, the drillstring (and the drill bit), is slowly and carefully lowered until it touches bottom. After that point, as the driller continues to lower the top of the drillstring, more and more weight is applied to the bit, and correspondingly less weight is measured as hanging at the surface. If the surface measurement shows 20,000 pounds kg less weight than with the bit <b>off</b> <b>bottom,</b> then there should be 20,000 pounds force on the bit (in a vertical hole). Some downhole MWD sensors can measure weight-on-bit more accurately and transmit the data to the surface.|$|E
50|$|After {{finding a}} stable manager in Mick Wadsworth, Scarborough {{were able to}} {{overturn}} several seasons of struggle to secure a 12th-place finish in 1996-97, before reaching the Division Three playoffs the following year; unfortunately for the club they crashed 7-2 on aggregate to Torquay United. The following season in 1998-99 saw the club stuck {{to the bottom of}} the table for most of the campaign, leading to Wadsworth resigning and Colin Addison taking over as manager. Results quickly improved under the new manager, but all the other teams near the bottom also went on good runs of form at the same time, meaning that all Scarborough could do was not get cut adrift at the bottom. They finally managed to move <b>off</b> <b>bottom</b> place after the penultimate match, but in a dramatic ending to the season, Scarborough were relegated from The Football League due to a goal in the last minute, of the last day of the season by Carlisle United's on-loan goalkeeper Jimmy Glass. The fact that their 48 points was (and remains to this day) the highest for a club finishing bottom of any division was of little comfort to the fans. This was the first relegation in the history of the club, and it would ultimately prove to be the beginning of a downward spiral from which the club would never recover.|$|E

On 12 January 2014, Berardi was the only player in the season to score four goals in a game, as Sassuolo came from 2-0 down to win 4-3 against Milan. Towards the end of January 2014, Sassuolo were in bottom place and so manager Di Francesco was relieved of his duties and Alberto Malesani was brought in. The managerial change did not have the desired effects and so in early March, Sassuolo re-entrust the side to the management of Di Francesco. Sassuolo won its away match against Fiorentina 4-3 on 6 May 2014, and after winning 4-2 against Genoa on 11 May, Sassuolo guaranteed its place in Serie A for the 2014-15 season. Berardi finished in equal 7th place in the Serie A top scorers list, with 16 goals for the season.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the factors}} that define the success of seaweed is the {{planting}} methods It self. It is important because the method will directly affect the seaweed production. The main problem faced by seaweed farmer is declining the production over years. There are several reasons causing that problem, including, predator, desease and environment degradation. The purpose of this research is investigating the effectiveness of two different seaweed planting methods with the respect to the seaweed growth rate. The two methods that mentioned previously are <b>off</b> <b>bottom</b> and <b>off</b> <b>bottom</b> bracket method. The two methods are basically simillar, the first method (<b>off</b> <b>bottom)</b> is a conventional method, on the other hand, the second method was given an additional nets in order to cover the <b>off</b> <b>bottom</b> construction. The space between each seaweed planting on two different methods are defined similar, which are 25 cm. The initial planting weight was measured 100 grams. Observation was done for 42 days (6 week) and data collection was performed every 7 days on total of 10 individual seaweed each treatment. Absolute weight, daily growth rate, daily growth and specific growth rate are calculated. The data analysis will be done using F test at ? = 0. 05 (SPSS 12. 0). The result found that the growth rate of seaweed (Eucheuma cottoni) under <b>off</b> <b>bottom</b> bracket was not significantly different compared to the <b>off</b> <b>bottom</b> method (?= 0. 476) ...|$|E

Data were analyzed by using Cohran test to see homogeneity. The homogeneity data were then analyzed by using t-test to see the different between two treatments. The result of the research has shown that seaweed growth was highest in <b>off</b> <b>bottom</b> methods which average weight on the seventh week reached 690 gram.

Average daily biomass ranged from 3. 1 to 21. 4 mg C m 23 and differed by both height <b>off</b> the <b>bottom</b> and by time of day. While copepods were the numerically dominant organisms, their contribution to biomass was only 35 % of the total zooplankton biomass.
