At Peter's funeral, actress Blair Brown wanted her character Nina Sharp to wear sunglasses, because she thought Nina would not share her emotions at the funeral. Unlike Noble, Brown wore a wig.

5|$|Little {{literary}} evidence survives of {{the activities}} of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lake</b> that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians.|$|E

25|$|Holle assumes {{control of}} the ship and executes the head mutineer, but keeps Wilson alive because she needs his {{piloting}} skills to land on Earth III, a cold tidally locked planet with dense air, a dynamic atmosphere and a red dwarf sun that fortunately appears a familiar white to the human eye. Since the remaining shuttle cannot seat all the passengers, Holle encourages the passengers to reproduce copiously: since children weigh little, many will fit on the shuttle, thus increasing genetic diversity. She sends three adults to accompany them: Wilson, Helen Gray and the Illegal Jeb. Helen and Jeb, whose children are not allowed on the shuttle due to genetic proximity, resentfully board. Wilson sets them down safely <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lake</b> and they prepare to settle on their new world. The remaining crew on the Ark plan to conduct a survey of the planetary system and beyond until they die.|$|E

25|$|Fulani {{innovations}} in infantry tactics. The cavalrymen of Gobir, under their leader Yunfa, initially mocked {{the inability of}} the Fulani to use horses effectively, but the Fulani replied with their own trump card, massed arrow fire, at the Battle of Tabkin Kwotto. Ordinarily, such fire would have been delivered by scattered bowmen in loose formation, vulnerable to quick charges by the Gobir chevaliers. In this particular battle however, the Fulani anchored their formation in a fairly wooded area, with one flank of their army resting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lake.</b> Although the cavalry of Gobir outflanked their opponents, the center of the Fulani formation held this strong position. Rather than deploy in the usual open skirmishing order, the Fulani bowmen adopted a square, grouping their archers in a compact block, and concentrating the firepower of their poisoned arrows. This broke the back of the Gobir formations, despite their armor.|$|E
