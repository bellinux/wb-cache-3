5|$|Hügel-Marshall {{continued}} {{to study and}} achieved a license in child education and welfare. She then found work in a children's home in Frankfurt am Main, where she worked for twelve years. The home {{reminded her of the}} degrading orphanage she had been sent to and seemed more like a detention center than a school. Working with the <b>other</b> <b>teachers,</b> and over the opposition of the school's management, she was able to make substantial changes and to modernize it during her time there. While working there, she completed a degree in social work and pedagogy.|$|E
5|$|Wealth is {{interpreted}} in prosperity theology as a blessing from God, obtained through a spiritual law of positive confession, visualization, and donations. This process is often taught in almost mechanical terms; Kenneth Copeland, an American author and televangelist, argues that prosperity {{is governed by}} laws, while <b>other</b> <b>teachers</b> portray the process formulaically. Journalists David van Biema and Jeff Chu of Time have described Word of Faith pastor Creflo Dollar's teachings about prosperity as an inviolable contract between God and humanity.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Japanese {{publications}} {{have emerged}} {{in an attempt to}} standardize taiko performance. The Nippon Taiko Foundation was formed in 1979; its primary goals were to foster good relations among taiko groups in Japan and to both publicize and teach how to perform taiko. Daihachi Oguchi, the leader of the Foundation, wrote Japan Taiko with <b>other</b> <b>teachers</b> in 1994 out of concern that correct form in performance would degrade over time. The instructional publication described the different drums used in kumi-daiko performance, methods of gripping, correct form, and suggestions on instrumentation. The book also contains practice exercises and transcribed pieces from Oguchi's group, Osuwa Daiko. While there were similar textbooks published before 1994, this publication had much more visibility due to the Foundation's scope.|$|E

5|$|Pastor H.J. Pedersen, {{like most}} early pastors in the synod, had {{received}} his training in a folk school, {{and he was}} convinced that the success of the new congregation and colony depended on the establishment of such a Danish-speaking folk school. Danebod Folk School opened December1, 1888, with Pedersen as president. <b>Other</b> <b>teachers</b> were Carl Hansen and Christian Hansen. Among the first students were Niels Petersen and Kristian Klink, both Danish immigrants. Klink was a stonemason educated in Denmark, and he helped pastor Pedersen in building the Stone Hall. It was built of native rock. Farmers hauled rocks from the shores of Swan Lake just south of Danebod, and Klink and his helpers split and shaped the rocks. The Stone Hall was finished in the fall of 1889, and the first public gathering in the Stone Hall was at Klink's funeral in November 1889. The Stone Hall quickly became the center of the new colony, and Sunday services were conducted here, as well as numerous weddings, baptisms and funerals. The students at the Danebod Folk School used the building as a gym hall, and young people would meet here to socialize, meet up with friends, and participate in singing games. Three years later, the Stone Hall was now too small for worship services. It was decided to build a new church, and the Cross Church at Danebod was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examines whether teacher licensure {{test scores}} and <b>other</b> <b>teacher</b> qualifications affect high school student achievement. The results are based on longitudinal student-level data from Los Angeles. The achievement analysis uses a value-added approach that adjusts for both student and teacher fixed effects. The results show little relationship between traditional measures of teacher quality (e. g., experience and education level) and student achievement in English Language Arts (ELA) or math. Similarly, teacher aptitude and subject-matter knowledge, as measured on state licensure tests, have no significant effects on student achievement. Achievement outcomes differ substantially from teacher to teacher, however, {{and the effects of}} a good ELA or math teacher spillover from one subject to the <b>other.</b> <b>Teacher</b> quality, teacher licensure, student achievement, high school, two-level fixed effects, education production function...|$|R

There were, however, compensatory interests even then. He continued to take private lessons in composition from Salieri, who gave Schubert more actual technical training {{than any of his}} <b>other</b> <b>teachers,</b> before they parted ways in 1817.|$|E
25|$|The Purana {{presents}} seven {{teachers and}} their hagiographic stories, describing for example Kapila, the Samkhya philosopher, as someone who was born as a full grown adult, who teaches his mother {{that in order to}} reach liberation, she must have bhakti, jnana (wisdom), and vairagya (dispassion), with bhakti being the most important. <b>Other</b> <b>teachers</b> such as Narada and Suka described in the Purana, however, present Bhakti with less prominence, and emphasize Advaita philosophy and Jnana yoga instead but then add that adoring Hari (Krishna) has the same liberating benefits.|$|E

25|$|John Calvin {{produced}} a catechism while at Geneva (1541), which underwent two major revisions (1545 and 1560). Calvin's aim {{in writing the}} catechism of 1545 was to set a basic pattern of doctrine, meant to be imitated by other catechists, which would not affirm local distinctions or dwell on controversial issues, but {{would serve as a}} pattern for what was expected to be taught by Christian fathers and <b>other</b> <b>teachers</b> of children in the church. The catechism is organized on the topics of faith, law, prayer and sacraments.|$|E
