5|$|History <b>of</b> <b>Manchester</b> United F.C.|$|E
5|$|The City <b>of</b> <b>Manchester</b> Stadium in Manchester, England, {{also known}} as the Etihad Stadium for {{sponsorship}} reasons, is the home ground <b>of</b> <b>Manchester</b> City Football Club and with a domestic football capacity of 55,097, the fourth-largest in the Premier League and eighth-largest in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} founded in 2005 by disaffected {{supporters}} <b>of</b> <b>Manchester</b> United. Although fans had various reasons for dissatisfaction, the catalyst for F.C. United's formation was the 12 May 2005 takeover <b>of</b> <b>Manchester</b> United by American businessman Malcolm Glazer. Supporters first considered forming a breakaway club in 1998 during an attempted takeover <b>of</b> <b>Manchester</b> United by BSkyB. The creation of F.C. United {{in the event of}} a Glazer buyout was first proposed in February 2005 by Manchester United fanzine Red Issue.|$|E

Those rebuilding plans were shelved when Victoria University <b>of</b> <b>Manchester</b> and UMIST merged to become the University <b>of</b> <b>Manchester</b> in 2004, leaving the interim centre, which received around 70,000 visitors a year.|$|E
