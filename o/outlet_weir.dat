50|$|Smaller-scale, {{sustainable}} {{agricultural methods}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular throughout Costa Rica. With the country's declaration {{to become the first}} carbon-neutral country by 2021, this is their first step in attaining such a goal. Crop rotation is one of the practices executed by sustainable farmers in Costa Rica. Since many plants are planted together, one major benefit of crop rotation is that each crop has a different harvesting period providing food and income year-round. This method also reduces soil erosion, a major environmental issue in Costa Rica. Instead of using chemicals to prevent pests many of these farmers harvest plants such as lemongrass and citrosa, natural pest repellents. The use of crop rotation, and seasonally changing crops also deters pests that feed on particular individual types crops since that crop is only around {{for a short period of}} time. Companion planting is another method employed by sustainable farmers in Costa Rica. For example, planting mint around vegetables helps deter many pests as the aroma is unappealing to them. Planting rue helps in deterring the Japanese beetle, a major agricultural pest. A newer technology method that sustainable farmers in Costa Rica are beginning to employ is the use of plug-flow anaerobic digesters. These machines are “long, narrow, insulated, and heated tanks made of reinforced concrete, steel or fiberglass with a gas tight cover to capture the biogas. It is loaded with thick manure of 20-30 percent total solids. When the manure reaches the outlet it discharges over an <b>outlet</b> <b>weir</b> arranged to maintain a gas tight atmosphere but still allow the effluent to flow out. Biogas produced by the digester is used to heat the digester to the desired temperature. Excess biogas can be used to run an engine generator. Heat can also be recovered from the engine generator and used for space or floor heating, water heating or steam production to offset the cost of purchased electricity, propane, natural gas or gas oil used on the farm for daily operations”.|$|E

Hydraulic efficiency improves further by the use of inlet deflectors, whose position (distance and submersion) is not very critical provided that die deflectors are effective and divert the incoming jet towards the bottom.

40|$|Outflow {{structures}} for stormwater detention basins can vary widely {{within a single}} watershed. The designs are often left to the whim of the local engineer. Why should there be such differences? This research attempts to discern the performance and efficiency of various typical and atypical weir shapes. To accomplish this task, a scale model of a stormwater detention basin was constructed with removable <b>outlet</b> <b>weirs.</b> The physical model was calibrated using typical weir structures (e. g. rectangular, V-notch, submerged orifice, etc.) in which accepted numerical models exist to calculate outflow discharge. Empirical stage-discharge relationships were then calculated for the atypical weir structures (e. g. stepped notch, combinations of typical shapes, etc.). The atypical weirs simulated herein represent the range of outlet structure designs located in the Upper Mantua Creek watershed, Gloucester County, New Jersey. This area of New Jersey has experienced large urban growth in the past 40 years, {{and many of the}} existing basins were not designed for the current runoff volumes they experience. Within this 7. 3 square mile watershed, there are currently 61 stormwater basins and more than 50 different outlet structure designs.

40|$|The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) {{model was}} used to assess the {{implications}} of long-term climate trends for the hydroclimatology of the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in the Owyhee Mountains, Idaho of the Intermountain West over a 40 - year period (1967 - 2006). Calibration and validation of the macroscale hydrology model in this highly monitored watershed is key to address the watershed processes that are vulnerable to both natural climate variability and climate change and. The model was calibrated using the streamflow data collected between 1997 and 2006 from the three nested weirs, the Reynolds Mountain East (RME), Tollgate and Outlet. For assessing the performance of the calibrated model, this study used 30 years of streamflow data for the period between 1966 and 1996. This investigation suggested that the model predicted streamflow was best at RME, and inadequate at Outlet. Simulated soil moisture was also verified using the data available from five soil moisture measurement sites. The model was able to capture the seasonal patterns of changes in soil water storage considering the differences in the spatial extent of the observed and predicted soil water storage (point measurements against the spatially averaged values for the HRU) and uncertainty associated with the soil moisture measurements due to instrument effects. Water budget partitioning during a wet (1984) water year and a dry (1987) water year were also analyzed to characterize the differences in hydrologic cycles during the extreme hydrologic conditions. Our analysis showed that in the dry water year, vegetation at the higher elevation were under water stress {{by the end of the}} water year. Contrastingly, in the wet water year only the vegetation at low and mid elevations were under water stress whereas vegetation at the at the higher elevations derived substantial soil moisture for ET processes even towards the end of the growing season. To understand the effect of climate change on the hydrologic cycle, the observed and simulated streamflow were analyzed for trends in Center of Timing (CT). Earlier CT timings for the simulated and observed streamflow at RME weir was obvious thus manifesting global warming signals at the watershed scale level in the Intermountain west region. Observed streamflow at the Tollgate and <b>Outlet</b> <b>weirs,</b> where streamflow is partially affected by the agricultural diversions, showed later CT timings and these results appeared to suggest that climate impact assessment studies need to carefully distinguish the system behavior that is altered by both natural and human-induced changes...|$|R

A 3 D {{two-phase}} flow {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model containing gas mal-distribution is developed in the Eulerian framework to predict the hydraulics of a dividing wall sieve tray.

Using water-air system, simulations of flow patterns and hydraulics of a commercial- scale 1. 2 m diameter sieve tray are carried out using this model to testify its precision. Then, the same simulations of a dividing wall sieve tray with equal diameter are carried out. The results show that there are two backflow regions on a dividing wall tray, one is in the segmental area, and the other is in the region nearby junction of dividing wall and <b>outlet</b> <b>weir.</b> In the segmental area of trays with equal diameter, the area of backflow region of dividing wall trays is basically equal to that of conventional trays...|$|E
40|$|The {{distillation}} point efficiencies for the alcohol-water binary, ternary and quaternary systems were measured using a modified Oldershaw column. This column is expanded above the tray {{to separate the}} newly formed bubbles from the column wall, thus eliminating the surface tension induced wall effects for positive systems and discouraging wetted wall effects. The excessive and recirculating foam and froth found in the conventional Oldershaw column is due to these wall effects and does not represent conditions in large scale distillation. The point efficiencies measured using this column for the system methanol/water were lower than the point efficiencies deduced from the composition profiles across a large and narrow rectangular distillation column using an eddy diffusion model. The narrow rectangular column had a liquid flow path length of about one meter, thus avoiding stagnant zones and flow non-uniformities. The lower efficiencies were due to the shorter contact time between the gas and the liquid. This contact time was increased markedly by fitting an <b>outlet</b> <b>weir</b> to the modified Oldershaw column, thus increasing the tray liquid hold-up and the point efficiencies. These point efficiencies were about 10 per cent lower than those on the large tray at a similar value of the F. Factor. The eddy diffusion model predicted rectangular tray efficiencies about 10 to 20 per cent lower than those measured, when using the improved modified column point efficiencies. Using a suitable model, the improved point efficiencies were scaled-up to the conditions existing on the rectangular tray. This resulted in the large tray values of 2 to 4 per cent lower tray efficiencies than those measured. The surface tension effect on the point efficiencies of the binary systems MeOH/n. PrOH using the original modified Oldershaw column {{in the absence of}} wall effects using the concept of the Marangoni stabilising index. The surface tension of these systems were measured using a glass thermometer. The system MeOH/H 20 had the highest Marangoni index and showed the highest point efficiencies throughout the composition range, with the EtOH/H 2 O/n. PrOH, with low values of the Marangoni index, showed comparable point efficiencies throughout the composition range. These systems demonstrate all the possible types of surface tension behaviour. The effects of the <b>outlet</b> <b>weir</b> height and hole size on the point efficiencies in the rectangular column operating under similar hydrodynamic conditions were also investigated using the system MeOH/H 2 O. There was an increase in point and tray efficiencies on increasing the <b>outlet</b> <b>weir</b> height from 2 mm to 12. 7 mm. There was also small increase in point and tray efficiencies on decreasing the hole size from 6. 4 mm to 1 mm at the expense of higher pressure drops. The point efficiencies of these trays under different hydraulic conditions were in the range 85 to 95 per cent, with subsequent high tray efficiencies. This provides further evidence of the high tray efficiencies available to the design engineer if the detrimental effects of stagnant zones and flow non-uniformities were eliminated. Two highly non-ideal ternary systems and quaternary system were also studied using the original modified Oldershaw and the rectangular columns. Considerable differences between the individual component point efficiencies were observed. These differences are probably caused by the interactive nature of the mass transfer in these systems. These systems also exhibited equal component point efficiencies in parts of the composition range, which illustrates the composition dependency of these systems. The individual component tray efficiencies for these systems were noticeably different, even with equal component point efficiencies operating across the tray. These differences were simulated using the eddy diffusion model, highlighting the effects of limited liquid back mixing on the tray. The composition profile for the system MeOH/EtOH/H 20 were predicted and compared with the measurements across the rectangular column using three methods derived from the original Maxwell and Stephan mass transfer equations. These predictions were in good agreement with the measurements. However, as the comparison is only based on a one meter flow path length, the actual design of distillation column using these methods would be conservative. The prediction of the composition profiles using the point efficiencies from the original version of the modified 0 ldershaw column yielded a similar observation for both the ternaries and the quaternary system. An expanded aluminium tray (Expamet 607 A) was also subject to preliminary efficiency tests in the rectangular column. This material has corrugated angled holes, thus encouraging the liquid flow across the tray by using the vapour momentum. This material showed much lower pressure drops, due to its high open area compared with conventional sieve trays, and discourages weeping and entrainment...|$|E

5000|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is {{a dynamic}} rainfall-runoff-subsurface runoff {{simulation}} model used for single-event to long-term (continuous) simulation of the surface/subsurface hydrology quantity and quality from primarily urban/suburban areas. It can simulate the Rainfall- runoff, runoff, evaporation, infiltration and groundwater connection for roots, streets, grassed areas, rain gardens and ditches and pipes, for example. The hydrology component of SWMM operates on a collection of subcatchment areas divided into impervious and pervious areas with and without depression storage to predict runoff and pollutant loads from precipitation, evaporation and infiltration losses {{from each of the}} subcatchment. Besides, low impact development (LID) and best management practice areas on the subcatchment can be modeled to reduce the impervious and pervious runoff. The routing or hydraulics section of SWMM transports this water and possible associated water quality constituents through a system of closed pipes, open channels, storage/treatment devices, ponds, storages, pumps, orifices, <b>weirs,</b> <b>outlets,</b> outfalls and other regulators. SWMM tracks {{the quantity and quality of}} the flow generated within each subcatchment, and the flow rate, flow depth, and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period composed of multiple fixed or variable time steps.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the nature of liquid flow across industrial sieve trays operating in the spray, mixed, and the emulsified flow regimes. In order to overcome the practical difficulties of removing many samples from a commercial tray, the mass transfer process was investigated in an air water simulator column by heat transfer analogy. The temperature of the warm water was measured by many thermocouples as the water flowed across the single pass 1. 2 m diameter sieve tray. The thermocouples were linked to a mini computer for the storage of the data. The temperature data were then transferred to a main frame computer to generate temperature profiles - analogous to concentration profiles. A comprehensive study of the existing tray efficiency models was carried out using computerised numerical solutions. The calculated results were compared with experimental results published by the Fractionation Research Incorporation (FRl) and the existing models did not show any agreement with the experimental results. Only the Porter and Lockett model showed a reasonable agreement with the experimental results for cenain tray efficiency values. A rectangular active section tray was constructed and tested to establish the channelling effect and the result of its effect on circular tray designs. The developed flow patterns showed predominantly flat profiles and some indication of significant liquid flow through the central region of the tray. This comfirms that the rectangular tray configuration might not be a satisfactory solution for liquid maldistribution on sieve trays. For a typical industrial tray the flow of liquid as it crosses the tray from the inlet to the <b>outlet</b> <b>weir</b> could be affected by the mixing of liquid by the eddy, momentum and the weir shape in the axial or the transverse direction or both. Conventional U-shape profiles were developed when the operating conditions were such that the froth dispersion was in the mixed regime, with good liquid temperature distribution while in the spray regime. For the 12. 5 mm hole diameter tray the constant temperature profiles were found to be in the axial direction while in the spray regime and in the transverse direction for the 4. 5 mm hole tray. It was observed that the extent of the liquid stagnant zones at the sides of the tray depended on the tray hole diameter and was larger for the 4. 5 mm hole tray. The liquid hold-up results show a high liquid hold-up at the areas of the tray with low liquid temperatures, this supports the doubts about the assumptions of constant point efficiency across an operating tray. Liquid flow over the <b>outlet</b> <b>weir</b> showed more liquid flow at the centre of the tray at high liquid loading with low liquid flow {{at both ends of the}} weir. The calculated results of the point and tray efficiency model showed a general increase in the calculated point and tray efficiencies with an increase in the weir loading, as the flow regime changed from the spray to the mixed regime the point and the tray efficiencies increased from approximately 30 to 80 %. Through the mixed flow regime the efficiencies were found to remain fairly constant, and as the operating conditions were changed to maintain an emulsified flow regime there was a decrease in the resulting efficiencies. The results of the estimated coefficient of mixing for the small and large hole diameter trays show that the extent of liquid mixing on an operating tray generally increased with increasing capacity factor, but decreased with increasing weir loads. This demonstrates that above certain weir loads, the effect of eddy diffusion mechanism on the process of liquid mixing on an operating tray to be negligible...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} hydroclimatic {{data set}} is presented for the 2011 water year to improve understanding of hydrologic {{processes in the}} rain–snow transition zone. This type of data set is extremely rare in scientific literature because of {{the quality and quantity}} of soil depth, soil texture, soil moisture, and soil temperature data. Standard meteorological and snow cover data for the entire 2011 water year are included, which include several rain-on-snow (ROS) events. Surface soil textures and soil depths from 57 points are presented as well as soil texture profiles from 14 points. Meteorological data include continuous hourly shielded, unshielded, and wind-corrected precipitation, wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative humidity, dew point temperature, and incoming solar and thermal radiation data. This data is often viewed as "forcing data", and is gap filled and serially complete. Sub-surface data included are hourly soil moisture data from multiple depths from seven soil profiles within the catchment, and soil temperatures from multiple depths from two soil profiles. Hydrologic response data include hourly stream discharge from the catchment <b>outlet</b> <b>weir,</b> continuous snow depths from one location, intermittent snow depths from 5 locations, and snow depth and density data from ten weekly snow surveys. Snow and hydrologic response data are meant to provide data on the catchment hydrologic response to the weather data.

40|$|Compared to {{packings}} trays {{are more}} cost effective column internals because {{they create a}} large interfacial area for mass transfer by {{the interaction of the}} vapour on the liquid. The tray supports a mass of froth or spray which on most trays (including the most widely used sieve trays) is not in any way controlled. The two important results of the gas/liquid interaction are the tray efficiency and the tray throughput or capacity. After many years of practical experience, both may be predicted by empirical correlations, despite the lack of understanding. It is known that the tray efficiency is in part determined by the liquid flow pattern and the throughput by the liquid froth height which in turn depends on the liquid hold-up and vapour velocity. This thesis describes experimental work on sieve trays in an air-water simulator, 2. 44 m in diameter. The liquid flow pattern, for flow rates similar to those used in commercial scale distillation, was observed experimentally by direct observation; by water-cooling, to simulate mass transfer; use of potassium permanganate dye to observe areas of longer residence time; and by height of clear liquid measurements across the tray and in the downcomer using manometers. This work presents experiments designed to evaluate flow control devices proposed to improve the gas liquid interaction and hence improve the tray efficiency and throughput. These are (a) the use of intermediate weirs to redirect liquid to the sides of the tray so as to remove slow moving/stagnant liquid and (b) the use of vapour-directing slots designed to use the vapour to cause liquid to be directed towards the <b>outlet</b> <b>weir</b> thus reducing the liquid hold-up at a given rate i. e. increased throughput. This method also has the advantage of removing slow moving/stagnant liquid. In the experiments using intermediate weirs, which were placed in the centre of the tray. it was found that in general the effect of an intermediate weir depends on the depth of liquid downstream of the weir. If the weir is deeper than the downstream depth it will cause the upstream liquid to be deeper than the downstream liquid. If the weir is not as deep as deep as the downstream depth it may have little or no effect on the upstream depth. An intermediate weir placed at an angle to the direction of flow of liquid increases the liquid towards the sides of the tray without causing an increase in liquid hold-up/ froth height. The maximum proportion of liquid caused to flow sideways by the weir is between 5 % and 10 %. Experimental work using vapour-directing slots on a rectangular sieve tray has shown that the horizontal momentum that is imparted to the liquid is dependent upon the size of the slot. If too much momentum is transferred to the liquid it causes hydraulic jumps to occur {{at the mouth of the}} slot coupled with liquid being entrained, The use of slots also helps to eliminate the hydraulic gradient across sieve trays and provides a more uniform froth height on the tray. By comparing the results obtained of the tray and point efficiencies, it is shown that a slotted tray reduces both values by approximately 10 %. This reduction is due to the fact that with a slotted tray the liquid has a reduced residence time Ion the tray coupled also with the fact that large size bubbles are passing through the slots. The effectiveness of using vapour-directing slots on a full circular tray was investigated by using dye to completely colour the biphase. The removal of the dye by clear liquid entering the tray was monitored using an overhead camera. Results obtained show that the slots are successful in their aim of reducing slow moving liquid from the sides of the tray, The net effect of this is an increase in tray efficiency. Measurements of slot vapour-velocity found it to be approximately equal to the hole velocity...|$|E

O projeto de pesquisa visou estudar condições hidrodinâmicas proporcionadas pela variação da Velocidade Cross-Flow (VCF) e assim verificar a influência na eficiência de uma estação piloto de flotação por ar dissolvido. A VCF é importante parâmetro para concepção de unidades de FAD e é função da vazão de entrada no tanque de flotação e da área entre o nível dá́gua no tanque de flotação e o anteparo que separa a zona de contato da zona de separação. A velocidade {{cross-flow}} constitui um parâmetro de grande importância para projetos de unidades de flotação. Nesta região de transição entre a zona de contato e a zona de separação, ocorre a passagem do conjunto floco/bolha, e turbulência excessiva pode causar o rompimento do conjunto e assim comprometer a eficiência da flotação. Além disso, o padrão de escoamento observado na zona de separação dos flotadores, onde ocorre a separação dos aglomerados f̈locos + bolhas,̈ depende fortemente do valor médio da velocidade cross-flow, conforme comentado por Lundh et al. (2000 e 2002) e por Reali e Patrizzi (2007). Daí a necessidade de se investigar mais profundamente a influência da VCF na eficiência da clarificação por flotação. O projeto de pesquisa foi dividido em duas etapas. Para realização das etapas foi estudado um tipo de água preparada em laboratório, através da adição de substância húmica e caulinita, para obtenção de cor aparente e turbidez, respectivamente. A água estudada possui cor aparente e turbidez moderada (1 mg/L de substância húmica e 8, 5 mg/L de caulinita) resultando em valores de turbidez por volta de 7 NTU e cor aparente por volta de 40 UH. A etapa 1 consistiu na determinação do par, pH de coagulação e dosagem de coagulante (sulfato de alumínio), gradiente médio de floculação e tempo médio de floculação adequado para a água de estudo. Para realização da etapa 1 foi utilizado equipamento de flotação de bancada de regime de batelada (Flotateste), que se encontra nas dependências do Laboratório de Tratamento Avançado e Reuso de Águas - LATAR/SHS/EESC/USP.

Para a água de estudo foram escolhidas duas condições de potencial Zeta, determinados na etapa 1 do projeto de pesquisa. A primeira condição o potencial Zeta permaneceria com valor próximo de 0 mV e na segunda condição o potencial Zeta seria positivo, por volta de + 12 mV. A etapa 2 consistiu em variar a velocidade cross-flow, através da variação da altura do vertedor de saída da água flotada de uma unidade piloto de flotação, de forma a se obter diferentes valores de VCF (mantendo-se constantes os valores de tempo de contato e taxa de aplicação superficial na zona de contato), para dois valores de Taxas de Aplicação Superficial (TAS) (7, 67 m/h e 15 m/h) na zona de separação e os dois valores de potencial Zeta (PZ), e com isto avaliar a sua influencia na eficiência de remoção de sólidos suspensos totais, cor e turbidez da instalação piloto retangular de FAD. The reactor DAF {{should provide}} adequate conditions for {{contact between the}} micro-bubbles and the flakes formed in the pretreatment conditions and also for the aggregate flocs/bubble can be directed {{to the top of}} the reactor, and thus be removed. The research project aimed at studying hydrodynamic conditions provided by the variation of Cross-Flow Velocity (VCF) and thus checks the influence on the efficiency of a pilot plant of dissolved air flotation. The VCF is an important parameter to design units of DAF and is a function of input flow in the flotation tank and the area between the water level in the flotation tank and the bulkhead that separates the contact zone of the zone of separation. The cross-flow velocity is a parameter of great importance to projects of flotation units. In this region of the transition zone between the contact zone and the separation zone, occurs the passage of the aggregate flocs/bubble, and excessive turbulence can cause disruption of the aggregate and thereby harm the flotation efficiency. Moreover, the pattern of flow observed in the flotation separation zone, which occurs the separation of aggregates f̈lakes + bubbles,̈ depends strongly on the average value of cross-flow velocity as described by Lundh et al. (2000 and 2002) and Reali and Patrizzi (2007). Hence the needs to investigate further the influence of VCF on the clarification efficiency by flotation. The research project was divided into two steps. To perform the steps has been studied a type of water prepared in the laboratory, through the addition of humic substances and kaolin, to obtain apparent color and turbidity, respectively. The study water has moderate turbidity and apparent color (1 mg/L of humic substance and 8. 5 mg/L of kaolin) resulting in turbidity values around 7 NTU and color apparent by 40 HU. Step 1 consisted in the determination of the pair, coagulation pH and coagulant dosage (aluminum sulfate), flocculation gradient and time flocculation suitable for the study water. For the implementation of step 1 was used bench batch flotation system equipment (Flotatest), located on the Laboratory for Advanced Treatment and Reuse Water - LATAR / SHS / EESC / USP.
