40|$|Project {{objective}} is to develop and disseminate accurate, objective information on critical wind energy issues impacting market acceptance of hundreds of land-based projects and vast off-shore wind developments proposed in the 6 -state New England region, thereby accelerating the pace of wind installation from today's 140 MW towards the region's 20 % by 2030 goals of 12, 500 MW. Methodology: This objective will be accomplished by accumulating, developing, assembling timely, accurate, objective and detailed information representing the 'state of the knowledge' on critical wind energy issues impacting market acceptance, and widely disseminating such information. The target audience includes state agencies and local governments; utilities and grid operators; wind developers; agricultural and environmental groups and other NGOs; research organizations; host communities and the general public, particularly those in communities with planned or operating wind projects. Information will be disseminated through: (a) a series of topic-specific web conference briefings; (b) a one-day NEWEEP conference, back-to-back with a Utility Wind Interest Group one-day regional conference organized for this project; (c) posting briefing and conference materials on the New England Wind Forum (NEWF) web site and featuring the content on NEWF electronic newsletters distributed to an <b>opt-in</b> <b>list</b> of currently over 5000 individuals; (d) through interaction with and participation in Wind Powering America (WPA) state Wind Working Group meetings and WPA's annual All-States Summit, and (e) through the networks of project collaborators. Sustainable Energy Advantage, LLC (lead) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will staff the project, directed by an independent Steering Committee composed of a collaborative regional and national network of organizations. Major Participants - the Steering Committee: In addition to the applicants, the initial collaborators committing to form a Steering Committee consists of the Massachusetts Renewable Energy Trust; Maine Public Utilities Commission; New Hampshire office of Energy & Planning, the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund;, ISO New England; Utility Wind Interest Group; University of Massachusetts Wind Energy Center; Renewable Energy New England (a new partnership between the renewable energy industry and environmental public interest groups), and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (conditionally). The Steering Committee will: (1) identify and prioritize topics of greatest interest or concern where detailed, objective and accurate information will advance the dialogue in the region; (2) identify critical outreach venues, influencers and experts; (3) direct and coordinate project staff; (4) assist project staff in planning briefings and conferences described below; (5) identify topics needing additional research or technical assistance and (6) identify and recruit additional steering committee members. Impacts/Benefits/Outcomes: By cutting through the clutter of competing and conflicting information on critical issues, this project is intended to encourage the market's acceptance of appropriately-sited wind energy generation...|$|E

5000|$|One {{difficulty}} in implementing <b>opt-in</b> mailing <b>lists</b> {{is that many}} means of gathering user email addresses remain susceptible to forgery. For instance, if a company puts up a Web form to allow users to subscribe to a mailing list about its products, a malicious person can enter other people's email addresses — to harass them, or to make the company appear to be spamming. (To most anti-spammers, if the company sends e-mail to these forgery victims, it is spamming, albeit inadvertently.) ...|$|R

This type of site is usually professionally designed and written to maximize conversions, and is used by e-commerce marketers.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{technology}} has transformed how society communicates. From {{the internet to}} cell phones to iPods and video games, interactive communication has become the norm. At the University of Rhode Island, students adapt quickly to the constantly changing technology. Yet student organizations and the University as a whole have not adapted as quickly to such changes. This {{has led to an}} uninformed and uninterested student body when it comes to programming and events on campus. As students instant message on their laptops and text message on their cell phones (simultaneously, of course), organizations, clubs and athletics struggle to increase attendance at events [...] events that many students have no idea exist. Ultimately, these groups are missing the boat when it comes to communicating electronically with their target audiences. Seeing this problem as an opportunity, I used my education in public relations to create a way for student organizations to spread the word about what’s happening at URI via e-mail. With the creation of a free weekly e-mail listing of campus events, the goal of this project is to offer organizations and departments the opportunity to reach students via e-mail. Beginning with the creation of a website, the project continued with an electronic survey of students. The goal of the survey was {{to gain a better understanding}} of how students might respond to the e-mail listing. The response was overwhelmingly positive and led to the creation, layout and design of RhodyWire. Throughout the semester, a marketing campaign was developed and implemented to create awareness about RhodyWire and to direct students to <b>opt-in</b> for the <b>listing.</b> RhodyWire debuted on April 2 and is sent every Monday to its subscribers. The future of RhodyWire has been discussed and plans have been made for it to continue next year. It is important to continuously promote RhodyWire and to listen to what its readers want. Thus, fliers will be distributed at Freshman Orientation to make incoming freshman aware of RhodyWire. In response to readers’ desires to know about what is happening off campus, guidelines will be set to determine what off campus events are appropriate for RhodyWire. I hope that the groundwork I have laid for RhodyWire will serve as a foundation that will continue to develop once I graduate. In the future, RhodyWire can potentially be the first e-mail that students read every Monday morning...|$|R
