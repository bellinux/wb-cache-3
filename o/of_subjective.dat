5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form <b>of</b> <b>subjective</b> idealism. If this is the case, it {{is subject to the}} traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{methodology}} {{was developed}} {{in the context of a}} wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit. Weber's position was close to historicism, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding <b>of</b> <b>subjective</b> motivations of individuals (social actors). Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances <b>of</b> <b>subjective</b> experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E

5|$|The many {{different}} forms of periodic table have prompted {{the question of whether}} there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table. The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product <b>of</b> <b>subjective</b> human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the {{many different}} forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.|$|E
5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer <b>of</b> <b>subjective</b> understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccording to the {{research}} <b>of</b> the <b>subjective</b> and the objective safety in Highway Safety Manual (HSM), their relationship and the road safety were discussed and improved. In this paper, the contents and the calculation methods <b>of</b> the <b>subjective</b> and the objective safety were determined based on the expressway investigation and collected data. The subjective safety index was established by the combination of RRCV, FT 85 and NASA-TLX, and the objective safety index was composed of road linear, pavement, traffic facilities and natural environment. In {{the end of the}} paper, SOR was supposed as a safety evaluation index, which is the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>subjective</b> safety and the objective one.
