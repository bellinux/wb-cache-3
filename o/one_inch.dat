5|$|Because of {{the quality}} of his {{maritime}} illustrations, Coggins was invited by publisher Doubleday to provide artwork for a children's book about the U.S. Navy; the author being Fletcher Pratt, the well known military historian. Coggins was invited to participate in Pratt's Naval Game, based on a wargame developed by Fred T. Jane involving dozens of tiny wooden ships, built on a scale of <b>one</b> <b>inch</b> to fifty feet. These were spread over the floor of Pratt's apartment and their maneuvers were calculated via a complex mathematical formula. The result of Pratt and Coggins's first collaboration, published in 1941, was Fighting Ships of the U.S. Navy, a volume that described in text and illustrated in full color every class of ship in the Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, but some witnesses said that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy {{moved through the}} pantry facing east. This {{has led to the}} suggestion that a second gunman actually fired the fatal shot, a possibility supported by former Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner for the County of Los Angeles Thomas Noguchi who stated that the fatal shot was behind Kennedy's right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately <b>one</b> <b>inch.</b> Other witnesses, though, said that as Sirhan approached, Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands, facing north and so exposing his right side.|$|E

5|$|In {{the realm}} of cartography, there were further {{advances}} beyond the map-makers of the Han dynasty. When the Tang chancellor Pei Ju (547–627) {{was working for the}} Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a graduated scale in the tradition of Pei Xiu (224–271). The Tang chancellor Xu Jingzong (592–672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658. In the year 785 the Emperor Dezong had the geographer and cartographer Jia Dan (730–805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia. Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1m (30ft) in length and 10m (33ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of <b>one</b> <b>inch</b> equaling one hundred li (Chinese unit of measuring distance). A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li. However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are star charts. Despite this, the earliest extant terrain maps of China come from the ancient State of Qin; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.|$|E
5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only <b>one</b> <b>inch</b> (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The storm's effects {{north of}} Florida were minor. Rainfall {{reached up to}} nine inches (228mm) in extreme eastern South Carolina and four inches (101mm) in eastern North Carolina. Winds reached 50mph (60km/h) with gusts up to 66mph (101km/h) at the Oak Island Coast Guard Station near Cape Fear, North Carolina and 54mph (87km/h) with gusts of 77mph (123km/h) at the {{offshore}} tower at Frying Pan Shoals about forty miles southeast of Cape Fear on June 18 with 70mph winds (110km/h) the next day. A 68foot fishing trawler sunk {{off the coast of}} Cape Fear in North Carolina from the high waves; no one was killed as the sailors were rescued by the United States Coast Guard on June 19. Flooding was reported with tides of two to three feet in the Carolinas. Rainfall from the subtropical storm reached both states, reaching maximum peaks of up to five inches (127mm) on the Georgia coast and seven inches on the Georgia/South Carolina border. Rainfall totaled to about <b>one</b> <b>inch</b> (25mm) on the Virginian coast. A ship encountered winds of a minimum tropical storm with gusts as high as a maximum tropical storm. The ship also encountered a tidal surge of 15 to 20feet.|$|E

The sulphuric acid was strong oil of vitriol; <b>one</b> cubical <b>inch</b> of it was equivalent to 486 grains of marble. The nitric acid was very nearly pure; <b>one</b> cubical <b>inch</b> dissolved 150 grains of marble. The muriatic acid was also nearly pure, and <b>one</b> cubical <b>inch</b> dissolved 108 grains of marble.

Some slices were internally sprayed with nickel paint to meet electromagnetic and radio emissions regulations.|$|R

25|$|The timber {{industry}} was very profitable in the region, {{which has a}} very high occurrence rate of lightning strikes, so a series of lookouts was created to guard against fires. The fireguard consisted of a combination house-office {{as well as a}} nearby barn, both constructed of <b>one</b> <b>inch</b> by twelve inch boards and <b>one</b> <b>inch</b> by four inch battens. With the development of the {{timber industry}} in the area, the station was also used as an office for the Forest Service timber sale administrator, which continued for the next 20-30 years. Over the years, the spring, as well as the meadows surrounding the cabin and barn were used by both cowboys and sheepherders driving their herds through the area. The station fell into disuse in the late 1940s or early 1950s.|$|E
