5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal {{in the belly}} of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E
5|$|For {{security}} reasons, filming {{and photography}} {{were not allowed}} near <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> the United States Bullion Depository.

5|$|Karl von Frisch (1886–1982) {{studied the}} European honey bee, demonstrating that bees can {{recognize}} a desired compass direction {{in three different}} ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> a dark beehive.|$|E

5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E

5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
5|$|Alien: Isolation is a single-player action-adventure {{game with}} heavy {{emphasis}} on stealth and survival horror features. The player controls the protagonist, Amanda Ripley, from a first-person perspective {{to interact with the}} environment. To advance through the game, the player must explore a space station and complete numerous objectives while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating enemies. Objectives range from activating computers to collecting certain items or reaching a specific area in the game. The player has the ability to run, climb ladders, and sneak into vents. The player can also crouch and hide behind objects to break the line of sight with enemies, and covertly peek over or lean around to gain view. The player also has the ability to go under nearby tables <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> lockers to hide from enemies.|$|E
5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E

5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas conductance values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> a mound. Deeming (2006) found a similar result. This seems to contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its eggs in a mound and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at the middle section of the eggs and did {{not take into account}} the fact that the pore density is much lower near the poles. This would lead to an overestimate of the total eggshell porosity and therefore an overstimate of the gas conductance value.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{commissioned}} {{a report from}} Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken {{on the day of}} the murders and later. In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece were found on <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> the silencer.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern of}} the chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E

5|$|Mainly nocturnal, {{the female}} redback {{lives in an}} untidy web in a warm {{sheltered}} location, commonly near <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> human residences. It preys on insects, spiders and small vertebrates that become ensnared in its web. It kills its prey by injecting a complex venom through its two fangs when it bites, before wrapping them in silk and sucking out the liquefied insides. Often, It first squirts its victim with what resembles 'superglue' from its spinnerets, immobilising the prey by sticking the victim's limbs and appendages to its own body. The Redback Spider then trusses the victim with silk. Once its prey is restrained, it is bitten repeatedly on the head, body and leg segments and is then hauled back to the Redback Spider's retreat. Sometimes a potentially dangerous victim can be left to struggle for hours until it is exhausted enough to approach safely. Male spiders and spiderlings often live {{on the periphery of}} the female spiders' web and steal leftovers. Other species of spider and parasitoid wasps prey on this species. The redback is one of few arachnids that usually display sexual cannibalism while mating.|$|E
