30|$|In the {{semantic}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>video,</b> how to extract {{the semantic}} concept of human thinking from video content {{is the focus of}} this research field. Crossing the semantic gap and achieving semantic concept level video retrieval is the most challenging research content in video content research. The most common methods for solving such problems are to construct a semantic index of a specific domain through semantic analysis and semantic extraction <b>of</b> <b>video</b> content. For sports video, it generally has a relatively uniform semantic structure and shooting mode, so there is a certain convenience for the semantic analysis of sports events. Semantic analysis <b>of</b> <b>video</b> data, efficient retrieval <b>of</b> <b>video,</b> sharing <b>of</b> <b>video</b> data resources, and construction <b>of</b> <b>video</b> content analysis and management systems have far-reaching research significance and practical application value.|$|R

Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{had been}} a home for music video pioneers. When the music video cable channel MTV started {{broadcasting}} in 1982, the importance <b>of</b> <b>videos</b> abruptly grew, changing the video from an occasional promotional tool to an indispensable means of reaching an audience. MTV filled its programs with many hard rock and heavy metal videos, but these were too expensive for bands who either had no recording contract or had signed to small, independent labels. Moreover, music videos exalted the visual appeal of a band, an area where some British metal groups were deficient. So the NWOBHM suffered the same decline as other musical phenomena that were based on low-budget productions and an underground following. Many of its leaders, such as Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang, Angel Witch and Samson, were unable {{to follow up on}} their initial success; their attempts to update their look and sound to match new expectations of the wider audience not only failed, but also alienated their original fans.|$|E

5|$|A factory was {{established}} {{soon after the}} fort was constructed and it minted coins that bore the initials TB or DB, indicating Dansborg. The fort acted as the important gateway in the trade route from Europe to Coramandel. Protestant missionaries were sent from Denmark by king Fredric IV, who was also the head of Lutheran Church of Denmark. Two of them, namely, Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Plutschua came to Tranquebar on 9 July 1706, established the Tranquebar Mission, learnt Tamil {{in a few years}} and were the first to translate and print The New Testament of the Bible in Tamil in the printing press inside the fort. The Danish mission was the first Protestant mission in India and from its inception, was staffed by German missionaries trained at Pietist schools and seminary founded by Francke at the end of 17th century. A Tamil-Latin dictionary containing 9000 words was compiled there by a medical missionary named Friedrich Koenig in 1778, whose source letters are stored in the royal archives. The fort is featured in a large number <b>of</b> <b>videos,</b> films and commercials. After India's independence in 1947, the fort was used as an inspection bungalow by the state government till 1978 when the State Department of Archaeology of the Government of Tamil Nadu took over the control of the fort. The fort is now used as a museum, housing a collection of major artifacts of the fort and the Danish empire. The fort {{is one of the most}} visited tourist landmarks in the region.|$|E

Therefore, the system is confronted with the problem <b>of</b> <b>video</b> understanding.
