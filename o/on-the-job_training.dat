Prior to ASCP certification, which came about in 2005, the AAPA had a fellowship status that program trained pathologists' assistants or <b>on-the-job</b> <b>trained</b> (OJT) pathologists' assistants (who could do specific coursework and 3 years of active employment) could join only based on passing a rigorous exam that parallels the current ASCP certification exam.

25|$|Under the {{educational}} reform tenets, polytechnic colleges were to {{give priority to}} admitting secondary vocational and technical school graduates and providing <b>on-the-job</b> <b>training</b> for qualified workers. Education reformers continued to press for the conversion of about 50 percent of upper secondary education into vocational education, which traditionally had been weak in the rural areas. Regular senior middle schools were to be converted into vocational middle schools, and vocational training classes were to be established in some senior middle schools. Diversion of students from academic to technical education was intended to alleviate skill shortages and to reduce the competition for university enrollment.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyse {{contracts}} which motivate workers {{to invest in}} <b>on-the-job</b> "general" <b>training</b> {{in a context of}} strategic bargaining and labour market imperfections (e. g., turnover, search and switching costs). While the "hold-up" literature mainly restricted attention to investments that benefit only the investor ("self-investments"), worker's "general" human capital is not a self-investment since it increases firm's revenue. For general self-investments Malcomson (1997, 1999) showed that a proper fixed wage contract assures the efficient level by workers. Instead, I show in this paper that for <b>on-the-job</b> general <b>training</b> (cooperative general investments) by workers a fixed wage contract "à la" Malcomson cannot obtain the "first-best" level of investment since the worker does not receive any return when the contract is not renegotiated. Following such a result, I pass to analyse a more complex contract which imposes a (breach) penalty to a party in case of permanent separation. Such a contract can assure the first-best level of general training by worker when marginal increases of worker's outside option and productivity inside the firm produced by the investment are the same and courts are able to enforce every contractual penalties...|$|R

25|$|The {{field of}} {{mechanical}} engineering {{can be thought of}} as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines.

Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or <b>on-the-job</b> <b>training</b> than undergraduate research.
