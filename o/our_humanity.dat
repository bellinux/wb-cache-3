The band explained that it decided on this picture because [...] "Our music represents the more broken and monster-like feelings of <b>our</b> <b>humanity,</b> like the apparition in this picture. It seemed a very fitting cover for our return {{after seven years of}} silence." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{feeling of}} respect for other {{religions}} dictates my opinion about Palestine, our neighbor. That the unhappy Jews come to reside there and behave as good citizens of this country, <b>our</b> <b>humanity</b> rejoices given that they are placed under a Muslim or Christian government mandated by The League of Nations. If they want to constitute a state and claim sovereign rights in this region, I forsee very serious dangers. It is to be feared {{that there will be}} a conflict between them and the other races.|$|E
500|$|The pianist Alfred Brendel opines that [...] "Busoni's piano-playing {{signifies the}} victory of {{reflection}} over bravura" [...] after the more flamboyant era of Liszt. He cites Busoni himself: [...] "Music is so constituted that every context is a new context and {{should be treated as}} an 'exception'. The solution of a problem, once found, cannot be reapplied to a different context. Our art is a theatre of surprise and invention, and of the seemingly unprepared. The spirit of music arises from the depths of <b>our</b> <b>humanity</b> and is returned to the high regions whence it has descended on mankind." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{a recent}} film like Robot Jox (1990) ... revels in {{exploring}} the technical complexities of its central conceit–nations warring vicariously through giant robots piloted by gladiator-type [...] "jockies"–it repeatedly emphasizes {{how much of}} the human has been surrendered to the technological and concludes with its chief antagonists abandoning their mechanical mounts to live in peace. Robot Jox, though, is just one of a great many such films to depict the attractions and promises of science and technology as essentially fictions, dangerous illusions from which we eventually have to pull back as best we can if we are to retain <b>our</b> <b>humanity.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Much of Barrett Browning's work {{carries a}} {{religious}} theme. She had read and studied such works as Milton's Paradise Lost and Dante's Inferno. She says in her writing, [...] "We want {{the sense of}} the saturation of Christ's blood upon the souls of our poets, that it may cry through them in answer to the ceaseless wail of the Sphinx of <b>our</b> <b>humanity,</b> expounding agony into renovation. Something of this has been perceived in art when its glory was at the fullest. Something of a yearning after this may be seen among the Greek Christian poets, something which would have been much with a stronger faculty". She believed that [...] "Christ's religion is essentially poetry — poetry glorified". She explored the religious aspect in many of her poems, especially in her early work, such as the sonnets.|$|E
2500|$|Pope Paul VI {{reaffirmed the}} Church's {{position}} in his 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae (Human Life). In this encyclical, the Pope acknowledges {{the realities of}} modern life, scientific advances, {{as well as the}} questions and challenges these raise. Furthermore, he explains that the purpose of intercourse is both [...] "unitive and procreative", that is to say it strengthens the relationship of the husband and wife as well as offering the chance of creating new life. As such, it is a natural and full expression of <b>our</b> <b>humanity.</b> He writes that contraception [...] "contradicts the will of the Author of life [...] Hence to use this divine gift [...] while depriving it, even if only partially, of its meaning and purpose, is equally repugnant to the nature of man and of woman, and is consequently in opposition to the plan of God and His holy will." ...|$|E

2500|$|Everett Richardson {{was one of}} 235 trawlermen {{from the}} tiny ports of Canso, Mulgrave and Petit de Grat who fought for better pay, safer working conditions, job {{security}} and most of all, {{for the right to}} belong to the union they had chosen, the United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union led by Homer Stevens, a member of the Communist Party of Canada. Their main adversaries were two, huge, foreign-owned fishing companies. The fishermen also faced stiff opposition from what Cameron calls the [...] "cod aristocracy," [...] rich members of the Nova Scotia elite, as well as from leading politicians, judges, government bureaucrats, members of the clergy, the province's main daily newspaper, and the Canadian labour establishment itself. [...] "In the end," [...] Cameron writes, [...] "this is not a story of the fishermen, or even of the labour movement. It is a story about privilege and poverty and injustice in this country, and about the social and political arrangements which cheat and oppress most Canadians, which stunt <b>our</b> <b>humanity</b> and distort our environment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeffrey Lockhart’s father, Ross, is a George Soros-like billionaire {{now in his}} sixties, with {{a younger}} wife, Artis, whose health is failing. Ross is the primary {{investor}} in a deeply remote and secret compound where death is controlled and bodies are preserved until a future moment when medicine and technology can reawaken them. Jeffrey joins Ross and Artis at the compound to say [...] "an uncertain farewell" [...] {{to her as she}} surrenders her body. Ross Lockhart is not driven by the hope for immortality, for power and wealth beyond the grave. He is driven by love for his wife, for Artis, without whom he feels life is not worth living. It is that which compels him to submit to death long before his time. Jeffrey heartily disapproves. He is committed to living, to [...] "the mingled astonishments of our time, here, on earth. [...] "Thus begins an emotionally resonant novel that weighs the darkness of the world—terrorism, floods, fires, famine, death—against the beauty of everyday life; love, awe, [...] "the intimate touch of earth and sun." [...] Brilliantly observed and infused with humor, Don Delillo’s Zero K is an acute observation about the fragility and meaning of life, about embracing our family, this world, our language, and <b>our</b> <b>humanity.</b>|$|E
