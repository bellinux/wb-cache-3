5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted as representative <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> {{necessary for a}} better understanding of theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E

40|$|Distinguishing {{between science}} <b>of</b> <b>religions</b> and {{dialogue}} <b>of</b> <b>religions</b> The purpose <b>of</b> {{this article is}} to consider some {{of the ways in which}} the academic study <b>of</b> <b>religions</b> may be able to assist in the continuing process <b>of</b> dialogue between <b>religions.</b> To do this, it is necessary first to distinguish clearly between the two. The academic, scientific study <b>of</b> <b>religions</b> (science <b>of</b> <b>religions,</b> or Religionswissenschaft 1) is itself a non-religious activity. It is agreed in many quarters, and here, that it should not be confused with theological and dialogical activity which have their own rationale. The dialogue between religions, for its part, certainly is in some sense a religious activity. It involves the presentation and exchange of religious experiences and religious positions. It is possible for such dialogues to take place without reference to the academic, scientific study <b>of</b> <b>religions.</b> Indeed this often happens. Yet it is conceivable that those involved in such dialogues might benefit from the perspectives which this discipline opens up. The present article, based on earlier presentations, makes some suggestions in this direction. ...|$|R
