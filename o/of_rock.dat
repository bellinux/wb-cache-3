40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a tiling method for {{generating}} piles <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> without any computationally demanding physically-based simulation. Previous techniques rely on a periodic tiling <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> and generate unrealistic repetitive patterns. In contrast, our approach relies on a modified corner cube algorithm to generate a set of aperiodic tiles. We generalize the construction method so that the geometry <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> should straddle corner cubes {{with a view to}} avoiding unrealistic gaps in the arrangement <b>of</b> <b>rocks.</b> Moreover, we propose an original technique to control the shape <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> into contact by computing the Voronoï cells using a parameterized anisotropic distance. Our method has been successfully used to generate landscapes and stone huts and walls with thousands <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> piled together...|$|R

5|$|As with {{previous}} {{games in the}} series, Warriors <b>of</b> <b>Rock</b> challenges one to four local or online players to use special instrument controllers based on guitar, bass, drums, and vocals to simulate the playing <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> music, matching notes as they scroll on-screen with specific actions of the controller to score points and successfully complete songs that are available on-disc, through imports of other Guitar Hero games, or purchasable as downloadable content. Players are awarded star ratings based on their performance; in Warriors <b>of</b> <b>Rock,</b> the typical limit of five stars can easily be surpassed through gameplay-changing powers possessed by the eight in-game characters when they are used. Players can opt to play songs on one of six difficulty levels, from Beginner to Expert (Expert+ on drums), that alter the number of notes and scrolling speed.|$|E
50|$|Point <b>of</b> <b>Rocks</b> {{also known}} as Bald Rock, is a hill and a locale in Jeff Davis County, Texas.

The elevation <b>of</b> Point <b>of</b> <b>Rocks</b> Spring, is at 5,469 feet / 1,667 meters, {{at the foot of the}} southeast slope of the Point <b>of</b> <b>Rocks</b> that reaches over 5,920 feet along its crest.|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies on}} the rigid rocking block have {{generated}} a wealth <b>of</b> knowledge about <b>rocking</b> behavior. However, evaluation <b>of</b> more complex <b>rocking</b> systems requires the derivation and solution of complicated equations of motion. This paper investigates {{the possibility of a}} unified description <b>of</b> several <b>rocking</b> systems through investigation <b>of</b> <b>rocking</b> mechanisms which describe the masonry wall and the masonry arch. Effective rocking parameters are derived for each of these structures, and the similarity <b>of</b> the <b>rocking</b> behavior is discussed. The error of the proposed approximation, which defines the limitations for this approach, is quantified for the example structures considered. Where appropriate, a unified description <b>of</b> <b>rocking</b> would allow the use <b>of</b> <b>rocking</b> spectra, which would be useful to readily predict the response of a wide array <b>of</b> <b>rocking</b> structures...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} is {{an important}} property <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> which is considered for energy-efficient building construction.
