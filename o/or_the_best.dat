This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.|$|E

Julius Mode, in storyline terms, follows the {{assumption}} that Soma succumbed to his dark power, and became the new dark lord. A new game can then be started {{from the main menu}} in Julius Mode. In Julius Mode, the playable characters include Julius Belmont, Yoko Belnades, and Alucard. Each character has a weapon and an assortment of abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up. The castle layout and enemies are the same, {{with the exception of the}} final battle, which is against Soma.|$|E

He was arrested in Paddington Station in London on 14 May 1870 while awaiting a delivery of arms.

That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time.

Christian Nutt of GameSpy felt that the strong characters helped support the narrative. IGNs Jeremy Dunham was highly positive about the story {{and the development of}} characters, but noted that some might be dissatisfied with the unresolved story elements held over to later games. Jake Alley of RPGamer called the story [...] "interesting", while Eurogamers Rob Fahey praised the complexity and depth of the narrative.

Although he found the album [...] "solid", Mike Joseph of PopMatters said that [...] "aside from its relatively short running time, it sounds suspiciously under produced". Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone averred that [...] "while the mostly up-tempo disc never lacks for energy, some of the more beat-driven tracks feel harmonically and melodically undercooked, with hooks that don't live up to 'Crazy in Love' <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Destiny's Child hits". Priya Elan of NME cited only [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] and [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] as highlights and criticized that [...] "too many tracks sound like updated versions of former glories", with no song on-par with [...] "Crazy in Love".|$|E
500|$|Governor William A. Stone {{appointed}} a new Capitol Building Commission in 1901. The commission then held another design competition, for Pennsylvania architects only, which prevented Cobb, a Chicagoan, from submitting a design or finishing his capitol. The Building Commission also stipulated that {{parts of the}} unfinished, current capitol were {{to be used in}} the new capitol. The General Assembly had appropriated $4million for the construction of the capitol. It did not limit the total amount to be used in furnishing the building. This caused problems after construction completion of the capitol. The American Institute of Architects was opposed to competition, citing that the terms of the competition were [...] "calculated to only 'encourage favoritism and injustice' and that they in no way obligated the Capitol [...] Commission to select the best design <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> architect". The Institute also advised that no Pennsylvania architects enter the competition; [...] Philadelphia architect Addison Hutton was subsequently expelled from the organization after submitting an entry. Joseph Miller Huston's design was chosen from among nine entries in the competition in January 1902.|$|E

500|$|The Norwegian Nobel Committee {{each year}} awards the Nobel Peace Prize (Norwegian and [...] ) [...] "to {{the person who}} shall have done the most <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> work for {{fraternity}} between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses." [...] It {{is one of the}} five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Norwegian Nobel Committee and awarded by a committee of five people elected by the Parliament of Norway. The first Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 1901 to Frédéric Passy and Henry Dunant; the prize was most recently awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons in 2017. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma, and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, Passy and Dunant shared a Prize of 150,782 Swedish kronor, which was equal to 7,731,004 kronor in 2008. The Peace Prize is presented annually in Oslo, {{in the presence of the}} King of Norway, on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death, and is the only Nobel Prize not presented in Stockholm. Unlike the other prizes, the Peace Prize is occasionally awarded to an organisation (such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, a three-time recipient) rather than an individual.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the end of}} the 16th century Clan Gregor were in {{constant}} disputes and were at times outlawed. In order to strengthen its position the clan proceeded to enter in alliances with clans who were reputed to share a common ancestry. One such alliance was concluded on 6 July 1571 between James Macgregor of that Ilk and Luchlin Mackinnon of Strathardill. Another such alliance was formalised twenty years later while the MacGregors were outlawed, on 27 May 1591 with Clan MacAulay. This formal agreement, known as a Bond of Manrent, was between Aulay MacAulay of Ardincaple and Alasdair MacGregor of Glenstrae. In the bond, Ardincaple acknowledged Glenstrae as his chief, and of being a cadet of the House of MacGregor, and therefore promised to pay the MacGregor chief his calp. The giving of calp, a tribute of cattle <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> eighth of a part of goods to a superior lord or chief, was a significant custom in Gaelic society. The contract between Ardincaple and Glenstrae gave the MacGregors some temporary relief from the Buchanans and Galbraiths. Prior to this contract, Ardincaple {{does not appear to have}} been involved with Clan Gregor in any way. According to Irving, even though the Ardincaple was at feud with the Buchanans it is unclear how such an alliance would benefit his own clan. Irving wrote that Ardincaple must have known that any connection with Clan Gregor [...] "would end (as it actually did) in a manner most disastrous to all connected with the turbulent Macgregors".|$|E
500|$|The Secretary General of Amnesty International, said: [...] "the Chinese {{government}} might see {{this is as}} a victory, but they would be mistaken... Because, while the other chairs in the packed hall {{on the day of}} the awards ceremony will each hold only one person, Liu's empty chair will hold... the thousands of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience [...] victims of prosecution and persecution simply for having the courage to voice their views." [...] On the other hand, in an article appearing in China Daily, David Gosset of the China Europe International Business School said the award was [...] "a sad paradox, a prize without any real winner, which generates mistrust and perplexity when understanding and clarity are most needed". Gosset believed that only citizens were able to define the exact terms and pace of democratisation in their own country, and lamented the [...] "fallacy" [...] of implicitly associating the PRC with German Nazism or South African apartheid, and emphasised that China, a developing country with a per capita GDP of $3,700, could hardly adopt the socio-political standards of the developed world without attenuating its development. He also argued that the choice of Liu was divisive in view of China's memory of Western imperialism, and of Alfred Nobel's dying wish to reward a person [...] "who shall have done the most <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> work for fraternity between nations". Professor Sidney Rittenberg said: [...] "One does not have to approve of Mr Liu's imprisonment in order to disapprove of his choice as a Nobel laureate... Not only have courageous, intelligent individuals like Mr Liu made no tangible contribution to China's advance, not only have their activities and his choice for a Nobel Prize made life more difficult for China's dissidents—but the main point is that his advocacy of a multiparty system for the China of today would almost certainly lead to disaster, if carried out. To wit, Iran after the overthrow of the shah." ...|$|E
