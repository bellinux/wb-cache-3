5|$|Despite the pacts, the Soviet Union's fears continued. In {{a stance}} long held by Russian {{military}} theorists, {{control of the}} Baltic Sea was crucial to the defense <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg,</b> Russia's second-largest city and the Baltic states offered a buffer zone between Russia and Germany. Pursuing this strategy, the Soviet Union initiated the Winter War in Finland after that country rejected a similar Moscow-offered mutual assistance treaty. Stalin was unnerved by German successes in Europe, since they had taken Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg by spring of 1940. According to Nikita Khrushchev, {{after the fall of}} France in May, Joseph Stalin expressed the concern that Adolf Hitler would 'beat our brains in'.|$|E
5|$|The 1946 Florida {{hurricane}} {{also known}} as the 1946 Tampa Bay hurricane was the last hurricane to make direct landfall in the Tampa Bay Area of the U.S. state of Florida to date. Forming on October 5 from the complex interactions of several weather systems over the southern Caribbean Sea, the storm rapidly strengthened before striking western Cuba. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, it peaked with winds corresponding to Category 2 status on the modern-day SaffirSimpson Hurricane Scale; however, it quickly weakened before approaching Florida. It made landfall south <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> and continued to weaken as it proceeded inland. Its remnants persisted for several days longer.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, {{with the}} era of the romantic ballet at an end, the {{principal}} personalities of the ballet, such as Perrot, Saint-Léon, Taglioni, and the composer Pugni, joined the Tsar's Imperial Ballet <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg,</b> Russia. Ballet in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted {{until the end of the}} 19th century. Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as Adeline Genée began performing. The theatre's ballet company found a new home at the Old Vic and soon took on the name of the Vic-Wells Ballet. Later, moving primarily to the Sadler's Wells Theatre, the company became known as the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Eventually the troupe began performing at the Royal Opera House and became the Royal Ballet, as it is known today.|$|E

5|$|In May 1890, Maria—who {{retained}} societal {{influence as}} {{the widow of}} a nobleman—persuaded the authorities to allow Lenin to take his exams externally at the University <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Petersburg,</b> where he obtained {{the equivalent of a}} first-class degree with honours. The graduation celebrations were marred when his sister Olga died of typhoid. Lenin remained in Samara for several years, working first as a legal assistant for a regional court and then for a local lawyer. He devoted much time to radical politics, remaining active in Skylarenko's group and formulating ideas about how Marxism applied to Russia. Inspired by Plekhanov's work, Lenin collected data on Russian society, using it to support a Marxist interpretation of societal development and counter the claims of the Narodniks. He wrote a paper on peasant economics; it was rejected by the liberal journal Russian Thought.|$|E
5|$|When Signor Lago, {{formerly}} impresario of the Imperial Opera Company <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg,</b> {{was looking}} for a second conductor to work with Luigi Arditi for a proposed London season, Garcia recommended Wood. The season opened at the newly rebuilt Olympic Theatre in London, in October 1892, with Wood conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. At that time the operatic conductor was not seen as an important figure, but the critics who chose to mention the conducting gave Wood good reviews. The work was not popular with the public, and the season was cut short when Lago absconded, leaving the company unpaid. Before that debacle, Wood had also conducted performances of Maritana and rehearsed Oberon and Der Freischütz. After the collapse of the Olympic opera season, Wood returned once more to his singing tuition. With the exception of a season at the Opera Comique in 1896, Wood's subsequent conducting career was in the concert hall.|$|E
5|$|Although only a {{depression}} at final landfall, this was officially counted as {{a tropical storm}} hit on the United States {{as much of the}} circulation was on land before landfall in the area <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg,</b> Florida. In preparations for Marco, a tropical storm warning was issued for nearly the entire Gulf and Atlantic coast of Florida. In Florida, Marco caused flooding damage to houses and roads, in addition to producing tropical storm force winds across the state. However, Marco is more notable for the impact from the remnants, especially in Georgia and South Carolina, where rainfall from the storm peaked at 19.89in (505mm) near Louisville, Georgia. In combination with the remnants of Hurricane Klaus, Marco caused heavy rainfall in South Carolina, causing a dam to burst, leading to three fatalities. Several more fatalities were caused by the remnants of Marco and Klaus, and the system caused 12 deaths. It also caused $57million (1990USD, $ USD) in damage, most of it from damage or destruction of residences in Georgia.|$|E

5|$|On 25–26 September, Ostfriesland and {{the rest}} of ISquadron {{provided}} support for a sweep out to the Terschelling Bank conducted by the II Führer der Torpedoboote (Leader of Torpedo Boats).

On 28 October the four ships arrived in Putzig Wiek, and from there steamed to Arensburg on the 29th. On 2 November the operation was completed and Ostfriesland and her sisters began the voyage back to the North Sea. In March 1918, Natzmer was replaced as the ship's commander by KzS Hans Herr.

5|$|Ewelina {{had three}} brothers: Adam, Ernest and Henryk, and three sisters: Alina, Karolina (better known as Karolina Sobańska) and Paulina. Hańska was closest {{to her brother}} Henryk, who later became famous {{for his work in}} the genre of Polish folk {{literature}} known as gawęda. They shared a passion for philosophical discussions, especially related to love and religion. Hańska's other brothers, Adam and Ernest, both pursued military careers. Hańska's eldest sister, Karolina, was admired as a child for her beauty, intellect, and musical talent. She later married a man 34 years her senior, a landowner from Podolie named Hieronim Sobański. They separated after two years, and she began a series of passionate affairs with some of her many suitors. These included the Russian general Ivan Ossipovitch Witt, the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, and the Russian writer Alexander Pushkin. The Tsar considered her behavior scandalous and declared her dangerously disloyal. As a result, Hańska and the other Rzewuski women were watched carefully by police when they visited the Russian capital <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Petersburg.</b> Hańska's younger sisters, Alina and Paulina, married early into comfortable upper-class families. Alina married a wealthy landowner from Smilavichy, whose father had gained his fortune by managing property for the Ogiński family. Her nephew Stanisław Moniuszko became a renowned composer. Paulina married a banker from Odessa named Jan Riznič.|$|E

5|$|The {{remainder}} of the game takes place in 1995. Bond visits Monte Carlo to investigate the frigate La Fayette, where he rescues several hostages and plants a tracker bug on the Eurocopter Tiger helicopter before it is stolen by the Janus crime syndicate. Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission he is captured and locked up in the bunker's cells along with Natalya Simonova, who has been betrayed to Janus. The two escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed, on the orders of Ourumov, by the GoldenEye satellite's EMP. Bond next travels to Saint Petersburg, where he arranges with ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky to meet {{the chief of the}} Janus organisation. This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan – his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked. Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the military archives for interrogation. Bond eventually manages to escape the interrogation room, rescue Natalya, and communicate with Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, who has verified Bond's claim of Ourumov's treachery. Natalya is recaptured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase through the streets <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg,</b> eventually reaching an arms depot used by Janus. There Bond destroys its weaponry stores and then hitches a ride on Trevelyan's ex-Soviet missile train, where he kills Ourumov and rescues Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally Xenia Onatopp escape to their secret base in Cuba.|$|E
