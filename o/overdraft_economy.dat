40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{financial}} system is particular importance for conduct of monetary policy. Briefly, Indonesia {{can be characterized as}} a bank-centered ?? <b>overdraft</b> <b>economy</b> ??. The domestic market in securities is not large enough to have great meaning either for the financing of economic activity or for the regulation of the liquidity of economy, in contrast, the deposit banking system is highly responsible for in some of the larger activities. Indonesia is an <b>overdraft</b> <b>economy</b> not only in the sense that bank credit and apparently assured borrowing power (the credit line) are important sources of liquidity for the economic agents, but also in the sense that banks have been almost permanently in debt to the central bank. Theoretically, in this situation, the direct control of credit is the efficient mechanism of the monetary policy. However, in Indonesia, this rule is not applied completely. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the procedures and the degree of efficiencies of the monetary policy in Indonesia during of 1969 until 1993. The debate over wether the monetary authorities should attempt to control money or credit has not been particulary vivid in Indonesia, consequently the control of credit implies the control of money and vice-versa. In practice, the growth of the money supply (M 2) has become a basis of its monetary control, within the target values which are consistent with the ultimate objectives of the economic policy. Several instruments of monetary policy which had been used are as follow. In the first period of Five Year Plan (Repelita), the monetary authorities controlled the money creation of the commercial banks indirectly by using the reserve requirement policy. However, the increase in oil price in 1973 have boosted the reserve money with the resulting increase in the money supply. For that reason, in 1974, the monetary authorities gave up the direct control system by imposing the credit ceiling with detailed sectoral credit allocation, and interest rate control. Then, in the climate of reduced resource availability occasioned the serious decline in oil revenue at the beginning of 1980 ???s, coupled with the threat from the world recession, a financial deregulation has been carried out by the monetary authorities in June of 1983. The main objective of the reformation was to make the financial system more efficient and self reliant in mobilizing and allocating financial resources. According to the new system, the procedures to influence the growth of money and credit will require both controlling the monetary base and the monetary multiplier (the System of Reserve Money Management) with the interest rate as the principal instrument. The test of efficiency of the monetary policy has been measured by the following issues: a close relationships, the predictability and the direction of causality between the policy instruments (operational objective) and the intermediate objective, and also between the intermediate objective and the ultimate policy objectives. A regression analysis has been employed to test the reliability of the relationship between the objectives. To confirm the stability of the forecasting ??quations, a standard test statistics have been employed as the THEIL???s U statistic. The test for the direction of causality was an application of SIMS???S technique for determining the causal ralationship between the objectives. The results indicated that the monetary autorities have no control over the intermediate objective M 2, because the m 2 money multiplier was unpredictable and that changes in the monetary base has been largely determined by the amount of the credit and money created by the banking system. However, the test of efficiency of the monetary control in order to the ultimate objectives demonstrates the results : that variations of the monetary aggregates M 2 and the credit variable have a significant influences on the economic activity (GDP), on the inflation rate and on the distribution of income.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three papers on open economy models in the portfolio balance tradition. The first paper presents a dynamic stock-flow consistent model for three economies with both fixed and floating exchange rates. The model is applied to simulate the impact of internal and external shocks, and short-run and long-run effects {{of changes in the}} U. S. fiscal position on the economies of the three countries [...] -the U. S., China and Euroland. The simulation results show that the compensation principle still holds in an open <b>overdraft</b> <b>economy.</b> The second paper investigates the effect of the diversification of China's foreign reserves using the three-country model. The simulation results show that with the diversification of China's foreign reserves, the euro appreciates against the dollar and the RMB. China and the U. S. can benefit from the diversification, while the Euroland economy slows down. What is interesting is that the model generates some kind of path dependence. How the central bank of China will achieve its target diversification rate has an impact on the steady state values of the model. The third paper examines the portfolio balance model for the determination of the nominal exchange rate of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar using the VAR model. One cointegration equation is found. Through the impulse response and the variance decomposition analyses, we find that the Canadian demand for the US bills and bonds {{play an important role in}} the dynamic changes of the exchange rate. The empirical test results indicate that it is difficult for the reduced form portfolio-balance models to consistently beat the random walk model...|$|E
