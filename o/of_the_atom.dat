5|$|Dalton {{proposed}} that each chemical element {{is composed of}} atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures (chemical compounds). This marked the first truly scientific theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom,</b> since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical fashion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} shown that there is no orbital {{component}} of energy <b>of</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electron in <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> in <b>the</b> mathematical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectra <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> and <b>the</b> ions. Due to this fact, <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbital movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electron in <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> becomes a myth. A new hypothesis describes a precession movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms.</b> Valence electrons precessing on <b>the</b> nuclei <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> joint them into molecules with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> their unlike magnetic poles...|$|R

5|$|Energy and {{momentum}} are conserved {{only on the}} average in interactions between matter and radiation, but not in elementary processes such as absorption and emission.

5|$|Harold Clayton Urey (April 29, 1893 – January 5, 1981) was an American {{physical}} chemist whose pioneering work on isotopes {{earned him the}} Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934 for the discovery of deuterium. He {{played a significant role}} in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> bomb, but may be most prominent for his contribution to theories on the development of organic life from non-living matter.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom.</b> Rutherford compared his findings to one firing a 15-inch shell at a sheet of tissue paper and it coming back to hit the person who fired it.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end mirror <b>of</b> {{a cavity}} in whose standing wave mode pattern <b>atoms</b> are trapped. <b>The</b> <b>atoms</b> and <b>the</b> light field strongly couple {{to each other}} because <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> form a distributed Bragg mirror with a reflectivity that can be fairly high. We analyze how the dipole potential in which <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> move is modified due to this backaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms.</b> We show that <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> can become bistable. These results are of a more general nature and {{can be applied to}} any situation where atoms are trapped in an optical lattice inside a cavity and where <b>the</b> backaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> on <b>the</b> light field cannot be neglected. We analyze <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coupled system in the adiabatic limit where the light field adjusts to <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> and <b>the</b> light field instantaneously and where <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> move much faster than the mirror. We calculate the side band spectrum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light transmitted through the cavity and show that these spectra can be used to detect <b>the</b> coupled motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> and <b>the</b> mirror.

5|$|The model's first hurdle was the Pickering series, lines {{which did}} not fit Balmer's formula. When {{challenged}} on this by Alfred Fowler, Bohr replied that they were caused by ionised helium, helium atoms with only one electron. The Bohr model was found to work for such ions. Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and Hendrik Lorentz, {{did not like the}} trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford, David Hilbert, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Max Born and Arnold Sommerfeld saw it as a breakthrough. The trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments. Today, the Bohr model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> has been superseded, but is still the best known model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom,</b> as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.|$|E
5|$|This {{model was}} able to explain {{observations}} of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron {{is most likely to}} be observed.|$|E
5|$|Thomson {{suggested}} that atoms were divisible, {{and that the}} corpuscles were their building blocks. To explain the overall neutral charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom,</b> he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge; this was the plum pudding model as the electrons were embedded in the positive charge like plums in a plum pudding (although in Thomson's model they were not stationary).|$|E

Each player selects two characters {{to compete in}} a one-on-one battle, attempting to defeat the opposing team. The players are given the ability to switch between their characters at any point during the match. The game also incorporates numerous elements from X-Men: Children <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atom</b> and Marvel Super Heroes.|$|E
5|$|X-Men vs. Street Fighter was {{initially}} released as an arcade game in 1996. The game was later ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and PlayStation in 1998. It established the series' basic gameplay conventions by combining Street Fighter-style combat with tag team features. X-Men vs. Street Fighter also borrowed gameplay concepts from Capcom's previous Marvel-licensed fighting games, X-Men: Children <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atom</b> and Marvel Super Heroes.|$|E
5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom,</b> which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
40|$|We {{observe the}} Balmer-α, -β, and -γ lines of {{hydrogen}} atoms and Q branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fulcher-α band <b>of</b> hydrogen molecules simultaneously with their polarization resolved for large helical device. From the fit including the line splits and the polarization dependences by the Zeeman effect, the emission locations, intensities, and <b>the</b> temperatures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> and molecules are determined. <b>The</b> emission locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen <b>atoms</b> are determined outside but {{close to the}} last closed flux surface (LCFS). The {{results are consistent with}} a previous work (Phys. Plasmas 12, 042501 (2005)). On the other hand, <b>the</b> emission locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecules are determined to be in the divertor legs, which is farer from those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms.</b> <b>The</b> kinetic energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> is 1 [*]∼[*] 20 [*]eV, while <b>the</b> rotational temperature <b>of</b> molecules is ∼ 0. 04 [*]eV.

5|$|Bohr {{developed}} the Bohr model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom,</b> {{in which he}} proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Capcom's {{partnership}} with Marvel Comics began in 1993 {{with the release}} of The Punisher, an arcade beat 'em up based on the comic book series of the same name. Capcom then created their first Marvel-based fighting game, X-Men: Children <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atom,</b> in 1994. Marvel Super Heroes soon followed in 1995. Many of the gameplay mechanics used in the Marvel vs. Capcom series were first developed and refined in these two fighting games, serving as precursors to the series. In 2011, then-current Capcom USA Strategic Marketing Director of Online and Community Seth Killian stated that many fighting game aficionados, including himself, consider them to have laid the foundation for the series.|$|E

5000|$|For a gas at a {{high enough}} temperature, <b>the</b> thermal {{collisions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> will ionize some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms.</b> One or more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrons that are normally bound to <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> in orbits around the atomic nucleus will be ejected from <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> and will form an electron gas that co-exists with <b>the</b> gas <b>of</b> atomic ions and neutral atoms. This state of matter is called a plasma. The Saha equation describes <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> ionization of this plasma as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperature, density, and ionization energies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms.</b> <b>The</b> Saha equation only holds for weakly ionized plasmas for which the Debye length is large.

5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all particles behave {{to an extent}} like waves. In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop a mathematical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> that described the electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles {{is that it is}} mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|Abstract One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amazing {{features}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biomolecules {{is their}} ability to preserve their complex three-dimensional structure in proper environments. This effect can not obtain satisfactory theoretical explanation from a point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantum mechanical models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms.</b> A recent inter-disciplinary study from different fields of physics and chem-istry indicates that the real physical models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> {{are different from the}} planetary atomic models. The difference is not from energetic, but from a structural aspect. Based on a new concept about the vacuum space, a recently developed unified theory called Basic Structures of Matter (BSM) al-lowed unveiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real physical structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> and elementary particles. The obtained physical models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> exhibit <b>the</b> same energetic levels as the quantum me-chanical models, while possessing nuclear structures differ-ent from the nuclei in the planetary atomic models. The derived models with fully identifiable parameters and posi-tions of quantum orbits allow studying the physical condi-tions behind the structural and bond restrictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> connected in molecules. The existing data base about struc-ture and atomic composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organic and biomole-cules provides an opportunity for test and validation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> derived models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms.</b> <b>The</b> presented article includes a brief introduction to the BSM theory and demonstration of a new method for theoretical analysis <b>of</b> biomolecules. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> DNA molecule, leads to formulation of two hy-potheses: for energy storage mechanism in proteins and for DNA involvement in a cell cycle synchronization. <b>The</b> anal-ysis <b>of</b> tRNA molecule leads to formulation of hypothesis about binary decoding mechanism behind <b>the</b> 20 flavours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex aminoacyle-tRNA synthetases- tRNA...|$|R
