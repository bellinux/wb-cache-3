5|$|A 5 hours, 9 {{minutes long}} biographical {{documentary}} film, , made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures the history <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times.</b> Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, {{which won the}} Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader. Gandhi was a central figure in the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values {{as a metaphor for}} the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the fashion}} <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times...</b> for the {{principal}} gentry, lords, courtiers, and men of all professions not merely mechanic, {{to meet in}} Paul's Church by eleven and walk in the middle aisle till twelve, and after dinner from three to six, during which times some discoursed on business, others of news. Now in regard of the universal there happened little that did not first or last arrive here... And those news-mongers, as they called them, did not only take the boldness to weigh the public but most intrinsic actions of the state, which some courtier or other did betray to this society.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ganga {{society in}} many ways {{reflected}} the emerging religious, political and cultural developments <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times.</b> Women became active in local administration because Ganga kings distributed territorial responsibility to their queens such as the feudal queen Parabbaya-arasi of Kundattur and the queens of King Sripurusha, Butuga II and feudal king Permadi. Inheritance of fiscal and administrative responsibility by the son-in-law, the wife or by the daughter is evident. The position of prime minister of King Ereganga II and position of nalgavunda (local landlord) bestowed upon Jakkiabbe, {{the wife of a}} fallen hero are examples. When Jakkiabbe took to asceticism, her daughter inherited the position.|$|E

50|$|Epochs {{are most}} {{commonly}} used for the younger Cenozoic Era, where a greater collection of fossils has been found and paleontologists have more detailed knowledge {{of the events that}} occurred during <b>those</b> <b>times.</b> They are less commonly referred to for the other eras and eons, since less fossil evidence exists that allows us to form a clearer view <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>time</b> periods.|$|R
50|$|Polish dubbing in {{the first}} post-war years {{suffered}} from poor synchronization. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>time</b> often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} 16 head coaches so far for the Islanders franchise. The team's first head coach was Phil Goyette, who coached {{the team for}} part of the 1972–73 season. Al Arbour is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached (1,500) and the most regular-season game wins (740); he is also the franchise's all-time leader for the most playoff games coached (198), and the most playoff-game wins (119). Goyette, Earl Ingarfield, Bill Stewart, Scott Gordon and Jack Capuano are the only coaches who spent their entire careers with the Islanders and have not been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Arbour is the only coach to have been {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is also the only coach to have won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's top coach. The franchise has participated in the Stanley Cup finals five times, coached by Arbour each time; they won Stanley Cup four <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times.</b> Arbour, Terry Simpson, Peter Laviolette, Steve Stirling, Ted Nolan, and Jack Capuano are the only coaches to have coached the team into the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 19 {{managers}} {{in the history of}} the Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. The Mariners franchise was formed in 1977 as a member of the American League. Darrell Johnson was hired as the first Mariners manager, serving for just over three seasons before being replaced during the 1980 season. In terms of tenure, Lou Piniella has managed more games and seasons than any other coach in their franchise history. He managed the Mariners to four playoff berths (1995, 1997, 2000 and 2001), led the team to the American League Championship Series in 1995, 2000 and 2001, and won the Manager of the Year award in 1995 and 2001. Piniella is the only manager in Mariners history to lead a team into the playoffs, with one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> after a 116-win season, tying the record for most wins in a season. None of the previous managers had made it to the playoffs before. Piniella, however, managed the team in 34 playoff games, winning 15, and losing 19. Dick Williams is the only Mariners manager to have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E

In June 2010, illegal immigrants represented 14.8 percent of Arizona state prisoners, but accounted for 7 {{percent of the}} state's overall population according to the Department of Homeland Security. In addition, the data showed that illegal immigrants accounted for 40% of all the prisoners serving time in Arizona state prisons for kidnapping; 24% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> serving <b>time</b> for drug charges; and 13 percent <b>of</b> <b>those</b> serving <b>time</b> for murder.|$|R

25|$|The western portal {{differs from}} other portals <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> by van-shaped door bands, {{decorated}} with a fine floral pattern. The ornamentation of the tympanum consists of large flowers with petals of various shapes in the interlaced branches and oblong leaves.|$|E
25|$|The fauna and flora <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> are richly {{represented}} in the clay pottery and tablets excavated from these sites.

This {{must have been}} the most beautiful building <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>time.</b> All the rooms and main walls of this building were decorated with designs. The central hall measured 18 x 14 and eastern walls were having two tall minarets. On the northern side there were many tanks and fountains which added to the grandeur of this building.|$|R
50|$|Southern Ontario usually {{receives}} {{about a dozen}} tornadoes each year, {{with most}} of them occurring between May and September. April and October tornadoes are much less common, and tornadoes rarely occur outside <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>time</b> frames. This November 9 tornado was the latest one recorded in Ontario since an F2 tornado hit near Exeter on December 12, 1946. The only other tornado {{this late in the}} season occurred near Leamington on November 29, 1919.|$|R

25|$|Jades of the Shang, Zhou, and Han dynasties are {{increasingly}} embellished with animal and other decorative motifs characteristic <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times,</b> and craftsmen developed great skill in detailed small relief work in {{objects such as}} the belt-hooks that became part of elite costume. In later periods ancient jade shapes, shapes derived from bronze sacrificial vessels, and motifs of painting were used, essentially to demonstrate the craftsman's extraordinary technical facility.|$|E

The first type of duty rested mainly in soldiers' hands. The other two were the responsibility of the burghers and (most of) the peasants.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the term}} 'Irani' is first attested during the Mughal era, most Iranis are {{immigrants}} who {{arrived on the}} subcontinent during the 19th and early 20th centuries, that is, when Iran was ruled by the Qajars and when religious persecution of non-Muslims was rampant. The descendants of the immigrants <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> remain culturally and linguistically closer to the Zoroastrians of Iran, in particular to the Zoroastrians of Yazd and Kerman. Consequently, the Dari dialect of the Zoroastrians of those provinces may be heard among the Iranis.|$|E
25|$|The Drużyna of the 12th century {{no longer}} formed {{the nucleus of}} the army. Instead it became the guard of the ruler; some of magnates had drużynas {{comparable}} to that of the Prince. By this time the army consisted of drużyna of the Prince, the detachments of the magnates, and the pospolite ruszenie, whose members came from the former free landowners (now mounted knights), as well as peasant infantry. We know almost nothing about the tactics <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times,</b> or about the human resources.|$|E
25|$|The log-logistic {{has been}} used as a model for the period of time {{beginning}} when some data leaves a software user application in a computer and the response is received by the same application after travelling through and being processed by other computers, applications, and network segments, most or all of them without hard real-time guarantees (for example, when an application is displaying data coming from a remote sensor connected to the Internet). It has been shown to be a more accurate probabilistic model for that than the log-normal distribution or others, as long as abrupt changes of regime in the sequences <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>times</b> are properly detected.|$|E
