40|$|Research of {{bioremediation}} {{of petroleum}} waste by indigenous petrophilic bacteria with biopile techniques at Klamono Area in Papua has been done. Petroleum waste {{is derived from}} various sources, namely tank cleaning, oil spills, <b>oil</b> <b>catcher,</b> leaking pipes, and drilling wastes containing oil residue. Preparation of petroleum waste {{has been done by}} adding wood sawdust as a bulking agent as much as 10 % (w/w), the ratio of C: N: P: K = 100 : 5 : 1; 0. 1 and mixed cultures of indigenous petrophilic bacterial isolated from the sources of the waste that has been collected in a storage-pit that Pseudomonas sp. (PSP 01), Pseudomonas sp. (PSP 05), and Bacillus sp. (PSP 03) with 1 : 1 : 1 ratio of 0. 5 % (v/w). During the bioremediation process was aerated at a rate of 1 liter/jam/m 3. Monitoring process have been done every week by doing the sampling with multiple sampling method to determine the five stations and each station has determined three sampling points, namely the surface, middle and bottom based on the depth, samples have been obtained pooled and analyzed. The results showed that a decline in Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) of 91. 04 % for six weeks. Total bacterial populations during bioremediation processes ranging 103 to 108 CFU/gram of soil. In addition {{at the end of the}} observation showed that the toxic aromatic compounds benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) showed concentrations under the Environmental Quality Standards. Thus, indigenous petrophilic bacteria effective as biological agents in the bioremediation of petroleum waste by biopile method...|$|E
40|$|The {{background}} {{of this research}} is crisis condition that caused by the conflict between PT Pertamina EP Asset 4 Field Cepu with the citizens of Ngelo, Cepu Subdistict, Blora Regency, due to environmental pollution which derived from operation activites in MGS (Main Gathering Station) Menggung. The purpose of the research is to describe how the crisis management pattern was done by public relations PT Pertamina EP Asset 4 Field Cepu to resolve the conflict between the company and citizens of Ngelo, Cepu Subdistrict, blora Regency due to pollution. An effort to solve the problems and research purpose was done by using the theory of Cluster Crisis, Hertfordshire Oil Storage Limited (HOSL) Crisis Management Process, Boundary Spanning and Environmental Scanning Theory, Situational of The Public (STP) Theory, and Image Restoration Theory. This research use case study analysis method. Data analysis unit that investigated in this research is PT Pertamina EP Asset 4 Field Cepu and citizens of Ngelo, Cepu Subdistrict, Blora Regency. The result showed that PT Pertamina EP Asset 4 Field Cepu try to manage the crisis through checks in Main Gathering Station Menggung at an early stage of crisis (pra crisis). Communication built by PT Pertamina EP Asset 4 Field Cepu with the society directly, besides the handling in operational way during the crisis is still continuing by close the <b>oil</b> <b>catcher</b> and made anticipation by raising up the hedge of main gathering station menggung. PT Pertamina EP Asset 4 Field Cepu was also doing corporate social responsibility program (CSR) for Ngelo citizens doing the corporate social responsibility program in some sectors like health, infrastructure, environment, education, economic empowerment, and education during the crisis (on going) crisis management. PT Pertamina EP Asset 4 Field Cepu use strategy corrective action and mortification (acknowledge faults) to rebuild image organization damage caused by crisis will be meetings with Ngelo citizens and dialogue by the mass media. PT Pertamina EP Asset Field Cepu suggested to build a team crisis that consists of of people from related function to coordinate crisis management pattern from the problem that faced...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of the thesis {{contains}} information, policies, regulations and instructions, needed for the dimensioning of precipitation drainage. Following that I focus specifically on Port of Koper, the current state of its drainage systems, the analysis of it and I suggest a possible solution to improve the functionality and safety of the drains into which the gathered rainwater flows. I divided the precipitation drainage into clean drainage systems, which channel the water from roofs directly into the sea or channel, and waste drainage systems, which cover larger paved surfaces and handling areas. Potentially polluted water is routed through overflow structures into retention basins equipped with oil separators, which also allow for the retention of polluted liquids {{in the case of an}} extreme occurrence, like an accident involving an oil truck. The catchment areas and the course of the pipelines are defined. The heights of the outflows of the subsystems are defined according to the terrain and location of the pipes. In the case of precipitation drainage the longitudinal profiles of the longest branches are plotted. Retention basins which also function as <b>oil</b> <b>catchers</b> are dimensioned. In the conclusion I give my findings or rather suggest measures to improve the safety of drains in Port of Koper...|$|R
