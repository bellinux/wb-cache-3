5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} the {{philosophical}} writings <b>of</b> <b>Plato,</b> Xenophon, Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character Diotima in the Symposium on her, while others suggest that Diotima {{was in fact a}} historical figure. According to Charles Kahn, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, Diotima is in many respects Plato's response to Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E
5|$|In {{regard to}} the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen by birth. He was liable to all types of obligations, as one {{can see from the}} {{proposals}} <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> in The Laws: presentation three times monthly at the home of the former master, forbidden to become richer than him, etc. In fact, the status of emancipated slaves was similar to that of metics, the residing foreigners, who were free but did not enjoy a citizen's rights.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{argued that}} {{a balance between the}} spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time <b>of</b> <b>Plato.</b> This balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was {{eventually}} upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.|$|E

5|$|During the Early Middle Ages, Greek {{classical}} {{learning was}} all but lost to the West. However, contact with the Islamic world, where Greek manuscripts were preserved and expanded, soon led to a massive spate of Latin translations in the 12th century. Europeans were re-introduced to the works <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> and Aristotle, {{as well as to}} Islamic thought. Christian thinkers of the scholastic school, in particular Peter Abelard (1079 – 1142) and Thomas Aquinas (1225 – 1274), combined Aristotelian classification with Plato's ideas of the goodness of God, and of all potential life forms being present in a perfect creation, to organize all inanimate, animate, and spiritual beings into a huge interconnected system: the scala naturae, or great chain of being.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} <b>of</b> <b>Plato,</b> {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this {{he concluded that}} Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the epicycle that, in turn, orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the deferent.|$|E

25|$|In the Renaissance {{the philosopher}} Marsilio Ficino {{set up an}} Academy under the {{patronage}} of Cosimo de Medici in Florence, mirroring that <b>of</b> <b>Plato.</b> His work was of great importance in reconciling the philosophy <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> directly with Christianity. One of his most distinguished pupils was Pico della Mirandola, author of An Oration On the Dignity of Man. Our term 'Neo Platonist' has its origins in the Renaissance.|$|E
25|$|Some 250 known manuscripts <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> survive. The texts <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> as {{received}} today apparently represent the complete written philosophical work <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> and are generally good {{by the standards}} of textual criticism. No modern edition <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> in the original Greek represents a single source, but rather it is reconstructed from multiple sources which are compared with each other. These sources are medieval manuscripts written on vellum (mainly from 9th-13th century AD Byzantium), papyri (mainly from late antiquity in Egypt), and from the independent testimonia of other authors who quote various segments of the works (which come from a variety of sources). The text as presented is usually not much different from what appears in the Byzantine manuscripts, and papyri and testimonia just confirm the manuscript tradition. In some editions however the readings in the papyri or testimonia are favoured in some places by the editing critic of the text. Reviewing editions of papyri for the Republic in 1987, Slings suggests that the use of papyri is hampered due to some poor editing practices.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1950s, the Tübingen School <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> {{interpretation}} {{has argued}} that the so-called 'unwritten doctrines' <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> debated by Aristotle and the Early Academy strongly resemble Plotinus's metaphysics. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> would be, at least in this central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the Tübingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.|$|E
25|$|The Neoplatonic {{movement}} (though Plotinus {{would have}} simply referred {{to himself as}} a philosopher <b>of</b> <b>Plato)</b> seems to be motivated by the desire of Plotinus to revive the pagan philosophical tradition. Plotinus was not claiming to innovate with the Enneads, but to clarify aspects of the works <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> that he considered misrepresented or misunderstood. Plotinus does not claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a tradition. Plotinus referred to tradition {{as a way to}} interpret Plato's intentions. Because the teachings <b>of</b> <b>Plato</b> were for members of the academy rather than the general public, it was easy for outsiders to misunderstand Plato's meaning. However, Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as misotheism or dystheism of the creator God as an answer to the problem of evil) as the targets of his criticism.|$|E
