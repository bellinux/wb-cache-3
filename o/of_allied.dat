5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due to the threat <b>of</b> <b>Allied</b> attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar {{played a}} key role. The Ocean Convoy System adopted by Britain {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940 ran on two routes – an east–west route between the UK and North America, and a north–south route between the UK, Gibraltar and Freetown in British-ruled Sierra Leone. Even before the war, Gibraltar had been {{designated}} as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe. From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support <b>of</b> <b>Allied</b> operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region. A huge number <b>of</b> <b>Allied</b> troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|During the occupation, Miri and Lutong {{became a}} {{periodic}} subject <b>of</b> <b>Allied</b> air raids and bombings. Food, clothes, and medicine were scarce.

5|$|Each legion was {{normally}} {{partnered with}} an approximately equal number <b>of</b> <b>allied</b> (non-Roman) auxiliae troops. The addition <b>of</b> <b>allied</b> {{troops to the}} Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the Socii and Latini, who had received Roman citizenship after the Social War. Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as alae, auxiliary light infantry known as cohors auxiliae, or a flexible mixture of the two known as cohors equitata. Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: sagittarii) and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: cataphracti or clibanarii). Infantry could be armed with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, their internal organisation was left to their commanders.|$|E
5|$|Factories, {{ports and}} other {{strategic}} sites {{used by the}} German war effort were frequent targets <b>of</b> <b>Allied</b> bombers from both the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and American United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Many of these were located in towns and cities, and inaccuracy of the bombing resulted in substantial civilian casualties.|$|E

5|$|In April, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto {{used the}} {{additional}} air resources allocated to Rabaul in Operation I-Go, an air offensive designed to redress {{the situation by}} destroying Allied ships and aircraft in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.

5|$|In addition, the {{shortage}} of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon its allies (socii) for the provision <b>of</b> <b>allied</b> troops. Where accepted allies could not provide the required force types, the Romans were not averse during this period to hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinction}} between the heavy infantry types began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment.

5|$|The {{operation}} achieved some {{surprise and}} tactical success, but was ultimately a failure. A great many Allied aircraft were destroyed {{on the ground}} but replaced within a week.

5|$|The {{operation}} did affect German analysis <b>of</b> <b>Allied</b> troop strength. In early 1944 the Allies had 38 {{divisions in}} the region, but the German battle plan identified up to 71. Whether directly related to Zeppelin or not, German forces remained in the Mediterranean throughout May 1944, and so were not available to reinforce Normandy in June.|$|E
