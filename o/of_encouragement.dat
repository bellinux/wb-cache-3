5|$|A pagan {{backlash}} against Christianity followed Æthelberht's death in 616, forcing Justus and Mellitus {{to flee to}} Gaul. The pair probably took refuge with Chlothar, hoping that the Frankish king would intervene and restore them to their sees, and by 617 Justus had been reinstalled in his bishopric by the new king. Mellitus also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow {{him to return to}} London; after Laurence's death, Mellitus became Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Bede, Justus received letters <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> from Pope Boniface V (619–625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters. The historian J. M. Wallace-Hadrill assumes that both letters were general statements <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> to the missionaries.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an empirical study examining the encouragements used by teachers in EFL classes. To find out the actual use <b>of</b> <b>encouragements,</b> the authors first adopted the following two steps : 1) classroom video-observations <b>of</b> verbal <b>encouragements</b> by teachers in schools ranging from elementary to university level; and 2) a questionnaire survey to obtain students' attitudes and preferences toward encouragements. The frequency data shows that elementary school teachers tend to give more encouragements than those at other schools. Also, high school teachers are liable to provide fewer encouragements. Apart from teachers in junior high, teachers in senior high school and university directed more encouragements at individuals than at the whole class. In addition, huge differences between teachers' use and students' preferences <b>of</b> <b>encouragements</b> are found...|$|R
5|$|In 1867, Rubinstein {{handed over}} the {{directorship}} of the Conservatory to Zaremba. Later that year he resigned his conductorship of the Russian Music Society orchestra, {{to be replaced by}} Balakirev. Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> should the Dances not be performed.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{new manager}} Jürgen Klinsmann, who {{replaced}} Rudi Völler, adopted {{the strategy of}} rotating the number one spot between Kahn and his longtime competitor, Jens Lehmann of Arsenal, to stimulate competition between the two. On 7 April 2006, {{after two years of}} dispute for the position Klinsmann announced Lehmann was his first-choice goalkeeper for the 2006 World Cup. Kahn decided to stay on as a backup for the competition; despite their acrimonious pre-tournament battle for Germany’s starting role, Kahn openly accepted Klinsmann’s decision. Kahn and Lehmann embraced and shook hands as the former offered words <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> before the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against Argentina. In the postgame conference, Kahn publicly praised Lehmann for his two decisive penalty saves.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{cynical and}} despairing over his recent break-up with ex-girlfriend Felicia, the normally-grumpy Bolander (Ned Beatty) is unusually cheerful {{as a result}} of his budding romantic relationship with Linda (Julianna Margulies), a much younger (26-year-old) waitress. Nervous about his first real date with her, Bolander asks Howard (Melissa Leo) to go on a double-date with him, along with Howard's boyfriend, prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek). The double date goes well until a lonely Munch crashes, joins the table and ruins the mood of the evening complaining about his romantic woes. Bolander, Munch and Linda leave together and walk to Fort McHenry, where Linda offers Munch words <b>of</b> <b>encouragement.</b> Impressed with her, Munch leaves Linda and Bolander alone, where they happily watch a fireworks show.|$|E

5|$|With export {{interest}} from Brazil, Japan, and Italy {{serving as a}} source <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> to continue development of the Harrier II, McDonnell Douglas commenced work on a night-attack variant in 1985. With the addition of an infrared sensor and cockpit interface enhancements, the 87th production single-seat AV-8B became the first Harrier II to be modified for night attacks, leaving the McDonnell Douglas production line in June 1987. Flight tests proved successful and the night attack capability was validated. The first of 66 AV-8B(NA)s was delivered to the USMC in September 1989. An equivalent version of the AV-8B(NA) also served with the RAF under the designation GR7; earlier GR5 aircraft were subsequently upgraded to GR7 standards.|$|E
5|$|Aerith makes several {{appearances}} in the CGI film , as Cloud's spiritual guide, urging him {{to move on with}} his life and to forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control, telling him that she never blamed him for her death. During their spiritual reunion, Aerith speaks to Cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers, cheerfully and kindheartedly poking fun at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past. However, she also acknowledges his suffering and offers kind words of support. One of Aerith's interactions with Cloud comes when each member of the original game's party helps in Cloud's final attack against Bahamut SIN; she appears as the last party member to assist Cloud. She also appears in the final scene of the movie, along with Zack Fair, where she gives Cloud more words <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> before she and Zack walk into the light. Near the end of the film, it is discovered that water mixed with the Lifestream flows beneath the flowerbed in Aerith's church, which manifests itself as a cure for Geostigma.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true. At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the party. In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words <b>of</b> <b>encouragement.</b> Andy subsequently drives away with a smile on his face.|$|E
