5|$|Pericles and {{his friends}} were never immune from attack, as preeminence in {{democratic}} Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule. Just before the eruption of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles and two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> associates, Phidias and his companion, Aspasia, faced a series of personal and judicial attacks.|$|E

5|$|According to some later accounts, {{before the}} {{eruption}} of the Peloponnesian War (431 BC404 BC), Pericles, some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> associates (including the philosopher Anaxagoras and sculptor Phidias) and Aspasia faced a series of personal and legal attacks. Aspasia, in particular, was reportedly accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. According to Plutarch, she was put on trial for impiety, with the comic poet Hermippus as prosecutor. The historical nature of the accounts about these events is disputed, and apparently no harm came to her as a result.|$|E
5|$|By early 1844, a rift {{developed}} between Smith {{and a half}} dozen <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> associates. Most notably, William Law, Smith's trusted counselor, and Robert Foster, a general of the Nauvoo Legion, disagreed with Smith about how to manage Nauvoo's economy. Both also said that Smith had proposed marriage to their wives. Believing the dissidents were plotting against his life, Smith excommunicated them on April 18, 1844. These dissidents formed a competing church and the following month, at Carthage, the county seat, they procured indictments against Smith for perjury and polygamy.|$|E

5|$|In North Africa, Rommel {{received}} help in cultivating {{his image}} from Alfred Ingemar Berndt, {{a senior official}} at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, who had volunteered for military service. Seconded by Goebbels, Berndt was assigned to Rommel's staff and became one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> aides. Berndt often acted as liaison between Rommel, the Propaganda Ministry and the Führer Headquarters. He directed Rommel's photo shoots and filed radio dispatches describing the battles.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1949, Nixon {{embarked}} on a putatively nonpolitical speaking tour of Northern California, where he was less well known, to see if his candidacy would be well received if he ran. With many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> advisers urging him to do so, Nixon decided in early October to seek the Senate seat. He hired a professional campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, who had helped to run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren and Senator Knowland and had played a limited role in Nixon's first congressional race.|$|E
5|$|Pericles, {{following}} Athenian custom, {{was first}} married to one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> relatives, {{with whom he}} had two sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, but around 445BC, Pericles divorced his wife. He offered her to another husband, with the agreement of her male relatives. The name of his first wife is not known; the only information about her is that she was the wife of Hipponicus, before being married to Pericles, and the mother of Callias from this first marriage.|$|E

5|$|Sa'd al-Dawla {{was the son}} of Sayf al-Dawla, {{the first}} Emir of Aleppo, and Sakhinah, the sister of Sayf al-Dawla's cousin and court poet, Abu Firas. At the time of his father's death, in February 967, he was only fifteen, and resided at the emirate's Jaziran capital, Mayyafariqin. His {{succession}} to the emirate was unopposed, but the state his father had left him was crumbling: the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II had just conquered Cilicia and was raiding its northern and western provinces, while rebellions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> lieutenants had plagued Sayf al-Dawla's last years.|$|E
5|$|Season 5, set 18 months after, {{begins at}} 7:00a.m. Jack is {{believed}} to be dead by everyone except a few <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> friends. He is forced to resurface when some of those friends are murdered and he is framed by terrorists with connections to the American government. The acquisition of nerve gas by the terrorists poses a new threat, and Jack discovers an insidious conspiracy while trying to stop those responsible.|$|E
5|$|This {{ambiguity}} of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, {{and as he}} grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing. Indeed, {{by the age of}} eighteen nearly all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> relatives had died by war or disease. Having spent the greater part of his early life in the twilight of Nero's reign, his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s, culminating with the civil war of 69, which brought his family to power.|$|E

Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, {{but it was not a}} joyful occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before, died in a fiery crash. Rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.|$|E
5|$|Before Massino became boss, John Gotti was one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> allies. Massino {{had backed}} Gotti in his plot {{to take over}} the Gambino family, and as Gambino boss, Gotti tried to get Massino a seat on the Commission as the Bonannos' acting boss. Gotti was {{reportedly}} infuriated that Massino had been officially promoted without him being consulted, and Massino would later testify he believed Gotti conspired with Vitale to kill him. Gotti, however, was marginalized by his 1992 racketeering and murder conviction and consequent life imprisonment. Massino, for his own part, was angered at Gotti's high public profile and later criticized Gotti for killing his predecessor Paul Castellano. Massino also had a poor relationship with Vincent Gigante, who had backed the opposition to Rastelli and blocked Gotti's attempts to bring Massino onto the Commission.|$|E
5|$|Hulagu Khan, a {{grandson}} of Genghis Khan, was an avowed shamanist, but was nevertheless very tolerant of Christianity. His mother Sorghaghtani Beki, his favorite wife Doquz Khatun, and several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> collaborators were Nestorian Christians. One {{of his most}} important generals, Kitbuqa, was a Nestorian Christian of the Naiman tribe. Military collaboration between the Mongols and their Christian vassals became substantial in 1258–1260. Hulagu's army, with the forces of his Christian subjects Bohemond VI of Antioch, Hethum I of Armenia, and the Christian Georgians, effectively destroyed {{two of the most}} powerful Muslim dynasties of the era: the Abbasids in Baghdad and the Ayyubids in Syria.|$|E

5|$|In general polling, Tancredo fared {{far worse}} than in straw polls. Early polls placed the {{candidate}} both {{above and below the}} 1% mark. However, in November 2007 he slightly moved up in polling, reaching the 2% mark and coming out ahead <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> rival, Congressman Duncan Hunter of California. In a November 16 Gallup poll, Tancredo stood in seventh place at 2%, trailing Congressman Ron Paul of Texas by 3%. In a head-to-head matchup done by Rasmussen Reports on August 29, 2007, Tancredo trailed New York Senator Hillary Clinton by 13% finishing with 37% to Clinton's 50%. In a head-to-head matchup with Barack Obama administered on the same day, Tancredo finished with 31% to 48% for Obama.|$|E
5|$|Sayf al-Dawla {{was widely}} celebrated {{for his role}} in the Arab–Byzantine Wars, facing a resurgent Byzantine Empire that in the early 10th century had begun to reconquer Muslim territories. In this {{struggle}} against a much superior enemy, he launched raids deep into Byzantine territory and managed to score a few successes, and generally held the upper hand until 955. After that, the new Byzantine commander, Nikephoros Phokas, and his lieutenants spearheaded an offensive that broke Hamdanid power. The Byzantines annexed Cilicia, and even occupied Aleppo itself briefly in 962. Sayf al-Dawla's final years were marked by military defeats, his own growing disability as a result of disease, and a decline in his authority that led to revolts by some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> lieutenants. He died in early 967, leaving a much weakened realm, which by 969 had lost Antioch and the Syrian littoral to the Byzantines and become a Byzantine tributary.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} dismissal, Wenger {{travelled}} to the United Arab Emirates {{to attend a}} series of conferences held by FIFA. Wenger {{was a member of}} the football governing body's technical committee, responsible for analysing the 1994 World Cup, and made a presentation to coaches of emerging football nations. His speech was closely followed by Japanese delegates, whose country had invested millions into the restructuring of its football league system. Representatives of Toyota, the majority owner of Nagoya Grampus Eight soon met with Wenger and offered him the chance to become the club's manager. Wenger deliberated, even though the idea of working abroad appealed to him; negotiations between the two parties lasted for two months. In that time, he sought the advice <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>closest</b> friends and family, and flew to Japan to watch Nagoya Grampus' striker Gary Lineker make his final appearance before his professional retirement. In December 1994, Wenger agreed to become manager of Nagoya Grampus, on a two-year contract worth ¥75m annually.|$|E
