5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying <b>out</b> <b>different</b> things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E
5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought <b>out</b> <b>different</b> sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, so it would be interesting to see what unfolded between them.|$|E

25|$|In the 2012–13 season, Edgar {{continued}} {{to be in a}} first team regular despite competing threats from new signing Jason Shackell. As a result, Manager Sean Dyche placed him in a midfielder position on several occasions following a midfield crisis.

It wasn’t until on February 9, 2013 when he scored his first Burnley goal, in a 2–1 loss against Bolton Wanderers. His second goal of the season then came on April 20, 2013, in a 1–1 draw against Cardiff City.

25|$|R. romandi, {{along with}} other swarm-founding wasps, can be quite {{aggressive}} during the swarming process. They are aggressive towards humans, non-nestmates, and to each other. Aggressiveness towards humans may result in stings, while aggressiveness towards other wasps involves biting of the body, legs or wings. Workers are more often the aggressors, while queens are more often the victims. In R. romandi, workers do not always act out against non-nestmates. If different colonies of R. romandi are introduced to each other during the absconding process, they will cluster together and relatively little violence is exhibited against non-nestmate queens at this stage. If a queen is introduced after new colony formation, however, she will be vigorously attacked. It has been hypothesized that this means that R. romandi workers test <b>out</b> <b>different</b> queens during the absconding process.|$|E

25|$|Jeff Kleiser and Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co.'s {{visual effects}} team of 40 people created {{the look of}} the Stargate. They used self-written image-creation and {{compositing}} software, as well as commercial digital packages to create the Stargate, the morphing helmets worn by Ra and the Horus guards, and the cityscape of Nagada. Footprints in the sand were often digitally removed. The creation of the wormhole, which was fully digital, {{was one of the biggest}} challenges in the making of the film. The ripples had to be digitally composited to appear accurate and realistic. Scanning lasers were lined up parallel to the gate to illustrate the amount of body that passed the surface of the Stargate plane. Afterwards, the parts of the body that had or had not yet gone through the gate (depending of the side of filming) were obliterated with a digital matte - a process that removes unwanted components from an individual frame or sequence of frames. The use of computers generating a big 3D storyboard allowed Emmerich to try <b>out</b> <b>different</b> shooting angles before settling on one angle.|$|E

500|$|The Bomb Squad {{worked out}} an {{elaborate}} method {{that involved the}} members assembling different types of sounds in the studio. They proceeded to reconfigure and recontextualize fragments from various sources into their own compositions. Each member brought a different philosophy to composing music, arranging sounds, and working with technology, while sampled material was taken from singles, LP albums, and radio, among other sources. Hank Shocklee called the group [...] "a production assembly line where each person had their own particular specialty." [...] In his words, he came [...] "from a DJ's perspective. Eric [...] is coming from a musician’s perspective. So together, you know, we started working <b>out</b> <b>different</b> ideas." [...] Sadler advocated a more traditional, structured approach to songwriting, while Shocklee's approach was more experimental. As the main lyricist, Chuck D wanted to recontextualize the sampled material into his lyrics and create a theme for the album.|$|E

500|$|Eukaryotic cells feature {{compartmentalized}} membrane-bound organelles {{that carry}} <b>out</b> <b>different</b> biological functions. The glycerophospholipids {{are the main}} structural component of biological membranes, such as the cellular plasma membrane and the intracellular membranes of organelles; in animal cells, the plasma membrane physically separates the intracellular components from the extracellular environment. The glycerophospholipids are amphipathic molecules (containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions) that contain a glycerol core linked to two fatty acid-derived [...] "tails" [...] by ester linkages and to one [...] "head" [...] group by a phosphate ester linkage. While glycerophospholipids are the major component of biological membranes, other non-glyceride lipid components such as sphingomyelin and sterols (mainly cholesterol in animal cell membranes) are also found in biological membranes. In plants and algae, the galactosyldiacylglycerols, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, which lack a phosphate group, are important components of membranes of chloroplasts and related organelles and are the most abundant lipids in photosynthetic tissues, including those of higher plants, algae and certain bacteria.|$|E

[...] Berridge also claimed the show didn't set out to look for an Asian family, saying: [...] "We wanted a new family as there were various elements missing from the show. I thought we were short on males and needed a surge of testosterone," [...] and said that the characters were formed around the actors: [...] "We didn't set out knowing exactly what we wanted.

Vikram also rejected approaches from television serial producers, citing that working in television would reduce his chances of becoming a mainstream actor. He also refused opportunities to take part in film events as a backing dancer, with actor Sriman revealing that Vikram was [...] "one amongst not many" [...] who was not interested in travelling to Canada to participate in such shows.|$|E

500|$|... "Hit the Lights" [...] {{was based}} on an {{unfinished}} Leather Charm song written by Hetfield and Hugh Tanner. Hetfield had brought the majority of the song to Ulrich, and the two worked <b>out</b> <b>different</b> arrangements. Performed at 160 beats per minute, [...] "Hit the Lights" [...] opens with fade-in distorted guitars and a short shriek by Hetfield. The song is driven by the 16th note repeated main riff and the continuous eighth note snare drum hits. The lyrics celebrate heavy metal itself and are sung with short and high pitched vocals. The song ends with several lengthy guitar solos by Hammett, who performed cleaner and more melodic versions of Mustaine's leads. [...] "The Four Horsemen" [...] is a revamp of the Mustaine-penned [...] "The Mechanix", which originally had lyrics about having sex at a gas station. A modified version of his composition with the original lyrics appeared on Megadeth's debut Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985). Although Mustaine told Metallica not to use any of his music, Hetfield wrote lyrics about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and added a bridge and cleanly picked guitar solo in the middle. Mustaine said the bridge was inspired by the main riff in Lynyrd Skynyrd's [...] "Sweet Home Alabama".|$|E

The group then {{embarked}} on The X Factor Tour in January 2012, while on tour the group met up with Stannard, Powell and Howes to develop songs for their debut album, DNA. The first song they developed was [...] "Change Your Life" [...] based on the group's experience on The X Factor and their fans. It was recorded at the Biffco Studios in Brighton, England. In a January 2012 interview with the Daily Mirror, Perrie Edwards was quoted as saying, [...] "We're going a bit urban, old school with a bit of pop. We wanna bring back old school harmonies. And Jesy beat-boxes and Leigh-Anne raps, so we're trying <b>out</b> <b>different</b> things". It was written as a song with an uplifting message. Jade Thirlwall told Robert Copsey of Digital Spy that the group loved the message of the song and that they were looking forward to releasing it. Serban Ghenea mixed the track at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Tom Coyne was responsible for the song's mastering.|$|E

Kelly stated during an interview that she felt Becky was [...] "punching above her weight" [...] with Jason. Kelly revealed that she felt Steve was the best man for Becky over her previous lover Jason, stating: [...] "Both boys bring <b>out</b> <b>different</b> things in Becky. With Jason, they liked going clubbing, {{and it was no}} strings attached, I think Becky needs more than that, even though she wouldn't admit it. I think, long-term, Steve's better for her." [...] When Gregson was interviewed by entertainment website Digital Spy, he was asked if he thought that his character has had a positive impact on Becky's life. In reply he stated: [...] "I think he's turned it around. She was all over the place getting into trouble all the time but he's made her grow up. And having a little girl there in Amy, that's made her grow a bit, too. She's got responsibilities now. She's besotted with him. She's still a total pisshead, though!" [...] Steve and Becky attempted to marry twice in 2009; their first wedding was given a promotional push from ITV, which aired adverts for the first wedding episodes. Their relationship was featured in a serious of romanctic plots in which ITV dubbed the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] season of the soap, with advertisements airing.|$|E
