40|$|This paper {{examines}} a quasi-sterilisation {{model of}} the Singaporean economy. It has been noted that the MAS has maintained a low and stable growth rate of the monetary base while targeting the exchange rate within a certain range. We argue that the scheme of the Central Provident Fund (CPF) has helped in sterilising {{the effect of the}} flow of foreign exchange {{in the absence of a}} well-developed open market. Using the OLS approach and cointegration methods, we model the implicit CPF-sterilisation mechanism and estimate the <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient</b> that characterises the opposite effects of foreign assets and domestic credit on the monetary base. The regression results show a comparable value of the <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient</b> and support the quasi-sterilisation hypothesis. 1.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is two fold. First, to estimate, using {{structural}} methods, the extent to which capital flows undermined West German monetary policy during the Bretton Woods years 1960 to 1970 and second, to show that earlier reduced form estimates of the capital-account <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient</b> are tainted by simultaneity bias thanks to the Deutsche Bundesbank's systematic policy of sterilization, and so overestimate the true coefficient. The paper distinguishes between the short-run or one-quarter <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the long-run coefficient implied by the full adjustment of all asset markets. An aggregative structural model German financial markets yields short-run coefficients between. 50 and. 65 implying substantial Bundesbank control over the monetary base, at least in the short-run. A formal test for simultaneous-equations bias provides evidence that variations in domestic credit cannot be regarded as exogenous and that equations regressing capital flows on changes in domestic credit and other variables exaggerate the extent of the offset. ...|$|E

This study performed a comprehensive analysis about the impact that pectus excavatum had on scoliosis and elaborated its biomechanical mechanism in pectus excavatum patients with scoliosis. Methods. 37 pectus excavatum patients were selected. According to age, Haller index of pectus excavatum, <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient,</b> vertical position, sternal torsion angle, and asymmetric index, 37 patients were, respectively, divided into 2 compared groups. The result was statistically calculated. Results. The scoliosis incidence and severity did not correlate with Haller index, <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient,</b> vertical position, sternal torsion angle, and asymmetric index of pectus excavatum, and there was no statistical significance between the two compared groups. Conclusions. The incidence and severity of scoliosis in PE patients with scoliosis have nothing to do with the geometric parameters of pectus excavatum but correlate with age. The scoliosis will aggravate with the increase of age. The heart may provide an asymmetric horizontal force to push the spines to the right. The mechanism of how the biomechanical factors exert influences on spines needs to be further investigated to keep the spine stable...|$|E

This paper analyses the impact on household saving behaviour of the substantial rise in compulsory contributions to superannuation funds. Our analysis takes account of other macroeconomic developments {{that are likely to}} have had a strong influence on the household saving rate over this period, especially the financial deregulation of the 1980 s and the unprecedented increase in the value of household wealth in the 1990 s. We first illustrate the effect of superannuation on household saving in a small theoretical model, also taking account of the effect financial deregulation and capital gains might have on saving. In an empirical model of saving motivated by our theoretical analysis, we find evidence that only part of compulsory superannuation contributions has been offset by reductions in other saving, suggesting that – other things being equal – compulsory superannuation has indeed resulted in higher household saving. superannuation; household saving; <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient...</b>|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} a {{modified}} TPC algorithm enabling pixel <b>offset</b> correction <b>coefficients</b> update and removing optics shading effect by the proper usage of temporally averaged IRFPA response determined at closed inner shutter is presented. Since the IRFPA response on infrared radiance {{coming from the}} inner shutter {{does not include the}} impact of camera housing and optics infrared radiance then the direct using of that detector response as the <b>offset</b> correction <b>coefficients</b> can lead to the insufficient NUC results appearing as shading effect on the output image. In the presented correction scheme, the pixel response change determined at the actual operating conditions in relation to the reference ones at closed shutter is used to compensate a pixel offset temporal drift. It will be shown further that the proposed NUC algorithm offers some advantages in signal processing path and hardware implementation.|$|R

In addition, the paper also {{analyzes the}} role of foreign and domestic interest rate differentials in pulling in or pushing out of these foreign exchange flows. We found that the <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient</b> is very small and insignificant (0. 16) implying that changes in credit resulted in very minimal offsetting reserve flows. The study found out that for the sample period, SBP only partially sterilized the inflows with magnitude of coefficient at (0. 50) confirming the stylized facts. Results also indicate that inflows were neither pulled into the country due to high domestic interest rates due to some domestic policy nor they are pushed into Pakistan owing to low interest rates abroad. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} Bank Negara Malaysia’s (BNM) {{monetary policy}} autonomy in 1991 - 2009, {{a period of}} volatile capital flows, during which BNM operated under several exchange regimes: managed floating; fixed exchange rates; and fixed exchange rates with selective capital controls. Using {{a modified version of}} the Brissimis, Gibson and Tsakalotos (2002) model, the paper’s empirical estimates show that the same-period offset coefficients are significantly less than unity under all regimes, indicating that the Malaysian central bank possesses some short-run control over monetary policy (even under fixed exchange rates). Although the long-run <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient</b> continues to be less than unity under managed floating, it is not significantly less than unity under fixed exchange rates. These results show that Malaysia is not exempted from the impossible trinity except in the very short-run. Perhaps one of the reasons Malaysia abandoned its US dollar exchange rate peg on 20 July 2005 to move back to managed floating is to increase its monetary policy independence. One implication of the Malaysian monetary policy experience is that managed floating with active sterilization may be a viable strategy for emerging market economies to deal with volatile capital flows. ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{motivation}} for this thesis {{comes from the}} lack of studies on issues related to central bank’s monetary sterilisation bonds (MSBs). The MSBs have been, in particular, issued in emerging economies to offset the impacts of sterilised FX market interventions. The objectives of this thesis are to examine the impacts of and {{motivation for}} sterilised FX interventions and to explore methodologies to assess the sustainability of MSB-dependent sterilisation policy. Chapter 2 overviews the main theoretical issues and statistical facts related to sterilisations, Chapter 3 and 4 investigate the impacts, profits and motives of sterilised FX interventions in selected countries, focusing on the asymmetric intervention preferences. Chapter 5 compares the degree of sterilisation and de facto capital mobility – focusing on emerging countries under inflation targeting – by estimating sterilisation and <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient</b> with panel data for 30 countries. Chapter 6 proposes several methodologies for assessing the sustainability of MSB-dependent sterilisation policy. We modify theories of fiscal sustainability and then derive central bank's intertemporal budget constraint, which is separated from the central governments. Several sustainability conditions are obtained, based on cointegration relation between total revenues and expenditures or on central bank’s monetary reaction function. Then, the sustainability tests are applied to empirical studies on the Bank of Korea’s sterilisation policy. ...|$|E

One is to estimate <b>offset</b> <b>coefficients</b> and the other is to estimate sterilization coefficients. The estimation results are as follows. Reflecting strict and effective capital controls, the domestic monetary policies were partially offset mainly by short-term capital flows. The Bank of Korea pursued sterilization policies very actively. Particularly, sterilization was more active during the late 1980 s of huge current account surplus than during the early 1990 s of a surge in capital flows. There were over-sterilization during the early 1 980 s when foreign reserves kept dropping, which implied that monetary policies were directed to worsening the balance of payments deficit rather than improving it.

40|$|Abstract: Fractal Image Coder (FIC) {{makes use}} of the {{self-similarity}} inside a natural image to achieve high compression ratio and maintain good image quality. In FIC, {{the most important factor}} affecting the compression ratio and the image quality is the quantization of the contrast scaling and brightness <b>offset</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Most quantization methods treat the two coefficients independently and quantize them separately. However, the two coefficients are highly correlated and scatter around a line. In this paper, a joint coefficient quantization method is proposed that considers the two coefficients together and thereby achieves better compression ratio and image quality. The proposed method is especially effective under parsimonious conditions. For example, using only 3 bits each to represent the contrast and brightness coefficients of Lena, the proposed method yields quality of 27. 04 dB, which is significantly better than 22. 87 dB obtained from the traditional linear quantization msethod...|$|R

This study examines the elasticities, absorption, monetary, capital market and the structural approaches to the balance of payments {{in the context of}} Indonesia's international transactions for 1960 - 1988. The main findings are : The necessary condition of the Marshall-Lerner is not satisfied in the SR, it is fulfilled in the LR but only just ! However, the sufficient condition shows that in the SR, the trade balance ameliorates but deteriorates in the LR, a reverse "J-curve" effect! The "pass-through" equation reveals that exchange rate, import price, money supply and lagged domestic price are significant in explaining domestic price responses. The significance of the pass through coefficient reveals {{that it is difficult to}} sustain price levels due to devaluation; inflationary effects counteract the price advantages following devaluations. The absorption model shows that the magnitude of the coefficient of MPA is relatively high indicating that the economy has been absorbing more than it produces. The reserve model reveals that the assumption of homogeneity in prices cannot be rejected; the restricted specifications are superior to the unrestricted ones. The major prediction of the monetary theory that the <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient</b> should be negative appears to be verified in most cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{retrieval}} (estimation) of {{sea surface}} temperatures (SSTs) from space-based infrared observations is increasingly performed using retrieval coefficients derived from radiative transfer simulations of top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures (BTs). Typically, {{an estimate of}} SST is formed from a weighted combination of BTs at a few wavelengths, plus an offset. This paper addresses two questions about the radiative transfer modeling approach to deriving these weighting and offset coefficients. How precisely specified do the coefficients {{need to be in}} order to obtain the required SST accuracy (e. g., scatter < 0. 3 K in week-average SST, bias < 0. 1 K) ? And how precisely is it actually possible to specify them using current forward models? The conclusions are that weighting coefficients can be obtained with adequate precision, while the <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient</b> will often require an empirical adjustment of the order of a few tenths of a kelvin against validation data. Thus, a rational approach to defining retrieval coefficients is one of radiative transfer modeling followed by offset adjustment. The need for this approach is illustrated from experience in defining SST retrieval schemes for operational meteorological satellites. A strategy is described for obtaining the required offset adjustment, and the paper highlights some of the subtler aspects involved with reference to the example of SST retrievals from the imager on the geostationary satellite GOES- 8...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new coefficient-based {{retrieval}} scheme for estimation of sea surface temperature (SST) from the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) instruments. The new coefficients are banded by total column water vapour (TCWV), obtained from {{numerical weather prediction}} analyses. TCWV banding reduces simulated regional retrieval biases to < 0. 1 K compared to biases 0. 2 K for global coefficients. Further, detailed treatment of the instrumental viewing geometry reduces simulated view-angle related biases from 0. 1 K down to < 0. 005 K for dual-view retrievals using channels at 11 and 12 μm. A novel analysis of trade-offs related to the assumed noise level when defining coefficients is undertaken, and we conclude that adding a small nominal level of noise (0. 01 K) is optimal for our purposes. When applied to ATSR observations, some inter-algorithm biases appear as TCWV-related differences in SSTs estimated from different channel combinations. The final step in coefficient determination is to adjust the <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient</b> in each TCWV band to match results from a reference algorithm. This reference uses the dual-view observations of 3. 7 and 11 μm. The adjustment is independent of in situ measurements, preserving independence of the retrievals. The choice of reference is partly motivated by uncertainty in the calibration of the 12 μm of Advanced ATSR. Lastly, we model the sensitivities of the new retrievals to changes to TCWV and changes in true SST, confirming that dual-view SSTs are most appropriate for climatological application...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to measure the sterilization and <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient</b> and degree of the relation between the Central Bank’s reactions and the macroeconomic variables. Additionally, neutralization coefficient was calculated. Estimations were done on a monthly basis and in two different sub-periods, from 1990 to 1993 and 1995 to 1999. The results showed that in the first period which is the pre-crisis period (1990 - 1993), low degree of sterilization, offset and neutralization coefficients, which suggest that the CBRT implemented a relatively accommodative policy to fiscal policy by expanding domestic credits to finance budget deficit. In contrast, in the second period which is the post-crisis period (1995 - 1999), the CBRT implemented more active policy by sterilizing most of the foreign assets increase and neutralizing the government credits by reducing the banking sector credits which was reflected in the high level of sterilization, offset and neutralization coefficient. In addition, in the second period, the CBRT gave importance to the stability of the markets more evidently by injecting the required liquidity. Finally, the link between high sterilisation and low inflation accepted generally as a rule in the literature were not observed in Turkey since the pricing behaviour changed especially after the 1994 crisis...|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} {{procedure for}} examining {{the effect of}} a new station is as follows. The whole span is 60  days, and the orbits are chopped into 5 -day arcs for the LAGEOS satellites and 3 -day arcs for the other four satellites. Based on a fact that the post-fit residual scatter of LAGEOS data is about half of that of the low-orbit satellites, the LAGEOS normal-point data are assigned a weight double that of the other satellites’ data. On the other hand, all stations’ data are treated equally. In addition to the six orbital elements, five empirical parameters, i.e., one along-track <b>offset</b> <b>coefficient,</b> two along-track once-per-revolution coefficients and two cross-track once-per-revolution coefficients, are estimated per arc. The Earth gravity field coefficients up to degree and order of 4 are estimated as common parameters. A range bias as a constant for the 60 -day span is estimated for each station and for each type of satellite, i.e., LAGEOS- 1 and 2 combined, Ajisai only, LARES only, and Starlette and Stella combined, so that they can absorb station-dependent, satellite-dependent biases primarily caused by target signature effects (Otsubo and Appleby 2003; Otsubo et al. 2015; Kucharski et al. 2015). Earth orientation parameters are also solved for per day. While the positions of all stations are fixed to an a priori set of coordinates, three transformation parameters and a scale parameter of the whole network with respect to the a priori set are solved for in the same batch estimation as other parameters.|$|E

Watersheds range from 32 to 14, 600 km 2 and represent a variety of distinct settings in terms of topography, land cover, and geologic history. Our study rivers exhibited three distinct patterns {{in the relationship between}} discharge and TSS: simple power functions, threshold power functions, and peaked or negative power functions. Differentiating rising and falling limb samples, we generated sediment rating curves (SRC) of form TSS = aQb, Q being normalized discharge. Rating parameters a and b describe the vertical offset and steepness of the relationships. We also used the fitted SRCs to estimate TSS values at low flows and to quantify event-scale hysteresis. In addition to quantifying the watershed-average topographic, climatic/hydrologic, geologic, soil and land cover conditions, we used high-resolution lidar topography data to characterize the near-channel environment upstream of gages. We used Random Forest statistical models to analyze the relationship between basin and channel features and the rating parameters.
