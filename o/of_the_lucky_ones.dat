500|$|The {{character}} {{later became}} the center of disapproval from viewers, who felt Declan was moving on too fast after Bridget's death when he developed feelings for Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). Sorensen then backed the storyline, wanting his character to move on stating: [...] "It's a difficult situation. Declan was truly in love with Bridget. He was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>ones</b> to have found his soul mate early in life, but at the same time, he has to move on and live his life." [...] further adding: [...] "A lot of people do think it's too soon for another relationship. But I can assure you that it's done very tastefully." [...] He then added an explanation to how Declan feels, adding: [...] "He feels as though he's cheated on Bridget and that he hasn't mourned for long {{enough to be able to}} move on without showing proper respect to the love of his life. He's left confused and upset." [...] As scenes from the storyline began to air Brewer made comment on the storyline reassuring viewers adding: [...] "I think they'll be okay with it... I think they'll be accepting. It's done very tastefully and very slowly. The two characters don't rush anything." ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{researchers}} on the 20 th century {{literature and}} art locate Roman Jaworski’s artistic work on <b>the</b> border <b>of</b> grotesque achievements. <b>The</b> author <b>of</b> Historia maniaków, as <b>the</b> only writer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Young Poland, with full awareness created and materialised his own theory of this category. In <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> writers preceding his artistic work {{one can see}} features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grotesque, which was expressed in every epoch. However, it was not enriched before the 20 th century. Even today {{it is difficult to}} define it clearly. <b>The</b> author <b>of</b> Historia maniaków remained for many years in <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future <b>lucky</b> <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> grotesque. Undoubtedly Jaworski did not influence the grotesque in such a radical way as Witkacy, Gombrowicz or Mrożek. However, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pioneering nature <b>of</b> his interest in the grotesque and the full awareness in referring to its attributes, one should acknowledge <b>the</b> author <b>of</b> Hamlet wtórny as <b>the</b> greatest authors <b>of</b> this genre. Roman Jaworski’s novel Wesele hrabiego Orgaza initiated <b>the</b> trend <b>of</b> catastrophic literature which in later years had many followers.

2500|$|It was at {{this time}} that many of the opera houses and even the {{vaudeville}} houses, if they hadn't already burned down, were torn down, abandoned or turned into storage or other space.

[...] William J. Schulte bought the opera house in 1934 and physically [...] "modernized" [...] it into a movie theater. During the early years of cinema, Tibbits sparkled with the flickering lights of silent movies.

[...] Vaudeville struggled to compete. [...] Burlesque brought a racier edge intended to lure audiences.

6000|$|... "Well, my dear," [...] {{continued}} Joe, [...] "the short an' {{the long}} of it is, {{that about the}} year 1588, the Spaniards sent off a huge fleet of big ships to take Great Britain and Ireland by storm--once for all--and have done with it, but Providence had work for Britain to do, and sent a series o' storms that wrecked nearly the whole Spanish fleet on our shores. Many of these vessels had plenty of gold dubloons on board, so when divin' bells and dresses were invented, men began to try their hands at fishin' it up, and, sure enough, {{some of it was}} actually found and brought up-- especially off the shores of the island of Mull, in Scotland. They even went the length of forming companies in this country, and in Holland, for the purpose of recovering treasure from wrecks. Well, ever since then, up to the present time, there have been speculative men among divers, who have kept on tryin' their hands at it. Some have succeeded; others have failed. David Maxwell is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>ones</b> for the most part, and even when luck fails, he never comes by any loss, for he's a hard-workin' man, an' keeps a tight hold of whatever he makes, whether by luck or by labour." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a time he}} {{indulged in}} vague dreams of that kingdom of God on earth of which he {{would be one of}} the makers; it was a dream of a shadowy splendour of cities, of great {{scientific}} achievements, of a universal beauty, of beautiful people living in the light of God, of a splendid adventure, thrusting out at last among the stars. But neither his natural bent nor his mental training inclined him to mechanical or administrative explicitness. Much more was his dream a vision of men inwardly ennobled and united in spirit. He saw history growing reasonable and life visibly noble as mankind realized the divine aim. All the outward peace and order, the joy of physical existence finely conceived, the mounting power and widening aim were but the expression and verification of the growth of God within. Then we would bear children for finer ends than the blood and mud of battlefields. Life would tower up like a great flame. By faith we reached forward to that. The vision grew more splendid as it grew more metaphorical. And the price one paid for that; one gave sham dignities, false honour, a Levitical righteousness, immediate peace, one bartered kings and churches for God.... He looked at the mean, poverty-struck room, he marked the dinginess and tawdriness of its detail and all the sordid evidences of ungracious bargaining and grudging service in its appointments. For all his life now he would have to live in such rooms. He who had been one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>ones....</b> Well, men were living in dug-outs and dying gaily in muddy trenches, they had given limbs and lives, eyes and the joy of movement, prosperity and pride, for a smaller cause and a feebler assurance than this that he had found....|$|E
