Water service to the John W. Lederle Graduate Research Center, Herter, and Tobin Halls as well as the showers at the Boyden Gym were also shut off.

25|$|Brady's first {{witnesses}} {{during the}} trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle {{with a smile on}} his face hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local hospital nurse who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local criminologist who claimed he found Arbuckle's fingerprints smeared with Rappe's blood on room 1219's bathroom door. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, Betty Campbell, however, revealed that Brady threatened to charge her with perjury if she did not testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had cleaned the room before the investigation even took place and did not find any blood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> door. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that the bruises on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening. During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.|$|E

500|$|... "Love Machine" [...] {{was written}} by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Tim Powell, Nick Coler, Lisa Cowling, Myra Boyle, Shawn Lee. They came up {{with some of the}} song's lyrics by singing [...] "nonsense lyrics" [...] over a backing track, which {{eventually}} evolved into real songwords. The instrumentation track was inspired by The Smiths, and created by Powell and Coler. It is a pop rock and teen pop written in C major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 88 beats per minute. The vocal range from the band members spans from F3 to B4. An early demo of [...] "Love Machine" [...] was included on the compilation album , and later on an official Girls Aloud singles boxset; this version was sung by band members Cheryl Cole, Nadine Coyle and Sarah Harding only, and featured radically different lyrics from the released version, even excluding the phrase [...] "Love Machine". One of the song's lyrics, [...] "What will the neighbours say / This time?" [...] inspired the album's title, and it is a reference to Girls Aloud's debut single, where Cole sings, [...] "Neighbours banging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> wall". MusicOMH contributor John Murphy noted the track uses [...] "a guitar line that sounds like it's been nicked from an old rockabilly tune", and compared its composition to other [...] "'80s synth pop songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Creator Shonda Rhimes {{compared}} {{what she}} deemed the two [...] "most iconic {{moments of the}} season", describing how the season begins with Izzie lying in the prom dress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> and ends with Cristina standing motionless in her wedding dress. Cast member Eric Dane described the impact his first scene in the season had on him, stating {{that it was a}} spectacular entrance: [...] "It was a brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. So every time I put it together and let my hands go, it was almost like throwing caution to the wind." [...] Cast member Sara Ramirez noted {{that one of the most}} significant scene in the season was when Izzie and George [...] "have this beautiful moment when neither of them speaks, but they say so much and it was just so rich", describing how their interaction during the scene determined everything that would be developed for their arc later. Betsy Beers, however, noted that the most [...] "powerful" [...] scene in the season saw Cristina Yang and Preston Burke in the on-call room, talking about the future of their relationship: [...] "It's fascinating to see how their entire relationship changes and almost disintegrates in this one exchange". Beers and Rhimes expressed their desire to introduce Patrick Dempsey's passion of car racing in the series, although this ultimately did not occur during the season. [...] "Patrick loved it. He's always driving something new, always trying something out", stated the series creator, regarding Dempsey's response to the storyline.|$|E
500|$|Vedder called [...] "Gonna See My Friend" [...] a [...] "drug song," [...] but {{elaborated}} {{that the}} song is about {{going to see a}} friend to stay off drugs, and he stated that [...] "Got Some" [...] is about a [...] "drug dealer," [...] but added what the drug the dealer is selling is actually a great rock song. [...] "Johnny Guitar", described by Vedder as [...] "almost an Elvis Costello homage", had its lyrics inspired by a collage of album covers that is pasted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> wall of the band's rehearsal space. Vedder noticed the album cover for Johnny [...] "Guitar" [...] Watson's 1979 album, What the Hell Is This?, and imagined a man who becomes attracted to one of the various women on the cover and then wonders why this woman would rather be one of Watson's many girlfriends instead of his only one. Vedder described [...] "Just Breathe" [...] as [...] "as close to a love song as we've ever gotten," [...] and said that the subject of {{the song is}} the happiest times of people's lives when they should just take in the moment and [...] "breathe for a minute." [...] He also said that [...] "Unthought Known" [...] concerns the human psyche, and [...] "Supersonic" [...] is about the love for music. According to Vedder, [...] "Speed of Sound" [...] is a song taken {{from the perspective of a}} man who is still sitting in a bar after everyone else has left, but he added that even though the song is sad it became more [...] "confident" [...] when played with the whole band. He said [...] "Force of Nature" [...] is [...] "about the strength of one person in the relationship, when they can withstand some of the faults in another." [...] "The End" [...] has been described as an [...] "aching love song." ...|$|E

Although originally criticizing the predictability of the event, Dahl noted an [...] "undeniable sense of originality", deeming the episode a portal to the series becoming [...] "a medical chick flick, but a damn good one". Highly praising the [...] "big and attractive" [...] cast, Dahl positively received {{the interaction between the}} characters, noting the [...] "smart" [...] dialogue that helps each character evolve. However, Dahl expressed disappointment in the over emotional scenes, describing them as [...] "off-putting" [...] and [...] "not believable", while comparing them to real life interactions between people who emote in a more sublte manner than displayed on television. [...] "Emotions ran high in the premiere and there was much crying", stated Dahl, but noted that the dialogue, who he had previously been worried would be [...] "too cutesy", was not bothering, and rather realistic, noting how the show is [...] "smartly written". He also described the Pompeo and Heigl's as [...] "worthy of attention". After the episode's broadcast, Robert Rorke of the New York Post deemed Stevens [...] "the heart and soul" [...] of the series, due to the episode mostly focusing on the events that come to define her as a person. Rorke named her the show's heroine, and wrote that [...] "Izzie is a welcome, calming presence, despite the devastation she experienced when she failed to save her patient and fiance Denny Duquette", considering her to have been more prominent than the title character, Grey, whose storyline received negative critiques: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmeas. But lately, she's been a little dopey, with that endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] Abigail Chao of Television Without Pity had a positive outlook on the episode. She praised the storyline of Izzie lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> floor, describing at as [...] "a perfect opportunity for flashbacks", which proved the strong friendship the five interns share. Montgomery's reaction to the discovery of Grey's underwear was deemed by Chao [...] "hilarious", whereas Bailey's interaction with the quarantined patient was described as [...] "touching". [...] "Now it's Meredith's turn to be feckless and indecisive", stated Chao, noting the lack of realism in Grey's love triangle with Shepherd and Dandridge. However, she praised the interaction of the three characters, who she deemed [...] "lovely adolescents".|$|E
