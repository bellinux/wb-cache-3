5|$|Within C.pepo, the pumpkins, the scallops, and {{possibly}} the crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated at different times and places. The domesticated forms of C.pepo have larger fruits than non-domesticated forms and seeds that are bigger but fewer in number. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of C.pepo, botanist Harry Paris suggested that the original wild specimen had a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He suggested that the crookneck, <b>ornamental</b> <b>gourd,</b> and scallop are early variants and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and the pumpkin.|$|E
5000|$|Turban squash, {{also known}} as [...] "Turk's turban" [...] or [...] "French turban" [...] ("Giraumon" [...] in French), {{is a type of}} squash most often used as a winter squash. It is an heirloom, predating 1820. [...] A {{cultivar}} of Cucurbita maxima, it is closely related to the buttercup squash. It is typically 6 pounds when mature. Colors vary, but are often mottled in shades of orange, green, and white. The squash is used as both a vegetable and as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>gourd.</b> [...] Taste is similar to other C. maxima cultivars, though [...] "not as vibrant," [...] "reminiscent to hazelnut," [...] and [...] "coarse, watery and insipid." [...] Known in the nineteenth century as [...] "the most beautiful in color, and the most worthless in quality, of all the varieties of squash;" [...] selective breeding since then may have improved the flavor.|$|E
50|$|Wild C. pepo {{is still}} {{found in the}} same areas as C. fraterna in Mexico. Their {{isozymes}} are very similar. C. pepo has more similarities to C. fraterna {{than it does to}} C. texana, which is also claimed to be an ancestor of C. pepo. All studied C. fraterna alleles are also found in C. pepo. Consequently, C. fraterna is the nearest relative of C. pepo. C. pepo is most likely an early domesticated form of C. fraterna. It crosses well with both C. pepo and C. texana. Unlike most wild Cucurbita species, some fruit specimens of C. fraterna have been found that were not bitter. Its usual habitat is dry upland scrub areas. C. pepo could be a compilospecies of C. fraterna and C. texana, which appear to be two species that were originally separate. Based on genetic allele analysis, two distinct groups occur within C. pepo: pumpkin, calabaza, criolla, and marrow squash are in one; and ornamental gourds, crookneck, acorn, scallop, and a few others in the second one. C. fraterna is genetically closer to the first group and C. texana is genetically closer to the second group. Ornamental gourds found in Texas are called var. texana and those found outside of Texas (Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana) are called var. ozarkana. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of C. pepo, Paris suggested that the original wild specimen was a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He also suggested that the crookneck, <b>ornamental</b> <b>gourd,</b> and scallop are early variants, and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and pumpkin.|$|E

5|$|Cucurbitacin is a plant steroid {{present in}} wild Cucurbita {{and in each}} member of the family Cucurbitaceae. Poisonous to mammals, it is found in {{quantities}} sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild Cucurbita and most <b>ornamental</b> <b>gourds,</b> with the exception of an occasional C.fraterna and C.sororia, bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild Cucurbita; in parts of Mexico the flesh of the fruits is rubbed on a woman's breast to wean children. While the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as a lure in insect traps.|$|R
50|$|The {{debate about}} the {{relationship}} of C. pepo, C. fraterna, and C. texana {{have been going on}} since at least 1857. C. pepo has more similarities to C. fraterna than it does to Cucurbita texana which is also claimed to be an ancestor of C. pepo. Their isozymes are very similar. C. fraterna shares alleles with C. pepo at all 25 studied loci, indicating C. fraterna is C. pepos nearest relative. C. pepo is most likely an early domesticated form of C. fraterna. It crosses well with both C. pepo and C. texana. C. pepo could be a compilospecies of C. fraterna and C. texana, which appear to be two species that were originally separate. Based on genetic allele analysis, there are two distinct groups within C. pepo: pumpkin, calabaza, criolla, and marrow squash are in one, and <b>ornamental</b> <b>gourds,</b> crookneck squash, acorn squash, pattypan squash, and a few others are in the other. C. fraterna is genetically closer to the first group and C. texana is genetically closer to the second group.|$|R
40|$|Spotted {{and striped}} {{cucumber}} beetles not only cause feeding damage in Iowa cucurbit crops, but vector a bacterium that causes bacterial wilt. ‘Turks Turban,’ an <b>ornamental</b> <b>gourd,</b> was used alone and {{in combination with}} carbaryl as a trap crop for these pests in muskmelon. We hypothesized that the beetles would preferentially feed on highly attractive gourd rows interspersed among the melon crop.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{aspects of}} informal learning, evidenced {{in a group}} of women artisans living in the city Santarém / PA, Aritapera region, and how these learning styles and informal knowledge interconnect with the perspective of the Ethnomatematics Program. Their social practices, reflected in their regional craft, show particularities involving the transmission and production of knowledge, organization of communities of pra ctice and evidenced symbolic exchanges during the preparation work of <b>ornamental</b> <b>gourds.</b> Methodological procedures used in this research were organized, according to an ethnographic approach, from observation and inference of construction processes and inc isions record ed on surfaces that create the regional gourds. Research results indicate that the iconography reflected in bowls, indicate motivations especially related with social representations evidenced in the community dynamics and commercial relations involved. Possible social interactions existing in this context thus permeate a permanent flow of diversified multifaceted knowledge exchange. The production and ornamentation of gourds are closely related to a kind of technical and instrumental knowledge, which involves the community as a whole. At the same time, it adds particular elements to the practices of the artisans, closely connected with nature, revealing a dynamic knowledge integrated and balanced with the environment, without disregarding the f act that any environmental alteration threatens the cultural practice, bringing changes to its modes of production...|$|R

However, the early origins of C. pepo in Mexico are well documented.|$|R
