60|$|Craig's {{surprise}} was real enough as he <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of the Professor's {{house on the}} following morning and found Lenora standing on the threshold.|$|E
60|$|It was no easy job {{to get to}} the woodshed, for {{the wind}} was still blowing furiously. When they <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of the Lodge the snow came {{swirling}} in, almost blinding them.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} he had {{finished}} his preparations and stowed all his electrical belongings in his various pockets, it was nearly midnight and the house was quiet. So Rob stole down stairs in his stocking feet and noiselessly <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1982 On May 14, 1982, “OLEX” was {{introduced}} to service, emergency LTL shipments, on an expedited door-to-door basis, in small vans, and straight trucks.

6000|$|... "Ryan, you {{had better}} go into the next house {{and see if they}} are pressed. Tell them that they must hold out without my help for a short time. I am going to send six {{officers}} out by <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> house, to collect some of our men together. Another will be in readiness to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> as soon as they return.|$|R
50|$|Friday the 13th Part III: Chris {{wakes up}} {{the morning after}} killing Jason, only to find he is still alive when she <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> lake house. Jason then {{proceeds}} to cut off Chris's head, and the scene immediately switches to Chris waking up screaming in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> police car, revealing her entire death was a dream and Jason remains dead in the barn.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, {{when they}} were back in town, Keawe bade the {{boatswain}} wait for him at the corner, by the old calaboose, and went forward up the avenue alone to the door of his house. The night had come again; there was a light within, but never a sound; and Keawe crept about the corner, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> softly, and looked in.|$|E
60|$|It {{was night}} at Marygreen, {{and the rain}} of the {{afternoon}} {{showed no sign of}} abatement. About the time at which Jude and Arabella were walking the streets of Christminster homeward, the Widow Edlin crossed the green, and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of the schoolmaster's dwelling, which she often did now before bedtime, to assist Sue in putting things away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now for it," [...] whispered Jack. He <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> softly, and we darted out. A {{streak of}} pale {{light on the}} horizon {{indicated}} the approach of day. We tried {{to close the door}} behind us, but we heard the butler choke, gasp, and shout {{at the top of his}} voice, [...] "Hi! hallo!" [...] At the same instant the old dinner-gong sent a peal of horrible sound through the house, and we took to flight filled with unutterable terror.|$|E
6000|$|... "Plenty of time," [...] {{he assured}} himself, {{and took the}} lamp which was to explain the whole affair, {{and went to the}} head of the {{staircase}} between the scullery and the parlour. He sat down in the twilight with the unlit lamp beside him and surveyed things. He must light the fire in the coal cellar under <b>the</b> stairs, <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> then come up them very quickly and light the paraffine puddles on each step, then sit down here again and cut his throat.|$|R
6000|$|... "None," [...] {{the other}} replied. [...] "It {{is in good}} hands. Black Harry has bribed a cook wench, who will <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> They say he was to return to London this week, and if so Sunday is fixed for the affair. Five days yet, and say another week for the news to get here. In a {{fortnight}} we will be {{on our way to}} England. There, I am thirsty, and we left the bottle in the next room. We had a late night of it with the boys there." ...|$|R
50|$|The next day, the {{children}} are split up into groups and loaded into trucks and ambulances {{to be transferred to}} other camps. The children in Karel's group are at first terrified because the Nazis often used ambulances to gas victims, but are eventually coaxed into the vehicle. During the trip, the smell of exhaust fumes causes {{the children}} to panic. Karel's friend Raoul manages to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> and <b>the</b> children scatter in all directions. Karel and Raoul try to swim across a river to escape from two UNRRA men. Raoul drowns, but Karel hides in the reeds.|$|R
6000|$|Just as {{they must}} have been {{starting}} for that [...] "one more run," [...] I <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> and fled into the night, with the bookful of banknotes in my bosom, the silver spoons in my pocket, and the cat in my arms. I threaded my way easily enough through the familiar obstacles in the backyard, and was out in the pitch darkness of the moor before I heard the second shock, and the crash which told me that the whole door had given way.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned away}} from the stove, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> and walked with a more {{determined}} step through the passage to the sitting-room. But here he halted again on the threshold with a quick return of his old habits of caution. The door was slightly open; apparently his angry outbreak of an hour ago had not affected the spirits of his daughters, for he could hear their hilarious voices mingling with those of the strangers. They were evidently still fortune-telling, but this time it was the prophetic and divining accents of Mr. Rice addressed to Clementina which were now plainly audible.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{we are in}} the fields, {{clear of}} the house, keep close by my side, and even try to keep step with me. What you have to say, say NOW; there must be no talking to betray our position--we must go silently, and you'll have enough to do to {{exercise}} your eyes and ears. I shall stand between you and any attack, but I expect you to obey orders without hesitation." [...] He <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> motioned to Cato to pass out, followed him, locked the door behind them, and taking the negro's arm walked beside the low palings {{to the end of the}} garden, where they climbed the fence and stood upon the open field beyond.|$|E
5|$|As Reyes brings William back to Scully's apartment, Comer's {{artifact}} flies over William and hovers {{above his}} head. Scully, realizing something is wrong, plans to drive William to somewhere safe. At the same time, Doggett notices the Overcoat Woman watching them nearby. As Scully and Reyes drive away, Doggett confronts {{the woman at}} gunpoint, but she runs him over. Scully places William {{under the care of}} The Lone Gunmen, but they are soon ambushed by the Overcoat Woman. With Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) incapacitated, <b>the</b> woman <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> van to find John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) holding William. The woman puts a gun to Byers' head.|$|R
60|$|The {{front door}} was open, and they {{could see through the}} hall and <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> into <b>the</b> garden beyond.|$|R
50|$|In 1930 one of Capone's bookkeepers, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Jack Zuta, {{defected}} to George “Bugs” Moran’s gang. Knowing that Capone did not like disloyalty, Zuta decided to lay low under the name “J.H. Goodman” at the Lake View Resort on Upper Lake Nemahbin in the town of Summit. Knowing it was only a matter of time before Capone's hit squad caught up with him, Zuta made a desperate call from an Oconomowoc drug store, begging for body guards to escort him down to Chicago. Unfortunately for him, he was overheard. Around sunset on August 1, 1930 Capone's hitsquad walked into the Lake View resort, threw <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> shot Zuta, and walked out the way they came in.|$|R
6000|$|The children, too, had {{not been}} able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Grettel wept bitterly and spoke to Hansel: [...] "Now it's all up with us." [...] "No, no, Grettel," [...] said Hansel, [...] "don't fret yourself; I'll be able to find a way to escape, no fear." [...] And when the old people had fallen asleep he got up, slipped on his little coat, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> and stole out. The moon was shining clearly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like bits of silver. Hansel bent down and filled his pocket with as many of them as he could cram in. Then he went back and said to Grettel: [...] "Be comforted, my dear little sister, and go to sleep: God will not desert us"; and he lay down in bed again.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the deputy}} {{on the kitchen}} floor rolled over with an appalling snort, struggled, {{stretched}} himself, and awoke. A healthy animal, he had shaken off the fumes of liquor with a dry tongue and a thirst for water and fresh air. He raised his knees and rubbed his eyes. The water bucket was missing from the corner. Well, he knew where the spring was, and a turn out of the close and stifling kitchen would do him good. He yawned, put on his boots softly, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> and stepped out. Everything was dark, but above and around him, to the very level of his feet, all apparently pricked with bright stars. The bulk of the barn rose dimly before him on the right, to the left was the spring. He reached it, drank, dipped his head and hands in it, and arose refreshed. The dry, wholesome breath that blew over this flat disk around him, rimmed with stars, did the rest. He began to saunter slowly back, the only reminiscence of his evening's potations being the figure he recalled of his pretty hostess, with bare arms and lifted glasses, imitating the barkeeper. A complacent smile straightened his yellow mustache. How she kept glancing at him and watching him, the little witch! Ha! no wonder! What could she find in the surly, slinking, stupid brute yonder? (The gentleman here alluded to was his host.) But the deputy had not been without a certain provincial success with the fair. He was true to most men, and fearless to all. One may not be too hard upon him at this moment of his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{news was}} trustworthy, Colonel Furness, and Oliver Cromwell owes {{his life to}} you. Soon after midnight one of the serving wenches <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> and eight men entered. Had no watch been set, they would doubtless have reached my room unobserved, by the {{staircase}} which leads from {{that part of the}} house. As it was, I had a guard in waiting, and when the men were fairly inside they fell upon them. The soldiers were too quick with them, being hot at the plot which was intended against my life, and all were killed, together with the wench who admitted them, who was stabbed by one of the men at the first alarm, thinking doubtless she had betrayed them. I hear that none of them have the air of gentlemen, but are clearly broken men and vagabonds. The haste of my soldiers has prevented me from getting any clew as to those who set them on, but I am sure that no English gentleman, even although devoted to the cause of Charles Stuart, would so plot against my life. And now, sir, I thank you heartily for the great service you have rendered me. My life is, I think, precious to England, where I hope to do some good work before I die. I say only in return that henceforth you may come and go as you list; and I hope yet that you will sit by me in Parliament, and aid me to set things in England in order. Do not take this, sir, as in any way a recompense for saving my life. The war is over; a few of those who had troubled, and would always trouble the peace of England, have been executed. Against the rest we bear no malice. They are free {{to return to their homes}} and occupations as they list, and so long as they obey the laws, and abstain from fresh troubles and plots, none will molest them. But, sir, in order that no molestation or vexation may occur to you, here is a free pass, signed by General Fairfax and two of the commissioners, saying that you are at liberty to go or come and to stay where you please, without hindrance or molestation from any." ...|$|E
50|$|While {{the dozen}} battle the German {{troops in the}} monastery's courtyard, Major Wright destroys the {{communications}} center, Stern makes {{his way into the}} basement and Fontenac <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> allowing Marie, Swede, Martinez and the Resistance men in with the explosives however Fontenac attempts to escape and flee to Spain but Swede prevents this from happening and tells him he will shoot him if he tries to escape, Fontenac follows orders in the end, Wright then heads <b>back</b> out into <b>the</b> courtyard, where, he, Sergeant Holt, the Webber brothers, Spencer and Kelly secure the area, while Ballews and Chacon give covering fire from the balcony, as Marie and Martinez set the incendiary fuses, accidentally igniting the chemicals, which eventually causes an explosion.|$|R
5000|$|She <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> but Birdie attacks her again, so {{she hits}} {{her over the}} head with an iron she finds on the floor and rushes outside. She climbs over <b>the</b> <b>back</b> gate, but falls and twists her ankle. Mum and Dad rush out limping, bloodied and battered, chasing her into a field. Lena then falls and then Mum stabs her with a knife she took from the house. But Mum and Dad are too weak to kill her so Lena fights them off, and stabs them both {{repeatedly}} back and forth. Meanwhile, Elbie sets [...] "the spastic" [...] free of her restraints, before strangling her. He then walks out of the front door. The next and final shot is of Lena screaming in the field as planes take off overhead.|$|R
2500|$|On August 24, 2017, the PGR {{identified}} the suspected murder after analyzing a video recording from {{a convenience store}} {{during the time of}} the murder. The recording to place after Bermúdez Zacarías was killed. In the video, a taxi from Metepec stopped at an OXXO convenience store, where the suspect got off to buy certain items. About a minute later, the suspect exited the store after purchasing several goods. He then walks towards the taxi, thanks the driver, [...] and <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> other suspect, believed to have been at the crime scene, got off the vehicle. The face of the first suspect was captured by the surveillance cameras, but it was not possible to recognize the face of the other one. Both of them then left the store on foot and were no longer visible by the surveillance camera.|$|R
50|$|New safety {{features}} {{introduced in the}} third-generation Equinox include a surround-view camera, forward collision warning, low-speed automatic braking, a Safety Alert Seat that uses vibration pulses to help alert the driver and avoid crashes, {{as well as a}} Rear Seat Alert system that alerts drivers who had <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> {{at the start of a}} trip to check the back seat once they get to their destination, a feature first introduced on the 2017 GMC Acadia.|$|E
50|$|On February 17, 1984, eleven-year-old Tumekica Jackson {{was living}} {{with her mother and}} her {{grandparents}} in the Scotlandville area of Baton Rouge. At 4:00 a.m., the grandmother discovered that Tumekica was missing from her bedroom. The police discovered that someone had broken the screen of the rear den window and had <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> In the muddy ground near the house, police obtained a cast of an imprint made by the left shoe from a pair of size 8⅓ tennis shoes. There were no signs of a struggle inside the house.|$|E
50|$|He killed McCollom at Denman St Alderly on 24 January with a sawn-off shot gun. The police heard {{reports that}} shots {{had been fired}} in a house at Farrington Street, Alderley. A squad of detectives arrived but could not find anything. They went into {{adjoining}} street, Denman Street, and found McCollom {{had been shot in}} the abdomen. He told the detectives had <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of a house he was renting in answer to a knock and had been shot. McCollom managed to give a description of the man then was taken to hospital, where he was operated on but died at 10pm.|$|E
50|$|The name {{references}} {{the idea}} that they are both a creator and a discoverer, and that they are not a fount of information like the Bard or an adviser like the wise old man, but a source of change. The frequent obliviousness of the Artist-scientist to the aspects of reality that do not fit with their plans (the stereotype being that they devise an elaborate plan to scale the walls of a fortress as <b>the</b> hero <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> and walks in) symbolizes the occasionally underwhelming nature of reality as opposed to our idealized vision of it. It also references the frequent futility of attempting to control one's fate. Their naivety symbolizes the gap between knowledge and wisdom, but in the face of their successes it can symbolize the futility of trying to stop a dreamer from changing the world.|$|R
50|$|In September 2015, Frankie goes to {{stay with}} her {{daughter}} Debbie and visiting her ex-husband Johnno. During this time, Jack sells the pub and the Osbornes move to a new home. They also adopt Jade Albright who eventually discovers she has cancer. When she eventually returns, Frankie is stopped by Lindsey Butterfield who, unbeknownst to her, has just been outed as a serial killer. She tells Frankie that there has been an accident and she needs to get to hospital. Frankie lets her get into the van and the two drive off. It is later revealed as a trap as Lindsey has kidnapped Frankie and has put her in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> van. Lindsey then phones Esther, who she later meets outside of <b>the</b> vans. Lindsey <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> van, revealing Frankie.

60|$|It will be {{necessary}} for a proper understanding of the subject, that we repeat here in a few words, the routine adopted by the exhibiter in disclosing {{the interior of the}} box--a routine from which he never deviates in any material particular. In the first place he <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> door No. I. Leaving this open, he goes round to the rear of <b>the</b> box, and <b>opens</b> a <b>door</b> precisely at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>door</b> No. I. To this <b>back</b> <b>door</b> he holds a lighted candle. He then closes <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> locks it, and, coming round to <b>the</b> front, <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> drawer to its full extent. This done, he <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> doors No. 2 and No. 3, (the folding doors) and displays the interior of the main compartment. Leaving <b>open</b> <b>the</b> main compartment, the drawer, and the front door of cupboard No. I, he now goes to the rear again, and throws <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> main compartment. In shutting up the box no particular order is observed, except that the folding doors are always closed before the drawer.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} year {{following}} Lawton Chiles' election to the United States Senate in 1970, Rhea was walking by 200 East Capitol Street. At the time, the neighborhood was unsafe and the properties were unsightly. For these reasons, most people did not come east of the Capitol. Chiles walked past a circa 1891 row house—the historic Manning House—that was in total disrepair. The {{second floor of the}} historic property had caved in and the windows were boarded up. Homeless people were living in the basement. Chiles remembered her child's comment about [...] "Florida's Embassy." [...] With that as her vision, she arranged the purchase of the property with $5,000 of her own money and $120,000 raised from friends in Florida. Chiles preferred the sound of Number One Second Street over the original address. With that preference, she boarded up the front entrance and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> as the formal entrance to Florida House. She supervised the historic restoration of the 100-year-old Manning House that came to be Florida House.|$|E
6000|$|Kate's heart leapt up at {{the sound}} [...] "amuse." [...] She popped her {{precious}} note into her pocket, bounded up-stairs, and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> drawing- room <b>door</b> for her playfellow, as he brought up {{the rear of the}} procession.|$|R
6000|$|... 14. Although M. Maelzel, in {{disclosing}} {{the interior}} of the machine, sometimes slightly deviates from the routine which we have pointed out, yet reeler in any instance does he so deviate from it as to interfere with our solution. For example, he has been known to open, first of all, the drawer--but he never <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> main compartment without first closing <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of cupboard No. 1--he never <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> main compartment without first pulling out the drawer--he never shuts the drawer without first shutting the main compartment--he never <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of cupboard No. 1 while the main compartment is open--and the game of chess is never commenced until the whole machine is closed. Now if it were observed that never, in any single instance, did M. Maelzel differ from the routine we have pointed out as necessary to our solution, it {{would be one of the}} strongest possible arguments in corroboration of it--but the argument becomes infinitely strengthened if we duly consider the circumstance that he does occasionally deviate from the routine but never does so deviate as to falsify the solution.|$|R
60|$|I {{had nearly}} reached {{the middle of}} the field when I {{perceived}} the creature. He was rooting about with his fore feet under a large beech tree which lay upon my right hand. I did not turn my head, nor would the bystander have detected that I took notice of him, but my eye was watching him with anxiety. It may have been that he was in a contented mood, or it may have been that he was arrested by the nonchalance of my bearing, but he made no movement in my direction. Reassured, I fixed my eyes upon <b>the</b> <b>open</b> window of Marie's bed-chamber, which was immediately over <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> in <b>the</b> hope that those dear, tender, dark eyes, were surveying me from behind the curtains. I flourished my little cane, loitered to pick a primrose, and sang one of our devil-may-care choruses in order to insult this English beast, and to show my love how little I cared for danger when it stood between her and me. The creature was abashed by my fearlessness, and so, pushing <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> I was able to enter the farmhouse in safety and in honour.|$|R
