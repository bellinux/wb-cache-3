5|$|After leaving Rogers County, {{the next}} county along US-412 is Mayes County. South of Chouteau, the route {{provides}} access to US-69 via an interchange. Just west of US-412's crossing of the Grand River, the highway intersects SH-412B, which connects US-412 to SH-69A. After crossing the river, US-412 comes to {{a fork in the}} road; one half of the fork is the Cherokee Turnpike, which mainline US-412 follows, while the other is US-412 Alternate, which runs parallel to the turnpike <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> alignment of US-412.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{the project}} moved to Columbia Point, near the University of Massachusetts Boston. The new site {{was less than}} ideal; it was located <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's {{architectural}} team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} survey of 1998, only nine plants were {{identified}} in one single Radyr garden, where it traditionally grew on grassy banks and lawns, often in shade. It was no longer found at the original locality of Radyr Quarry where examples were last seen in 1985. At Bridgend, six possible plants of the Radyr genus were found <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> garden wall, but confirmation of identification is still awaited.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Rane {{worked for}} another {{seventeen}} hours {{to open the}} road to Chingas, which lay half-way between Rajauri and Naushahra <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> Mughal route, and beyond. During the period from 8 to 11 April, {{he had made a}} significant contribution in the Indian advance to Rajauri. His work not only cost the Pakistani forces about 500 dead and many more wounded, but also saved many civilians in the area from Chingas and Rajauri.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1842, {{popular opinion}} had {{turned against the}} Mormons. After an unknown assailant shot and wounded Missouri {{governor}} Lilburn Boggs in May 1842, anti-Mormons circulated rumors that Smith's bodyguard, Porter Rockwell, was the shooter. Though the evidence was circumstantial, Boggs ordered Smith's extradition. Certain he would be killed if he ever returned to Missouri, Smith went into hiding twice during the next five months, before the U.S. district attorney for Illinois argued that Smith's extradition to Missouri would be unconstitutional. (Rockwell was later tried and acquitted.) In June 1843, enemies of Smith convinced a reluctant Illinois Governor Thomas Ford to extradite Smith to Missouri <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> charge of treason. Two law officers arrested Smith, but were intercepted by a party of Mormons before they could reach Missouri. Smith was then released on a writ of habeas corpus from the Nauvoo municipal court. While this ended the Missourians' attempts at extradition, it caused significant political fallout in Illinois.|$|E

5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot was based <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not {{know if it was}} real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E
5|$|In another story, based <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> folktale-motif, and echoing {{a similar}} theme, Demeter {{was searching for}} her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.|$|E
5|$|Principal filming {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the crash scene being filmed <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> airport space with flat roads. However, other key {{sequences}} occurred in the studio. Because the fight scene between the Winchesters and Azazel at the climax was meant {{to take place in}} a secluded, forest-enclosed cabin, production built the set on a sound stage. Production designer Jerry Wanek felt the set was extremely important, as viewers would become uninterested if the forest looked fake. With Morgan rendered blind by the yellow contact lenses required to depict his character's demonic possession, the production crew placed sandbags on the floor to help the actor locate his marks.|$|E

5|$|Sleaford was {{primarily}} an agricultural town until the 20th century, supporting a cattle market, with seed companies, such as Hubbard and Phillips, and Sharpes International Seeds, being {{established in the}} late 19th century. The arrival of the railway made the town favourable for malting. Industry has declined, and in 2011 the most common occupations are in wholesale and retail trade, health and social care, public administration and defence and manufacturing. Regeneration of the town centre {{has led to the}} redevelopment of the old industrial areas, including the construction of the National Centre for Craft & Design <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> wharf.|$|E
5|$|Still {{awaiting}} imperial {{permission to}} build in the courtyard, the Perushim wished to rely <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> firman given to the Jews in 1623, which stated {{that there could be}} no objection to them building in their own quarters. Having received a supporting document issued by the Qadi of Jerusalem in March 1824, it was possible for them begin rebuilding the dwellings in the courtyard. In practice, however, construction never materialised as they were unable to exercise their authority over the plot of land. This was apparently due to confrontation with the Arab squatters and the local government's disregard of the documents proving their ownership of the courtyard.|$|E
5|$|The video starts showing Arjona {{inside a}} room {{powering}} <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> video projector and singing while watching {{a black and}} white film projected on the wall. This scenes are shown until the music style of the song changes into salsa. Then, after the musical change, scenes of two twin brothers are shown, interpolated, one of them living in Havana, the other living in Miami, Florida. The following scenes show the technological differences to which the brothers are attached, before going into the musical change to merengue and cuban music, on which two large group of kids, led by the two brothers, are shown sprinting throughout two shores until they meet and start to celebrate. Then, the final musical change is shown, along a collage of different scenes from the United States and Cuba. Finally, Arjona is shown again sit along the video projector, and the clip ends. As of 14 July 2012, the video has reached 1.4 million views on YouTube.|$|E

5|$|Avi Shlaim, Emeritus Professor of International Relations in the University of Oxford, {{asserts that}} two main {{schools of thought}} have been {{developed}} {{on the question of}} the primary driving force behind the declaration, one presented in 1961 by Leonard Stein, a lawyer and former political secretary to the World Zionist Organization, and the other in 1970 by Mayir Vereté, then Professor of Israeli History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Shlaim states that Stein does not reach any clear cut conclusions, but that implicit in his narrative is that the declaration resulted primarily from the activity and skill of the Zionists, whereas according to Vereté, it was the work of hard-headed pragmatists motivated by British imperial interests in the Middle East. Much of modern scholarship on the decision to issue the declaration focuses on the Zionist movement and rivalries within it, with a key debate being whether the role of Weizmann was decisive or whether the British were likely to have issued a similar declaration in any event. Danny Gutwein, Professor of Jewish History at the University of Haifa, proposes a twist <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> idea, asserting that Sykes's February 1917 approach to the Zionists was the defining moment, and that it was consistent with the pursuit of the government’s wider agenda to partition the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the money}} for the first phase of Device works came from Henry's {{dissolution}} of the monasteries a few years before, and the revenues that flowed in from the Court of Augmentations and First Fruits and Tenths as a result. In addition, the dissolution had released ample supplies of building materials as the monastic buildings were pulled down, and much of this was recycled. Netley Castle, for example, was based <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> abbey and reused many of its stones, East Tilbury Blockhouse reused parts of St Margaret's Chantry, Calshot Castle took the lead from nearby Beaulieu Abbey, East and West Cowes castles stone from Beaulieu and Quarr, and Sandwich had the stone from the local Carmelite friary. Milton Blockhouse was constructed on land that had recently been confiscated from Milton Chantry. By {{the second phase of the}} programme, however, most {{of the money}} from the dissolution had been spent, and Henry instead had to borrow funds; government officials noted that at least £100,000 was needed for the work.|$|E
5|$|Team member Lucas Davis {{compiled}} {{the development}} tools and documentation for Anachronox and released them in August 2001. Four bug-fixing patches exist for Anachronox. Ion Storm {{created the first}} (1.01), which fixed the Windows 2000 buffer overrun crash and implemented other improvements such as taxi-cabs between distant points and enhanced save game functionality. Ion Storm released the first patch (1.01) on July 2, 2001. Joey Liaw set up a GeoCities website for reporting bugs and technical information after the game's release, and worked on a new patch in his spare time. The second patch (1.02, or build 44) was released in May 2003 and overhauls the save-game system and provides other important stability fixes. The third and fourth patches—1.02 (build 45), released September 2003, and 1.02 (build 46), released April 2004—are fan-made unofficial patches and fix {{most of the remaining}} bugs. Fans have translated the game into German and released a conversion patch. Level designer Rich Carlson released a scrapped secret level for Anachronox in February 2004 after finding it <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> floppy disk.|$|E

5|$|Tulsidas {{himself has}} given {{only a few}} facts and hints about events {{of his life in}} various works. Till late nineteenth century, the two widely known ancient sources on Tulsidas' life were the Bhaktamal {{composed}} by Nabhadas between 1583 and 1639, and a commentary on Bhaktamal titled Bhaktirasbodhini composed by Priyadas in 1712. Nabhadas was a contemporary of Tulsidas and wrote a six-line stanza on Tulsidas describing him as an incarnation of Valmiki. Priyadas' work was composed around a hundred years after the death of Tulsidas and had eleven additional stanzas, describing seven miracles or spiritual experiences from the life of Tulsidas. During the 1920s, two more ancient biographies of Tulsidas were published based on old manuscripts – the Mula Gosain Charit composed by Veni Madhav Das in 1630 and the Gosain Charit composed by Dasanidas (also known as Bhavanidas) around 1770. Veni Madhav Das was a disciple and contemporary of Tulsidas and his work gave a new date for Tulsidas' birth. The work by Bhavanidas presented more narratives in greater detail as compared to the work by Priyadas. In the 1950s a fifth ancient account was published based <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> manuscript, the Gautam Chandrika composed by Krishnadatta Misra of Varanasi in 1624. Krishnadatta Misra's father was a close companion of Tulsidas. The accounts published later are not considered authentic by some modern scholars, whereas some other scholars have been unwilling to dismiss them. Together, these five works form a set of traditional biographies on which modern biographies of Tulsidas are based.|$|E
5|$|While bishop, Hervey {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a history}} of the refounding of the abbey of Ely, which later became incorporated into the Liber Eliensis. This was a Latin reworking of an Old English book of grants compiled by Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester. He was energetic in recovering the feudal rights of the bishopric against knights who had intruded themselves on the lands, but were not rendering knight service to the bishop. As bishop, he attended a legatine council, or council held by a papal legate, in 1127, and a royal council in 1129, but otherwise his administrative actions remain obscure. The causeway between the island of Ely and Exning, which made it easier for pilgrims to visit the shrine of Saint Ethelreda, was built under Hervey's orders. Insight into his activities as bishop is given in the Pipe Roll of 1130, the first surviving Pipe Roll. In that record, Hervey is recorded as owing King Henry 45 pounds to provide an office for a nephew, 100 pounds <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> settlement with the king, another 100 pounds for the settlement of a case dealing with Ramsey Abbey, Bury St. Edmunds Abbey and the bishop, 240 pounds for the right to be rid of a surplus of knights, and finally 1000 pounds for the king to allow the bishop's knights to serve castleguard at Ely instead of Norwich.|$|E
