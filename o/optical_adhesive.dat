To study molecularly defined cell functions, biologically inspired materials that mimic the nanoscale order of extracellular matrix protein fibers and yield suitable electrical charge transfer characteristics are highly desired.

30|$|Recently, nanoimprint {{lithography}} [NIL] has attracted increasing attention as a facile technique for patterning polymer nanostructures [1 – 3]. The principle of NIL {{is very simple}} and described in detail elsewhere [1]. A hard mold with nanoscale surface-relief features is pressed onto a polymer cast at controlled temperature and pressure, which creates replica patterns on the polymer surface. Mold materials normally used for NIL include silicon, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, or metals such as nickel, and the surface nanostructures are typically fabricated using various lithographic, electrochemical, and etching techniques [1, 4 – 6]. While these conventional inorganic molds are thermally and mechanically stable [7], they often easily break due to their stiffness when pressed or removed. The large mismatch of thermal expansion between stiff inorganic molds and polymeric films is also problematic. For these reasons, several {{attempts have been made}} to use soft and flexible molds made from polymeric materials [8]. Various elastomeric polymers such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) [PDMS] were used for this purpose [9 – 11]. However, due to the innate softness of these materials with low elastic modulus, e.g., 2 to 4 MPa for PDMS, the molds tended to deform when pressure was applied, and hence, these materials were not suitable for imprinting nanoscale features. Stiffer polymeric molds with a higher mechanical strength such as urethane- [12, 13] and epoxide-based [14, 15] polymer molds were therefore introduced. For example, the Norland <b>Optical</b> <b>Adhesives</b> (NOA 63, Norland Products, Cranbury, NJ, USA), a urethane-based UV-curable polymer, is a plausible candidate due to its good mechanical properties and high Young's modulus (approximately 1, 655 MPa) [16]. The urethane- and epoxide-based polymers, however, possess high surface energies, leading to strong adhesion of the molds to the imprinted surface. Consequently, the mold surface must be coated with an anti-adhesive layer. Recently Kim et al. introduced the PDMS coating technology onto various hard and soft molds including these stiffer polymers. The PDMS-coated molds showed good surface properties, i.e., low surface energy and low adhesion properties, like normal PDMS molds [17, 18]. It was previously reported that to create a strong and highly stable PDMS coating, the oxidized polymer surface must be treated with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane [APTES] before PDMS deposition. The hydroxyl groups on the oxidized polymer surface can bind strongly with APTES by silanization, and subsequent PDMS deposition forms strong covalent bonds between the aminosilane (APTES)-treated surface and monoglycidyl ether-terminated PDMS through epoxy-amine chemistry [17, 18]. A well-established technique for surface oxidation and consequent generation of terminal hydroxyl groups for various semiconductors is the piranha soak (sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide mixed solution) [1]. This approach, however, cannot be applied to polymer surfaces since most polymeric materials are highly vulnerable to strong acids. Photooxidation using UV-oxygen treatment has been reported as an alternative [17, 18]. However, this approach is also destructive [19, 20], and the polymer surfaces are rapidly etched before the formation of surface hydroxyl groups is optimized. In this study, we developed a relatively nondestructive oxidation approach using a mixed solution of ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide for the generation of hydroxyl groups on NOA 63 polymer surfaces and compared the effectiveness of this method with that of previously reported photooxidation approaches.|$|R
