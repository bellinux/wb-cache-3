40|$|Abstract — Time <b>overruns</b> and Cost <b>overruns</b> {{has been}} a major issue in many Indian {{construction}} projects. The successful execution of construction projects and keeping them within prescribed schedule and cost is very important for effective time performance and cost performance. This research work is carried out on studying significant factors causing Time <b>overruns</b> and Cost <b>overruns</b> in Indian construction projects. A valid questionnaire for the survey was developed based on factors for time <b>overruns</b> and factors for cost <b>overruns</b> identified from literature review. These factors are grouped into 12 categories for time <b>overruns</b> and 8 categories for cost <b>overruns</b> and distributed to Contractors, Consultants, and Owners of Indian construction Industry. The data from the questionnaire was analyzed statistically. Relative important index method was used to found out the most significant factors affecting Time and Cost <b>overruns.</b> The result accomplished from the survey revealed that the major cause for time <b>overruns</b> are material market rate, contract modification, and high level of quality requirement and the major cause for cost <b>overruns</b> are high transportation cost, change in material specification, and escalation of materials price. The study findings highlight the significant factors and some recommendations are given to control time and cost <b>overruns</b> in Indian construction Industry...|$|R
50|$|Recent {{works by}} Ahiaga-Dagbui and Smith {{suggests}} a rethink {{of what is}} traditionally referred to as <b>overruns</b> in construction. They attempt {{to make a distinction}} between the often conflated causes of construction cost underestimation and eventual cost <b>overruns.</b> Critical to their argument is the point of reference for measuring cost <b>overruns.</b> Whereas some measure the size of cost <b>overruns</b> as the difference between cost at the time of decision to build and final completion costs, others measure the size of <b>overruns</b> as the difference between cost at contract award and final completion cost.This leads to a wide range in the size of <b>overruns</b> reported in different studies.|$|R
40|$|Cost <b>overruns</b> are {{a global}} phenomenon. By {{assuming}} that companies are profit maximizing, we imply that inaccurate estimates of project costs are unwanted {{as the basis}} for investment analysis is weakened. The aim of this thesis is therefore to identify which factors affect the ability to set accurate budgets and meet the estimated costs. I highlight this topic by analyzing the differences in cost <b>overruns</b> between projects from the Norwegian oil industry and the public sector, by introducing macroeconomic variables for analysis and by looking into whether the cost <b>overruns</b> from one sector affects the other. Firstly, descriptive statistics and univariate regressions were run in order to obtain a better overview of the topic. Both public and oil projects are statistically more prone to cost <b>overruns</b> than underruns, however, oil projects experience <b>overruns</b> of larger magnitude. Public projects show a trend where increasing project size reduces cost <b>overruns,</b> while cost <b>overruns</b> in oil projects tend to increase with the duration of the project. To further analyze the dynamics of cost <b>overruns,</b> multivariate regressions were performed. This includes using forward selection by iterative processes in order to arrive at the final models. For oil projects, I find the variables Duration, Pension fund surprise, GDP growth and NCS investment surprise to significantly affect the magnitude of cost <b>overruns,</b> explaining about 25 % of the variability in cost <b>overruns</b> for oil projects. As for public projects, the corresponding model includes the variables Duration, Employment level, GDP from marine activities and Export, explaining about 13 % of the variability. The models above indicate that cost <b>overruns</b> in both sectors depend on the macroeconomic environment at the time of project execution. The explanatory power for the oil model is rather acceptable, however, I fail to find a good general model for cost <b>overruns</b> in public projects. When comparing the two sectors by running the models on the opposite dataset, no causal relationship in cost <b>overruns</b> between the two was found, and I therefore fail to confirm whether the different sectors affect the cost <b>overruns</b> of each other...|$|R

This paper tests whether Dutch projects perform significantly better in terms of cost <b>overruns</b> than other geographical areas. It is concluded that for road and tunnel projects, the Netherlands performs similarly {{to the rest of the}} world. For rail projects, Dutch projects perform considerably better, with projects having significantly lower percentage cost <b>overruns</b> in real terms (11 %) compared to projects in other North West European countries (27 %) and in other geographical areas (44 %).

40|$|Media reports abound on {{instances}} of prolonged delays and excessive cost <b>overruns</b> in infrastructure projects. Only {{a small number}} of projects get delivered in time and within the budget. Examples of successful project implementation, like construction of the Delhi Metro Rail, are few and appear only far in between. Indeed, the problem of time and cost <b>overruns</b> in India is widespread and severe. Yet, very few empirical studies exist on the subject. Even rarer are the studies based on completed projects. As a result, the extents as well as the causes behind delays and cost <b>overruns</b> have remained under-researched. This study investigates the various issues related to delays and cost <b>overruns</b> in publically funded infrastructure projects. The following questions are posed and answered [...] How common and how large are the time and the cost <b>overruns?</b> What are the essential causes behind these delays and cost <b>overruns?</b> Are the underlying causes statistically significant? Are Contractual and Institutional failures among the significant causes? What are the policy implications for planning, development and implementation of infrastructure projects? The study is based on, by far, the largest dataset of 894 projects from seventeen infrastructure sectors. Among other results, it shows that the contractual and the institutional failures are economically and statistically significant causes behind cost and time <b>overruns.</b> Delays, Cost <b>Overruns,</b> Time <b>Overruns,</b> Infrastructure, Projects, Causes, Contractual Failures, Organizational Failures, Institutional Failures...|$|R

The merits of the different <b>overrunning</b> clutch are analyzed by the design characteristic, reliability, weight, process of the manufacture and so on. In the end, the application and development of the high speed <b>overrunning</b> clutch are discussed according to the characteristics of the transmission system that have high reliability, long life and light weight. Function of the High Speed <b>Overrunning</b> Clutch in the Transmission System of the Helicopter The high speed <b>overrunning</b> clutch is one of {{the critical}} components. When the power system drives the rotor system, the high <b>overrunning</b> clutch is on engagement mode that the speed of the driven part always tries to be equal to that of the driver. However, the high <b>overrunning</b> clutch is on disengagement mode that the speed of the driven part highly attempt that of the driver. The driver and driven parts of the high <b>overrunning</b> clutch is on differential speed during the twin or more engine being in start-up and the power system being on the G.
