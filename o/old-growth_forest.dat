5|$|Loggers felled {{massive amounts}} of forest in the 1920s and 1930s. Reforestation efforts began in the 1940s because natural {{regeneration}} could not {{keep pace with the}} rate of logging. In 1962, the Columbus Day Storm knocked many more large trees to the ground. Today, <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> covers only about five percent of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{fiscal crisis}} in the 1970s caused {{the rest of the}} park to fall into disrepair. A dearth of funds {{exacerbated}} the pollution of the park. Hands-on education programs at the park were reduced to passive observations of flora and fauna. Elsewhere in the park, excessive foot traffic was eroding the soil in the forests. The stock of younger, replacement trees in the <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> had relatively little diversity compared to other natural forests.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Massachusetts {{had been}} cleared for agriculture, leaving only traces of <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> in {{isolated}} pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many rural areas as farms have been abandoned. Currently, forests cover around 62% of Massachusetts. The areas most affected by human development include the Greater Boston area {{in the east and}} the Springfield metropolitan area in the west, although the latter includes agricultural areas throughout the Connecticut River Valley. There are currently 219 endangered species in Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to impact climate change, but climate change is also impacting <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests.</b> As the effects of global warming grow more substantial, the ability of <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> to sequester carbon is affected. Climate change showed an impact on the mortality of some dominant trees species, as observed in the Korean pine. Climate change also showed an effect on the composition of species when forests were surveyed over a 10 and 20-year period, which may disrupt the overall productivity of the forest.|$|R

40|$|The United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the UN Forum on Forests (UNFF) are {{the most}} {{important}} international environmental agreements to include <b>forests.</b> <b>Old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> are not an official forest category in these agreements, thus there is no direct support for the conservation of <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> in international policy, nor is there a globally accepted international forest policy. Nevertheless, negotiations under UN conventions include mechanisms that could indirectly support the conservation of <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> in the future. Under the UNFCCC, a new mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics could help conserve forests with high carbon stocks. A global network of forest protected areas is being discussed under the CBD. However, <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> will be conserved only when international environmental agreements are implemented by individual countries through national and local action...|$|R
5|$|In 1989, annual {{timber harvest}} revenue on federal forest land {{nationwide}} peaked at $1.5 billion. Following that year, {{the impact of}} overharvesting and increased environmental concerns began to negatively impact timber sales on the O lands. In 1994, the federal Northwest Forest Plan was implemented. Designed to guide forest management of federal lands while protecting <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> habitat for endangered species such as the Northern spotted owl, the plan restricted the land available for timber harvest. By 1998, revenue on federal forest lands fell {{to a third of}} the peak 1989 revenue, with areas in the Northwest particularly hard-hit.|$|E
5|$|Ricketts Glen State Park is a Pennsylvania {{state park}} on 13,050 acres (5,280ha) in Columbia, Luzerne, and Sullivan {{counties}} in Pennsylvania in the United States. Ricketts Glen is a National Natural Landmark {{known for its}} <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> and 24named waterfalls along Kitchen Creek, which flows down the Allegheny Front escarpment from the Allegheny Plateau to the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians. The park is near the borough of Benton on Pennsylvania Route 118 and Pennsylvania Route 487, and is in five townships: Sugarloaf in Columbia County, Fairmount and Ross in Luzerne County, and Colley and Davidson in Sullivan County.|$|E
5|$|Ricketts Glen is {{the name}} given to the Kitchen Creek valley south and {{downstream}} of Waters Meet. It is 1.8miles (2.9km) between Pennsylvania Route 118 and Waters Meet on the Falls Trail, making this the longest glen. The three northernmost waterfalls are all within 0.5miles (0.80km) of Waters Meet, and are only a short hike {{from the bottom of}} Ganoga Glen or Glen Leigh. The southern part of this glen has large areas of <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest,</b> chiefly hemlocks. Ricketts Glen is entirely in the Catskill Formation and all of the falls on this section of Kitchen Creek have plunge pools.|$|E
40|$|The Northern Spotted Owl is an {{endangered}} species that requires <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> in southwest mainland British Columbia for its survival. Policies to save the owl focus on habitat preservation and include trade-offs between removing <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> from timber harvesting allocations, and preservation of an animal with no direct market value. The majority of forests are public land and determining the proper trade-offs requires knowledge of the general public’s preferences. Existence values for the Spotted Owl may be confounded with their habitat (i. e. <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests),</b> or other <b>old-growth</b> dependent species at risk, where the <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> can exist without these species, but not vice versa. This study uses a stated preference, multi-attribute, trade-off approach to measure these values separately, but {{in the context of}} each other. Risk (success of conservation) is also included into the valuation. The study surveyed the general public of the Lower Mainland using a web-based format...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{a rapidly}} {{expanding}} {{body of research}} has made wildlife biologists and land managers increasingly aware that <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> are critical wildlife habitat. This has come {{at a time when}} <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> are rapidly being eliminated in order to meet human demands for wood products. In Oregon, for example, it is anticipated that virtually all remaining <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> on commercial forest lands will be harvested by the year 2020 (Beuter et al. 1976). Thereafter, regenerating forests on cutover areas will be intensively managed and harvested every 60 - 80 years on most sites. If history is a good example, it is extremely unlikely that <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> will ever again be regenerated on these cutover areas. Because of the overwhelming economic pressures mandating the harvest of the remaining stands of old-growth, we believe that the single most difficult issue facing wildlife biologists and land managers in the Pacific Northwest is how to retain viable populations of wildlife that find their optimum habitat in <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests.</b> One species associated with <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> in the Pacific Northwest is the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). During the last 10 years we have been closely involved with studies and management of this species in Oregon. The purpose of this report is to briefly summarize the research that has been conducted on the spotted owl and to describe a management plan that has been proposed for the species in Oregon...|$|R

5|$|Splash dams, greased chutes, {{railroad}} landings, railroad {{branch lines}} and steam donkey operations {{were among the}} strategies utilized to exploit the watershed's resources of timber. Unfortunately, railroad embankments and fills used to build up tributaries had artificially straightened them in the process, and erosion increased dramatically on the barren hillside, causing many streams to become much siltier than they naturally would be. Nearly all the <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> in the watershed is now gone, and the forests that remain are mostly second-growth stands.|$|E
5|$|The North Mountain House was {{threatened}} by a forest fire in 1900; the subsequent loss {{of much of the}} surrounding <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> led to decreased numbers of hotel guests. In 1903 another large fire on North Mountain threatened the sawmill in the village of Ricketts. The wooden addition to the stone house was torn down in either 1897 or 1903, and the land became a garden. The hotel closed in November 1903, and the fishing club and passenger train service ended with the closure.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests in}} and around Ricketts Glen State Park {{are some of the}} most {{extensive}} in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for plants like black gum, yellow birch, cinnamon fern, sphagnum and various sedges. The <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and oaks, and the park is home to 85species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers.|$|E

5|$|Lack {{of money}} has precluded major improvements, however, and timber {{companies}} have replanted {{much of the}} logged area with non-native tree species. Coastline areas, including dunes and coastal prairie, have been invaded by exotic species, {{partly due to the}} suppression of forest fires until the 1980s. A fire management plan now allows controlled burning as one method to return the parkland to its original state. Since the redwoods were logged on the basis of accessibility, with inaccessible areas being cut last, large <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> sections were isolated from one another, sometimes by many miles. In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return, regardless of the amount of money used to rehabilitate the ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{is home to}} one of {{the last}} stands of <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> in eastern North Carolina. A forest of bay trees, sweetgum, pawpaw, persimmon, bald cypress and poplar are found on the {{northern}} shore of Lake Phelps. The cypress have a trunk diameter of up to tenfeet (3m) and the poplar have a trunk diameter of sixfeet (2m). There are vines that are as wide as an average man's leg and grow up the trees in excess of 130feet (40m). In the section of the park along the Scuppernong River, the Atlantic white cedar and other rare cedar trees have grown to rather large sizes. Several of the trees at Pettigrew State Park are listed on the North Carolina and National Registries of Big Trees.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park {{falls within}} two {{terrestrial}} ecoregions of the Palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forest— the Balkan mixed forests and the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests. Forests cover 80% of the park's area, with <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> forming 30% of them. These woods {{are the last}} remaining temperate forests with evergreen laurel undergrowth in Europe. The park has {{the highest number of}} vertebrate species of all protected areas in Bulgaria, including 66 species of mammals, 269 species of birds, 24 species of reptiles, 10 species of amphibia and 41 species of freshwater fish, as well as 70 species of marine fish in the waters of the Black Sea. The invertebrate fauna is poorly researched and includes 84 Bulgarian endemic species, of which 4 are local, and 34 relict species.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} effect of forest age on soil carbon storage, {{clarifying}} if <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> still store soil carbon despite the ecological theory that <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> are carbon neutral. In the first section, a general overview of carbon storage is given, and key areas where forest age could affect carbon storage are described. In the second section, the existing literature is reviewed, elaborating {{the effect of}} these factors on carbon storage in <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests.</b> Finally a case study of a temperate broadleaf forest site is given. The results demonstrate that <b>old-growth</b> <b>forests</b> are still able to store carbon in the soil; however, litter quality, i. e. acid-generating conifer needles, may also negatively influence soil carbon storage. Most interestingly, the amount of stored carbon depends strongly on the methods applied. Chronosequence approaches generally gain only a few grams of carbon per year and square metre, whereas repeated sampling yields several tens of grams...|$|R

5|$|Like the extinctions {{of other}} New Zealand birds {{such as the}} piopio in the 19th century, {{the decline of the}} huia was poorly studied. Massive {{deforestation}} occurred in the North Island at this time, particularly in the lowlands of southern Hawkes Bay, the Manawatu and the Wairarapa, as land was cleared by European settlers for agriculture. The huia was particularly vulnerable to this as it could only live in <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood-boring insect larvae. It seems it could not survive in regenerating, secondary forests. Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested, the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed. The destruction of this part of its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on huia populations, but its removal would have been particularly dire if they did in fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape snow at higher altitudes as some researchers including Oliver have surmised.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of Ratanakiri Province is diverse, encompassing rolling hills, mountains, plateaus, lowland watersheds, and crater lakes. Two major rivers, Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, flow {{from east to}} west across the province. The province is known for its lush forests; as of 1997, 70–80% of the province was forested, either with <b>old-growth</b> <b>forest</b> or with secondary forest regrown after shifting cultivation. In the far north of the province are mountains of the Annamite Range; the area is characterized by dense broadleaf evergreen forests, relatively poor soil, and abundant wildlife. In the highlands between Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, the home of the vast majority of Ratanakiri's population, a hilly basalt plateau provides fertile red soils. Secondary forests dominate this region. South of the Srepok River is a flat area of tropical deciduous forests.|$|E
