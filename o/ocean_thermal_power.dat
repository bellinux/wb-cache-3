40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that in 1970 the total energy {{consumed}} in the U. S. was equal to the energy of sunlight received by only 0. 15 % of the land area of the continental U. S. The utilization of solar energy might, therefore, provide an approach for solving the energy crisis produced by the consumption of irreplaceable fossil fuels at a steadily increasing rate. Questions regarding the availability of solar energy are discussed along with the design of solar energy collectors and various approaches for heating houses and buildings by utilizing solar radiation. Other subjects considered {{are related to the}} heating of water partly or entirely with solar energy, the design of air conditioning systems based on the use of solar energy, electric power generation by a solar thermal and a photovoltaic approach, solar total energy systems, industrial and agricultural applications of solar energy, solar stills, the utilization of <b>ocean</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>power,</b> power systems based on the use of wind, and solar-energy power systems making use of geosynchronous power plants...|$|E

40|$|In this article, 20 [*]kW <b>ocean</b> <b>thermal</b> energy {{conversion}} with a vapor–vapor ejector is newly proposed. As a vapor–vapor ejector is {{installed in the}} system, the pressure difference between the turbine inlet and outlet increases. Therefore, {{the amount of the}} working fluid required for the total turbine work of 20 [*]kW is less than when no vapor–vapor ejector is installed. Therefore, installing a vapor–vapor ejector in the system decreases the evaporation capacity and the pump work. The performance analysis considered the outlet pressure of the high-stage turbine, the mass flow ratio of the working fluid at the outlet of a separator just after the high-stage turbine, and the nozzle diameters of the vapor–vapor ejector. As the outlet pressure of high-stage turbine becomes lower, the turbine gross power of high-stage turbine and system efficiency increase although lower outlet pressure of high-stage turbine results in lower ejector performance. Similarly, in terms of mass flow ratio, the highest system efficiency was shown at mass flow ratio of 0. 4 at the outlet of a separator just after the high-stage turbine. On the other hand, the performance of the ejector at mass flow ratio of 0. 5 at the outlet of a separator was largest. When the nozzle diameters of the vapor–vapor ejector are properly designed, the vapor–vapor ejector shows the highest performance. After the optimization of the operation parameters, system efficiency of the proposed <b>ocean</b> <b>thermal</b> {{energy conversion}} <b>power</b> cycle was 2. 47 %, relatively 15 % higher than that of the basic <b>ocean</b> <b>thermal</b> energy conversion <b>power</b> cycle (2. 2 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{performance}} analysis for evaporation capacity, total work {{and efficiency of}} the <b>ocean</b> <b>thermal</b> energy conversion(OTEC) <b>power</b> system using mixed refrigerant(R 32,R 152 a) is conducted to find the effect of hot wasted water on OTEC power system. The system {{in this study is}} applied with two stage turbine, regenerator, cooler and separator on Organic Rankine Cycle. The commercial program HYSYS is used for {{the performance}} analysis. The main results were summarized as follows: The efficiency of the OTEC power cycle has a largely effect on the evaporation capacity and total work. As increasing temperature of heat source water, evaporator's capacity is decreased but total work increase. Otherwise, using hot wasted water bring effects not only increasing system efficiency but also declining evaporator's capacity.

40|$|Mixtures offer {{potential}} advantages over pure compounds as working fluids in <b>ocean</b> <b>thermal</b> energy conversion cycles. Power plant capital costs {{per unit of}} energy output can be reduced using mixtures because of increased thermal efficiency and/or decreased heat exchanger size requirements. Mixtures also potentially offer the advantage of improved performance characteristics under conditions of progressive fouling of heat exchangers. Potentially, {{a significant portion of}} the world's future energy needs can be supplied by <b>ocean</b> <b>thermal</b> energy (1). In <b>ocean</b> <b>thermal</b> energy conversion schemes, the objective is to utilize the 30 to 40 F temperature differences between warm surface sea water and cold (1000 to 2000 feet deep) sea water which occur in numerous regions in the oceans. The utilization of these ocean temperature differences for power generation was proposed before 1900 by D'Arsonval (1). An open steam cycle for <b>ocean</b> <b>thermal</b> energy conversion was proven technically but not economically feasible in 1926 by Claude (1). Currently, the closed cycle proposed by Anderson and Anderson (2) is being given major consideration for <b>ocean</b> <b>thermal</b> cycles, partly owing to the fact that use of working fluids such as propane or ammonia leads to small turbine sizes relative to turbine sizes for the open steam cycle. Noteworthy conceptual designs for <b>ocean</b> <b>thermal</b> energy conversion plants have been proposed by Heronemus et al. (3) and Zener (4). In a recent proposal, "Uses of Mixtures as Working Fluids in <b>Ocean</b> <b>Thermal</b> Energy Conversion Cycles " (K. E...|$|R
