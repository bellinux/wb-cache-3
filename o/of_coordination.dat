5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the heavy s-block elements, {{including}} strontium, a vast range <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 {{all the way to}} 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The Ca2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger.|$|E

5|$|When {{it is in}} an aqueous solution, {{neptunium}} {{can exist}} in any of its five possible oxidation states (+3 to +7) and each of these show a characteristic color. The stability of each oxidation state {{is strongly dependent on}} various factors, such as the presence of oxidizing or reducing agents, pH of the solution, presence <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> complex-forming ligands, and even the concentration of neptunium in the solution.|$|E
5|$|Actinides with {{oxidation}} state +6, {{except for the}} AnO22+-type cations, form 2−, 2− and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na2UO4 (uranate) and (NH4)2U2O7 (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides more easily form coordination compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K2ThF6, KThF5, and even K5ThF9 complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na2SO4·Th (SO4)2·5H2O), nitrates and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An2Th(NO3)6·nH2O are <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> nature, with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides. The most stable coordination compounds of actinides – tetravalent thorium and uranium – are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. acetylacetone.|$|E

5|$|As the society, Durkheim noted {{there are}} several {{possible}} pathologies {{that could lead to}} a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are anomie and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> and suicide. By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.|$|E
5|$|Atomic {{exchange}} involves {{exchange between}} an adatom and an adjacent atom within the surface lattice. As {{shown in figure}} 4, after an atomic exchange event the adatom has taken {{the place of a}} surface atom and the surface atom has been displaced and has now become an adatom. This process may take place in both heterodiffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Ni) and self-diffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Pt). It is still unclear from a theoretical point of view why the atomic exchange mechanism is more predominant in some systems than in others. Current theory points towards multiple possibilities, including tensile surface stresses, surface relaxation about the adatom, and increased stability of the intermediate {{due to the fact that}} both atoms involved maintain high levels <b>of</b> <b>coordination</b> throughout the process.|$|E
5|$|Geralda was {{the second}} cyclone in as many months to strike eastern Madagascar, after Daisy in January. Geralda {{produced}} wind gusts as strong as , which were the highest worldwide for several decades. The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding, particularly in valleys. About 80% {{of the city of}} Toamasina was destroyed, including most schools, homes, and churches. The cyclone heavily damaged roads and rail lines, which later disrupted relief efforts. In the capital Antananarivo, Geralda killed 43people after flooding many houses. Overall, more than 40,000homes were destroyed, leaving 356,000people homeless. Nationwide, the cyclone killed 231people and caused over $10million in damage (1994USD). Relief work in the storm's aftermath was hampered by lack <b>of</b> <b>coordination,</b> and the Malagasy military were deployed to help storm victims. Few stocks were pre-positioned, causing food prices to rise greatly. Several countries and departments of the United Nations donated money or supplies to the country.|$|E
