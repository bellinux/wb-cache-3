40|$|ABSTRACT This project {{discusses}} {{the development of}} <b>Keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>Touch.</b> <b>Keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>Touch</b> is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization {{which is designed to}} aid the visitation process. Visitation is concerned with children and their families who have been separated. Reasons for separation vary; however, many children have been separated and would benefit greatly from a local visitation program. Items such as children’s rights, California’s mandatory mediation law, and the current conditions of the family court house in San Bernardino County are all discussed and examined as supporting evidence to the problem of family visitation. The goal of <b>Keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>Touch</b> is to provide a comfortable environment, both physical and virtual, that encourages open communication (dialogue) between children and their families. The cultural climate of <b>Keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>Touch</b> is one that encourages, supports and nurtures the natural connection between children and their families...|$|R
