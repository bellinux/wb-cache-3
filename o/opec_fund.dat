500|$|Oil-exporting {{countries}} have used {{part of their}} petrodollar surpluses to fund foreign aid programs, as a prominent example of so-called [...] "checkbook diplomacy" [...] or [...] "petro-Islam". The Kuwait Fund was an early leader since 1961, and certain Arab nations became {{some of the largest}} donors in the years since 1974, including through the IMF and the <b>OPEC</b> <b>Fund</b> for International Development. Oil exporters have also aided poorer nations indirectly through the personal remittances sent home by tens of millions of foreign workers in the Middle East, although their working conditions are generally harsh. Even more controversially, several oil exporters have been major financial supporters of armed groups challenging the governments of other countries.|$|E

The OPEC Special Fund was conceived in Algiers, Algeria, in March 1975, and was formally established the following January. [...] "A Solemn Declaration 'reaffirmed the natural solidarity which unites OPEC countries with other developing countries in their struggle to overcome underdevelopment,' and called for measures to strengthen cooperation between these countries... resources are additional to those already made available by OPEC states through a number of bilateral and multilateral channels."

Mr. Baum {{called attention to the}} long-term nature of the commitment to agricultural research directed at increasing food security. The Group commended the 1979 Integrative Report's summary of the scientific output of the centers. It agreed to adopt the plan for doubling CGIAR resources in five years, proposed in the Report, and also to undertake a second system wide review of the CGIAR. The Group considered a CG Secretariat paper on the role of center boards, which would be an important topic for the system review. Adoption of IFPRI for funding was confirmed; its headquarters location remained under study by IFPRI. Members referred to TAC an application from ICIPE for entry to the CGIAR system. The Group discussed center cash flow problems, and the desirability of earlier donor payments, and reviewed the implementation of the recommendations of the first system review. A European donor reported on the establishment of an International Course for Development Oriented Research in Agriculture(ICRA) to equip scientists for technical assistance programs in agriculture. High level attention from the Economic Summit to agricultural research and the CGIAR and a message to the CGIAR from the President of the United States were noted.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the key problems of assessing the country’s investment climate. The {{subject in the}} light of recent political events, has received increased attention. For reasons of increasing political tensions between Russia and the West, the investment activity is significantly reduced among foreign investors in our country. Studies have shown that the main problems of the current investment climate assessment methodologies are objectivity, comprehensiveness, relevance and comparability of proposed assessments. This article provides a mechanism for solving the above problems by using a multifactor model of investment attractiveness.  The information base for the study served as the official annual statistical reports and bulletins of international organizations such as: IBCA, Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, Monetary <b>Fund,</b> <b>OPEC,</b> UNCTAD, UNESCO, World bank, etc. The key theoretical positions on the assessment of the investment climate in the country were presented the results of the analysis reports and reviews of the international consulting company Ernst and Young and Deloitte, the official Internet resource of Russian and international business publications: Euromoney, Fortune, The Economist, The Financial Times, BBC, Bloomberg, RBC, Vedomosti and Komersant.  The reliability and validity of scientific statements, conclusions and recommendations contained in this article provides the correct use of sufficient analytical and statistical information on the directions of research.  In this article, the key attention is paid to the method of mathematical modeling and forecasting. With the introduction of the multiplicative model, where the multipliers are the separately calculated factors and potential risk factors, it is planned to bring the most accurate and objective evaluation model of investment climate in the country.  The results articles as data and mathematical models will allow foreign investors to use the most objective assessment of the investment climate in the country in order to build their strategies market functioning. The article describes two methods to obtain an estimate of the investment climate, a fundamental and expertise. Studies have shown that the fundamental method provides the most accurate and objective assessment of, but not all of the investment potential factors can be subjected to mathematical evaluation. The use of expert opinion on the practice of subjectivity difficult to experts, so its use requires special care.  In modern economic practice it proved that the investment climate elements directly affect the investment decisions of companies. Improving the investment climate assessment methodology, it allows you to build the most optimal form of cooperation between investors from the host country. In today’s political tensions, this path requires clear cooperation of subjects, both in the domestic and international level. However, now, these measures will avoid the destabilization of Russia’s relations with foreign investors. </p...|$|R
