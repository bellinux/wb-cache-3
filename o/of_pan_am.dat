5|$|Germany {{was criticized}} {{severely}} {{by the international}} press for lax security measures in Frankfurt Airport that allowed Demeke to smuggle a pistol on board, and for allowing the hijacked aircraft to leave after refueling in Hannover. Frankfurt Airport, the busiest airport in Europe at the time, had recently come under fire after the bombing <b>of</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, when it had been alleged that the explosives had been loaded in Frankfurt. Since the 1988 bombing, the Frankfurt airport had performed numerous security reviews and implemented more stringent security procedures.|$|E
5|$|On January 15, 1970, First Lady of the United States Pat Nixon christened Pan Am's first 747, at Dulles International Airport (later Washington Dulles International Airport) in the {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Am</b> chairman Najeeb Halaby. Instead of champagne, red, white, and blue water was sprayed on the aircraft. The 747 entered service on January22, 1970, on Pan Am's New York–London route; the flight had been planned for the evening of January21, but engine overheating made the original aircraft unusable. Finding a substitute delayed the flight by more than six hours to the following day when Clipper Victor was used.|$|E

40|$|Wings {{and legs}} of the gregarious desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria {{have been shown to}} be release sites <b>of</b> {{phenylacetonitrile}} (<b>PAN),</b> the major adult male-produced pheromone. However, there is limited information on the distribution <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> within the locust. Here we show, using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), that PAN occurs in nearly all body parts of both adult males and females of the locust in varying amounts. <b>PAN</b> <b>was</b> 20 -fold more concentrated in males than in females. In females, <b>PAN</b> <b>was</b> concentrated more in the tarsal segments. The greatest amounts <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> <b>were</b> in 2 - and 3 -week old female and male body parts, respectively. No trace <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> <b>was</b> found in similar ages and sexes of the solitarious phase desert locust. Our results show that <b>PAN</b> <b>is</b> distributed in the body matrix of both sexes of gregarious phase locusts and suggest that no specific tissue is responsible for biosynthesis of the pheromone.

She was decommissioned 28 December 1958 and berthed with the United States Reserve Fleet at Long Beach, California. She was redesignated AVT-11, an auxiliary aircraft transport and landing training ship, on 15 May 1959. After 10 years docked at the reserve fleet, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry on 1 December 1969 and sold for scrapping on 23 March 1971 to Zidell Explorations Corporation in Portland, Oregon.|$|E

40|$|Polyamide 6 /clay nanocomposites (<b>PAn,</b> where n <b>is</b> {{the mass}} {{fraction}} of clay) with various clay loading were prepared by melt compounding in a twin screw extruder. Exfoliation of clay in a PA matrix {{was confirmed by}} X-ray diffraction. Strain amplitude response <b>of</b> <b>PAn</b> in both melt and solution states has been investigated. In the melt state, critical strain amplitude <b>of</b> <b>PAn</b> <b>is</b> sensitive to strain amplitude response and decrease logarithmically with increasing clay loading. The elastic moduli (G′) <b>of</b> <b>PAn</b> <b>are</b> reversible under frequency loop sweeps. Comparisons of strain amplitude response in both melt and solution states have been conducted. Two different responses have been observed: strain thinning in the melt state and weak strain overshoot in the solution state. FTIR studies show that amide II band <b>of</b> <b>PAn</b> shifts toward high wavenumbers, but amide I band and N–H stretching vibration are independent of clay loading. We suggest that two types of strain amplitude response <b>of</b> <b>PAn</b> can <b>be</b> explained: strain thinning which <b>is</b> dominant in <b>PAn</b> caused by physical adsorption and entanglement of PA chains on nanoclays and weak strain overshoot caused by weak bonds between PA chains and nanoclays...|$|R
40|$|Polyaniline (<b>PAN)</b> <b>was</b> {{prepared}} {{by using a}} technique of chemical synthesis to obtain the insulating emeraldine base form.

Subsequently, the high pressure using a Bridgman anvil cell was applied on the doped PAN, {{and the effect of}} high pressure on the properties <b>of</b> doped <b>PAN</b> <b>was</b> analyzed. At normal pressure, the conductivity <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> increases as the PH value increases. While at high pressures, the conductivity <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> increases, and then it becomes independent of pressure. The results indicate that the conductivity <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> <b>is</b> related to the presence of the polaron band, and the doped PAN under high pressure will be enhanced strongly in conductivity because of overlap of polaron band and π band. However, with the further increase of the applied pressure, scattering mechanisms of carriers limit the conductivity <b>of</b> <b>PAN...</b>|$|R

40|$|Peroxyacetyl nitrate (<b>PAN)</b> <b>is</b> a trace {{constituent}} of {{the atmosphere}} but plays important roles in air pollution and atmospheric chemistry. To understand the chemical and transport processes <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, measurements <b>of</b> <b>PAN,</b> its precursors and related parameters were made at a regional background site in late summer and late autumn of 2011. Despite the fairly low ambient levels <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> in general, several photochemical episodes with peak concentrations <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> and ozone (O 3) as high as 4. 86 and 189 ppbv were observed when the region was under influence of a tropical cyclone. PAN showed a seasonal variation with higher levels in autumn than in summer. PAN production efficiency, defined as the amount <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> formed per unit amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) oxidized, was examined for the polluted PRD plumes, which indicated that PAN production accounted for on average approximately {{one third of the}} NOz formation. The photochemical production efficiency <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> <b>was</b> much lower with respect to that of O 3, suggesting that ~ 2. 9 ppbv <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> could <b>be</b> produced per formation of 100 ppbv of O 3 in the PRD plumes. Varying air masses including maritime air, regional air masses from the PRD, and continental outflow from eastern China were identified, which showed different chemical signatures in terms of both pollution levels and NOz budget. The highest abundances <b>of</b> <b>PAN</b> <b>were</b> measured in the PRD air masses, compared to the lowest concentrations in the marine air.
