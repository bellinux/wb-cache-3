40|$|Family {{businesses}} play {{a significant}} role in employment creation in Ghana and the services <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> and non-family member employees are normally required. The level of commitment of these employees has gained significant research attention over the years because of its positive impact on the growth and succession <b>of</b> the <b>family</b> businesses.

A total <b>of</b> 150 <b>family</b> business employees selected from 18 family businesses in the Ashanti Region of Ghana participated in the study.

In this paper, financial performance <b>of</b> a <b>family</b> business is measured by using Return on Assets, Return on Sales and Total Debt/Total Assets ratios. The <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO is more successful as far as ROA ratios concerned, but is less successful as far as TD/TA ratios concerned, in comparison to non <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO. In other words, the non <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO is more successful as far as TD/TA ratios concerned, but is less successful as far as ROA ratios concerned, in comparison to <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO. Additionally, as far as ROS ratios concerned, {{there is no significant}} difference between <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO and non <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO. Overall, the results are consistent with the hypotheses that there is difference between ROA <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO and non <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO, and there is difference between TD/TA <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO and non <b>family</b> <b>member</b> CEO...|$|R

As she grew older, Charlotte developed a penchant for spreading gossip and causing trouble. Eager to escape from parental control, at age sixteen, she married Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Meiningen in 1878. Her husband's weak-willed personality {{had little effect on}} her. Known for spreading gossip and her eccentric personality, Princess Charlotte enjoyed Berlin society while frequently leaving her only child, Princess Feodora, in the care <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> Charlotte and Feodora, in turn, also had {{a difficult}} relationship.|$|E

5|$|Many {{art objects}} were {{produced}} in Northern China {{during the time}} of the Northern Celestial Masters. These objects were closely modeled on Buddhist designs. The image of the god (usually Laozi), would be carved on the front side of a stone stele, with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving. The inscriptions were usually prayers to the dead, a wish for the happiness <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> or wishes for political peace. The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state. This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.|$|E

In school, he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble. As a teen, he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max (1979), and decided he wanted to become an actor. However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel. His stand-up gigs in inner-city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, however, so he continued his work as a barman and waiting tables.|$|E

5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing to the absence <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment. Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation {{in support of the}} preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses, including education. Long concerned that the Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the Malian and Moroccan music preferred by younger people, in 2014, she created a Mauritanian Music Festival.|$|E
5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E
