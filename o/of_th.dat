In Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, miR-155 showed higher expression in patients' tissues and synovial fibroblasts. In multiple sclerosis, increased expression of mir-155 has also been measured in peripheral and CNS-resident myeloid cells, including circulating blood monocytes and activated microglia. It was also found that mir-155 is implicated in inflammation. Overexpression of mir-155 will lead to chronic inflammatory state in human.|$|E

Radio active thymidine was administered and Thd {{concentrations in the}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma was determined by liquid scintillation counter. Thd concentrations in the fractionated CSF which located close to the nasal cavity following intranasal (i. n.) administration were higher than that following intravenous (i. v.) administration, thus these observation suggests Thd, like other compounds, transported from nasal cavity to CSF directly following i. n. administration. The fractionated CSF concentration and the area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) following i. n. administration <b>of</b> <b>Thd</b> at 1. 338 ? 267. 6 mM were determined. The relationships between both the fractionated CSF concentration and AUC, and dose <b>of</b> <b>Thd</b> seemed dose-independent, though saturation in the transport <b>of</b> <b>Thd</b> from nasal membrane to CSF and systemic circulation was observed. The CSF concentrations and AUC following i. n. administration <b>of</b> <b>Thd</b> at a dose of 13. 38 mM with 2 '-deoxyuridine (dUrd, 25, 50 and 100 mM) or 2 '-deoxyinosine (dIno, 50 mM) were also determined.
