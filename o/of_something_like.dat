25|$|In the {{basement}} of the floor of the Rene Block Gallery in Berlin, Beuys positioned himself on the floor wrapped in a large felt blanket. Emerging from either end of the blanket were two dead hares, often seen in his performances. Around him was an installation of copper rod, felt and fat. Inside a blanket he held a microphone and for a period of eight hours grunted into the microphone as viewers watched from the doorway. The grunts are compared to those of a stag, as the stag is a symbol <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a chief. The performance directly relates and even includes elements of the Fluxus movement that Beuys was a part of. The grunting is seen in part of a composition as a reflection of suffering. Being wrapped in a felt blanket mirrors the story of his suffering and rescue by the Tartars after his plane crashed in the war.|$|E

[...] Braun's home run in that game also broke the Brewers rookie record for home runs (28). Braun hit his 30th homer in his 94th game, a pace no player had set to start a career since McGwire hit 30 in 84 games during 1986 and 1987.|$|E

[...] He also compared it {{to the work of}} The Weeknd and commended its [...] "lack of smut" [...] in the lyrics, stating [...] "it's just Usher playing it fast and loose in falsetto. The result is as subtle as it is unbelievable." [...] Eric Arredondo of Beats Per Minute viewed the song as an improvement over Usher's 2010 album Raymond v. Raymond and addressed the comparisons to The Weeknd, writing that, [...] "though it still doesn't hold much of the innovations and risks <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> The Weeknd's House of Balloons, 'Climax' can do something that most songs on that album can't do without losing most of their fun: be played on the radio." ...|$|E

Christgau, the poll's creator and supervisor, ranked it number one on his own list. Sounds also named it the year's best album, while NME ranked it fifth on its year-end list. Verlaine later said of the overwhelmingly positive response from critics, [...] "There was a certain magic happening, an inexplicable certainty <b>of</b> <b>something,</b> <b>like</b> the momentum of a freight train. That's not egoism but, if you cast a spell, you don't get flummoxed by the results of your spell." [...] By the time of Television's return to the US, however, Elektra had given up on promoting Marquee Moon, which they dismissed as a commercial failure. Marquee Moon sold fewer than 80,000 copies in the US and failed to chart on the Billboard 200. The group was dispirited by their inability to meet commercial expectations, which led to their disbandment in 1978.|$|E

However, we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers: large productions ($120–) and niche features ($5–20m). ... Fewer $30– releases are expected." [...] Fox launched a new subsidiary in 2006, Fox Atomic, to concentrate on teen-oriented genre films. The economic model was deliberately low-rent, at least by major studio standards.

500|$|Tim McCanlies {{was hired}} to write the script, though Bird was {{somewhat}} displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself. He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions. In Bird's original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies {{decided to have a}} brief scene displaying his survival, stating, [...] "You can't kill E.T. and then not bring him back." [...] McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. [...] "didn't have time to mess with us" [...] as McCanlies said. The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth. Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as [...] "paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> The Yearling." [...] Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, [...] "I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done. He’s made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He’s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he’s developed The Iron Giant. I can’t stop thinking about it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, in {{acknowledgment}} of the [...] "wealth of influences adopted by the Bungie team", a list of Bungie employees' favorite science fiction material was published on the company's website. The developers acknowledged that the Halo series' use of ring-shaped megastructures followed on from concepts featured in Larry Niven's Ringworld and Iain M. Banks' Culture series (of which Consider Phlebas and Excession {{were said to be}} particularly influential). In a retrospective article in Edge, Bungie's Jaime Griesemer commented, [...] "The influence <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> Ringworld isn't necessarily in the design– it's in that feeling of being somewhere else. That sense of scale and an epic story going on out there." [...] Griesemer also explained, [...] "One of the main sources of inspiration was Armor , in which a soldier has to constantly re-live the same war over and over again. That sense of hopelessness, a relentless battle, was influential." [...] The Flood were influenced by the assimilating alien species in Christopher Rowley's The Vang; it has also been speculated that the Master Chief's name [...] "John 117" [...] may have been a reference to a character named Jon 6725416 in Rowley's Starhammer, or to the John Spartan character of Demolition Man. An IGN article exploring the literary influences present in the Halo franchise commented on similarities between Halo and Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game: aspects of the SPARTAN Project and the design of the Covenant Drones are perceived as reminiscent of the super soldier program and Buggers found in the novel. Bungie has also acknowledged James Cameron's film Aliens as a strong cinematic influence.|$|E
