25|$|A Tribunal is a {{governmental}} body {{that makes up}} courts with a special jurisdiction. As ad hoc courts, they have specific purposes and are created in a response to certain situations. When it comes to gender-targeted crimes, tribunals hear the trials of the related crimes. Two examples of tribunals that have carried out trials of gender-targeted crimes are the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). These two tribunals have particularly focused on gender-based crimes while other tribunals have not. For example, another failure that the Tokyo Tribunal was its omission to call the female victims to give evidence at trial. The ICTR and ICTY have made improvements in regards to effectively prosecuting gender-targeted crimes and have carried out indictments that charge the accused with gender-based violence <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> rape charges. Women serve in high-level positions of both tribunals and have {{a prominent role in}} the prosecution of the gender-based crimes.

[...] I do think having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped.... I think there's also a lot of humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except maybe on Shake Your Money Maker, which was a lighter time and a lighter mood."

2500|$|The theatres were {{originally}} {{built on a}} very large scale to accommodate {{the large number of}} people on stage, as well as the large {{number of people in the}} audience, up to fourteen thousand. Mathematics played a large role in the construction of these theatres, as their designers had to be able to create acoustics in them such that the actors' voices could be heard throughout the theatre, including the very top row of seats. The Greek's understanding of acoustics compares very favourably with the current state of the art.

2500|$|Many {{public housing}} {{officials}} in the Roosevelt Administration were progressives, and had strong convictions about the right of all citizens to inexpensive, quality housing. [...] The provision of decent housing seemed to many of these officials {{to be a key}} to the preservation of democracy during the dark days of the Depression. Housing was simply too important a concern to be left only to private industry, labor, or even individual citizens; they believed it was the responsibility of the government to take the lead. [...] Sentiments such as these quickly led to the consideration of public housing programs for those <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> the low-income groups.

2500|$|Coase (1960) (referred to by Toth et al.., 2001; and Helm, 2005, p.4) {{argued that}} social costs could be {{accounted}} for by negotiating property rights according to a particular objective. Coase's model assumes perfectly operating markets and equal bargaining power among those arguing for property rights. For climate change, the property rights are for emissions (permits or quotas). However, {{it should be noted that}} other factors affect the climate <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> emissions, e.g., the ocean, forests, etc. (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, pp.28–29). In Coase's model, efficiency, i.e., achieving a given reduction in emissions at lowest cost, is promoted by the market system. This can also be looked at from the perspective of having the greatest flexibility to reduce emissions. Flexibility is desirable because the marginal costs, that is to say, the incremental costs of reducing emissions, varies among countries. Emissions trading allows emission reductions to be first made in locations where the marginal costs of abatement are lowest (Bashmakov et al.., 2001). Over time, efficiency can also be promoted by allowing [...] "banking" [...] of permits (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.30). This allows polluters to reduce emissions at a time when it is most efficient to do so.|$|E

Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy.
