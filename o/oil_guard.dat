5000|$|The Mobile Police {{are also}} intimately {{connected}} to the security apparatus of the oil corporations operating in Nigeria, particularly the Niger Delta, as the companies are required to pay the requisite salaries and expenses of Mobile Police forces engaged in the protection of oil operations. Mobile Police are designated {{to the protection of}} company assets and, although the MOPOL are under state control, companies such as Shell have admitted to supplying arms and munitions to their MOPOL conditions. This has earned the MOPOL forces charged with <b>guarding</b> <b>oil</b> facilities titles of [...] "Shell Police", [...] "Mobil Police", and others.|$|R
5000|$|A 2016 {{survey of}} the {{academic}} literature finds that [...] "most major oil price fluctuations dating back to 1973 are largely explained by shifts in the demand for crude oil". As the global economy expands, so does demand for crude oil. The authors note {{that the price of}} oil has also increased at times due to greater [...] "demand for stocks (or inventories) of crude <b>oil...</b> to <b>guard</b> against future shortages in the oil market. Historically, inventory demand has been high in times of geopolitical tension in the Middle East, low spare capacity in oil production, and strong expected global economic growth." [...] In particular, political events can have a strong influence on the oil price. Historical examples include OPEC’s 1973 embargo in reaction to the Yom Kippur War and the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Financial analysts and academics have had very few tools to study such political events compared to what is available on economic aspects of oil price formation. The PRIX index was developed in attempt to fill this gap with a metric on political developments and corresponding export trends from world’s 20 largest oil exporters.|$|R
50|$|The oil {{producing}} exclave of Cabinda (located in Zaire/DRC) was {{a separate}} colony of Portugal {{that was for}} a short while place the governorship of the Portuguese Angolan Governor. At the time of liberation, Cabinda was lumped into the Angolan custodianship and quickly absorbed by the MPLA as being part of Angola. The self-determination rights of the people of Cabinda a geographically separate nation was ignored by the MPLA and Cuban government. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Cabinda, a Cabindan separatist rebel group, attacked a Cuban base near Tshiowa on August 11. The Cuban forces repelled any attacks on the oil fields of Cabinda and placed over 2,000 soldiers <b>guarding</b> <b>oil</b> production facilities owned by American companies creating a stark irony in the Cuban publicized propaganda.|$|R
40|$|Oil spill {{modeling}} {{was performed}} using the “type A” (simplified, {{with a minimum}} of field data requirements) modeling approach and SIMAP (Spill Impact Model Analysis Package) to assess marine biological injuries and natural resource damages (NRD) for 23 spill cases identified by Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The objectives were to provide (1) an assessment of the pathways and fate of the oil, and thus, estimate exposure to the water surface, shoreline and other habitats, water column, and sediments; and (2) estimates of injuries to wildlife, aquatic organisms, and habitats that were used to scale compensatory restoration. Compensatory habitat restoration for all quantifiable wildlife, fish and invertebrate injuries was scaled using Habitat Equivalency Analysis (HEA) and wetland habitat creation as mitigation. However, this is not a direct method of increasing sea turtle production. Therefore, scaling was performed to estimate the number of hatchlings needed to compensate for the sea turtle injuries. DEP then successfully submitted claims for NRD to the US Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>Oil</b> Pollution Fund...|$|R
40|$|Purpose &ndash; The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{cyclical}} relationship between the demand for crude oil and real output for the OECD. Design/methodology/approach &ndash; The paper employs Harvey&rsquo;s structural time series model to analyse the contemporaneous and non-contemporaneous cyclical co-movement of the demand for crude oil with real output, using quarterly observations for the period 1984 : 1 - 2010 : 4. Findings &ndash; The empirical evidence suggests that a strong and positive cyclical relationship between the two variables exists, with the demand for crude oil being procyclically contemporaneous. Practical implications &ndash; The implication of this finding suggests that consuming countries cannot stockpile <b>oil</b> reserves to <b>guard</b> against the cyclical nature of demand, while producing countries face weak and bearish oil markets during economic recessions, because oil consuming countries cannot smooth out their demand for oil on an intertemporal basis. Originality/value &ndash; The paper provides further evidence supporting the procyclically contemporaneous relationship between the demand for crude oil and real output for the OECD...|$|R
2500|$|In 1914, British {{forces from}} India {{occupied}} Iranian territory {{east of the}} Shatt al-Arab waterway, to <b>guard</b> <b>oil</b> concessions in Iran and in 1915 advanced up the Tigris river to Ctesiphon near Baghdad, before being defeated by the Ottoman army and forced to retreat to Kut. During the Siege of Kut [...] the Ottomans defeated three relief attempts and refused an offer of £2,000,000 to ransom the garrison, which surrendered {{at the end of}} April. Hopes of a Russian relief force from the Caspian Sea through Kermanshah and Kanikin to Baghdad failed to materialise. From May–November 1916, the British consolidated a hold on Ottoman territory to the west of Iran around Basra and the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris {{at the head of the}} Persian Gulf. In 1917 the British campaign in Mesopotamia continued, with advances to Baghdad and towards the oilfields of Mosul as the campaign in the Levant led to the occupation of Palestine. A Russian invasion of 1915 from Caucasus established bases at Resht, Kazvin and Teheran and led to inconclusive operations between the Russians and Ottomans further west, closer to the Iranian–Ottoman border.|$|R

5000|$|Not {{providing}} {{enough troops}} to maintain order, {{which led to}} the absence of martial law after the country was conquered. The ORHA had identified at least twenty crucial government buildings and cultural sites in Bagdad, but none of the locations were protected; only the <b>oil</b> ministry was <b>guarded.</b> With no police force or national army to maintain order, ministries and buildings were looted for their desks, tables, chairs, phones, and computers. Large machines and rebars from buildings were also looted. Among those pillaged were Iraqi museums, containing priceless artifacts from some of the earliest human civilizations, which No End in Sight suggested had sent chilling signals to the average Iraqi that the American forces did not intend to maintain law and order. Eventually, the widespread looting turned into an organized destruction of Baghdad. The destruction of libraries and records, in combination with the [...] "De-Ba'athification", had ruined the bureaucracy that existed prior to the U.S. invasion. ORHA staff reported that they had to start from scratch to rebuild the government infrastructure. Rumsfeld initially dismissed the widespread looting as no worse than rioting in a major American city and archival footage of General Eric Shinseki stating his belief of the required troop numbers reveals the awareness of the lack of troops.|$|R
