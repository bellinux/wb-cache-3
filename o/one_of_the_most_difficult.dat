5|$|Forming {{three-dimensional}} lattices of DNA was {{the earliest}} goal of DNA nanotechnology, but this {{proved to be}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> to realize.

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> {{questions}} {{involving the}} right to life is when exactly life begins and ends. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it should be accorded {{the right to}} life under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional. This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Chris Carter, {{who called}} the episode one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, created the episode as a way to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. The episode contained several elaborate special effects; effects producer Mat Beck considered the sequence where Mulder has a vision of Deep Throat and his father to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> of the season.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that Labyrinth had {{a budget of}} $25 million. The film was a box office disappointment, grossing $12.9 million during its U.S. theatrical run. The commercial failure demoralized Henson {{to the extent that}} his son Brian remembered the time of the film's release as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> periods of his father's career. It would be the last feature film directed by Henson before his death in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Defender {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} titles of the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis' best contributions to the video game industry, as well as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> video games. Though not the first game to scroll horizontally, it created the genre of purely horizontal scrolling shooters. It inspired the development of other games and was followed by sequels and many imitations.|$|E
5|$|Gale Eugene Sayers (born May 30, 1943) is {{a former}} {{professional}} American football player who earned acclaim both as a halfback and return specialist in the National Football League (NFL). In a brief but highly productive NFL career, Sayers spent seven seasons with the Chicago Bears from 1965 to 1971, though multiple injuries effectively limited him to five seasons of play. He {{was known for his}} elusiveness and agility, and was regarded by his peers as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> players to tackle.|$|E
5|$|His {{character}} has {{also appeared in}} other media related to The King of Fighters franchise, including comic adaptations and The King of Fighters live-action film, and portrayed by British martial arts actor Ray Park. As the first boss character from The King of Fighters, the SNK staff created him to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> characters to defeat. His Omega Rugal form from 95 has been noted by the staff to be their favorite boss to the point they added him in the Dream Match titles. Publications for video games and other media have provided praise and criticism for Rugal's character.|$|E

5|$|Mount Guiting-Guiting in Sibuyan, the province's tallest mountain, is {{considered}} as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> climbs in the Philippines, {{and is thus}} a major destination of local mountain climbers because of its steep and jagged summit. Another a suitable place for hiking and trekking is Mount Payaopao is Tablas. Meanwhile, Banton's Guyangan Cave System, an Important Cultural Treasure, is where the Banton Cloth — the earliest known warp ikat textile in Southeast Asia — was found in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> {{aspects of}} modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching {{for evidence of}} symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors {{that would have been}} used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E
5|$|The A320 {{retained}} the dark cockpit where an indicator is off when its system is running {{to draw attention}} on dysfunctions from the A310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by Bernard Ziegler, first Airbus CEO Henri Ziegler's son. All following Airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training; for Roger Béteille, former Airbus president, this choice was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> he had ever made.|$|E

5|$|The Unicamp {{national}} exam is very competitive {{and is considered}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> in Brazil. In 2015 there were 77,145 applications for only 3,320 possible places, with 23 candidates competing for each position in an undergraduate program, an average acceptance rate of 4.3%. The exam covers all topics taught in the Brazilian high school system, including Portuguese, mathematics, Brazilian and world history, geography, biology, physics, chemistry, sociology, philosophy, arts and English. Despite that, questions in the exams are generally interdisciplinary.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} {{in response to the}} interest in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. It has received mostly positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the graphics and variations of gameplay; however, many critics were divided over the difficulty. It won six awards from the 1991 Nintendo Power Awards, and has since been renowned as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> video games ever created. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|The route was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> in {{the modern}} history of the race, with {{substantial}} criticism that it was simply too hard for a three-week-long race. Of the seven stages categorized as 'high mountain', six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at Grossglockner in Austria, the exceptionally steep Monte Zoncolan, and a tall and steep peak near the Fascia Valley in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, this one to the Nevegal. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended {{with the majority of}} the field together {{at the front of the}} race.|$|E

5|$|Kyo's appears {{repeatedly}} in the series {{at the insistence of}} the marketers and the main planners. Iori, and other SNK regulars also appear in every game, making it a challenge to decide the storyline for each title. Along with his rival Iori, it has been noted by several of the series' designers that Kyo is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> characters to illustrate because of his popularity among fans. Originally, Kyo's girlfriend, Yuki, was not meant to be conceptualized, since her first mention ever in the story was in Kyo's profile as one of his most cherished possessions. Her addition to his profile was done by one of the programmers mostly as a joke since Kyo was more popular with female gamers.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{worked on}} the {{character}} designs for the main cast. He was originally only {{going to work on}} Aya and Eve, but after seeing the settings for the other characters, he offered to design them too. The team wanted to emphasize the character's sexuality. As part of this, the team included a scene where Aya takes a shower. This was inspired by a similar scene in Parasite Eve II. When the title was being developed for PSP, the team's main challenge with the character was to make her look as realistic as possible while retaining her established physical traits. Using this new realism, the team wanted to portray the fear felt by humans when faced with such threats through Aya. Achieving this realism proved <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> aspects of development. Her alternate costumes were not a high priority for the team, so their artists had high creative freedom.|$|E
5|$|On the east, {{the first}} {{impression}} is all of rock. The long strath of Grisedale runs north-eastward to Ullswater, cutting off a series of hanging valleys which fall from the Helvellyn range. To the south east of Nethermost Pike, below the summit of High Crag, is Ruthwaite Cove. Surrounded by crag on three sides, this corrie contains Hard Tarn, a small pool on a rock shelf. This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> mountain tarns to locate, and its black algal bed and clear water combine to give the false impression of great depth. Ruthwaite Cove is now the site of Ruthwaite Lodge, a climbing hut. It was formerly the setting for more industrial activity, with the remains of several underground mines and some shallow open workings visible near the Lodge.|$|E
