40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} the determinants for getting <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> right, cognitive {{research has been conducted}} to study the process of <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> analysis. As a result, three important determinants for the correctness of requirement specifications have been identified: the knowledge of <b>information</b> analysts, <b>requirement</b> analysis techniques, and problem domains. In {{order to identify}} and explain the important variables for the correctness of requirement specifications, various cognitive models have been built on the basis of different cognitive theories such as normative models, problem solving models, mental models, and comprehension models. However, they are inadequate because they are focused on some rather than all of the three determinants. As a result, two issues related to requirement analysis techniques cannot be accounted for: First, no requirement analysis technique can consistently outperform the <b>others.</b> Second, experienced <b>information</b> analysts use multiple requirement analysis techniques in analyzing complex information systems. This research suggests that an adequate cognitive model need to meet two requirements: first, it can explicate the interactive relationships among the three determinants of <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> analysis, and second, it can explain the two unsolved issues for requirement analysis techniques The importance of an adequate cognitive model can be shown in four aspects: (1) it provides an adequate model for <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> analysis; (2) it provides a basis for empirical validation; (3) it provides a framework for viewing and comparing important aspects of <b>information</b> <b>requirement</b> analysis; and (4) it provides a theoretical basis for the design of computer-aided software engineering tools...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores global {{business}} performance outcomes {{as a result}} of aligning ERP systems capabilities to {{global business}} <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> Global business is a network of interconnected organizations that have multinational operations and exchange finished goods, raw materials, services, information, knowledge, skills and capital across national boundaries. It is a new business trend in which organisations from all industry sectors capitalize on cheap labour, low cost capital, unique resources and new market opportunities in the global economy. Global business management entails unique <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> from strategic business units (SBSs) operating {{in different parts of the}} world. Global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> include: 1) multi-level and multi-purpose information from global SBUs; 2) accurate and timely information; 3) consolidated information; 4) global business process information; 5) global supply chain information; and 6) secure information. The first three <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> are important for supporting management decisions while the other three are important for supporting global businesses’ operating decisions. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have been increasingly adopted to meet global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> ERP systems capabilities that support global business information management include multi-level and multi-purpose information management; delivering accurate, timely and consolidated information; integrating global business process information; managing global supply chain information and transmitting secure information. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) technique this research established that if two variables (global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> and ERP systems capabilities) co-align, this resulted in improved business performance. The co-alignment in this research is adopted from Venkatraman’s explanation of “fit as co-variation/co-alignment” perspective. Performance outcomes of global business {{as a result of}} co-aligning ERP systems capabilities and global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> are measured using four perspectives: financial performance; customer performance; learning and growth performance; and internal business process performance. Findings of this research supported the conceptualisation of fit from the co-alignment/co-variation perspective, confirming that the co-alignment of global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> and ERP systems capabilities leads to better business performance of global organizations. The findings also confirmed that global organisations have unique <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> that are somewhat different to local businesses. ERP systems are able to support global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> Findings also confirmed that the financial, customer, learning and growth and internal business process performance of global organizations are moderated by the organization size and the globalization history. Not only does this research fill the void in global business literature by investigating the important role information plays in global business management, but it extends the ERP literature and IT/IS alignment theories to the co-alignment of IS capabilities with global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> for improved performance outcomes. The major contribution to knowledge this research makes is the development and validation of a co-alignment model, extending theories of IT/IS alignment to the alignment of a specific information system (ERP system) to a specific type of business (global business) ...|$|R
