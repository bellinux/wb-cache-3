Two Republican incumbent Congressmen were defeated in New York state and the Democrats picked up a Republican open seat, all from Republican regions upstate, and four Republican Congressmen were defeated in Pennsylvania.

According to Skousen's nephew, Mark Skousen, Leap reflects Skousen's [...] "passion for the United States Constitution", which he [...] "felt was inspired by God and the reason behind America's success as a nation". The book is recommended by Beck as [...] "required reading" [...] to understand the current American political landscape and become a [...] "September twelfth person".
