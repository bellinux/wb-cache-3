40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) screens are {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} result of growing concern about UV radiation and skin cancer; they are also added to cosmetics and other products for light stability. Recent data on bioaccumulation in wildlife and humans point to a need for in-depth analyses of systemic toxicology, in particular with respect to reproduction and ontogeny. We examined six frequently used UVA and UVB screens for estrogenicity in vitro and in vivo. In MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, five out of six chemicals, that is, benzophenone- 3 (Bp- 3), homosalate (HMS), 4 -methyl-benzylidene camphor (4 -MBC), octyl-methoxycinnamate (OMC), and <b>octyl-dimethyl-PABA</b> (OD-PABA), increased cell proliferation with median effective concentrations (EC 50) values between 1. 56 and 3. 73 µM, whereas butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane (B-MDM) was inactive. Further evidence for estrogenic activity was the induction of pS 2 protein in MCF- 7 cells and the blockade of the proliferative effect of 4 -MBC by the estrogen antagonist ICI 182, 780. In the uterotrophic assay using immature Long-Evans rats that received the chemicals for 4 days in powdered feed, uterine weight was dose-dependently increased by 4 -MBC (ED 50 309 mg/kg/day), OMC (ED 50 935 mg/kg/day), and weakly by Bp- 3 (active at 1, 525 mg/kg/day). Three compounds were inactive by the oral route in the doses tested. Dermal application of 4 -MBC to immature hairless (hr/hr) rats also increased uterine weight at concentrations of 5 and 7. 5 % in olive oil. Our findings indicate that UV screens should be tested for endocrine activity, in view of possible long-term effects in humans and wildlife.

40|$|The {{fact that}} certain {{ultraviolet}} (UV) filters used in cosmetics display estrogenic activity prompted us to study potential actions on androgen receptors (AR) {{in the human}} breast carcinoma cell line MDA-kb 2, which expresses functional endogenous AR and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and is stably transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), methyltrienolone (R 1881), methyltestosterone, danazol, and androstenedione increased luciferase activity, with EC 50 values between 0. 11 nM (R 1881), 0. 14 nM (DHT), and 73. 5 nM (androstenedione). DHT-induced luciferase gene expression was inhibited by nonsteroidal antiandrogens, hydroxyflutamide, flutamide, bicalutamide, and vinclozolin. In contrast, the steroidal AR agonist/antagonist cyproterone actetate showed agonistic activity in the absence and presence of DHT, which was not blocked by hydroxyflutamide and thus seems not to be mediated by AR. GR-mediated activation of luciferase by dexamethasone was 100 times less potent than DHT and was not antagonized by hydroxyflutamide. The cell line was used for screening of UV filters, benzophenone- 3 (Bp- 3), benzophenone- 4, 3 -benzylidene camphor, 4 -methylbenzylidene camphor, butyl-methoxy-dibenzoylmethane, homosalate (HMS), <b>octyl-dimethyl-PABA,</b> and octyl-methoxycinnamate. Two of these, Bp- 3 and HMS, antagonized DHT-induced AR activation below cytotoxic concentrations, with IC 50 of 5. 57 10 − 6 M (HMS) and 4. 98 10 − 6 M (Bp- 3). None of the eight UV filters displayed agonistic activity when tested alone, but high concentrations of Bp- 3 induced an increase of luciferase activity {{in the presence of}} dexamethasone, which was not blocked by hydroxyflutamide or the estrogen antagonist, ICI 182, 780. These data indicate that the UV filters Bp- 3 and HMS possess antiandrogenic activity in vitro in addition to estrogenic activit...|$|E
