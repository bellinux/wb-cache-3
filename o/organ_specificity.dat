50|$|Ideally, the {{synthesis}} of the desired radiopharmaceutical from 99mTcO4, a reducing agent, and desired ligands should occur in one container after elution, and the reaction must be performed in a solvent that can be injected intravenously, such as a saline solution. Kits are available that contain the reducing agent, usually tin(II) and ligands. These kits are sterile, pyrogen-free, easily purchased, and can be stored {{for long periods of}} time. The reaction with 99mTcO4 takes place directly after elution from the generator column and shortly before its intended use. A high <b>organ</b> <b>specificity</b> is important because the injected activity should accumulate in the organ under investigation, as there should be a high activity ratio of the target organ to nontarget organs. If there is a high activity in organs adjacent to the one under investigation, the image of the target organ can be obscured. Also, high <b>organ</b> <b>specificity</b> allows for the reduction of the injected activity, and thus the exposure to radiation, in the patient. The radiopharmaceutical must be kinetically inert, in that it must not change chemically in vivo en route to the target organ.|$|E
50|$|It is {{suggested}} that a CYP- or peroxidase-mediated activation of Sudan I {{or a combination of}} both mechanisms as an explanation for the <b>organ</b> <b>specificity</b> of this carcinogen for liver and urinary bladder in animals. It must be noted that the Sudan I metabolites formed by peroxidase are much less likely to be formed at physiological conditions, because in vivo there are many nucleophilic molecules present which scavenge the Sudan I reactive species. Hence, formation of adducts of Sudan I reactive species with nucleophilic species, such as DNA, tRNA, proteins, polynucleotides, and polydeoxynucleotides seems to be the preferred reaction under physiological conditions, with deoxyguanosine as the major target for Sudan-I DNA binding, followed by deoxyadenosine.|$|E

MRI, moreover, because it produces especially clear images of well-hydrated tissue, could be a particularly effective diagnostic option for mummies that still retain humidity within tissues or organs. Therefore, in the present study, we tested MRI on a 17 th century mummy, {{one of the most}} perfectly preserved ‘hydrated mummies’ ever found in Korea, {{in order to determine the}} quality of images that could be obtained. We found that the diagnostic value of an MRI scan of the hydrated mummy was not inferior to that of a computed tomography scan. The T 1 - and T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance (MR) signals showed unique patterns not easily obtained by computed tomography, the resultant MR images revealing the <b>organ</b> <b>specificities</b> clearly. Overall, the quality of the MR images from the hydrated mummy was superb and the scientific value of MRI in the study of hydrated mummies should not be underestimated...|$|R
40|$|The {{action of}} growth hormone on {{skeletal}} tissue is mediated through somatomedin, a {{low molecular weight}} peptide found in serum. This peptide, formerly known as “sulfation factor” or “thymidine factor,” produces marked insulin-like effects in various target tissues. Since {{at least some of}} the metabolic effects of insulin on target cells are initiated by a highly specific interaction with receptors on cell membranes, this study was undertaken to determine whether somatomedin might interact with the same binding sites. It was found that somatomedin, at physiological concentrations, competes with 125 I-labeled insulin for receptor sites on isolated fat cells, liver membranes, and isolated chondrocytes, and that the relative binding affinities of insulin and somatomedin reflect the in vitro biological potencies of the two hormones in these tissues. This is the first demonstration of a peptide other than insulin, proinsulin, or derivatives of insulin competing for insulin-binding sites, and implies a structural, as well as a functional, homology between somatomedin and insulin. Somatomedin may be only one of a larger group of homologous pleiotypic peptides with different target <b>organ</b> <b>specificities...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{half-life}} of 99mTc is {{long enough}} that labelling synthesis of the radiopharmaceutical and scintigraphic measurements can be performed without significant loss of radioactivity. [...] The energy emitted from 99mTc is 140 keV, which allows {{for the study of}} deep body organs. Radiopharmaceuticals have no intended pharmacologic effect and are used in very low concentrations. Radiopharmaceuticals containing 99mTc are currently being applied in the determining morphology of organs, testing of organ function, and scintigraphic and emission tomographic imaging. The gamma radiation emitted by the radionuclide allows organs to be imaged in vivo tomographically. Currently, over 80% of radiopharmaceuticals used clinically are labelled with 99mTc. A majority of radiopharmaceuticals labelled with 99mTc are synthesized by the reduction of the pertechnetate ion in the presence of ligands chosen to confer <b>organ</b> <b>specificity</b> of the drug.

50|$|Recently, new gastric (H. suis and H. baculiformis) and {{enterohepatic}} (H. equorum) {{species have}} been reported. H. pylori is of primary importance for medicine, but non-H. pylori species, which naturally inhabit mammals (except humans) and birds, have been detected in human clinical specimens. These encompass two (gastric and enterohepatic) groups, showing different <b>organ</b> <b>specificity.</b> Importantly, some species, such as H. hepaticus, H. mustelae, and probably H. bilis, exhibit carcinogenic potential in animals. They harbour many virulence genes and may cause diseases not only in animals, but also in humans. Gastric species such as H. suis (most often), H. felis, H. bizzozeronii, and H. salomonis {{have been associated with}} chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers in humans and, importantly, with higher risk for MALT lymphoma compared to H. pylori. Enterohepatic species e.g., H. hepaticus, H. bilis, and H. ganmani, have been detected by PCR, but still are not isolated from specimens of patients with hepatobiliary diseases. Moreover, they may be associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The significance of avian helicobacters (H. pullorum, H. anseris, and H. brantae) also has been evaluated extensively. H. cinaedi and H. canis can cause severe infections, mostly in immunocompromised patients with animal exposure. Briefly, the role of these species in veterinary and human medicine is increasingly recognised. Several other topics such as isolation of still uncultured species, antibiotic resistance and treatment regimens for infections and pathogenesis and possible carcinogenesis in humans should be evaluated.|$|E

40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for biotechnological improvements of storage roots is {{the availability of}} tissue-specific promoters enabling high expression of transgenes. In this work, we cloned two genomic fragments, pMe 1 and pDJ 3 S, controlling {{the expression of a}} gene with unknown function from cassava (Manihot esculenta) and of the storage protein dioscorin 3 small subunit gene from yam (Dioscorea japonica), respectively. Using ?-glucuronidase as a reporter, the activities of pMe 1 and pDJ 3 S were evaluated in independent transgenic carrot lines and compared to the constitutive CaMV 35 S and the previously described cassava p 15 promoters. Activities of pMe 1 and pDJ 3 S in storage roots were assessed using quantitative GUS assays that showed pDJ 3 S as the most active one. To determine <b>organ</b> <b>specificities,</b> uidA transcript levels in leaves, stems and roots were measured by real-time RT-PCR analyses showing highest storage root specificity for pDJ 3 S. Root cross sections revealed that pMe 1 was highly active in secondary xylem. In contrast, pDJ 3 S was active in all root tissues except for the central xylem. The expression patterns caused by the cassava p 15 promoter in carrot storage roots were consistent with its previously described activities for the original storage organ. Our data demonstrate that the pDJ 3 S and, to a lesser extent, the pMe 1 regulatory sequences represent feasible candidates to drive high and preferential expression of genes in carrot storage roots.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the authors {{investigated}} 9 cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) syndrome (group I) and 32 cases not diagnosed as DIC (group II) in a clinical, hematological and pathohistological point of view. The results obtained are as follows : (1) The occurrence of bleeding considered {{to be caused by}} DIC were observed in all cases in group I and in half the cases of group II. (2) In group II, fibrin thrombi were demonstrated in 31. 3 % of cases, while fibrin thrombi were demonstrated in 89 % cases of group I. These results may suggest that DIG is not an uncommon complication. (3) In both groups the number of fibrin thrombi identified was high in lung and kidney, and their pathological properties and <b>organ</b> <b>specificities</b> were almost similar in both groups. (4) Fibrin thrombi observed in human DIC cases was susceptible to secondary fibrinolysis and their properties were almost identical to that experimentally induced in rabbits by endotoxin, reported in the preceding paper. (5) Morphologically the fibrin thrombi demonstrated in human DIC cases were mainly of a tangled or massed type. In autopsied specimens, the fibrin thrombi seemed to be changed from a tangled or massed type to spotty, amorphous, globular, reticular or waste thread type in the course of secondary fibrinolysis. Even in the cases not suspected as DIC, a careful observation is required to demonstrate fibrin thrombi, especially when they are suspected to have underlying diseases inclined to complicate with DIC...|$|R

Results We designed the Integrated Pathway Analysis Database for Systematic Enrichment Analysis (IPAD, [URL]), defining inter-association between pathway, disease, drug and <b>organ</b> <b>specificity,</b> based on six criteria: 1) comprehensive pathway coverage; 2) gene/protein to pathway/disease/drug/organ association; 3) inter-association between pathway, disease, drug, and organ; 4) multiple and quantitative measurement of enrichment and inter-association; 5) assessment of enrichment and inter-association analysis with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources; and 6) cross-linking of multiple available data sources. IPAD is a comprehensive database covering about 22, 498 genes, 25, 469 proteins, 1956 pathways, 6704 diseases, 5615 drugs, and 52 organs integrated from databases including the BioCarta, KEGG, NCI-Nature curated, Reactome, CTD, PharmGKB, DrugBank, PharmGKB, and HOMER. The database has a web-based user interface that allows users to perform enrichment analysis from genes/proteins/molecules and inter-association analysis from a pathway, disease, drug, and organ. Moreover, the quality of the database was validated with the context of the existing biological knowledge and a "gold standard" constructed from reputable and reliable sources. Two case studies were also presented to demonstrate: 1) self-validation of enrichment analysis and inter-association analysis on brain-specific markers, and 2) identification of previously undiscovered components by the enrichment analysis from a prostate cancer study. Conclusions IPAD is a new resource for analyzing, identifying, and validating pathway, disease, drug, <b>organ</b> <b>specificity</b> and their inter-associations. The statistical method we developed for enrichment and similarity measurement and the two criteria we described for setting the threshold parameters can be extended to other enrichment applications. Enriched pathways, diseases, drugs, organs and their inter-associations can be searched, displayed, and downloaded from our online user interface. The current IPAD database can help users address a wide range of biological pathway related, disease susceptibility related, drug target related and <b>organ</b> <b>specificity</b> related questions in human disease studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the molecular mechanisms of hormonal control of growth, we constructed a subtracted cDNA library enriched for sequences expressed {{more in a}} hormone-autonomous, radiation-induced tumor tissue line of Arabidopsis thaliana than in normal, hormone-dependent callus. Ten cDNA clones, which are expressed 1. 3 - to 10 -fold more in the tumor line, were isolated and partially characterized. The clones differ greatly in their level of expression in tumor tissue and in their pattern of expression in plant organs. Southern blot hybridization and sequence analysis showed that this group contains three pairs of closely related clones. Northern blot analysis indicates that one pair of clones represents two members of a gene family that are expressed in different plant organs. One of the isolated sequences shows strong sequence similarity to a cDNA encoding a lipid transfer protein. Two sequences are highly {{similar to those of}} previously described membrane channel proteins but have different <b>organ</b> <b>specificities.</b> Two other cDNAs have significant sequence similarity to glycine-rich proteins and hydroxy-proline-rich glycoproteins. When used to probe Southern blots, none of the cDNAs identified polymorphisms between tumor and callus DNA, which might be expected if their overexpression were due to local genome rearrangements induced by radiation. The diversity observed among these 10 clones suggests that some are likely to be involved in tumorous growth and not simply specific to a certain cell or tissue type present in the tumor...|$|R
40|$|The {{mixture of}} PBBs in FireMaster BP- 6 has been {{demonstrated}} to constitute potent inducers of hepatic and extrahepatic mixed function oxidase (MFO) enzymes. Chronic dietary administration of PBBs to mature female rats results in a "mixed" pattern of induction, with increases in both cytochrome P- 450 and P 1 - 450 associated enzymes. Acute administration of PBBs (150 mg/kg IP) to mature female rats resulted in a time-dependent induction of MFO activities; the P- 450 -dependent enzymes were simulated early (24 - 48 hr after administration) while the P 1 - 450 dependent enzymes reached maximal activities at later time points. However, studies of the kinetics and patterns of inhibition of the induced enzymes along with gel electrophoresis studies of the microsomal proteins indicate that PBBs may induce different proteins from those induced by the classical P- 450 and P 1 - 450 inducers, phenobarbital and 3 -methylcholanthrene. In addition, the pattern of enzyme induction caused by PBBs in developing rats differs from that in adults, in that the P 1 - 450 -associated enzymes are stimulated prior to the P- 450 -associated enzymes. The overall pattern of enzyme induction in extrahepatic tissue differs from that seen in the liver and sex differences in enzyme induction have also been demonstrated. As modifications of MFO activity may alter the toxicity of chemicals, {{these findings suggest that}} the toxicity of chemicals may be altered in animals exposed to PBBs and that these toxicities may exhibit age, sex, and <b>organ</b> <b>specificities</b> different from those seen in control animals...|$|R

Male rats were given N-butyl-N 44 -hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) for 4 weeks and then one of 16 test chemicals for 32 to 34 weeks. Saccharin, ascorbate, DL-tryptophan, allopurinol, and diphenyl promoted development of PN hyperplasia. The dose-response of the promoters were examined in both sexes of rats by administration of saccharin at doses of 0. 04, 0. 2, 1. 0 and 5. 0 % for 32 weeks after BBN treatment. The occurrence of PN hyperplasia was significantly increased in the group given 5 % saccharin. Dose-response curves showed enhanced hyperplastic responses in both sexes given 0. 2 to 5 % saccharin. The <b>organ</b> <b>specificities</b> of promoters were studied in rats initiated with BBN or 2 -acetylaminofluorene (2 -AAF) followed by phenobarbital or saccharin for 32 weeks. Phenobarbital greatly enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis. Saccharin significantly enhanced the occurrence of both BBN-induced and 2 -AAF-induced PN hyperplasia. However, there was no effect of phenobarbital on the urinary bladder or of saccharin on the liver. The rats showed a strain difference in susceptibility of the urinary bladder to saccharin; ACI rats were most susceptible and Sprague Dawley rats were most resistant to saccharin.

40|$|The isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway (IBP) {{has been}} highly implicated {{in a number}} of {{cellular}} malignancies, including proliferation, invasion, and migration. Epidemiological studies have found clinically relevant inhibitors of the IBP, such as the statin family and nitrogenous bisphosphonates, reduce the risk of prostate cancer advancement. In vitro work has implicated statin 2 ̆ 7 s and nitrogenous bisphosphonate 2 ̆ 7 s inhibition of GGPP and protein geranylgeranylation as the components responsible for their reduction of prostate cancer progression. However, their depletion of nearly all isoprenoid intermediates as well as their <b>organ</b> <b>specificities</b> make understanding the specific role of protein geranylgeranylation in prostate cancer metastasis impossible. Consequently, we have developed a novel library of seven alkyl bisphosphonate ethers found to potently reduce GGDPS with little to no activity against the related FDPS enzyme. Inhibition of GGDPS in three human prostate cancer cell lines reduced GGPP and protein geranylgeranylation without affecting protein farnesylation, translating into a reduction in cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, the GGDPS inhibitors reduced protein geranylgeranylation at lower concentrations in the highly metastatic PC 3 cell line as compared to the less metastatic LNCaP and 22 Rv 1 cell lines. Additionally, the PC 3 cell line was found to have higher levels of endogenous IBP intermediates as compared to the less metastatic cells. Translation in vivo using two murine models of human prostate cancer metastasis found a reduction in soft tissue tumor burden that corresponded to a biochemical reduction in protein geranylgeranylation. In conclusion, selective reduction of GGPP and protein geranylgeranylation was sufficient to reduce the metastatic potential of prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Chromatin glycoproteins {{recognized}} by Concanavalin A have been isolated from pig liver, kidney and heart {{by the use}} of immobilized lectin. Two groups of proteins differing in affinity for DNA have been analysed. Glycoproteins are mainly present in the group of proteins which are tightly bound to DNA. Mono and bidimensional electrophoretic patterns of total tightly bound proteins reveal a similarity among the three organs examined, while the corresponding patterns of the glycoproteins are typical for each <b>organ.</b> The tissue <b>specificity</b> of chromatin glycoproteins, together with their capability to interact not only with DNA but possibly also with other nuclear components, suggest a role for these proteins in the mechanism of genome expression...|$|R
40|$|Bullous pemphigoid is {{characterized}} by the presence of both circulating and tissue-fixed antibasement-membrane zone (BMZ) antibody. The present study determined the <b>organ</b> location and <b>specificity</b> of antibody fixed in vivo from a patient who died with active pemphigoid. Direct immunofluorescence (IF) of several organs revealed BMZ antibody only in the skin, esophagus, and vagina. BMZ antibody, however, was eluted with citric acid buffer (pH 2. 2) from skin, esophagus, vagina, and trachea. The eluted antibody was similar to the circulating pemphigoid antibody in terms of IgG subclass, tubular pattern, and inability to fix complement. However, the two antibodies do not seem to share the same antigenic site or at least do not share equal affinity for the antigenic sites. Complement studies revealed activation of both the classic and the alternate pathways within the tissue and reduction of all complement components within the blister fluid...|$|R
