Elected to the United States House <b>of</b> <b>Representatives</b> <b>in</b> 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy and opposed the Mexican–American War. After a single term, he returned to Illinois and resumed his successful law practice. Reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new Republican Party, which had a statewide majority in Illinois. As part of the 1858 campaign for US Senator from Illinois, Lincoln took part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival, Democrat Stephen A.

In 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state, though most delegates originally favored other candidates.

After non-combat service during the Mexican–American War, {{he was elected}} as a Democrat to the Kentucky House <b>of</b> <b>Representatives</b> <b>in</b> 1849, where he took a states' rights position against interference with slavery. Elected to the U.S. House <b>of</b> <b>Representatives</b> <b>in</b> 1850, he allied with Stephen A. Douglas {{in support of the}} Kansas–Nebraska Act.

In 1859, he was elected to succeed Senator John J. Crittenden at the end of Crittenden's term in 1861. As vice president, Breckinridge joined Buchanan in supporting the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for Kansas, which led to a split in the Democratic Party.|$|E
