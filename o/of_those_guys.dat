500|$|Due to his non-ideal size as a pitcher, {{some have}} seen issues in Loup's stamina and durability. His pitches can also {{come across as}} [...] "a bit too hittable." [...] He is, however, {{especially}} effective when pitching against left-handed batters. In 2013, Loup was viewed by the Blue Jays' manager John Gibbons as [...] "not necessarily a long guy; he's more a situational, one-inning guy." [...] Despite his shortcomings, Loup has the lowest walk rate among all major league pitchers who have pitched at least seventy innings since 2012, having walked only 2.6% of the batters he has faced.

He eventually changed the goal into meeting William Shatner, the actor who played Captain Kirk. Shatner had written a book on the science of Star Trek, and had gone to Pausch for help with the virtual reality section of the book. Pausch met and worked with Shatner for this purpose.

Both of his parents were natives of Ghana in West Africa, and Papa began playing soccer. He could not skate, meaning he {{struggled}} with ice hockey, Canada's most popular sport. Oppong said, [...] "Soccer is really popular in Africa, so my dad got me into soccer. Basketball is more of my love.

He wrote, produced, and performed, and that's the way I wanted to do it." [...] For the album, D'Angelo and the production personnel utilized antiquated, vintage equipment, including Wurlitzer musical instruments and dated effects boxes, as well as modern electronic devices such as drum machines and computers. Notable instruments used by D'Angelo were the Fender Rhodes electric piano and the Hammond organ. The album was later mastered by engineer Herb Powers Jr. at The Hit Factory mastering studio in New York City.|$|E

Motley and Willis, however, were sometimes stepped on and called names during games. [...] "Sometimes I wanted to just kill some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys,</b> and the officials would just stand right there," [...] Motley said many years later. [...] "They'd see those guys stepping on us and heard them saying things and just turn their backs.

[...] Motley and Willis did not travel to one game against the Miami Seahawks in the Browns' early years after they received threatening letters. Another time in Miami, Motley and Willis were told they were not welcome at the hotel where the team was staying. Brown threatened to relocate the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down.|$|E

500|$|On {{top of his}} {{technical}} talent, Friday {{was physically}} very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries. According to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle. He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: [...] "When {{he was in the}} line-up you'd have a centre-forward and a centre-half; not only would he be up there running them ragged, but when it broke down he'd be the first person to start tackling back". He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as [...] "really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see what I can do with it'". On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a teammate. [...] "We didn't need anyone else up front", Hurley later said. [...] "They couldn't get the ball off him. He was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> who could beat five players easily". Andrews agreed: [...] "once he'd got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him".|$|E

500|$|Corey Taylor {{explained}} that the phrase [...] "All Hope Is Gone" [...] is aimed at the fans' expectations of the band, further elaborating, [...] "Just when you thought you had us figured out, give up all hope because you're never, ever going to." [...] Throughout the album, Taylor incorporates a focus on politics in his lyrics, compared to Slipknot's previous albums. The opening track, [...] ".execute.", features Taylor's response to former United States Vice President Spiro Agnew's speech targeted at Vietnam War protesters. and the second track [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] follows in the same vein. During an interview with Kerrang!, Taylor discussed the song's lyrical content, explaining, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} people who are disguising politics as religion and dictating taste and turning it into policy. And that hurts me." [...] Reviewing for IGN, Jim Kaz said that lyrically, [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] gives the listener a [...] "heaping dose of Corey Taylor's caustic bravado". On the track [...] "Wherein Lies Continue", Taylor offers a [...] "dressing down of the world as we know it", explaining, [...] "It kinda goes up against any civilization that takes themselves way too seriously and where the 'leaders' are so pretentious that they think they are deemed to speak for the people." [...] He also proclaimed, [...] "It wouldn't be a Slipknot album if I didn't rag on the recording industry."

500|$|The {{character}} David Robert Jones is {{a reference}} to English musician David Bowie, who was born with that name. [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] was the first appearance of the character. When actor Jared Harris was first cast for the part, he was told Jones was [...] "possibly a major, important character", {{as indicated by the}} episode's title. Whether his character would make a reappearance later in the season depended on how well received Jones was by the show's audience, Harris' performance, and if the writers felt they had more to tell about the character. [...] Harris later described Jones in a May 2009 interview, [...] "I think you could sense that there was a great bit of ambiguity about the character which was useful. He's a bad guy that might be on the right side. He just might be fighting for the good guys. Those guys are always great parts because you leave the audience guessing about what side he's really on. He's one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> that if he's fighting for the right cause, he's a tremendous ally. But if he's fighting on the wrong cause, he's a formidable opponent. He's an anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause". Harris asserted in a February 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract, meaning that the character was not meant to be permanent. He affirmed this by believing the character's personality rendered Jones incapable of joining the regular cast, [...] "You'd have to keep [...] chained like a dog. You couldn't let him loose. You certainly couldn't let him use his hands. You know what the f--k he'd do".|$|E
500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E

TV fans of this era usually best remember his role as Henshaw, Sergeant Bilko’s right-hand man on that show. “He was proudest of that show,” Amalia Melvin said. “I think the camaraderie <b>of</b> all <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> made it such a pleasant way to work.

Tom Kenny cited Looney Tunes and SCTV as influences for the show, and also stated [...] "I'm sure if you asked Joe Murray or Mr. Lawrence or any <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys,</b> especially in terms of animation, the weirdest cartoons would of course be our favorites—those weird '30s Fleischer brothers Betty Boop cartoons and stuff like that." ...|$|E
25|$|Grisettes {{appeared}} in many caricatures of bohemian Paris, {{most notably in}} those by Daumier and Gavarni, {{as well as in}} illustrations of novels about them, such as Gerald du Maurier's own engravings for Trilby. The artist and war correspondent, Constantin Guys, frequently portrayed them in his sketches of Parisian life during the Second French Empire. A grisette likewise became the subject of one of Edward Hopper's early watercolours, painted in Paris in 1906. Hopper's portrayal, like several <b>of</b> <b>those</b> by <b>Guys,</b> shows the grisette wearing a traditional seamstress apron. However, their slightly raised skirts (particularly in the Guys sketches) and provocative poses also allude to the association of grisettes with prostitution.|$|R

The King dismissed the accusations as absurd, pointing out that Belasyse was so afflicted with gout that he could hardly stand, while Arundell and Stafford had not been on speaking terms for 25 years, and were most unlikely to be intriguing together; but Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury had the lords arrested and sent to the Tower on 25 October 1678. Seizing upon the anti-Catholic tide, Shaftesbury publicly demanded that the King's brother, James, be excluded from the royal succession, prompting the Exclusion crisis. On 5 November 1678, people burned effigies of the Pope instead <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guy</b> Fawkes.
