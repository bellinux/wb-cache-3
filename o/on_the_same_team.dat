5|$|Jair played <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>team</b> as Diego, {{and was a}} slimmer, more {{technically}} able player, but {{had less}} focus; the two were often not fielded {{at the same time}} in order to prevent arguments.

5|$|Since 1957, {{there have}} been five Gold Glove batteries. The pitcher and catcher, collectively known as the battery, {{are the only two}} players on the field {{involved}} in every pitch. In particular, the pitcher and catcher control the running game with tools such as pickoffs or the strength of the catcher's throwing arm. The first pitcher and catcher <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>team</b> to win Gold Gloves in the same year were Jim Kaat and Earl Battey, with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. Only two pairs of batterymates have won Gold Gloves together more than once: Iván Rodríguez and Kenny Rogers won with the Texas Rangers in 2000, and again with the Detroit Tigers in 2004 and 2006. Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright matched the feat, winning in both 2009 and 2013.|$|E

50|$|Sports were emphasized. In {{the early}} years masters played with boys <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>teams,</b> and <b>the</b> {{traditional}} football rivalry with Groton was slowly expanded to include the English game of “fives”, baseball, and other sports.|$|R

5|$|Virginia Tech {{featured}} {{an unusual}} two-quarterback system on offense, as quarterbacks Sean Glennon and Tyrod Taylor shared time behind center. Though unusual, {{the system was}} successful in leading the Hokies to their second ACC Championship in fouryears. During the 2007regular season, Glennon threw for 1,636yards and 11touchdowns, completing 63percent of his passes. Taylor, meanwhile, passed for 916yards and fivetouchdowns while also rushing for 431yards. Some pundits predicted that Kansas might have difficulty with Taylor's mobility, as his style of play {{was similar to that}} of Missouri's Chase Daniel, who gave Kansas its sole loss of the 2007season. On {{the other end of the}} Virginia Tech aerial offense was a corps of capable receivers, led by senior wide receivers Eddie Royal and Josh Morgan. Morgan was the fifth-ranked receiver in Virginia Tech history, having earned 1,787receiving yards. Royal was sixth, having earned 1,767yards. Two of Tech's other receivers, Josh Hyman and Justin Harper, recorded 1,138and 1,274receiving yards each, marking the first time in Virginia Tech history that the Hokies had four different thousand-yard career receivers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>team.</b> On the ground, the Hokies were led by running back Branden Ore, who rushed for 876yards and eighttouchdowns during the regular season. One week before the Orange Bowl, Tech coaches revealed that Ore would be suspended for the first quarter of the game against Kansas as punishment for showing up late to the Hokies' final pre-bowl practice. Ore was replaced by sophomore rusher Kenny Lewis Jr.|$|E

Menchov and Evans performed far below the levels expected of them, finishing 51st and 30th respectively, and Sastre only showed briefly among the leaders on the mountain stages that would have provided his best chance of making a bid for victory, coming 17th overall.|$|E
25|$|Netball {{strategy}} involves {{several types}} of passes, including centre passes, penalty passes and short passes. A centre pass occurs after a goal has been scored, when the Centre passes the ball. A short pass is a pass between two players <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>team,</b> where {{the length of the}} pass is so short that a defensive player cannot get between the two opposing players to intercept the ball. A penalty pass is a pass where the ball is returned from the sideline into play. This pass occurs after a penalty has been called.|$|E

50|$|The International Volleyball Association {{was a short}} lived co-ed {{professional}} volleyball {{league in}} the United States from 1975 to 1980.

50|$|Few team/driver changes {{occurred}} during the off-season, {{and most of the}} key fixtures from 1990 remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>teams.</b> Among <b>the</b> few changes, Danny Sullivan departed Penske Racing, and joined the Pat Patrick Alfa Romeo effort. Rick Mears' familiar Pennzoil Z-7 Special livery was gone for 1991, as the Penske team (Mears and Fittipaldi) became a two-car team with Marlboro sponsoring both cars.|$|R
25|$|Lippi {{confirmed}} his squad for the match {{at a press}} conference at the headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels on 12 March, at which UEFA President Michel Platini, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Manchester United director Sir Bobby Charlton were also present. At the press conference, Lippi revealed that Zinedine Zidane had been approached to come out of retirement to play in the game, but the French midfielder had declined. Zidane's reasons were not made public, but it is believed {{that he did not want}} to play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>team</b> as Marco Materazzi, whom he had infamously headbutted in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final.|$|E
25|$|The commissioner's office {{reviews the}} {{application}} for Gateway Players, verifying {{that the college}} teammate does not have prior St. Louis affiliations; no other options {{to stay in the}} city. Each applicant must also agree to play in a minimum number of games to qualify. If the request is approved, one registration fee is refunded and the two college teammates operate as a package deal. Both must play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>team,</b> like brothers in a Little League program. If any manager wants to claim one, they receive the other, but it costs the team two recruiting chips. If the Gateway Players go unsigned in the offseason, they will enter the draft, and must be selected in back-to-back rounds.|$|E

25|$|On January 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Sosa to the Baltimore Orioles in {{exchange}} for infielder/outfielder Jerry Hairston, Jr., infielder Mike Fontenot, and RHP Dave Crouthers. To facilitate the deal, Sosa and his agent agreed to waive the clause that guaranteed his 2006 salary, and the players' union indicated it would not object to that agreement. Under the deal, Sosa earned $17,875,000 for the 2005 season, with the Cubs paying $7 million of his salary. By playing for the 2005 Orioles alongside fellow 500-home-run batter Rafael Palmeiro, Sosa and Palmeiro became the first 500 home run club members in history to play together <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>team</b> after reaching the 500 home run plateau.|$|E
25|$|In October 1983, {{original}} {{team owner}} Sam Schulman sold the SuperSonics to Barry Ackerley, initiating {{a period of}} decline and mediocrity for the franchise. 1984 saw Fred Brown retire after playing 13 productive seasons, all with Seattle. His career reflected much of the SuperSonics' history to that time, having been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>team</b> roster as Rule and Wilkens during his rookie season, playing a key role on Seattle's first playoff teams, and being the team's important sixth man during the championship series years. In recognition of his many contributions to the team, Brown's number was retired in 1986. Lenny Wilkens left the organization following the 1984–85 season, and when Jack Sikma was traded after the 1985–86 season, the last remaining tie to the SuperSonics' championship team (aside from trainer Frank Furtado) had been severed.|$|E
25|$|While at Greenville, Thompson met Elizabeth Mahon, {{a talented}} {{player with the}} same passion for baseball, with whom she started a close friendship.

With the prospect of making the $60 per week that was being paid {{to the members of the}} established teams, which was a vast sum of money then, the two Greenville girls decided to try their hand in the new circuit, obtaining full-time jobs in the AAGPBL for the 1944 season. Thompson was assigned to the Milwaukee Chicks, while Mahon joined the Minneapolis Millerettes, becoming the only South Carolina ballplayers in AAGPBL history. Mahon died in 2001 at the age of 82.|$|E

25|$|The Wings {{were quickly}} {{selected}} as favorites {{to win the}} Stanley Cup and they were right. With so much talent on one team, including the first time three 500-goal scorers were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>team,</b> they quickly {{got off to a}} great start, winning 22 of their first 27 games.

After the Canucks took the first 2 games, it looked like the Canucks were going to sweep the Red Wings and the Red Wings were going to have their 2nd straight early exit. Their Captain, Steve Yzerman gave a closed-door speech to the team. Only the players in the locker room knew what was said, but the Wings headed to Vancouver and won four straight games to take the series.|$|E
25|$|The match {{started with}} the first two {{competitors}} in the ring, the two wrestlers who are next in the rotation were on the apron and the remaining eight wrestlers were on the floor on their respective sides of the ring. The first elimination came at 6:14 when Volador Jr. pinned Luciferno, giving the tecnico side a six-on-five advantage. At 10:15 Bárbaro Cavernario pinned Titán to even the sides. At one point Dragon Lee and Mephisto collided mid ring, allowing Hechicero to pin Dragon Lee while Volador Jr. pinned Mephisto {{at the same time}} for a double elimination. Late in the match Volador Jr. and Carístico bumped into each other during the match and started to argue and push each other around despite being <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>team.</b> The argument was broken up by Místico to allow the match to continue.

Euforia forced Volador Jr. to submit, followed by Ángel de Oro quickly pinning Euforia to win the match and become a three time Rey del Aire winner.|$|E
25|$|Target started {{sponsoring}} stock cars in 2001 with Sterling Marlin when Chip Ganassi {{bought into}} the Felix Sabates stock car team. In the 2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season, the No. 41 Chip Ganassi Target car was driven by Jimmy Spencer, and from 2003 to 2005, Casey Mears drove the car. In 2006, Reed Sorenson took over the No. 41 when Mears moved to a different Chip Ganassi car <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>team.</b> Sorenson drove the car through the 2008 season, and Target has also had some major sponsorship time on the Ganassi Racing No. 40 car with Dario Franchitti and Jeremy Mayfield who subbed for the injured Franchitti. The 40 team has since been shut down. For 2009, the Target sponsorship moved to the No. 42 driven by Juan Pablo Montoya with the newly formed Earnhardt Ganassi Racing. Target also sponsored Earnhardt Ganassi Racing's No. 8 car driven by Aric Almirola, which it co-sponsors in some races with other sponsors such as Guitar Hero and TomTom until the team was disbanded in May 2009.
