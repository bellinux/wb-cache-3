2500|$|Around 1993, Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{linguistics}} {{professor and}} political commentator Noam Chomsky praised the film {{because of the}} way people were portrayed doing the real work of unions. According to Chomsky: [...] "he real work is being done by people who are not known, that's always been true in every popular movement in history...I don't know how you get that across in a film. Actually, come to think of it, there are some films that have done it. I mean, I don't see a lot of visual stuff, so I'm not the best commentator, but I thought Salt of the Earth really did it. It was a long time ago, but at the time I thought that it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>really</b> great movies—and of course it was killed, I think it was almost never shown." ...|$|E
2500|$|... – In a {{telegram}} addressed to Karl von Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, Pope Benedict XVI offered his condolences to the House of Habsburg. Benedict praised Otto von Habsburg as [...] "a great European" [...] {{who had worked}} tirelessly for peace, the coexistence of peoples and a just order in Europe. [...] "In the hour of grief over this tragic loss, I associate myself with you and the entire imperial family in prayer for the deceased. In a long and fulfilling life, Archduke Otto was {{a witness to the}} eventful history of Europe," [...] the Pope wrote. Cardinal Renato Martino remembered Otto as one of the twentieth century's [...] "greatest defenders" [...] of the Catholic faith and human dignity, stating that his father, [...] "Blessed Karl of Austria, instilled in him from an early age that the office of a ruler is one of holy service and selfless sacrifice {{for the good of the}} peoples entrusted to him. It was a philosophy that would influence him all his life." [...] Cardinal Christoph Schönborn said that [...] "Otto von Habsburg was without doubt <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>really</b> great Europeans," [...] and that he should be regarded as one of the [...] "architects of the European idea and of European integration" [...] together with Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, and Alcide De Gasperi. Schörnborn regretted that it had taken so much time for Austria to show [...] "the reasonable gratitude towards the House of Habsburg, which Austria owes so incredibly much" [...] and whose [...] "political and cultural heritage we consume today." ...|$|E

Already [...] "industrial discontent" [...] has attained to the magnitude of war. It is important, then, that there be an understanding of principles and purposes. As the combatants will not define their positions truthfully by words, let us see if it can be inferred from the actions which are said to speak more plainly.

2500|$|Boucher and McComas were {{disappointed}} by the novel, saying that despite Asimov's good ideas, [...] "his heavy treatment and routine plot are disappointing. L.

6000|$|... 'Then, {{going up}} a broad staircase, {{we came to}} what may once have been a gallery of {{technical}} chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case. And at last, in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>really</b> air-tight cases, I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. [...] "Dance," [...] I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena's huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling The Land of the Leal as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a modest cancan, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally inventive, as you know.|$|E
6000|$|Some apology may {{be thought}} {{due to the}} reader, for an {{endeavour}} to engage his attention on a subject of which no profound study seems compatible with the work in which I am usually employed. But profound study is not, in this case, necessary either to writer or reader, while accurate study, {{up to a certain}} point, is necessary for us all. Political economy means, in plain English, nothing more than [...] "citizens' economy"; and its first principles ought, therefore, to be understood by all who mean to take the responsibility of citizens, as those of household economy by all who take the responsibility of householders. Nor are its first principles in the least obscure: they are, many of them, disagreeable in their practical requirements, and people in general pretend that they cannot understand, because they are unwilling to obey them; or, rather, by habitual disobedience, destroy their capacity of understanding them. But there is not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>really</b> great principles of the science which is either obscure or disputable--which might not be taught to a youth as soon as he can be trusted with an annual allowance, or to a young lady as soon as she is of age to be taken into counsel by the housekeeper.|$|E
60|$|The Bohuns {{were one}} of the very few aristocratic {{families}} really dating from the Middle Ages, and their pennon had actually seen Palestine. But it is a great mistake to suppose that such houses stand high in chivalric tradition. Few except the poor preserve traditions. Aristocrats live not in traditions but in fashions. The Bohuns had been Mohocks under Queen Anne and Mashers under Queen Victoria. But like more than <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>really</b> ancient houses, they had rotted in the last two centuries into mere drunkards and dandy degenerates, till there had even come a whisper of insanity. Certainly there was something hardly human about the colonel's wolfish pursuit of pleasure, and his chronic resolution not to go home till morning had a touch of the hideous clarity of insomnia. He was a tall, fine animal, elderly, but with hair still startlingly yellow. He would have looked merely blonde and leonine, but his blue eyes were sunk so deep in his face that they looked black. They were a little too close together. He had very long yellow moustaches; on each side of them a fold or furrow from nostril to jaw, so that a sneer seemed cut into his face. Over his evening clothes he wore a curious pale yellow coat that looked more like a very light dressing gown than an overcoat, and on the back of his head was stuck an extraordinary broad-brimmed hat of a bright green colour, evidently some oriental curiosity caught up at random. He was proud of appearing in such incongruous attires--proud of the fact that he always made them look congruous.|$|E

Much like the 8008, it was used for applications such as terminals, printers, cash registers and industrial robots.

[...] While a friend and student of Millet, [...] "Hunt is an entirely original artist, and every picture of his is a spontaneous and independent product." [...] In a bit of art history revisionism, some scholars are now re-examining Hunt's powerful pull on other early New England artists, many better-known.|$|R
